https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806706,Bayern coach Nagelsmann hopes to 'bury' talk of Neuer rift,"MUNICH (AP) — Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann wants to “bury” talk of a rift with Manuel Neuer after the injured captain criticized the decision to replace the team's goalkeeping coach.

            Bayern hosts Bochum on Saturday and then takes on Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday. It will be the German champion's first European game with recent signing Yann Sommer in goal in place of Neuer, who is out for the rest of the season after breaking his leg skiing after the World Cup.

            “It’s important, and important for Manu as well, to bury this topic at some time,"" Nagelsmann said Friday. ""Everybody knows that the healing of the body is very strongly influenced by the thoughts happening in the head and it’s also important for Manu to look forward, and that's also the same for me.”











            Nagelsmann didn’t say whether Neuer would remain team captain when he returns from injury.

            “Manu is currently the captain of this team and that’s a good thing,” Nagelsmann said.

            Joshua Kimmich and Thomas Müller have worn the captain’s armband in Bayern’s five games since Neuer broke his leg.

            Neuer said that the firing last month of goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalović on Jan. 23 was a low point of his career in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and The Athletic website. Neuer and Tapalović had worked together for more than a decade at Bayern.

            The new goalkeeping coach, Michael Rechner, worked with Nagelsmann when he was coach of Hoffenheim earlier in his career.

            “I've read that Nagelsmann is hiring his buddy. He's not my buddy,” Nagelsmann said, adding that Rechner was an “excellent goalkeeping coach.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806707,Madrid faces Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal for club world title,"Having surprisingly made it this far, Al-Hilal has already won before taking on Real Madrid in the final of the Club World Cup.

            The club from Saudi Arabia stunned Brazil's Flamengo in the semifinals and stands in the way of Madrid collecting a record-extending eighth title in the competition.

            If Al-Hilal does manage an even bigger upset in Morocco's capital of Rabat on Saturday, it would be another testament to the growing power of soccer outside its traditional strongholds of Europe and South America.











            “Football is changing,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""And you can see that by the fact that Al-Hilal is in the final.”

            Perhaps the only thing in Al-Hilal's favor is that many of its players know what it is like to pull off the extremely improbable.

            The team coached by Argentine Ramón Díaz includes members of the Saudi Arabia national side which stunned Argentina in their World Cup opener in November. 

            Saudi Arabia’s scorers in that 2-1 win over Argentina, Salem Aldawsari and Saleh Alshehri, play for Al-Hilal. Aldawsari scored twice in Tangier on Tuesday to help secure a 3-2 win over Flamengo, the Copa Libertadores champion.

            Al-Hilal, which has won a record four Asian Champions League titles, also features Nigerian journeyman Odion Ighalo and former FC Porto striker Moussa Marega.

            “We will play one of the most important and beautiful matches in our history,” Al-Hilal goalkeeper Abdullah Al-Mayouf said. “We are physically and mentally ready to play the final against Europe’s champions.”

            Just having a team in the final is another boost for Saudi Arabian soccer, after the country flexed its economic muscle to become a bigger global player in the sport. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund bought Newcastle in 2021, and its domestic league recently scored a huge win when Al-Nassr, a rival of Al-Hilal, convinced Cristiano Ronaldo it was time to continue his illustrious career outside Europe.

            “Football is more global. It is no longer Europe versus South American,” Ancelotti said. “We’re up against a good team, who have individual qualities and a lot of players in the Saudi national team who did well in the World Cup, and players with a lot of experience in Europe.

            ""We have great respect for them, and they showed their quality by knocking out Flamengo in the semifinals.”

            Karim Benzema and defender Éder Militão joined Madrid in Rabat after they missed the 4-1 win against Egyptian club Al Ahly on Wednesday due to injury. Ancelotti said it was still unclear whether they will be ready to play in the final. If Benzema can't play, Brazilians Vinícius Júnior and Rodygo will likely be tasked with leading the attack.

            The Club World Cup is considered a relatively minor title for European clubs due to its short length — only two games for the Champions League winners. That said, Madrid always takes the competition seriously and needs to regain some winning momentum. It lost the final of the Spanish Super Cup to Barcelona last month and has fallen eight points behind its fierce rival in the Spanish league after losing at Mallorca 1-0 last weekend.

            Madrid won the UEFA Super Cup to start the season and is attempting the difficult defense of its Champions League and Spanish league double from last season.

            Madrid was successful the last five times it played for the club world title following triumphs in the Champions League. It did it in 2014 and from 2016-18, and also in 2002 in what was called the Intercontinental Cup — a one-game final between the European and South American champions. Madrid last failed to win the world title in 2000, when it lost the Intercontinental Cup to Argentine club Boca Juniors.

            Flamengo will play Al Ahly in Tangier on Saturday to determine third place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806708,Indian gov't withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s government on Friday withdrew its appeal to citizens to mark Valentine’s Day next week not as a celebration of romance but as “Cow Hug Day” to better promote Hindu values.

            The appeal had attracted widespread criticism from political rivals and on social media.

            A terse statement issued by the government-run Animal Welfare Board of India said the appeal issued Wednesday “stands withdrawn.”











            Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been “absolutely crazy, defying logic.”

            ""The decision to withdraw the government appeal was to prevent the politics of Hindutva (Hindu nationalism) from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters,” he said. 

            Young, educated Indians typically spend Valentine’s Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties. 

            The Animal Welfare Board had said Wednesday that “hugging cows will bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness.”

            Devout Hindus, who worship cows as holy, say the Western holiday goes against traditional Indian values.

            In recent years, Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal say such raids help reassert a Hindu identity.

            Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been pushing a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity. Hindus comprise nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people. Muslims account for 14%, while Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the remaining 6%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806722,EU sees influence surge in Southeast Asia — survey,"The European Union's image in Southeast Asia has improved over the past year, including its reputation as a defender of free trade and international law, according to The State of Southeast Asia 2023 survey report published on Thursday.Brussels has cemented its place as the preferred ""third party"" that Southeast Asian nations want to engage with amid a highly fractious US-China superpower rivalry in the region, while trust in the EU as an economic and political actor is also growing, the report said.Almost 43% of the region's respondents preferred the EU as an alternative partner, well ahead of Japan, the UK and India.""Against the backdrop of the US-China rivalry, ASEAN needs to broaden its strategic options,"" Melinda Martinus, lead researcher at the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute's ASEAN Studies Center and an author of the annual survey, said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.""Engagement with the EU provides a cushion from the intensifying rivalry between the two superpowers,"" she added. ""The EU's stance on the environment and climate, human rights, the rule of law, and territorial integrity has demonstrated that they are a responsible global partner needed by ASEAN to maintain the world order.""According to the survey of elite opinion, some 4.2% of Southeast Asian respondents thought the EU was the most influential economic actor in the region, up from just 1.7% last year and compared to 10.5% who said the US.Almost 5% said the EU has the most political and strategic influence in the region, in comparison to 0.8% last year.The survey also saw a rise in the numbers of Southeast Asians who had confidence in the EU as a champion of free trade and in its leadership to maintain the rules-based order and uphold international law, ranking the bloc second behind the US.Igor Driesmans, the EU ambassador to ASEAN, said he was ""pleased"" by the results.""ASEAN's increasingly positive perception of the EU is the result, I think, of our decadeslong consistency and predictability in favor of international law and multilateralism,” he told DW.""Like us, Southeast Asians want to live in a multilateral rules-based world, where human rights and international law are upheld and where might does not make right.""In addition, Driesmans added, the poll reflects the strength of the EU's growing relations as strategic partners with ASEAN.""This will encourage us to keep the momentum of last year's EU-ASEAN Commemorative Leader's Summit and focus on our joint work to improve connectivity, ensure a green transition, and make trade free and fair,"" he said.The EU's popularity appears to be rising the quickest among the region's smaller states, including those with which the EU currently has weaker economic or diplomatic relations.Whereas less than a third of Laotians last year had confidence that the EU will ""do the right thing"" to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, it rose to nearly two-thirds in this year's survey.Confidence in the EU also dramatically rose among Cambodians, of whom almost four-fifths prefer the EU as their main ""third party"" amid the US-China rivalry, the most of any of the 10 surveyed Southeast Asian populaces.Seun Sam, a policy analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, reckons it's partly to do with the EU being a major importer of Cambodian goods, as well as improved relations after Cambodia held the annually rotating ASEAN chair last year, during which Prime Minister Hun Sen was praised for supporting the West's stance on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.He co-hosted the EU-ASEAN leaders' summit in December, and while in Europe made a rare state visit to France.Sam said, ""People around the world will criticize Cambodia for being too close to China or being too close to the US, but no one will criticize Cambodia for being too close to the EU,"" referring to the widespread allegations that Hun Sen's government is now fully in Beijing's orbit.The EU's image, however, appears to have suffered in Malaysia and Indonesia, where anger is boiling over the bloc's plans to phase out imports of palm oil and alter environmental rules on imports, which the two countries say will severely harm their local agriculture industries.The two Southeast Asian countries are among the world's largest producers of palm oil, and both have taken Brussels to the World Trade Organization over its legislation.Almost half of Indonesian respondents, up from a third last year, now have ""no confidence” or ""little confidence” that the EU will do the right thing to  contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance.""In Malaysia and Indonesia, the palm oil issue remains serious and is not likely to improve any time soon,"" said Bridget Welsh, an analyst at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute.""It also feeds into a deep-seated framework where the West is seen as targeting Muslim countries and imposing its values in a hypocritical manner,"" Welsh added.During last December's EU-ASEAN Commemorative Summit in Brussels, Indonesian President Joko Widodo made clear he doesn't want any lecturing from the EU.""There must be no imposition of views,"" he stated. ""There must not be one who dictates over the other and thinks that my standard is better than yours.""According to Welsh, the EU ""needs to appreciate how damaging the discrimination on palm oil in Malaysia and Indonesia is.""However, EU and Indonesian negotiators are meeting this week in Jakarta for the 13th round of talks, and European officials are hopeful that a free-trade agreement can be reached by the end of the year.EU trade talks with Thailand will resume in March, the country's Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit confirmed last month after a meeting with Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU trade commissioner. The EU said in December that it also wants to resume talks with the Philippines.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's visit to Cambodia and Malaysia, meanwhile, kicks off next week to deepen his country's political and economic ties in the region.Edited by: Sou-Jie van Brunnersum",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806723,Frankfurt ready for Bayern Munich and Bundesliga challenge,"Buoyed by an excited 23,200 strong crowd at the Waldstadion, Eintracht Frankfurt were only denied a season-opening victory against Bayern Munich because goalkeeper Maria Grohs pulled off a couple of impressive saves late on.On first showing, it offered some hope that Frankfurt might be able to push current Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg. But, given Wolfsburg and Bayern have traded title wins between themselves exclusively since 2013, Frankfurt defender Verena Hanshaw is more realistic of the challenge Frankfurt can offer.""The first game showed that we are able to win matches like this,"" Hanshaw told DW. ""My hope and wish is that we get third place. For the team our wish really is when we play against the big teams. like Bayern or Wolfsburg, that we can get points from them.""""It is our biggest hope but first we also need to play well against all of the other teams because if we mess that up then the chance will be gone.""Hanshaw, who is playing in her ninth consecutive season in the Bundesliga, has seen big changes during her time in the league. The Austrian joined when the club was still FFC Frankfurt, a standalone women's side with a rich pedigree both domestically and internationally, including four Champions League wins. However, big investment in Wolfsburg and Bayern across the past decade forced Frankfurt to make big changes, namely merging with the men's side in July 2020.Even then, it took until November 2022 for the team to be afforded the opportunity to use the practice fields that their male counterparts do, directly opposite the Waldstadion, instead of the public playing fields around the city.""Every day for the team when you're training on these types of pitches it's amazing,"" Hanshaw said of the move to properly curated practice grounds. ""We had big troubles with where we were practicing but we are thankful that we now have the ability to train here every day and it means a lot to us.""It's the turnout in the stands that remains the biggest change for Hanshaw across the last decade.""There's not a lot that's still the same [since I made my debut],"" Hanshaw added. ""Everything was completely different. With the crowd it's amazing how much support we get. It's such a nice thing for me to see because when I started in the Bundesliga when I was 16, we had 10 people and when I look now it's super cool.""Despite a 5-0 defeat to Wolfsburg in December that was a painful reminder of the gap between the top two and the rest, Nike Arnautis' side looks strong this season.While Hanshaw and the rest of the Frankfurt group are still focused on the grind of weekly Bundesliga games, the looming presence of the World Cup this summer is hard to ignore.""The league is good training for the World Cup for the players who will be going,"" said Hanshaw, whose Austrian team lost to Scotland in the first round of the playoffs. ""There's a high level of competitiveness in this league and of course it'll be even higher in the World Cup. I can't wait to see so much of this team play there.""Edited by Jonathan Harding",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806724,Can India's judiciary maintain its independence?,"In recent weeks, a number of senior government officials, including Law Minister Kiren Rijiju and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, have hit out against how judges are being appointed in the country.In India, judges for the Supreme Court and high courts are appointed through a  quarter-century-old mechanism that involves both sitting judges and government officials.A group of senior judges, known as the collegium, puts up candidates' names to the Law and Justice Ministry, and these names are approved if they clear security checks.This ensures that the government plays a minimal role in judges' selection and is involved only at the concluding stage.While supporters argue that the system is needed to ensure judicial independence, critics describe it as opaque and unaccountable.The increasingly public attacks by senior members of government targeting the judiciary have reignited debate about whether elected representatives should have a say in the process.Legal experts and some former judges believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is seeking a bigger role in the selection of judges.The disagreement highlights not only the need for transparency and accountability in the process but also the delicate balance of power between the various branches of government.Gautam Bhatia, a lawyer and constitutional scholar, pointed out that the frequency, intensity, and directness of the attacks by the government are quite unprecedented.""Executive attacks on the court now occur on a weekly basis. These attacks question not only the method of judicial appointments, but also one of the apex court's most famous judgments, which held that there exists a basic structure of the constitution beyond parliament's competence to amend,"" Bhatia said.""This is widely perceived to be an important bulwark against a totalitarian evisceration of the constitution.""It is not the first time Modi's administration has been accused of trying to gain greater control over judges' selection.In 2015, the government brought in the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, which gave the executive a greater role in such appointments. The legislation, however, was struck down by the Supreme Court.The appointment of judges has been a long-standing tug of war between the judiciary and executive in India.The government had enjoyed primacy in selecting judges until 1993, when the top court instituted the collegium system by ruling the executive is bound by the advice of the judiciary when it comes to judge selection.It's not just members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who criticize the current system.""The present collegium system is opaque and its functioning is flawed. This is not a new problem but has been persistently critiqued for decades,"" senior advocate Rebecca Mammen John told DW.However, she pointed out that the alternative offered by the government throws up even more sinister challenges.""The government wants to appoint 'yes persons' to these high constitutional posts to leverage their stand within the courts. That must be avoided at all costs and the independence of the judiciary can be asserted only by the judiciary who ordinarily should tolerate no governmental interference,"" John stressed.Pamela Philipose, a senior fellow at the Indian Council of Social Science Research, expresses similar concerns.""The recent spate of salvoes against the judiciary and the collegium appears to be driven by a quest for a committed judiciary — one that is more than willing to accommodate itself to the government,"" she said.""The concern is that a majoritarian government, such as the one presently in power in New Delhi, could make ideologically driven appointments that could severely compromise the independence of the judiciary.""Anjana Prakash, a former high court judge, pointed out that judicial appointments are turning out to be an extremely fraught exercise, given the disagreements between the executive and the judiciary.""The government finally clears the names of judges for appointment and transfers. However, the government is not satisfied with this power alone. It wants control over the initial selection as well whose primacy is with the collegium,"" Prakash told DW.The dispute has worsened the problem of a shortage of judges and pending cases in Indian courts. Official data shows four out of every 10 judicial seats in high courts are currently empty, and there are over 70,000 cases pending before the Supreme Court and over 5.9 million cases before the high courts.Rijiju, the law minister, said in parliament in December that 165 high court judges were appointed last year against 331 vacancies.The government recently cleared the appointment of new judges to the Supreme Court, in a sign that the collegium system is here to stay — for now.Prakash said the dispute has turned into a power struggle.""Not once has the government said the persons selected and recommended were not fit to be judges. If they have objected, it is for other reasons but certainly not merit. I am surprised that no one is talking of this,"" he said.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806725,Wind power in Poland: Trying to find a happy medium,"The melt-in-the-mouth cheesecake on sale in Cafe Manufaktura Ciasta and the gentle sea breeze blowing around the village of Cisowo on the Baltic coast would leave visitors in no doubt that they are in a particularly lovely part of Poland — were it not for the huge wind turbine towering over the cafe just three meters from the road.Within a radius of just a few hundred meters, a dozen other wind turbines have been erected in a seemingly random manner across the coastal landscape. They belong to two wind farms that were completed in 2001 and 2013.No consideration was evidently given to maintaining any kind of distance to roads and houses. The operators of these wind farms — the companies Energia Eco and Enerco — don't see that there is a problem. After all, they obtained all the necessary construction permits from the relevant authorities.To put a stop to this kind of unregulated wind turbine development, Poland's government, which is led by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, passed a law in 2016 that introduced the so-called ""10H rule"" for all new wind turbine projects.This rule stipulates that the distance between a wind turbine and the nearest house or nature reserve must be at least ten times the turbine's height. If, for example, a wind turbine is 200 meters (656 feet) high, it must be at least 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the nearest house or nature reserve.People who don't like the look of wind turbines or consider them unhealthy or even damaging to the environment — whether in Poland or elsewhere around the world — welcome such restrictions.But for the operators of wind turbines and supporters of renewable energy, the 10H rule pretty much means the end of onshore wind power development. Janusz Gajowiecki, president of the Polish Wind Energy Association (PWEA), said that because of the law, only 0.28% of Poland's land area is now available for the construction of wind turbines.""Current legislation rules out virtually all land for the construction of new wind turbines,"" said Aleksandra Dziadkiewicz of the renowned Polish think tank Forum Energii. She goes on to say that any new turbines currently under construction are being built on the basis of permits that were issued before the 10H law came into force, in other words before 2016.""Yet Poland needs lots of new wind turbines for the energy transition,"" she continues, ""and as quickly as possible.""In late January 2023, an amendment to the law was put to parliament. The hope was that a compromise could be reached that would help wind turbine operators. The amendment proposed cutting the legally required distance between turbines and houses/nature reserves to 500 meters.According to the PWEA, this would allow turbines to be erected on around 7% of the country's land area. But no agreement was reached in parliament. There are now plans to discuss an amendment that would fix the required distance at 700 meters.Damian Babka of the renewable energy producer Qair Group confirmed that the failure to adopt the proposed 500-meter limit was a major setback for wind power producers. His company had pinned a lot of hope on the amendment. ""While a distance of 700 meters would allow some projects to be implemented,"" said Babka, ""it would keep the capacity to generate green energy at a very low level.""Residents of the picturesque village of Cisowo, which has a population of about 300, set up an association last fall that focuses on the impact of the unregulated development of wind power generation before 2016. Since 1998, 8.8% of residents have moved away from the village, and those that have stayed have little faith left in the authorities' efficiency when it comes to enforcing laws.There is huge support for the 10H rule in Cisowo, and the people of the village warmly welcome its strict enforcement by the polish authorities. The reason is that the village has seen the downside to a liberalization of the market and the move to a system of more flexible rules.For instance, several unauthorized camp sites and huts have been set up directly under the turbines. While they have a beautiful view of the sea, there is no wastewater treatment or refuse collections. The people in the village have no idea who built what and when. All they know is that the people camping there have not been moved on.The house of the Bienert family, which was one of the founding members of the local association, is just 450 meters from one of the wind turbines. The Bienerts are of the opinion that the noise and the change in the light caused by the turbine's rotors are having a negative impact on their well-being and health.Maciej Bienert, the father of the family, is firmly in favor of the development of renewable energy in Poland. The Bienerts themselves have several solar panels on the roofs of their residential and commercial buildings and sell a large amount of solar power. ""Clear rules are needed for it to work in the long run,"" said Bienert. ""And you can't make those rules without the people who are directly affected by them.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/10,,

Twenty-seven were injured, authorities said.

            The explosion and the subsequent collapse took place in the Nile Delta city of Damanhour, about 150 kilometers (99 miles) north of the capital, Cairo. The office of Egypt's public prosecutor said the cylinders were stored in violation of regulations. 

            Among the dead were three children, the youngest was a 3-year-old, authorities said in a separate statement. 











            Search efforts were ongoing to find those still missing beneath the rubble while the injured were transported to a nearby hospital, it said. No further details were immediately provided. 

            Building collapses are common in Egypt, where poor construction and shoddy building maintenance are common across the country, especially in shantytowns, low-income neighborhoods and rural areas.

            Last month, six people were killed in an apartment block collapse in the southern city of Asyuit. 

            After Friday's collapse, Egypt’s Ministry of Social Solidarity said the families of those killed would receive 50,000 Egyptian pounds, or about $1,638, in aid. Families who lost their homes in the collapse would receive 20,000 Egyptian pounds, which is around $655, it said.

            The government has tried to crack down on illegal construction in recent years following decades of lax law enforcement. Also, authorities are building new cities and neighborhoods to rehouse those living in poorly constructed buildings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806729,Guardiola responds after Man City accused of breaches,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — As Manchester City's lawyers prepare for another battle to clear the club's name, manager Pep Guardiola said Friday the Premier League champions have already been condemned.

            City was accused on Monday of breaching a slew of financial regulations over a nine-year period. If found guilty, the club could face a fine, deduction of points or, in the most extreme case, expulsion from English soccer's top division.

            “My first thought is we are already being condemned,” Guardiola said. “We are lucky we live in a marvellous country where everyone is innocent until proved guilty. We didn’t have this opportunity. We are already sentenced.”











            City had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2020 after UEFA had ruled it had committed “serious breaches” of financial fair play regulations from 2012-16.

            City has said it will prove its innocence after the latest accusations, which followed a four-year investigation and, if upheld, represent one of the biggest scandals in the history of the Premier League.

            “Look what happened with UEFA,” Guardiola said. “We proved it. It is the same case. Why should I don’t trust with my people? Why should I trust the CEOs or the owners of the 19 clubs, the nine clubs like it was with UEFA? No, I trust my people.

            “I’m fully convinced that we will be innocent, and then what will happen next? Will it stop now? It’s not because of UEFA but since Abu Dhabi took over the club, since Day 1 it was like that.”

            City is accused of about 80 breaches of financial rules and 30 more relating to its alleged failure to cooperate with the investigation since December 2018.

            Guardiola became the first person from the club to publicly address the accusations when speaking at a news conference ahead of his team’s Premier League match against Aston Villa on Sunday.

            He said City's reputation had been damaged as result of repeated allegations of financial wrongdoing.

            “Just in case we are not innocent we will accept what the judge in the Premier League decides,” he said. ""But what happens if in the same situation that UEFA happened we are innocent? What happens to restore or pay back our damage? Because the damage is now for one decade.""

            Guardiola has previously criticized City's rivals amid scrutiny of the club's exorbitant spending under the ownership of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family. Signings such as Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish have turned City into the dominant force in English soccer, winning six league titles and eight other major trophies.

            In 2020, Guardiola accused rival teams of a “whispering” campaign against City and Friday he said Premier League clubs are driving the latest action.

            “When they push to get rid of us from this competition, that is obvious because they believe that we didn’t behave properly,"" Guardiola said. ""And we can accept that but, let us defend when we believe we did it properly.”

            Amid questions about his own future, he was adamant he would remain as manager.

            “I am not moving from this seat. I can assure you, more than ever I want to stay,” he said. “Sometimes I have doubts, seven years already is a long time in any country. Now I don’t want to move. Not because people say they lied to you Pep. They didn’t lie to me.”

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.   DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants overstated Enovix's ability to produce batteries at scale, touting the Company's ""meaningful progress"" in scaling up its manufacturing facility, and its being positioned to deliver batteries ahead of competitions, despite its continued manufacturing issues.

            Cryptocurrency companies grabbed the spotlight during the 2022 Super Bowl, with commercials from a handful of newcomers to advertising’s biggest stage: FTX, Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro. Some marketing experts dubbed it the “Crypto Bowl.”

            A year later, the industry has been humbled by a massive downturn in crypto prices, as well as the bankruptcy of several well-known companies. 











            The dramatic turnaround harkens back to 2000, when dot-com companies such as Pets.com ran Super Bowl ads, only to go out of business within a year or two. 

            This year, crypto companies have “zero representation,” said Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports.

            Here’s a look at the crypto companies that advertised in last year’s Super Bowl and where they stand now:

            FTX: BANKRUPT

            Cryptocurrency exchange FTX was one of biggest advertisers in last year’s Super Bowl, featuring ads that included celebrity comedian Larry David. While at the time FTX was the world’s second or third largest crypto exchange, it didn’t operate a large business in the U.S. 

            Within 10 months of the Super Bowl, FTX was bankrupt. The Bahamas-based company collapsed after investors started pulling their deposits on concerns about the company’s balance sheet. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.

            FTX's founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged with defrauding customers out of billions of dollars. He is scheduled to go on trial in October. 

            David, along with other celebrities such as football star Tom Brady and basketball star Stephen Curry, was named in a lawsuit that argued their celebrity status made them culpable for promoting the firm’s failed business model. 

            CRYPTO.COM: HUMBLED

            While Crypto.com still is operating, the company is significantly less healthy than it was a year earlier. 

            The Singapore-based company announced in January that it was laying off 20% of its workforce, on top of layoffs implemented in late 2022. The company also disclosed that a significant part of its assets were tied up in low-quality cryptocurrency coins like the Shiba Inu Coin. 

            Like FTX, Crypto.com tried to make a name for itself through sports sponsorships. The company spent $700 million for the naming rights to the former Staples Center, where the Los Angeles Lakers play. It's now the Crypto.com Arena. The company's 2022 Super Bowl ad featured basketball superstar LeBron James, with the tagline “fortune favors the brave.”

            Crypto.com said its layoffs were due to a “confluence of negative economic developments” but its CEO placed a significant amount of blame on the collapse of FTX. 

            COINBASE: IN LEGAL HOT WATER

            Coinbase had one of the weirder ads at least year’s Super Bowl, involving a floating QR code that would take users to a promotion where the company was giving away millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies. Marketing experts named it one of the more successful ads of the game, since it took people by surprise and stood out, though many viewers found it confusing. 

            Shares of publicly traded Coinbase have fallen by more than 70% since last year’s game. With digital currencies such as bitcoin plunging, the company has seen trading revenues dry up as investors have avoided buying crypto altogether. 

            The company also announced layoffs equal to about 20% of its workforce and the company’s CEO has said the company is bracing for what they are calling “a crypto winter.”

            Further, Coinbase has drawn the attention of U.S. regulators. The company had to pay $100 million to settle a New York State investigation into whether it was allowing users to sign up for accounts without adequate background checks. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also looking into whether to ban the cryptocurrency practice of “staking,” which had been big business for Coinbase in the past. 

            ETORO: NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS? 

            The fourth crypto company to have a Super Bowl ad last year was eToro. The company, based in Israel, ran an ad promoting ""social investing.” 

            Unlike FTX, Coinbase and Crypto.com, eToro has largely avoided any negative news in the past year. The company expanded its offerings beyond crypto to allow users to buy stocks and options as well as non-fungible tokens, better known as NFTs.NEW YORK (AP) — How the mighty have fallen.Cryptocurrency companies grabbed the spotlight during the 2022 Super Bowl, with commercials from a handful of newcomers to advertising’s biggest stage: FTX, Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806750,"ROSEN, TRUSTED AND TOP RANKED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Southwest Airlines Co. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm - LUV","New York, US -  Newsfile Corp. - February 10, 2023 -  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) between June 13, 2020 and December 31, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important  March 13, 2023 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action commenced by the Firm.   SO WHAT: If you purchased Southwest Airlines securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.   WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Southwest Airlines class action, go to  https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=10716 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email  pkim@rosenlegal.com or  cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court  no later than March 13, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.   WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.  Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.   DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose, among other things, that: (1) Southwest Airlines continuously downplayed or ignored the serious issues with the technology it used to schedule flights and crews, and how it stood to be affected worse than other airlines in the event of inclement weather; (2) Southwest Airlines did not discuss how it's unique point-to-point service and aggressive flight schedule could leave it prone in the event of inclement weather; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court  no later than February 21, 2023.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose, among other things, that: (1) the Company was experiencing challenges that increased costs, including supply chain disruptions, that impacted Daktronics' ability to fund inventory levels and operations; (2) as a result, it was probable that some portion of the Company's deferred tax assets would not be realized; (3) as a result, Daktronics was reasonably likely to record a material valuation allowance to its deferred tax assets; (4) there were material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting related to income taxes; (5) the foregoing presented liquidity concerns and there was substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, Defendant's positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806763,Man pleads guilty to racial harassment of neighbors,"LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts man has pleaded guilty to repeatedly tossing banana peels onto his neighbors’ property in what prosecutors said was a case of racial harassment, and to having more than 70 guns in his home that he was not legally allowed to possess.

            Robert Ivarson, 55, of Lexington was sentenced to up to nine years in prison earlier this month after pleading guilty in Middlesex Superior Court to criminal harassment, a criminal civil rights violation and more than 100 weapons charges, District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement Thursday. He was also ordered to have no contact with the victims and undergo a mental health evaluation and any recommended treatment.

            A message seeking comment was left with Ivarson's attorney.











            Ivarson was arrested in December 2016 after a Black family from Haiti in his neighborhood reported finding banana peels on their property on 30 to 40 occasions over several months, authorities said. Police even saw him throw the peels in the days prior to his arrest.

            Investigators during two court-athorized searches of Iverson's home in January and October 2017 found 73 guns, including handguns, assault rifles, an Uzi, large-capacity magazines and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, the district attorney said. Authorities also found Confederate, KKK and Nazi paraphernalia in the home, authorities said.

            Ivarson has been prohibited from possessing firearms since the 1990s because of various criminal convictions, prosecutors said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806765,"Danielle Deadwyler cites racism, misogynoir in Oscar snub","NEW YORK (AP) — Danielle Deadwyler says racism and misogynoir played a role in this year's Academy Awards nominations, where she and Viola Davis were overlooked in the best actress category. 

            Going into Oscar nominations last month, Deadwyler was widely seen as a likely nominee for her lauded performance as Mamie Till-Mobley in “Till.” But the best actress field, perhaps the most competitive category this year, didn't shake out as expected: Both Deadwyler and Davis were left out. 

            Davis, a four-time Oscar nominee and one-time winner for her performance in “Fences,” had been celebrated for the historical epic “The Woman King.” Deadwyler had been nominated by the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs in the run-up to Oscar nominations, and won best lead performance at the Gotham Awards. 











            That two prominent Black actors were among the most striking snubs has been seen by some as a reflection of racial bias in the film industry. The day after the Oscar nominations, “Till” director Chinonye Chukwu posted on Instagram: “We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women.”

            Asked for her reaction to that comment on an episode of the “Kermode & Mayo's Take” podcast posted on Friday, Deadwyler strongly agreed with Chukwu.

            “We’re talking about people who perhaps chose not to see the film — we’re talking about misogynoir — like it comes in all kinds of ways, whether it’s direct or indirect,"" said Deadwyler. “It impacts who we are.”

            Misogynoir, a term coined by the Black feminist author and activist Moya Bailey, refers to misogyny and prejudice directed at Black women. 

            “I think the question is more on people who are living in whiteness, white people’s assessment of the spaces they are privileged by,” added Deadwyler. “We’ve seen it exist in a governmental capacity — it can exist on a societal capacity, be it global or national.”

            That Deadwyler and Davis were edged out of an Oscar nomination is part of what fueled the initial backlash to the star-studded grassroots campaign for actress Andrea Riseborough. After a string of celebrity-hosted screenings (a regular feature of Hollywood's awards season), Riseborough unexpectedly landed a nomination for her performance in the indie drama “To Leslie,” alongside Michelle Yeoh (""Everything Everywhere All at Once""), Cate Blanchett (""Tár""), Ana de Armas (""Blonde"") and Michelle Williams (""The Fabelmans""). 

            After the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences announced an inquiry into the Riseborough campaign, it found no reason to rescind her nomination or take any other action — though Bill Kramer, academy president, said some social media and outreach campaigning tactics “caused concern."" 

            But conversation has continued on how money, race, status and connections can influence awards campaigns. “The Woman King” director Gina Prince-Bythewood said earlier this week that she questioned how people in the film industry are using their social capital. 

            “People like to say, ‘Well, Viola and Danielle had studios behind them.’ But we just very clearly saw that social capital is more valuable than that,” Prince-Bythewood told The Hollywood Reporter. “That type of power is exercised in more casual ways in social circles, where folks are your friends or your acquaintances. There may be diversity on your sets but not in your lives. And Black women in this industry, we don’t have that power.”

            Deadwyler, whom The Associated Press named one of the breakthrough performers of last year, said on the podcast it was everyone's responsibility to ensure an equitable playing field.

            “Nobody is absolved of not participating in racism and not knowing that there is a possibility of its lingering effect on the spaces and the institution,” she said.

            Argentina’s World Cup-winning captain and France’s superstar forward head the three-player shortlist announced by FIFA on Friday, eight weeks after leading their teams in an epic final in Qatar.

            Karim Benzema completed the top three in the voting by a global panel of national team captains and coaches plus selected journalist in each of FIFA’s 211 member countries, as well as fans voting online.











            In the Best Women’s Player award, Beth Mead of England, Alex Morgan of the United States and Spain's Alexia Putellas were on the shortlist voted for by a separate global voting panel.

            The winners will be announced at a Feb. 27 ceremony in Paris.

            Messi edged Mbappé for the Golden Ball awarded by FIFA as the best player at the World Cup. Croatia captain Luka Modrić placed third in that contest.

            Another duel is expected for the Paris Saint-Germain teammates with Messi favored to get a seventh win in FIFA’s annual individual prize. Mbappé seeks his first.

            Messi won his six previous awards when it was called the FIFA World Player of the Year (2009), the FIFA Ballon d’Or in each year from 2010-12 and again in 2015, then in the current title of Best FIFA Men’s Player for 2019

            Mbappe makes the shortlist for the first time though he was fourth in voting for the 2018 award. The 24-year-old has been sixth, seventh and eighth in past three years.

            Robert Lewandowski won the FIFA award for the past two years.

            The more prestigious Ballon d’Or award organized by France Football magazine was won in October by Karim Benzema ahead of the World Cup. The France forward missed the tournament because of an injury. Messi was not on the long list of Ballon d’Or candidates announced in August.

            The Best Women's Player award for 2021 was won by Putellas and the Barcelona playmaker made the top three again despite being injured days before the European Championship and missing the tournament for Spain.

            Mead led England to the Euro 2022 title as the tournament's joint top scorer and was named its best player. She suffered a serious knee injury in November playing for Arsenal and could miss the Women's World Cup that starts in July, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.

            Morgan, who was second in the 2019 vote to teammate Megan Rapinoe, was player of the tournament when the U.S. won the CONCACAF W Championship last year. She was also the joint top scorer.

                2014 photo of US rescue dog misrepresented after Turkey earthquake
              











            CLAIM: A photo shows a white-haired dog covered in dirt who helped rescue at least 10 people in Turkey after an earthquake struck the country on Monday.

            THE FACTS: The image was taken in 2014 by a Reuters photographer after a deadly mudslide near Oso, Washington. Following Monday’s earthquake, old photos and videos showing a variety of tragedies — from tsunamis to building collapses — circulated widely, falsely identified as showing the aftermath in Turkey and Syria. Amid search efforts, where many countries have sent dogs and rescuers, incorrectly attributed images of dogs used in other search efforts emerged. One widely shared misrepresented image shows a dog caked in dirt as he stares directly into the camera. A person sporting a red sleeve and white glove is holding the dog’s leash. “This dog hero who worked the whole night and saved 10 lives in Turkey,” reads a caption on an Instagram post of the image. But the photo shows a rescue dog who helped after the 2014 mudslide in Oso, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) outside of Seattle, which killed 43 people. It was taken by Rick Wilking, a freelance photographer for Reuters. “Tryon the rescue dog waits to go through the decontamination area at the mudslide after searching for victims in Oso, Washington March 30, 2014,” a caption on the photograph states. The AP also published a similar image of Tryon taken by Wilking at the time. The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey, as well as Syria, during the early hours Monday toppled thousands of buildings and killed more than 20,000 people, the AP reported.

                Study doesn’t prove egg yolks protect against COVID-19
              

            CLAIM: A protein naturally found in egg yolks protects against COVID-19 in humans, which is why there is an egg shortage.

            THE FACTS: The claim misrepresents a 2021 study by a group of Chinese researchers who immunized hens with part of the coronavirus spike protein in order to extract antibodies from yolks in the hens’ eggs. “PREVENT’S COVID! Do you understand why gov’ts are messing with chicken feed & destroying egg farms!” wrote one Twitter user who shared a screenshot of the study, which was archived in the National Library of Medicine. The post references other debunked claims that chicken feed is being altered to reduce egg production and that fires are being set at food plants to create shortages. While the post implies a link between the study and the current egg shortage, the two have no relationship to each other, experts say. “Eating eggs which have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is completely useless against COVID-19,” said Peter Palese, a microbiology professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine who has conducted similar research. “Such antibodies taken orally are right away digested in our digestive tract.” The study — titled “Chicken Egg Yolk Antibodies (IgYs) block the binding of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants to human ACE2” — was published in January 2021. The researchers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The study describes how antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein were isolated from chicken egg yolks. However, this was achieved by first immunizing hens with a portion of the spike protein. The antibodies were not naturally occurring in the hens, nor would they have a profound impact on COVID-19 in humans, according to Palese. “Such antibodies are good laboratory reagents but are no good for injecting into humans,” he wrote in an email to the AP. Daria Mochly-Rosen, a professor in the Stanford University School of Medicine’s department of chemical and systems biology, confirmed that the hens first need to be immunized with a protein derived from the virus for the antibodies to be present in their egg yolks. Even then, she said, the antibodies need to be purified from the raw eggs. In a similar study published in the journal “Viruses” last year, a team of researchers “hyperimmunized” hens, then collected their eggs to obtain antibodies. Those antibodies were used in a laboratory to perform virus neutralization tests, said Dr. Rodrigo Gallardo, a professor in the school of veterinarian medicine at the University of California, Davis, who contributed to the research. The team found that the antibodies were capable of neutralizing virus action in cells in-vitro, however, Gallardo emphasized that not all eggs contain antibodies that can neutralize COVID. “Not all eggs will contain these specific IgY’s that neutralize SARS CoV-2,” Gallardo said. He confirmed that the current egg shortage was caused by an outbreak of Avian Influenza H5N1 that has led to the losses of tens of millions of poultry. The outbreak, combined with soaring feed, fuel and labor costs, has led to U.S. egg prices more than doubling over the past year.

                Thai official: No plans to void Pfizer COVID vaccine contract
              

            CLAIM: Thailand is canceling its COVID-19 vaccine contract with Pfizer after its princess fell into a coma following a booster shot.

            THE FACTS: There are no plans to alter Thailand’s contract with the New York-based pharmaceutical giant, an official with the country’s National Vaccine Institute said. Princess Bajrakitiyabha’s condition was attributed to an irregular heartbeat caused by a bacterial infection. As concerns about the health of the princess mount following her December collapse, social media users are falsely claiming the Southeast Asian kingdom is taking drastic measures against a suspected culprit: Pfizer, one of the primary makers of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. “Thailand princess has been in a coma for about 3 weeks after getting a booster,” wrote one Twitter user in a post that’s been liked or shared roughly 28,000 times as of Tuesday. “The Royal family has discovered Pfizer has lied & it’s looking like they will tear up their contract & demand billions back. This could be the start of Pfizer’s demise.” Many of the users link to comments recently made in an online interview by Sucharit Bhakdi, a retired microbiology professor and vocal opponent of COVID vaccines. The former professor at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany, whose parents were originally from Thailand, claims in the interview that top Thai officials are considering nullifying the Pfizer contract after hearing out his concerns about the inoculations. But the Thai government has disputed this. “FAKE NEWS DO NOT SHARE!” Thailand’s Department of Disease Control wrote in Thai in a Feb. 3 Facebook post that includes a screenshot of Bhakdi’s interview. “The public is requested not to be fooled and ask for cooperation not to send, or share such information on various social media channels.” An official with Thailand’s National Vaccine Institute, which is under the Ministry of Public Health, also confirmed to the AP there are no plans to revisit the country’s contract with Pfizer. In a statement, Pfizer noted that Thailand’s disease control agency continues to recommend its vaccine “for all authorized ages and indications.” Bhakdi acknowledged that some of the claims circulating online are an “exaggeration.” But he maintains his concerns are being seriously considered. “I did speak with highest-ranking advisors to the government and Royal Family, thereby explaining why Thailand could and should annul the Pfizer purchase contract,” he wrote in an email Monday. “No more, no less. And they seemed to be convinced. Nothing has happened due to internal counter-movements. We are renewing our efforts, however, and with luck there will be things to report in about 2 weeks.” In a Jan. 7 statement, the royal palace said Bajrakitiyabha, the 44-year-old princess, who is the king’s eldest daughter and a potential heir to the throne, remained unconscious and on life support after falling into a coma while training dogs for an army exhibition. The statement attributed her collapse to an irregular heartbeat caused by a mycoplasma infection, a bacterial illness usually associated with pneumonia. Daniel Kuritzkes, a Harvard Medical School professor and chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said mycoplasma infections have so far not been found to be associated with COVID-19 vaccinations.

                LAX airport hasn’t added urinals to women’s restrooms
              

            CLAIM: Los Angeles International Airport is adding urinals to its women’s restrooms.

            THE FACTS: One men’s restroom has been temporarily converted into a women’s restroom while that section of the airport undergoes construction, a spokesperson told the AP. A misleading video taken inside a restroom at LAX has spread widely on social media in recent days. The video shows someone walking into a restroom labeled with a blue sign reading “women.” Inside, two rows of urinals can be seen, cordoned off behind white barriers and shielded from use with clear plastic covers. “Urinals in the women’s bathroom,” the person filming says. “Women, urinals. What the heck?” Social media users have falsely suggested the urinals were placed in the women’s restroom as a nod to transgender passengers or baselessly claimed their presence constituted a threat to the women inside. “Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is installing urinals in the WOMEN’S restrooms,” read the caption on one Instagram post. “So parents and ladies be alert and diligent when entering these facilities. Your safety and children’s safety has been put at risk by your government.” The restroom in the video has urinals because it is ordinarily a men’s room, said Heath Montgomery, a spokesperson for Los Angeles World Airports, the authority that runs LAX. That particular restroom had been converted to a women’s facility during construction work on the surrounding terminal. “We have dozens if not hundreds of restrooms throughout our 9 terminals and many other facilities,” he wrote in an email. “This one required a temporary conversion due to construction. It was marked appropriately and had the men’s facilities temporarily walled off.” Under California law, people within the state’s borders are entitled to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity, and single-stall restrooms must be designated as gender-neutral. LAX already has gender-neutral restrooms.

            Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheckA roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___2014 photo of US rescue dog misrepresented after Turkey earthquakeCLAIM: A photo shows a white-haired dog covered in dirt who helped rescue at least 10 people in Turkey after an earthquake struck the country on Monday.THE FACTS: The image was taken in 2014 by a Reuters photographer after a deadly mudslide near Oso, Washington. Following Monday’s earthquake, old photos and videos showing a variety of tragedies — from tsunamis to building collapses — circulated widely, falsely identified as showing the aftermath in Turkey and Syria. Amid search efforts, where many countries have sent dogs and rescuers, incorrectly attributed images of dogs used in other search efforts emerged. One widely shared misrepresented image shows a dog caked in dirt as he stares directly into the camera. A person sporting a red sleeve and white glove is holding the dog’s leash. “This dog hero who worked the whole night and saved 10 lives in Turkey,” reads a caption on an Instagram post of the image. But the photo shows a rescue dog who helped after the 2014 mudslide in Oso, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) outside of Seattle, which killed 43 people. It was taken by Rick Wilking, a freelance photographer for Reuters. “Tryon the rescue dog waits to go through the decontamination area at the mudslide after searching for victims in Oso, Washington March 30, 2014,” a caption on the photograph states. The AP also published a similar image of Tryon taken by Wilking at the time. The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey, as well as Syria, during the early hours Monday toppled thousands of buildings and killed more than 20,000 people, the AP reported.— Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed this report.___Study doesn’t prove egg yolks protect against COVID-19CLAIM: A protein naturally found in egg yolks protects against COVID-19 in humans, which is why there is an egg shortage.THE FACTS: The claim misrepresents a 2021 study by a group of Chinese researchers who immunized hens with part of the coronavirus spike protein in order to extract antibodies from yolks in the hens’ eggs. “PREVENT’S COVID! Do you understand why gov’ts are messing with chicken feed & destroying egg farms!” wrote one Twitter user who shared a screenshot of the study, which was archived in the National Library of Medicine. The post references other debunked claims that chicken feed is being altered to reduce egg production and that fires are being set at food plants to create shortages. While the post implies a link between the study and the current egg shortage, the two have no relationship to each other, experts say. “Eating eggs which have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is completely useless against COVID-19,” said Peter Palese, a microbiology professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine who has conducted similar research. “Such antibodies taken orally are right away digested in our digestive tract.” The study — titled “Chicken Egg Yolk Antibodies (IgYs) block the binding of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants to human ACE2” — was published in January 2021. The researchers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The study describes how antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein were isolated from chicken egg yolks. However, this was achieved by first immunizing hens with a portion of the spike protein. The antibodies were not naturally occurring in the hens, nor would they have a profound impact on COVID-19 in humans, according to Palese. “Such antibodies are good laboratory reagents but are no good for injecting into humans,” he wrote in an email to the AP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806769,Amsterdam Anne Frank museum targeted with antisemitic text,"Dutch police said Friday they are investigating a stunt that saw a text alluding to an antisemitic conspiracy theory projected onto the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam, causing outrage across the country.

            The words “Ann (sic) Frank invented the ballpoint pen,” referring to a debunked claim that the Jewish teenager’s famed diary is a forgery, were displayed for several minutes this week on the side of the building where her family hid during the Holocaust. 

            The 17th-century canal house is now a museum focusing on Frank’s short life, which receives around 1 million visitors a year.











            Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned the “reprehensible” incident, and tweeted: “We can never and should never accept this.” Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius cited the incident to urge parliament to approve a pending bill explicitly banning Holocaust denial.

            The proposed legislation would make it easier to prosecute over the Amsterdam incident, which currently falls under a law on discriminatory statements against minority groups.

            Amsterdam police said they are looking into the incident.

            “We were notified about it and our detectives are investigating,” spokesperson Rob van der Veen told the AP. 

            The text was projected from a vehicle across the canal and was noticed by security guards, who contacted police. A recording of the stunt was posted on an antisemitic Telegram channel.

            Frank kept a diary of life under German occupation in World War II, when, as a Jew, she was in constant danger. Even though she was arrested with her family in 1944 and sent to a Nazi concentration camp, where she died, the diary survived and became one of the world’s most famous books.

            According to the Netherlands’ top official for fighting antisemitism, Eddo Verdoner, several pages written with a ballpoint pen were found amongst Frank’s papers in the 1980s. That type of pen was not introduced in the Netherlands until after WWII, and Holocaust deniers have claimed this proves her diary, published by her father after the war, is a fake. However, researchers have concluded that the pages were accidentally left in the diary in the 1960s.

            Verdoner told the AP that the Amsterdam stunt was “a despicable act that tries to cast doubts on the experiences of the witnesses of the Holocaust.”

            He said there had been a rise in antisemitism since the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that throughout history Jews have faced increased hatred during times of hardship.Dutch police said Friday they are investigating a stunt that saw a text alluding to an antisemitic conspiracy theory projected onto the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam, causing outrage across the country.The words “Ann (sic) Frank invented the ballpoint pen,” referring to a debunked claim that the Jewish teenager’s famed diary is a forgery, were displayed for several minutes this week on the side of the building where her family hid during the Holocaust.The 17th-century canal house is now a museum focusing on Frank’s short life, which receives around 1 million visitors a year.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned the “reprehensible” incident, and tweeted: “We can never and should never accept this.” Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius cited the incident to urge parliament to approve a pending bill explicitly banning Holocaust denial.The proposed legislation would make it easier to prosecute over the Amsterdam incident, which currently falls under a law on discriminatory statements against minority groups.Amsterdam police said they are looking into the incident.“We were notified about it and our detectives are investigating,” spokesperson Rob van der Veen told the AP.The text was projected from a vehicle across the canal and was noticed by security guards, who contacted police.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806770,"At 82, Dionne Warwick staying busy with youth musical, more","CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — With a stunning musical career already spanning decades, Dionne Warwick couldn’t be blamed for slowing down a bit at age 82. That is nowhere near happening.

            The Grammy-winning, multimillion-selling singer has a soon-to-be released duet with Dolly Parton and a new biographical documentary now streaming on HBO Max. That's not all.

            Her latest project with music producer son Damon Elliott and others is an upcoming 50-city live touring show called “Hits! The Musical” with performers ranging in age from 10 to 22.











            This week at a rehearsal space in Clearwater, Florida, it was time to hear the kids sing and dance, the first chance for Warwick to see the “Hits!” revue in person. It's set to begin performances Feb. 23 in Asheville, North Carolina, and end May 8 in San Francisco.

            In an interview with The Associated Press, Warwick said she did not hesitate when the opportunity arose to be an executive producer of the show.

            “Anything that deals with children is an automatic yes for me,” Warwick said. “These babies are amazing. They've proven what music can do, bring joy, happiness, inspiration, ability — just life, you know?”

            Warwick said she had “an amazing experience” after watching the group run through high-energy medleys of everything from Ricky Martin's “Livin' La Vida Loca” to “Where Is The Love?” by the Black-Eyed Peas to a mashup of Adele's “Rolling In The Deep” and “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars.

            “I'm really at a loss for words and I'm never at a loss for words,” Warwick said. “To see this kind of brilliance.”

            One of the youthful 29-member cast, 15-year-old Matthew Jost, said he's thrilled to be part of the show even after playing guitarist Zack in “School of Rock” on Broadway. The show runs through key eras of music over three acts, from rock to pop to hip-hop.

            “It's just music that means a lot to me. For this year, we're all over the place,” Jost said, adding that he hopes the audience “just gets that we're kids, we're here, and music brings people together.” 

            Much credit goes to Warwick's son, Damon Elliott, who was nominated this year for an Academy Award along with songwriter Diane Warren for the song “Applause” from the film “Tell It Like A Woman.” The pair also teamed up on a song called “Gonna Be You” in the new “80 For Brady” movie.

            “Mom and I, we don’t take on anything, we don’t endorse pretty much anything,” Elliott said in an interview about the “Hits!” show. “But when it involves kids, as long as they are truly up to par and they work hard and bring that energy, I’ll be behind it.”

            Another executive producer is Thaddeus M. Bullard, a former college and professional football player best known as WWE wrestling star Titus O'Neil, and show CEO Bob Gries, a Tampa financier who formerly owned two Florida Arena League football teams.

            Warwick's rehearsal show Wednesday capped a week in which she attended the Grammy Awards, performed at a MusiCares dinner honoring Motown greats Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson and then flew to Nashville, Tennessee to shoot a video with Parton for their new tune.

            That song, “Peace Like A River,” is set for release Feb. 24. Warwick said she has known Parton for years but they've never recorded together.

            “She sent me a song and decided she wanted me to sing with her,” Warwick said, noting she plans to record a gospel/inspirational album herself in the coming months. “It's so timely. This song fits completely inside what I'm getting ready to do.”

            Those projects will only add to the estimated 100 million records Warwick has sold since her 1960s partnership with composer Burt Bacharach — who died this week at age 94 — and lyricist Hal David yielded such hits as “Walk On By,” “Do You Know The Way To San Jose?” “Alfie,” and “I'll Never Fall In Love Again.” She has had 56 singles make the charts.

            All of this ground is covered in the new documentary, titled “Dionne Warwick: Don't Make Me Over” that's streaming on HBO Max. It is chock full of music titans discussing Warwick's life and career. A key section is the rise to superstardom and death in 2012 of Whitney Houston, who was Warwick's cousin and a huge part of the family's impressive musical heritage.

            Back in Florida, the “Hits!” troupe gathered on stage at the end of the recent rehearsal to sing an a cappella version of “That's What Friends Are For,” the song Warwick cut in 1986 to boost AIDS research along with Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight.

            Warwick said she’s not ready at all to rest on all those accomplishments.

            “My voice is fine. I don't take care of it, God does,” she said. “I'll keep going as long as the people want me to be there and they fill the seats. That's all I can tell you.”CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — With a stunning musical career already spanning decades, Dionne Warwick couldn’t be blamed for slowing down a bit at age 82.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806771,Oldest schoolhouse for Black children in US moved to museum,"WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) — A building believed to be the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children in the U.S. was hoisted onto a flatbed truck and moved a half-mile Friday to Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia museum that continues to expand its emphasis on African American history. 

            Built 25 years before the American Revolution, the original structure stood near the college campus of William & Mary. The pinewood building held as many as 30 students at a time, some of them free Black children studying alongside the enslaved.

            Hundreds of people lined the streets to celebrate its slow-speed trip into the heart of the living history museum, which tells the story of Virginia’s colonial capital through interpreters and restored buildings. 











            For historians and descendants alike, the Bray School contradicts the belief that all enslaved Americans were uneducated. But the school’s faith-based curriculum — created by an English charity — also justified slavery and encouraged students to accept their fate as God’s plan. 

            “Religion was at the heart of the school, and it was not a gospel of abolition,” said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary’s Bray School Lab. 

            “There was this need to proselytize and to bring salvation while still not doing anything to destabilize the institution of slavery,” Lee said. “Save the soul, but continue to enslave the body. It was the here versus the hereafter.”

            It was a brand of duplicity that fit easily into the larger contradictions of the country's founding, when the Democracy being forged explicitly denied rights and freedoms to many of its people. 

            Williamsburg is less than 10 miles from Jamestown, which England established in 1607. The colony was supplied with enslaved Africans for labor just a dozen years later. A century and half after that, Black people, most of them still enslaved, represented just over half of Williamsburg’s 2,000 people.

            The Bray School was established in 1760 at the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin, chairman of a London-based Anglican charity named after philanthropist Reverend Thomas Bray. The charity also set up schools in other cities, including New York and Philadelphia. 

            The curriculum ranged from spellers to the Book of Common Prayer. But even within the schools’ paternalistic framework, the education could still be empowering, perhaps even subversive. 

            “I was going through a facsimile of one of the books, and there are words like ‘liberty,’” Lee said. “What did learning those words do to expand these children’s sense of themselves? Their sense of the world?” 

            Isaac Bee, a Bray School student, would run away as an adult from a slave owner named Lewis Burwell. An ad that Burwell placed in The Virginia Gazette in 1774 offered a cash bounty for his return and warned that Bee could read. 

            The white teacher, a widow named Ann Wager, lived upstairs at the school, and taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10, according to surviving records. 

            The Williamsburg Bray School operated until 1774; only Philadelphia's reopened after the Revolutionary War. The structure became a private home for many years before it was incorporated into William & Mary’s campus. 

            The former schoolhouse eventually was moved from its original spot to make way for a dormitory. The original structure had 1.5 stories, with a small upstairs. It was expanded over the years to include two full stories, and was last used as an office for ROTC, the college program that prepares military officers. 

            Historians believed they had identified the original Bray School building, but it wasn’t confirmed until 2021, through the use of dendrochronology, a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber to determine the wood’s harvest date.

            “This is a remarkable story of survival,” said Matthew Webster, Colonial Williamsburg’s executive director of architectural preservation and research. “And for us, it’s so important to put it back (to its original state) and tell the full and true story.” 

            The Bray School was exceptional: Although Virginia waited until the 1800s to impose anti-literacy laws, white leaders across much of Colonial America forbid educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage their liberty. South Carolina criminalized teaching slaves to write English in 1740. 

            Inside the schoolhouse, the original post at the bottom of the walnut staircase still stands, its square top rounded and nicked from centuries of use, Webster said, adding that it’s a “very powerful piece for a lot of people.” 

            For Tonia Merideth, the Bray School Lab’s oral historian, the building stirred up many emotions upon her first visit. It was material proof against the narrative that her ancestors were illiterate and dumb. 

            “Everything that I learned about my ancestors was wrong,” she said. “They could learn. They did learn. They were able.”

            Merideth added: “Regardless of the intentions of the school, the children were still taking that education and possibly serving it for their own good and aiding in their community.” 

            Merideth can trace her roots to the Armistead family, which enslaved people in the Williamsburg area and is known to have sent at least one child, named Locust, to the Bray School. But only three years of student lists have survived. 

            The moving of the Bray School is part of Colonial Williamsburg’s ongoing reckoning over its past storytelling of Black history and the nation’s origin story. The museum was founded in 1926 but did not tell Black stories until 1979. 

            In 2021, it uncovered the brick foundation of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches. Last year, archeologists began to excavate graves at the site. 

            The Bray School’s new location is right next door. 

            “We’re going back and we’re getting that school and we’re getting that legacy,” Merideth said. “And we’re bringing it back to the historic area.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806772,Abortion pill could be pulled off market by Texas lawsuit,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Texas lawsuit with a key deadline this month is posing a threat to the nationwide availability of medication abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S. 

            The case filed by abortion opponents who helped challenge Roe v. Wade seeks to reverse a decades-old approval by the Food and Drug Administration. 

            If a federal judge appointed by former President Donald Trump sides with them, it could halt the supply of the drug mifepristone in all states, both where abortion is banned and where it remains legal.











            “It could have an immediate impact on the country,” said Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. “In some ways this is a backdoor ban on abortion.”

            On Friday, a group of 22 Democratic-led states weighed in, saying the consequences of reversing the approval could be “nothing short of catastrophic. A similar-sized group of Republican states also filed briefs supporting the reversal, saying the ability to order pills by mail undermines their laws banning abortion. 

            U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has not indicated exactly when or how he will rule, but groups like Timmaraju’s have been preparing for a possible decision shortly after a Feb. 24 filing deadline. There is scant precedent for a lone judge overruling the FDA’s scientific decisions. A swift appeal of any ruling is likely.

            The lawsuit was filed by the group Alliance Defending Freedom, which was also involved in the Mississippi case that led to Roe v. Wade being overturned. 

            “Our representatives in Congress created the FDA and gave the FDA the responsibility to make sure that drugs are safe before they’re allowed on the market … the FDA failed that responsibility,” said Julie Blake, senior counsel for the group. 

            They argue the FDA overstepped its authority in approving mifepristone by using an accelerated review process reserved for drugs to treat “serious or life-threatening illnesses.”

            But in its legal response, the agency said it didn't accelerate the drug’s approval, which came four years after the manufacturer first submitted its application to market the pill.

            The FDA approved mifepristone — in combination with a second drug — as a safe and effective method for ending a pregnancy in 2000. Common side effects include cramping and light bleeding. Cases of more severe bleeding requiring emergency care are very rare.

            Halting access to the drug more than 20 years after approval would be “extraordinary and unprecedented,” federal attorneys stated in a legal filing.

            Kacsmaryk, who previously ruled against a program providing free birth control to minors in Texas, could also issue a ruling rolling back regulators' decisions to ease restrictions on the pill’s availability. Those have been based on scientific studies showing women can safely use the drug at home. 

            In late 2021, the FDA removed a requirement that women pick up the drug in person. Last month the agency dropped another requirement that prevented most pharmacies from dispensing the pill.

            Medication abortion accounted for over half of abortions before Roe v. Wade was overturned, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. It’s grown more important since then, said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the science-based research group that supports abortion rights. 

            “The clinics that are open in the receiving states are stretched thin, they don’t have a lot of give in their capacity and being able to provide medication abortion is very, very important,” she said. 

            Abortion medication is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. Mifepristone is taken first, swallowed by mouth. The drug dilates the cervix and blocks the effects of the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy.

            Misoprostol, a drug also used to treat stomach ulcers, is taken 24 to 48 hours later. It causes the uterus to cramp and contract, causing bleeding and expelling pregnancy tissue. The combination has been shown to be more than 95% effective in ending pregnancies up to 10 weeks. 

            If mifepristone is pulled, providers could prescribe misoprostol alone instead, an approach that is used in many parts of the world, but would be a big shift in U.S. practice and has not been found to be quite as effective.

            Such a ruling could also increase the need for surgical abortion and further increase wait times at clinics, which are already weekslong in some cases after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe, Nash said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806773,Corruption endangers world's shrinking fisheries,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As Indonesia’s fisheries minister, Edhy Prabowo was tasked with protecting one of his country’s most precious resources: baby lobsters so tiny one can fit on the tip of a finger.

            The waters off the nation’s many islands and archipelagos had once teemed with lobster. But overfishing in recent decades decimated the crustacean’s population, so much so that fishermen turned to catching the hatchlings. They scooped them up by the thousands and shipped them to Vietnamese lobster farms, where the babies are raised to adulthood and sold mostly to dealers in China to meet its enormous demand for seafood.

            Concerned that such harvesting was harming lobster populations, Indonesia’s fishing ministry in 2016 prohibited the export of the tiny crustaceans. Shortly after taking office, Prabowo lifted the ban. Court documents show that just a month later, in June 2020, the minister accepted a $77,000 bribe from a seafood supplier to grant it a permit to sell the hatchlings abroad.











            The money kept flowing. In his short stint as minister, Prabowo accepted bribes of nearly $2 million. He was arrested in 2020 by Indonesian authorities, having used the graft to purchase 26 road bikes, Old Navy children’s clothes, Louis Vuitton bags, Rolex watches and two luxury pens. Prabowo, 50, was sentenced to five years in prison for corruption. His attorney declined to comment.

            Prabowo’s case is not an outlier. At least 45 government officials have been accused of corruption in the past two decades, the AP found. The allegations range from high-ranking officials like Prabowo, accepting large payments from fishing companies to obtain lucrative contracts, to low-level civil servants accepting a few thousand dollars to ignore fishermen bringing illegal catch ashore.

            “Fisheries corruption can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and local communities that may depend on them,” said Ben Freitas, manager of ocean policy at the World Wildlife Fund, based in Washington. “It is a global problem.”

            The situation is most critical in areas managed by developing nations because many industrialized countries have already overfished their own waters, forcing their trawlers to go afar. Many coastal developing countries depend on fish for millions of jobs and to feed their people.

            Those wishing to conceal their operations or pay bribes to get around restrictions have found fishing to be a welcoming industry.

            “The lack of accountability, I think, is even greater in the fisheries sector than it is in other environmental-related activities,” said Juhani Grossmann at the Basel Institute on Governance, which is working on anti-corruption efforts with Indonesia's fishing ministry.

            At least with illicit lumber operations, Grossmann said, “you don’t have a different shell corporation for every single truck.""

            The AP review found that most cases of corruption and graft were low-level schemes, like one in India in which prosecutors last year alleged two fisheries officers extorted $1,100 to approve subsidies for a fish farm. Another involved fishermen said to have bribed Malaysian officers with at least $11,000 for every boat they agreed not to report.

            But some involve global financial institutions. In 2021, the Swiss bank Credit Suisse admitted to fraudulently financing a massive loan to Mozambique to expand its tuna fishing fleet. A contractor handling the loan paid kickbacks of $150 million to Mozambican government officials. 

            And in the “ Fishrot ” scandal, Namibian authorities allege the Icelandic seafood company Samherji paid roughly $6 million in bribes to Namibian officials to be permitted to fish in the country’s waters. Samherji has denied committing crimes.

            Stephen Akester, a fisheries management adviser who has worked in Africa and South Asia for four decades, cited a long history of foreign companies — particularly from China — forging corrupt relationships with fisheries officials.

            “They exploited the weakness of these governments for whom any kind of revenue was big money, even small dollars,” he said. “And that still continues today.”

            In Gambia, a small West African nation nestled along Senegal’s coast, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries and Water Resources, Bamba Banja, was charged in 2021 with accepting a bribe from a Chinese company to free a vessel detained for illegal fishing. The case is ongoing; Banja’s lawyer told AP that the fisheries secretary denies any wrongdoing.

            Corruption is not limited to developing countries. Malta's fisheries director in 2019 was linked to a criminal network that sought to launder illegally caught bluefin tuna that arrived in Spain from Italy and Malta via French ports. The newspaper El Confidencial said Spanish police intercepted a phone call in which the director was heard telling a tuna magnate, “You have to pay me."" Malta's fisheries ministry said the director was on unpaid leave.

            The cases reviewed by AP probably represent a small fraction of the corruption that takes place daily as seafood is transported and sold around the world.

            In Ghana, for instance, the fishing ministry has been unmarked by any major corruption scandal. Yet the Environmental Justice Foundation, which has investigated abuses in the fishing sector for two decades, issued a report last year documenting how the West African nation has become ensnared in “a culture of corruption in which bribery and intimidation pervades all levels of fisheries management.”

            Kyei Kwadwo Yamoah advocates for better fisheries management in Ghana as convener of the Fisheries Alliance. In reviewing infractions reported by observers on fishing vessels for a World Bank project in 2016, Yamoah found wide, unexplained gaps in enforcement. The government had penalized some companies, he said, but others were granted a renewed fishing license without question.

            “There was no clarity as to why these vessels were not even booked or sanctioned, while there was a clear case of a breach of law,” Yamoah said.

            Overfishing and illegal fishing have pushed Ghana's fish stocks to near collapse, prompting presidential action and putting the livelihoods and the health of millions of Ghanaians at risk.

            The situation, Yamoah said, is growing dire: Some days fishermen spend all day on the water and come back with nothing.

Malta's fisheries ministry said the director was on unpaid leave.The cases reviewed by AP probably represent a small fraction of the corruption that takes place daily as seafood is transported and sold around the world.In Ghana, for instance, the fishing ministry has been unmarked by any major corruption scandal. Yet the Environmental Justice Foundation, which has investigated abuses in the fishing sector for two decades, issued a report last year documenting how the West African nation has become ensnared in “a culture of corruption in which bribery and intimidation pervades all levels of fisheries management.”Kyei Kwadwo Yamoah advocates for better fisheries management in Ghana as convener of the Fisheries Alliance. In reviewing infractions reported by observers on fishing vessels for a World Bank project in 2016, Yamoah found wide, unexplained gaps in enforcement. The government had penalized some companies, he said, but others were granted a renewed fishing license without question.“There was no clarity as to why these vessels were not even booked or sanctioned, while there was a clear case of a breach of law,” Yamoah said.Overfishing and illegal fishing have pushed Ghana's fish stocks to near collapse, prompting presidential action and putting the livelihoods and the health of millions of Ghanaians at risk.The situation, Yamoah said, is growing dire: Some days fishermen spend all day on the water and come back with nothing.___Associated Press reporters Colleen Barry in Milan, Ciarán Giles in Madrid, Joshua Goodman in Miami, Abdoulie John in Gambia, Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi, and Edna Tarigan and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta contributed to this report.___Follow the reporters on Twitter: @FuTingBJ, @GraceEkpu and @helenwieffering.Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips.___This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

He praised the UK for being ""in the lead"" in providing several forms of military support to Ukraine.Hodges said he believed that the only ""red line"" for Washington's involvement in Ukraine is ""boots on the ground.""He stressed that Kyiv must retake Crimea to preserve the ""international rules-based order"" and the ""UN Charter."" Hodges added that it is important for Ukrainian ports to maintain access to the Sea of Azov through Crimea.Hodges — who presided over US forces in Europe from 2014 to 2018 — said he believed that Russia was attempting to ""surge"" a new offensive, but added that does not have the capability to launch a ""major"" one.""They don't have the armored forces, the ability to break through,"" he said, adding that this isn't going to change the ""overall operational environment"" in Ukraine.Kyiv ""has enough to limit the Russian success,"" he said, adding that this will still be ""costly"" in terms of casualties and ammunition.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Friday said any decision on supplying fighter jets to Ukraine must come from the NATO defensive alliance.""There would have to be a decision on the part of NATO, and Poland will eventually decide what to do when there is an unequivocal decision that fighter jets can be transfered to Ukraine,"" Morawiecki told a press conference in Brussels.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has returned from a whirlwind tour of European supporters, has warned that Ukraine needs artillery, munitions, modern tanks, long-range missiles and fighter jets in time to fend off new Russian offensives.Zelensky said he saw ""positive signals, concerning the respective weapons"" from EU leaders and that he hoped that assorted murmurs would become a ""concrete voice.""",2023/02/10,,

Along with Sandu, she pushed for accession into the EU — the country was given candidate status last year.The government had been planning a series of reforms in line with EU accession to speed up the process while also seeking to diversify the country's energy supply and reduce its dependence on Russia.Moldova gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 but a thin stretch of the country along the Ukrainian border, known as Transnistria, has continued to hold close ties with Moscow and claims autonomy from Chisinau.Russian troops are also present in the separatist region, giving weight to the direct and indirect threats made by Russian officials.Moldova has been hit by a myriad of problems, including skyrocketing inflation, energy insecurity, and large numbers of Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country.The threats posed by the war in neighboring Ukraine were made evident on Friday when a Russian missile flew through Moldovan airspace.The government has also faced widespread protests, organized by the party of pro-Moscow politician in exile Ilan Shor. Chisinau has claimed the protests were backed by the Kremlin to destabilize the pro-Western government.""I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,"" Gavrilita said in her resignation statement. ""We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in.""""In spite of unprecedented challenges, the country was governed responsibly, with a lot of attention and dedicated work.

            The Spanish club, which made the announcement Thursday evening, said the dozen club members would not be allowed to use their tickets to attend games while the probe was ongoing into the incidents that occurred during Madrid’s 2-0 win at Valladolid on Dec. 30. Valladolid said it collaborated with police to identify them.

            Vinícius, a 22-year-old Brazil forward who is Black, has been subjected to racist abuse since his arrival in Spain in 2018, but it has intensified this season. He was targeted last weekend during a game at Mallorca. Last month, his effigy hung off a bridge in Madrid before the derby against Atletico Madrid.











            Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti denounced the suffering of his player earlier this week, saying that the racist attacks he is receiving “is a problem of Spanish football.”

            Teammate Aurélien Tchouameni, a France midfielder who is also Black, spoke out about his situation on Friday ahead of the Club World Cup final in Morocco.

            “As the coach said, the problem with Vinicius is a general issue and society’s problem with racism. It doesn’t matter if you are white, Black or red. We have to show zero tolerance. We must eradicate it at all costs. The Spanish league can take action and hopefully change this situation.”

            The Spanish league said earlier this week it filed a complaint with the courts regarding the incident at Mallorca. It had filed similar legal complaints in cases involving racist insults against Vinícius five other times, with three of them being archived and two still being analyzed.

            The league has also issued a call for fans to send images of racist acts at games either by email or by message via a Telegram messaging channel.

            Authorities have yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy last month. Nor have any teams been punished for the racist insults inside their stadiums.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806783,Elon Musk's Neuralink probed over material shipments,"Elon Musk’s brain-implant company Neuralink is being probed over its shipping methods after an animal rights group contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. officials said. 

            The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said that public records show untrained Neuralink employees transported “contaminated” devices that were removed from the brains of “infected” monkeys without safely packaging them. The incidents are said to have taken place in 2019 at the University of California, Davis, where experiments on rhesus macaques were performed.

            Neuralink is one of many groups working on linking brains to computers, efforts aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other applications.











            The origins of the technology dates back to the 1960s, but significant advances have been made in recent years. 

            Late last year, in a livestreamed “show and tell” presentation, Musk said his team is in the process of seeking approval from U.S. regulators to test his company's device. He said at the time that the company should be able to put the implant in a human brain as part of a clinical trial in about six months, though that timeline is far from certain.

            The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said medical files it obtained for the monkeys suggest that transported neural devices may have been contaminated with antibiotic-resistant pathogens including Staphylococcus and Klebsiella, which can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and meningitis. The group said the devices have also have been contaminated with Corynebacterium ulcerans, an “emerging human pathogen” that can produce fatal diphtheria. The devices may also have come from monkeys infected with Herpes B.

            “The records suggest that Neuralink’s sloppy practices pose a danger to public health and safety,” Deborah Dubow Press, Esq., associate general counsel with the Physicians Committee, said. 

            Neuralink, based in Fremont, California did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806784,New classified document found in FBI search of Pence home,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI discovered an additional document with classified markings at former Vice President Mike Pence ’s Indiana home during a search Friday, following the discovery by his lawyers last month of sensitive government documents there.

            Pence adviser Devin O’Malley said the Department of Justice completed “a thorough and unrestricted search of five hours"" and removed “one document with classified markings and six additional pages without such markings that were not discovered in the initial review by the vice president’s counsel.""

            The search, described as consensual after negotiations between Pence's representatives and the Justice Department, comes after he was subpoenaed in a separate investigation into efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election and as Pence contemplates a Republican bid for the White House in 2024.











            Pence is now the third current or former top U.S. official, joining Trump and President Joe Biden, to have their homes scoured by FBI agents for classified records. The willingness of Pence and Biden to permit the FBI to search their homes, and to present themselves as fully cooperative, reflects a desire by both to avoid the drama that enveloped Trump last year and resulted in the Justice Department having to get a warrant to inspect his Florida property.

            Police blocked the road outside Pence’s neighborhood in Carmel, just north of Indianapolis, on Friday afternoon as the FBI was inside the home. They were seen leaving shortly after 2 p.m. Pence and his wife were out of state, visiting family on the West Coast following the birth of their second and third grandchildren.

            A member of Pence’s legal team was at the home during the search and the FBI was given what was described as unrestricted access to search for documents with classified markings, documents that could be classified but without markings and any other documents subject to the Presidential Records Act.

            O’Malley said Pence has directed his legal team to continue to cooperate with the DOJ and “to be fully transparent through the conclusion of this matter.”

            The FBI had already taken possession of what Pence’s lawyer previously described as a ""small number of documents"" that had been “inadvertently boxed and transported” to Pence's Indiana home at the end of the Trump administration.

            The Justice Department did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

            Separate special counsels have been investigating the discovery of documents with classification markings at Biden’s home in Delaware and his former Washington office, as well as Trump’s Florida estate. Officials are trying to determine whether Trump or anyone on his team criminally obstructed the probe in refusing to turn over the documents before the FBI seizure. The FBI recovered more than 100 documents marked classified while serving a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago last August.

            In yet another document development, emails released late Friday revealed that after the National Archives became aware of the discovery of the classified papers at Biden's former Washington office, Archives officials requested and received papers that had been shipped to a law office in Boston by the president’s personal attorney.

            No classified documents were believed to be in the Boston documents. 

            The circumstances of the Biden and Pence cases are markedly different from that of Trump.

            Pence, according to his lawyer Greg Jacob, had requested a review by his attorneys of records stored at his home “out of an abundance of caution” during the uproar over the discovery of classified documents at Biden's home and former private office. When the Pence documents were discovered on Jan. 16 among four boxes that had ben transferred to Pence’s home during the transition, Jacob said, they were secured in a locked safe and reported to the National Archives. FBI agents then collected them.

            Material found in the boxes came mostly from the Naval Observatory residence where Pence lived while he was vice president. Other material came from a West Wing office drawer.

            Pence has said he was unaware the documents had been in his possession.

            “Let me be clear: Those classified documents should not have been in my personal residence,” Pence said recently at Florida International University. “Mistakes were made, and I take full responsibility.”

            “We acted above politics and put national interests first,"" he said.

            The National Archives last month asked former U.S. presidents and vice president s to recheck their personal records for any classified documents following news of the Biden and Pence discoveries.

             The Presidential Records Act states that any records created or received by the president while in office are the property of the U.S. government and will be managed by the Archives at the end of an administration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806785,"Don't feed the bears! But birds OK, new Tahoe research shows","RENO, Nev. (AP) — Don't feed the bears!

            Wildlife biologists and forest rangers have preached the mantra for nearly a century at national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and for decades in areas where urban development increasingly invaded native wildlife habitat. 

            But don't feed the birds? That may be a different story — at least for one bird species at Lake Tahoe.











            Snowshoe and cross-country ski enthusiasts routinely feed the tiny mountain chickadees high above the north shore of the alpine lake on the California-Nevada border. The black-capped birds of Chickadee Ridge will even perch on extended hands to snatch offered seeds.

            New research from University of Nevada scientists found that supplementing the chickadees' natural food sources with food provided in feeders or by hand did not negatively impact them, as long as proper food is used and certain rules are followed.

            “It’s a wonderful experience when the birds fly around and land on your hand to grab food. We call it ‘becoming a Disney princess,’” said Benjamin Sonnenberg, a biologist/behavioral ecologist who co-authored the six-year study. 

            But he also recognized “there’s always the question of when it is appropriate or not appropriate to feed birds in the wild.""

            State wildlife officials said this week they generally frown on feeding wildlife. But Nevada Department of Wildlife spokeswoman Ashley Sanchez acknowledged concerns about potential harm are based on speculation, not scientific data.

            The latest research project under the wings of Professor Vladimir Pravosudov’s Chickadee Cognition Lab established feeders in the Forest Service's Mount Rose Wilderness and tracked populations of mountain chickadees at two elevations — both those that did and didn't visit feeders.

            “If we saw increases in the population size or decreases in the population size, that could mean we were hurting the animals by feeding them,” co-author Joseph Welklin said. “Our study shows that feeding these mountain chickadees in the wild during the winter has no effect on their population dynamics.""

            Sonnenberg said he understood concerns about supplementing food for wild creatures at Tahoe, where bears attracted to garbage get into trouble that sometimes turns fatal, and not for humans. The bears may ultimately be killed because they no longer fear people. He grew up in Bozeman, Montana, and has fond memories of grizzly and black bears at Yellowstone National Park where he learned at an early age “not to intentionally or to accidentally feed them.”

            “Feeding wildlife is context-specific and comes with nuance,” he said.

            Bear-human conflicts were extremely rare at Tahoe when Ranger Smith started battling Yogi and Boo-Boo over “pic-a-nic” baskets at fictional Jellystone Park in the popular cartoon that debuted in 1960. But between 1960 and 1980 the human population around Lake Tahoe exploded from 10,000 to 50,000 — 90,000 in the summer. Peak days now approach 300,000 visitors.

            The growth spurred more development encroaching on native bear habitat, which led some so-called “garbage bears"" to become dependent on unsecured trash for food. In a few cases, wildlife officials have blamed resulting bear deaths on north Tahoe residents feeding bears in their backyards.

            “Should you feed the bears? Of course not,” Sonnenberg said. “But given the millions of people that are feeding birds around the world, understanding the impact of this food on wild populations is important, especially in a changing world.”

            Mountain chickadees are of particular interest because they’re among the few avian species that hunker down for the cold Sierra winters instead of migrating to a warmer climate. They stash away tens of thousands of food items every fall then return to the hidden treasure throughout the winter to survive.

            They're “prolific scatter hoarders and rely on specialized spatial memory abilities to recover cached food from their environment during harsh winter months,” according to the findings published last month in the journal Ornithology.

            “When they come to your hand and grab a food item,” Sonnenberg said, “if they fly away into the woods and you can’t see them anymore, they are likely storing that food for later.”

            Their visits to feeders instead of tapping their own stash, the study said, “may be partially driven by the seemingly compulsive-like nature of caching behavior, as chickadees will cache available resources until they are depleted.""

            The project included scientists from Canada's University of Western Ontario's Department of Psychology, Kennesaw State University's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology in Georgia and the University of Oklahoma's Biological Survey.

            Sanchez said the Nevada Department of Wildlife's concerns include observations the chickadees are exhibiting a level of tameness around potential predators — humans — which could make them more susceptible to other predators in nature.

            She also said in an email the number of people hand-feeding the birds at Chickadee Ridge has increased significantly in recent years, “which means the odds that somebody will feed them inappropriate food items or handle them inappropriately has also increased.""

            Sonnenberg added in an email the researchers are “not directly advocating for or against the feeding of chickadees at Chickadee Ridge.”

            But “what our results do show is that this extra food does not cause chickadee populations in the Sierra Nevada to boom (increase to densities that could be harmful) or bust (decrease dramatically due to harmful effects),” he wrote.

            Anyone feeding the birds should only provide food similar to what is found in their natural environment such as unsalted pine nuts or black-oil sunflower seeds, never bread or other human food, he said.

            “And always be respectful of the animal,” Sonnenberg said. “Behave like you’re in their house and you’re visiting them.”RENO, Nev. (AP) — Don't feed the bears!Wildlife biologists and forest rangers have preached the mantra for nearly a century at national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and for decades in areas where urban development increasingly invaded native wildlife habitat.But don't feed the birds? That may be a different story — at least for one bird species at Lake Tahoe.Snowshoe and cross-country ski enthusiasts routinely feed the tiny mountain chickadees high above the north shore of the alpine lake on the California-Nevada border. The black-capped birds of Chickadee Ridge will even perch on extended hands to snatch offered seeds.New research from University of Nevada scientists found that supplementing the chickadees' natural food sources with food provided in feeders or by hand did not negatively impact them, as long as proper food is used and certain rules are followed.“It’s a wonderful experience when the birds fly around and land on your hand to grab food. We call it ‘becoming a Disney princess,’” said Benjamin Sonnenberg, a biologist/behavioral ecologist who co-authored the six-year study.But he also recognized “there’s always the question of when it is appropriate or not appropriate to feed birds in the wild.""State wildlife officials said this week they generally frown on feeding wildlife. But Nevada Department of Wildlife spokeswoman Ashley Sanchez acknowledged concerns about potential harm are based on speculation, not scientific data.The latest research project under the wings of Professor Vladimir Pravosudov’s Chickadee Cognition Lab established feeders in the Forest Service's Mount Rose Wilderness and tracked populations of mountain chickadees at two elevations — both those that did and didn't visit feeders.“If we saw increases in the population size or decreases in the population size, that could mean we were hurting the animals by feeding them,” co-author Joseph Welklin said. “Our study shows that feeding these mountain chickadees in the wild during the winter has no effect on their population dynamics.""Sonnenberg said he understood concerns about supplementing food for wild creatures at Tahoe, where bears attracted to garbage get into trouble that sometimes turns fatal, and not for humans.

            Bedingfield is expected to be key in Biden’s likely re-election campaign as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the president's plans who was not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

            Biden hasn't said officially that he's running for re-election, but has said it's his intention to do so.

            Bedingfield's departure is the latest for the administration, which saw little turnover during Biden's first two years. Jen Psaki left as White House press secretary in May. Ron Klain announced his departure as chief of staff just a few weeks ago. Since then, Brian Deese, a top Biden aide on the economy, said he would leave, and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is also expected to do so.

            Bedingfield was Biden's communications director when he was vice president and served as his deputy campaign manager during his 2020 presidential run. 

            “Since my time as Vice President, Kate has been a loyal and trusted adviser, through thick and thin,” Biden said in a statement. “The country is better off as a result of her hard work and I’m so grateful to her — and to her husband and two young children — for giving so much. Ben has big shoes to fill.”

            LaBolt worked on communications for Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was Biden’s pick for the Supreme Court, and the first Black woman to have the job. LaBolt also worked in communications for Democrats in both the House and Senate.

            But when they attempted to fly out of the southern African country they were rearrested at the airport and fresh charges were pressed against them.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806793,Texas AG settles with former aides who reported him to FBI,"DALLAS (AP) — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has agreed to apologize and pay $3.3 million in taxpayer money to four former staffers who accused him of corruption in 2020, igniting an ongoing FBI investigation of the three-term Republican. 

            Under terms of a preliminary lawsuit settlement filed Friday, Paxton made no admission of wrongdoing to accusations of bribery and abuse of office, which he has denied for years and called politically motivated. 

            But Paxton did commit to making a remarkable public apology toward some of his formerly trusted advisers whom he fired or forced out after they reported him to the FBI. He called them “rogue employees” after they accused Paxton of misusing his office to help one of his campaign contributors, who also employed a woman with whom the attorney general acknowledged having an extramarital affair. 











            Both sides signed a mediated agreement that was filed in the Texas Supreme Court and will be followed by a longer, formalized settlement. 

            “Attorney General Ken Paxton accepts that plaintiffs acted in a manner that they thought was right and apologizes for referring to them as 'rogue employees,'” the final settlement must state, according to court records.

            In all, eight members of Paxton's senior staff joined in the extraordinary revolt in 2020, and they either resigned or were fired. The attorney general said he settled with the four who sued under Texas' whistleblower law to put to rest ""this unfortunate sideshow.”

            “I have chosen this path to save taxpayer dollars and ensure my third term as attorney general is unburdened by unnecessary distractions,” Paxton said in a statement.

            The $3.3 million payout would not come from Paxton's own pocket but from state funds, which means it would still require approval by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature. 

            Settlement of the case, which Paxton's office fought in court for years, means he will avoid sitting for a civil deposition at a time when a corruption investigation by federal agents and prosecutors remains open. In turn, the attorney general's office agreed to remove an October 2020 news release from its website that decries Paxton's accusers and to issue the statement of contrition to former staffers David Maxwell, Ryan Vassar, Mark Penley and James Blake Brickman.

            “The whistleblowers sacrificed their jobs and have spent more than two years fighting for what is right,"" said Maxwell's lawyer, TJ Turner. Brickman was not part of the mediation with Paxton’s office but joined the settlement, attorney Tom Nesbitt said, after being asked to and negotiating “significant non-monetary terms.”

            The settlement also prevents Paxton from seeking the withdrawal of a 2021 appeals court ruling that state whistleblower law applies to the attorney general.

            The agreement does not include any provisions limiting the ability of Paxton’s accusers to make public statements or cooperate with federal investigators.

            The deal comes more than two years after Paxton’s staff accused him of misusing his office to help Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, whose business was also under federal investigation. The allegations centered on Paxton hiring an outside lawyer to investigate Paul’s claims of misconduct by the FBI.

            Paxton and Paul have broadly denied wrongdoing and neither has been charged with a federal crime. 

            In the wake of the revolt, an Associated Press investigation in September found that Paxton’s agency has come unmoored, with seasoned lawyers quitting over practices they say slant legal work, reward loyalists and drum out dissent.

            But the investigation, accusations and a separate 2015 securities fraud indictment for which Paxton has yet to face trial have done little to hurt him politically. He easily defeated challenger George P. Bush in a contested GOP primary last spring, went on to decisively beat his Democratic opponent and secure a third term in November and has filed a steady stream of legal challenges to the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden. 

            While swearing in Paxton to another four years on the job last month, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott described it as an easy call during the midterm elections to keep backing him. 

            “I supported Ken Paxton because I thought the way he was running the attorney general’s office was the right way to run the attorney general’s office,"" said Abbott.

The attorney general said he settled with the four who sued under Texas' whistleblower law to put to rest ""this unfortunate sideshow.”“I have chosen this path to save taxpayer dollars and ensure my third term as attorney general is unburdened by unnecessary distractions,” Paxton said in a statement.The $3.3 million payout would not come from Paxton's own pocket but from state funds, which means it would still require approval by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature.Settlement of the case, which Paxton's office fought in court for years, means he will avoid sitting for a civil deposition at a time when a corruption investigation by federal agents and prosecutors remains open. In turn, the attorney general's office agreed to remove an October 2020 news release from its website that decries Paxton's accusers and to issue the statement of contrition to former staffers David Maxwell, Ryan Vassar, Mark Penley and James Blake Brickman.“The whistleblowers sacrificed their jobs and have spent more than two years fighting for what is right,"" said Maxwell's lawyer, TJ Turner. Brickman was not part of the mediation with Paxton’s office but joined the settlement, attorney Tom Nesbitt said, after being asked to and negotiating “significant non-monetary terms.”The settlement also prevents Paxton from seeking the withdrawal of a 2021 appeals court ruling that state whistleblower law applies to the attorney general.The agreement does not include any provisions limiting the ability of Paxton’s accusers to make public statements or cooperate with federal investigators.The deal comes more than two years after Paxton’s staff accused him of misusing his office to help Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, whose business was also under federal investigation. The allegations centered on Paxton hiring an outside lawyer to investigate Paul’s claims of misconduct by the FBI.Paxton and Paul have broadly denied wrongdoing and neither has been charged with a federal crime.In the wake of the revolt, an Associated Press investigation in September found that Paxton’s agency has come unmoored, with seasoned lawyers quitting over practices they say slant legal work, reward loyalists and drum out dissent.But the investigation, accusations and a separate 2015 securities fraud indictment for which Paxton has yet to face trial have done little to hurt him politically. He easily defeated challenger George P. Bush in a contested GOP primary last spring, went on to decisively beat his Democratic opponent and secure a third term in November and has filed a steady stream of legal challenges to the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden.While swearing in Paxton to another four years on the job last month, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott described it as an easy call during the midterm elections to keep backing him.“I supported Ken Paxton because I thought the way he was running the attorney general’s office was the right way to run the attorney general’s office,"" said Abbott.___Associated Press reporter Paul J.

            Sunday, 6:30 p.m. EST, Fox

            
                FANDUEL SPORTSBOOK NFL LINE: Eagles by 1 1/2.











            AGAINST THE SPREAD: Eagles 10-9, Chiefs 7-11-1.

            SERIES RECORD: Chiefs lead 5-4.

            LAST MEETING: Chiefs defeated the Eagles 42-30 on Oct. 3, 2021, in Philadelphia. 

            LAST WEEK: Eagles defeated 49ers 31-7; Chiefs beat Bengals, 23-20.

            EAGLES OFFENSE: OVERALL (3), RUSH (5), PASS (9), SCORING (3).

            EAGLES DEFENSE: OVERALL (2), RUSH (T16), PASS (1), SCORING (8).

            CHIEFS DEFENSE: OVERALL (11), RUSH (8), PASS (18), SCORING (16)

            TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Eagles plus-8; Chiefs minus-3.

            EAGLES PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Jalen Hurts, 24, will try to become the fourth starting QB younger than 25 to win the Super Bowl. The Eagles went 16-1 when Hurts started, losing two games when he was sidelined by a injured shoulder late in the season. Hurts set an NFL record for QBs with 15 TD runs in the regular season and playoffs, while also ranking tied for first in the NFL this season with 11 TD passes on throws at least 20 yards downfield. 

            CHIEFS PLAYER TO WATCH: TE Travis Kelce is healthy after playing through the aftermath of back spasms against Cincinnati in the AFC title game. He still had seven catches for 78 yards and a score. The Chiefs lost three wide receivers in that game to injuries, and while JuJu Smith-Schuster (knee) and Kadarius Toney (ankle) will be available, Kelce is still the Chiefs' best pass-catching option. He caught a career-best 110 passes for 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns in the regular season. The only player with more playoff TD catches than Kelce's 15 is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.

            KEY MATCHUP: Eagles DE Haason Reddick vs. Chiefs RT Andrew Wylie. Reddick had 16 sacks in the regular season and 3 1/2 more so far in the playoffs as the dominant force on a strong defensive line for Philadelphia. He will mostly be matched up with Wylie, whose nine sacks allowed in the regular season were tied for fourth most in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus.

            KEY INJURIES: Both teams are relatively healthy. Eagles CB Avonte Maddox (toe) returned in a limited role in the NFC title game and should be full go in the Super Bowl. ... Chiefs CB L’Jarius Sneed left the AFC championship game with a concussion but has cleared protocol and is set to play Sunday.

            SERIES NOTES: The Chiefs have won all three meetings against the Eagles under Andy Reid, who also went 3-0 against Kansas City during his tenure as Philadelphia coach. ... Patrick Mahomes threw five TD passes with only six incomplete passes against the Eagles last season. Jalen Hurts threw for a career-high 387 yards that game for Philadelphia. 

            STATS AND STUFF: This marks the sixth time since the 1970 merger that the two teams with sole possession of the top two records in the regular season played in the Super Bowl. ... The Eagles are playing in their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. They lost their first two trips and won it all in the 2017 season against New England. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806796,Judge rejects bid to nullify Boeing deal over Max crashes,"DALLAS (AP) — A federal judge has rejected an effort by families of passengers who died in Boeing 737 Max crashes to reopen an agreement that allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution for fraud in how it won regulatory approval for the plane.

            District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth said that he has sympathy for families of the 346 people who died in two Max crashes, but that federal law doesn't give courts the power to oversee agreements that prosecutors make with defendants.

            The court, O'Connor wrote in a decision dated Thursday, “has no occasion to address whether the (settlement) is in fact grossly incommensurate with Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.”











            The ruling appears to end an effort by family members of some passengers to nullify a January 2021 agreement that Boeing struck with the Justice Department. Boeing agreed to pay a $244 million fine as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in which the government agreed not to prosecute Boeing on a felony fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the Max.

            Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, said they plan to appeal the ruling to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 

            “Boeing and DOJ crafted an illegal and secret plea deal without any chance for the families to confer about it, which is required by the Crime Victims Rights Act,"" Cassell said in a prepared statement. ""We are optimistic our appeal will vindicate the families’ rights in this case and ensure that never again are deals like this one reached secretly and without victim involvement.”

            Boeing did not immediately comment.

            O'Connor ruled in October that the families met the definition of crime victims and the Justice Department should have told them about the negotiations. That led to his decision to order Boeing to stand for arraignment. 

            The Justice Department, like Boeing, felt that the judge should not reopen the settlement.

            At the Jan. 26 hearing, Boeing pleaded not guilty to fraud, and more than a dozen family members gave emotional testimony about their grief and outrage at Boeing's actions. Some called for Boeing executives to be prosecuted. 

            Boeing was charged with misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about a key flight-control system on the Max that was implicated in a 2018 crash in Indonesia and a 2019 crash in Ethiopia. Boeing cast blame on two former test pilots, but critics said the low-level employees were scapegoats for corporate wrongdoing.

            Sales of the Max stopped after the crashes and a worldwide grounding. Orders have rebounded more recently, however, and the Max is Boeing's best-selling plane. The company announced last month that it will open a fourth Max assembly line late next year because of strong demand.DALLAS (AP) — A federal judge has rejected an effort by families of passengers who died in Boeing 737 Max crashes to reopen an agreement that allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution for fraud in how it won regulatory approval for the plane.District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth said that he has sympathy for families of the 346 people who died in two Max crashes, but that federal law doesn't give courts the power to oversee agreements that prosecutors make with defendants.The court, O'Connor wrote in a decision dated Thursday, “has no occasion to address whether the (settlement) is in fact grossly incommensurate with Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.”The ruling appears to end an effort by family members of some passengers to nullify a January 2021 agreement that Boeing struck with the Justice Department.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806797,"Maryland manhunt ends with arrest in woods, 2 officers shot","FALLSTON, Md. (AP) — A Maryland man, whose father called law enforcement to report him suicidal, was taken into custody early Friday, ending a 39-hour manhunt during which he wounded two Baltimore County police officers in separate shootings and holed up in a wooded area behind a suburban shopping center, authorities said. 

            David Linthicum, 24, was already on the run when he shot the second officer, a detective, and stole his department-issued vehicle Thursday night, police said. 

            Officers eventually stopped Linthicum about 20 miles away using spike strips. From there, Linthicum fled into the woods but was surrounded by officers from multiple law enforcement agencies, with a helicopter illuminating the scene from above. Eight hours later and without further injury, they had him in handcuffs, authorities said.











            The ordeal began when police responded to a call about a person in distress at Linthicum’s Baltimore County home Wednesday afternoon. When an officer arrived, Linthicum’s father told the officer his son was suicidal. Together, they walked downstairs to Linthicum’s room in the basement, according to charging documents. 

            “As they entered the bedroom, they saw David Linthicum laying on his bed and holding a high-powered rifle,” the documents say. 

            Linthicum fired about 15 rounds toward the officer and his father, who both “fled the residence to seek cover from any further gunshots,” according to police. The officer realized he had been struck and was transported to a hospital; Linthicum fled the scene.

            After receiving treatment, the officer was discharged from the hospital later that night.

            Meanwhile, federal and state law enforcement joined the manhunt that would continue throughout the following day and night as Linthicum evaded capture.

            Around 9:20 p.m. Thursday, authorities warned residents to shelter in place in the area surrounding Linthicum’s home, saying he had been spotted nearby. 

            In an update Friday afternoon, officials with the Baltimore County Police Department said the detective, who was patrolling the area in connection with the manhunt, saw Linthicum walking along a road near his house. 

            When the detective exited his unmarked pickup truck and approached the suspect on foot, Linthicum raised a rifle and pulled the trigger, firing numerous rounds and striking the officer multiple times, according to charging documents. The officer returned fire as Linthicum stole the truck and drove away, the documents say. 

            The detective suffered gunshot wounds to his face, torso, leg and arms, police wrote. He had been wearing a ballistic vest and was in stable condition as of Friday morning, Interim Baltimore County Police Chief Dennis Delp said during a news conference.

            “He’s going to need a significant amount of reconstruction,” said Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician in chief at the University of Maryland Medical System’s Shock Trauma Center, who told reporters outside the hospital Thursday night that the detective was on life-support. “He’ll be with us for a while.”

            In a statement released Friday afternoon, Gov. Wes Moore asked Marylanders to keep the injured officer in their thoughts. 

            “He and his fellow officers are true heroes, who unselfishly put their lives on the line to protect Marylanders,” Moore said. “We are grateful to have restored peace in the communities affected and vow to bring this individual to justice.”

            Once Linthicum was surrounded in the woods Thursday night, officers used several “less lethal” tactics to encourage him to surrender, including flash bangs. He tried to hide in a rocky area, but officers used a helicopter and drones to locate him before he was finally captured at around 5:45 a.m. Friday, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said. 

            “Eventually it culminated in our personnel going hands-on with him and physically, after some resistance, being able to place him into custody,” Gahler said.

            He said Linthicum was intermittently communicating with officers during the standoff, but much of what he said was irrelevant to the situation at hand. For example, in response to the flash bangs, Linthicum made a comment about how much he likes fireworks, Gahler said.

            Linthicum “sustained no injuries as a result of his arrest,” but was sent for a medical review “out of an abundance of caution,” the sheriff said. 

            He was later transferred into Baltimore County Police custody, officials announced Friday afternoon. 

            “Our community is safer with this individual in custody where he belongs,” Gahler added at a news conference. 

            Gahler said police found a firearm in the recovered vehicle and Linthicum had ammunition on him when he was arrested. The area was being searched in case he dropped another firearm in the woods.

            Linthicum has been charged with 11 total offenses, including armed carjacking and three counts of attempted first-degree murder.

            Harford County schools in the Fallston area were closed Friday. Some Baltimore County schools were also closed Thursday while the manhunt was underway.

            Court records show Linthicum pleaded guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute in 2019 and received probation before judgment. Officials said there was no immediate indication drugs were involved in the latest crimes.

            A person who answered the phone Friday morning at a number listed under Linthicum’s father’s name declined to comment.

The officer realized he had been struck and was transported to a hospital; Linthicum fled the scene.After receiving treatment, the officer was discharged from the hospital later that night.Meanwhile, federal and state law enforcement joined the manhunt that would continue throughout the following day and night as Linthicum evaded capture.Around 9:20 p.m. Thursday, authorities warned residents to shelter in place in the area surrounding Linthicum’s home, saying he had been spotted nearby.In an update Friday afternoon, officials with the Baltimore County Police Department said the detective, who was patrolling the area in connection with the manhunt, saw Linthicum walking along a road near his house.When the detective exited his unmarked pickup truck and approached the suspect on foot, Linthicum raised a rifle and pulled the trigger, firing numerous rounds and striking the officer multiple times, according to charging documents. The officer returned fire as Linthicum stole the truck and drove away, the documents say.The detective suffered gunshot wounds to his face, torso, leg and arms, police wrote. He had been wearing a ballistic vest and was in stable condition as of Friday morning, Interim Baltimore County Police Chief Dennis Delp said during a news conference.“He’s going to need a significant amount of reconstruction,” said Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician in chief at the University of Maryland Medical System’s Shock Trauma Center, who told reporters outside the hospital Thursday night that the detective was on life-support. “He’ll be with us for a while.”In a statement released Friday afternoon, Gov. Wes Moore asked Marylanders to keep the injured officer in their thoughts.“He and his fellow officers are true heroes, who unselfishly put their lives on the line to protect Marylanders,” Moore said. “We are grateful to have restored peace in the communities affected and vow to bring this individual to justice.”Once Linthicum was surrounded in the woods Thursday night, officers used several “less lethal” tactics to encourage him to surrender, including flash bangs. He tried to hide in a rocky area, but officers used a helicopter and drones to locate him before he was finally captured at around 5:45 a.m. Friday, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said.“Eventually it culminated in our personnel going hands-on with him and physically, after some resistance, being able to place him into custody,” Gahler said.He said Linthicum was intermittently communicating with officers during the standoff, but much of what he said was irrelevant to the situation at hand. For example, in response to the flash bangs, Linthicum made a comment about how much he likes fireworks, Gahler said.Linthicum “sustained no injuries as a result of his arrest,” but was sent for a medical review “out of an abundance of caution,” the sheriff said.He was later transferred into Baltimore County Police custody, officials announced Friday afternoon.“Our community is safer with this individual in custody where he belongs,” Gahler added at a news conference.Gahler said police found a firearm in the recovered vehicle and Linthicum had ammunition on him when he was arrested. The area was being searched in case he dropped another firearm in the woods.Linthicum has been charged with 11 total offenses, including armed carjacking and three counts of attempted first-degree murder.Harford County schools in the Fallston area were closed Friday. Some Baltimore County schools were also closed Thursday while the manhunt was underway.Court records show Linthicum pleaded guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute in 2019 and received probation before judgment. Officials said there was no immediate indication drugs were involved in the latest crimes.A person who answered the phone Friday morning at a number listed under Linthicum’s father’s name declined to comment.___Skene reported from Baltimore.",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806798,Here’s how to legally bet on the Super Bowl,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Sports betting is now legal in two-thirds of the country, and more Americans than ever before have an opportunity to place a legal bet on Sunday’s Super Bowl.

            With sports betting ads blitzing the airwaves with come-ons and promotions, things might be a bit confusing, especially for first-time bettors or those who don’t fully understand how things work.

            Here is a guide to betting on the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. We will deal here only with legal options from sportsbooks approved and regulated by government authorities in the U.S.











            WHAT IS A POINT SPREAD? OVER/UNDER WHAT?

            Two of the most popular bets are on the point spread (the number of points by which a team must win the game in order for the bet to be a winner) and the total, also known as the over/under (the total number of points scored by both teams).

            Contrary to popular belief, the point spread is not a consensus on how many points oddsmakers think one team will win by. Rather, it is a number designed to generate as close to an equal number of bets on both sides as possible. That way, the oddsmakers are guaranteed a profit through a cut of the action, called the vigorish, or “vig.” (Many books, hoping to sound less wiseguy-ish, call it “the price.”) Most sportsbooks will keep 10% or more of a winning bet before paying you the rest, but they keep 100% of all losing bets. Prices on Super Bowl bets can vary significantly, so it pays to shop around to get the lowest price you can before making a bet.

            Beating the spread is known as “covering.” For the Eagles to cover their spread of 1.5 points, they must win the game by 2 or more points. Conversely, underdog Kansas City can cover by either winning the game outright, or losing by less than 2 points. (Odds and point totals are as of Friday from FanDuel, the official odds provider for The Associated Press.) The spread can change up until kickoff — and even afterward, during live betting, we'll get to that later — but the number locks in once you make a bet.

            A spread with a whole number, say, 2 points, opens the opportunity for what's called a “push"" if the winning margin ties. You don't win anything but you get your original bet refunded. This also applies to other bets, which is why most of them involve a fraction, like 44.5 yards or 48.5 points.

            Don’t want to bother with points and just pick the winner? That’s called the money line. A bet on the Eagles to just win the game, regardless of the score, is somewhat less profitable than using a point spread. You will have to bet $122 of your own money to win $100. (Of course you get your original $122 back as part of the $222 payout.) A money line bet on Kansas City, however, will win $104 on a $100 bet, for a total payout of $204.

            If you believe the game will be a high-scoring affair, you might want to make a bet on the total, currently 50.5 points. That means if you bet the over, both teams combined must score at least 51 points for your bet to win. If it doesn’t, people who bet the under will win.

            CAN I MAKE MY OWN ODDS?

            Yes. But that can be costly. You can pick your own spread or total — an alternate — to improve your chance of winning, but the farther your pick deviates from the sportsbook’s number, the less it will pay if you win. (You also can choose a harder-to-reach number for a higher potential payout, such as betting that the Chiefs will win by 20 points, but that’s a very risky strategy.) So if all you want to do is bet Kansas City with the point spread, but you want to get more points than the 1.5 currently being offered, you can bet on an alternate spread, such as Kansas City getting 3.5 points. That's helpful if you think the game might be decided by a 3-point field goal, and you want an extra cushion. But because you're grabbing better odds for yourself, the bet is a more costly one: You must put up $166 of your own money to win $100 in that case. Additional bets can be tacked on as part of so-called same-game parlays, which are combinations of bets on the same game. But the more combined outcomes you bet on, the greater the likelihood that at least one of them will lose, sending your entire parlay down in flames.

            WHAT ELSE CAN I BET ON?

            If this sounds like a lot to take in, there are much simpler ways to bet on the game, including some aimed at the casual fan or even someone who knows nothing at all about football. A perennial favorite is betting on the coin flip at the start of the game to determine which team can choose to get the ball first. There are only two choices: heads or tails. You can even bet on which color of Gatorade the winning coach will be doused in at the game’s conclusion. Seriously.

            This is what’s called a proposition or “prop” bet. It involves betting on whether a particular event will or won’t happen during the game, and there is a vast array to choose from. They can be disarmingly simple, such as guessing which team will get the ball first, whether the first score of the game will be a touchdown or a field goal, and whether or not the game will go into overtime.

            Prop bets based on a particular player’s performance are always popular during the Super Bowl. You can bet on whether Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will pass for over or under 294.5 yards, how many catches his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, will have (over or under 7.5) or how many touchdown passes Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will throw.

            CAN I BET WHILE THE GAME IS BEING PLAYED?

            People with online sportsbook accounts can bet on ever-changing outcome odds as the game is being played; live-betting is the fastest-growing segment of sports betting. For instance, the game starts with the Eagles favored by 1.5 points, but say Kansas City scores two quick touchdowns to take a 14-0 lead. The in-game odds will change to reflect the current situation, and you can now bet on whether Kansas City will win by 14 points, or whether the Eagles will lose by less than that. Or say the Chiefs' top receiving weapon Kelce is being shut down by Eagles defenders, and appears unlikely to eclipse his pregame receiving yards total of 79.5 yards. Bettors can wager on whether he will or won’t eclipse a lower number.

            A word of caution, though: The number of these in-game bets and the rapidity with which odds change can be dangerous for those with a gambling problem, and many experts fear they could even tip a casual gambler toward becoming one with a problem. Some good advice: Set a budget in advance of money you can afford to lose, and stick to it. Look at betting on the game as a form of entertainment and not as a way to gain money that you need. If things head south, don’t make additional bets to try to win back what you’ve lost. This is one of the quickest ways gamblers dig themselves a deep hole.

            WHAT IF I THINK I MIGHT HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM?

            Betting on the Super Bowl is supposed to be fun, and for most people, it is. But for others, compulsive gambling is a serious problem. For help, call 800-GAMBLER.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806800,'Breaking Bad' star praises streaming ahead of Super Bowl ad,"GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) — It’s been nearly a decade since “Breaking Bad” was on the air. But according to Aaron Paul, the iconic series is still “one of those gifts that just keeps on keeps on giving,” thanks to steaming services that allow it to continue to find new fans.

            “A lot of these kids that were too young to watch the show when their parents were watching it, they are now old enough to watch. And so, they’re diving in,” Paul said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.

            His latest project with former co-star Bryan Cranston is a “Breaking Bad”-inspired ad for the chip company PopCorners that will air during this weekend’s Super Bowl.











            “The team’s back and pushing a more viable legal product this time,” Paul laughed. “It’s an embarrassment of riches. It’s so hard to get a job in this industry. And then to get one that you really love, but one that just keeps on giving back.”

            “Breaking Bad,” which aired on AMC for five seasons, holds the Guinness World Record for the critically highest-rated TV series ever. In addition to the longevity it has sustained from subsequent projects in the show’s franchise, such as “Better Call Saul,” Paul thinks “Breaking Bad” continues to exist in the zeitgeist thanks to its availability on Netflix.

            “These shows live, hopefully, forever on these platforms,” Paul said. “New people are getting introduced to it all the time and it’s just so easy to find.”

            His comments came soon after HBO pulled the plug on “Westworld,” which Paul starred in, and removed the Emmy-winning sci-fi drama entirely from its streaming platform, HBO Max.

            “It was hard because that’s our family, our film family. And so it’s rough not to be able to say a proper goodbye,” Paul said of the move.

            “Westworld” received more than 50 Emmy nominations and won nine awards from the TV academy.

            Warner Bros.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806801,'Everybody's tired': South Dakota tribe sues US over crime,"Holly Wilson had just left to pick up soda for a steak dinner for her nine grandchildren last May, when a barrage of bullets was fired into her home on the largest Native American reservation in South Dakota. 

            Her 6-year-old grandson, Logan Warrior Goings, jumped from the family's loveseat and raced across the room to his grandfather — and was shot in the head. It took at least 15 minutes for a single tribal law enforcement officer to arrive, but by then, the drive-by shooters were gone, and Logan — a “kind and gentle” boy who loved Xbox and his Siamese cat, Simon — was dead. 

            “He was the sweetest little boy,” said Wilson, 62. “He was so helpful for grandma. He was my best partner.” 











            Months later, a father and son who live near Wilson on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe, were shot and killed by an intruder, and their bodies weren't found for six days, she said. Just a few nights ago, Wilson's oldest son was held at gunpoint in his home. 

            These types of crimes have become increasingly common on the 5,400-square-mile (14,000-square-kilometer) reservation. Only 33 officers and eight criminal investigators are responsible for over 100,000 emergency calls each year across the reservation, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut, tribal officials said. The officers and investigators are all federally funded — and the tribe says it's just not enough.

            The tribe sued the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in July, alleging the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligations nor its trust responsibility by failing to provide adequate law enforcement to address the “public safety crisis” on the reservation. The federal government countered in court documents that the tribe can't prove treaties force the U.S. to provide the tribe with its “preferred level of staffing or funding for law enforcement.” After two days of court proceedings this week, a judge said he would take the case under advisement.

            “We need change. Everybody’s tired of the same old talk. It’s all talk, talk, talk every year after year, and our people have suffered for decades,” Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out told The Associated Press. “We believe now is the time to take that stand.” 

            The federal government has a trust duty to Indigenous nations and has made promises to tribes under treaty agreements, which should be read liberally and in favor of Native American tribes, explained Robert Miller, law professor at Arizona State University and an enrolled citizen of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe in Oklahoma. 

            “If federal law enforcement is woefully weak, which it is on most reservations, it’s not carrying out its duty as the trustee, as the guardian of Indian nations,” he said. 

            Indigenous nations have increasingly advocated for treaty rights, including hunting, fishing and education, in the courtroom, with some success. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court made its landmark McGirt decision, ruling that a large portion of eastern Oklahoma, promised in treaties to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, would remain a reservation.

            In court documents in this case, the Oglala Sioux Tribe points to treaties such as the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which states that if someone commits a crime against Native Americans, the U.S. will “proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.”

            Star Comes Out said he hopes Oglala Sioux’s lawsuit, which was filed just days after the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana filed a similar one, will help to serve as an example for other tribes in the Great Plains and beyond who are facing similar situations. 

            The South Dakota reservation, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Rapid City, is located between the Nebraska border and the Bakken oil fields.

            The location has made it convenient for both human and drug trafficking, explained Patricia Marks, an attorney with the tribe, while its lack of police has meant it's known as a “lawless area.” 

            “We’ve had a radical increase in guns, gun violence,” she said. “We’ve had a radical increase in hard narcotics. It is heroin. It’s fentanyl. It’s meth. It is things that are life threatening.” 

            Between January and June 2022, tribal law enforcement received 285 reports of missing persons, 308 gun-related calls and 49 reports of rape, Oglala Sioux officials said. There are typically only five tribal officers on any given shift, and response time for weapon-related calls can be anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour, Marks said. 

            In 2020, there were 155 more violent crimes reported by the Oglala Sioux tribal law enforcement compared to 2017, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 

            Criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country is complicated and depends on whether the suspect, victim or both are Native American, and where the crime occurs. 

            The federal government, tribes and counties have tried to bolster public safety on reservations — where, in some locations, Native women are killed at a rate more than 10 times the national average — with approaches that include cross-commissioning agreements, expanding sentencing authority for tribes and programs that allow tribal prosecutors to try cases in federal court. 

            The landmark Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, for example, expanded sentencing authority of tribal courts under certain conditions.

            The Justice Department has also worked to increase funding given to tribes to address crime, including last year when officials announced it would award over $246 million in grants to Native communities to improve public safety and help crime victims. 

            But the tribe says none of this has been enough. 

            On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the FBI has jurisdiction over a set of major crimes. But its closest office is in Rapid City, so it can take more than two hours for agents to arrive, explained Marks.

            “For all practical purposes, it is the tribal police who are the first responders regardless of the type of crime,” she said. “They’re the ones that have to get out there and answer the call.""

            The tribe would need over 140 more police officers on the reservation to fight the rampant crime, according to court documents.

            JoAnn Sierra, 79, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said two of her sons and two of her grandsons were killed on or near the reservation. The most recent case involved her grandson, Justin Little Hawk, 40, who in November 2020 was ambushed by a man he did not recognize while driving two of Sierra’s teenage grandchildren, she said. 

            The man got in the backseat of Sierra’s car and shot Little Hawk after the other grandchildren ran out. He died shortly before Christmas, and the person responsible was never convicted, Sierra said. 

            “It just makes me feel like I’m lost … Why does this have to happen here?"" Sierra asked. ""Why didn’t I move?” 

            Since the death of Logan, who was given the Lakota name Petá Zi Hoksila, meaning Yellow Fire Boy, Wilson has plastered the reservation with signs that say things like, “Justice for Logan” and “Who killed grandma’s baby?” in hopes of bringing attention to his death. 

            She said after Logan was shot, she waited months to hear from the FBI, and when she tried to talk with tribal law enforcement, they were limited in what they could say due to jurisdictional issues. 

            Wilson said she believes if there had been more law enforcement responding quickly, her grandson’s case could have been solved. 

            “It’s sad that we had to take those measures as a tribe to get the help that should have been there,"" she said through tears. ""It should have been there according to the treaties. And yet we all had to live like this. Lose people; lose loved ones.” 

            ___

            Associated Press writer Felicia Fonseca contributed from Flagstaff, Arizona.Holly Wilson had just left to pick up soda for a steak dinner for her nine grandchildren last May, when a barrage of bullets was fired into her home on the largest Native American reservation in South Dakota.Her 6-year-old grandson, Logan Warrior Goings, jumped from the family's loveseat and raced across the room to his grandfather — and was shot in the head. It took at least 15 minutes for a single tribal law enforcement officer to arrive, but by then, the drive-by shooters were gone, and Logan — a “kind and gentle” boy who loved Xbox and his Siamese cat, Simon — was dead.“He was the sweetest little boy,” said Wilson, 62. “He was so helpful for grandma. He was my best partner.”Months later, a father and son who live near Wilson on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe, were shot and killed by an intruder, and their bodies weren't found for six days, she said. Just a few nights ago, Wilson's oldest son was held at gunpoint in his home.These types of crimes have become increasingly common on the 5,400-square-mile (14,000-square-kilometer) reservation. Only 33 officers and eight criminal investigators are responsible for over 100,000 emergency calls each year across the reservation, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut, tribal officials said. The officers and investigators are all federally funded — and the tribe says it's just not enough.The tribe sued the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in July, alleging the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligations nor its trust responsibility by failing to provide adequate law enforcement to address the “public safety crisis” on the reservation. The federal government countered in court documents that the tribe can't prove treaties force the U.S. to provide the tribe with its “preferred level of staffing or funding for law enforcement.” After two days of court proceedings this week, a judge said he would take the case under advisement.“We need change. Everybody’s tired of the same old talk. It’s all talk, talk, talk every year after year, and our people have suffered for decades,” Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out told The Associated Press. “We believe now is the time to take that stand.”The federal government has a trust duty to Indigenous nations and has made promises to tribes under treaty agreements, which should be read liberally and in favor of Native American tribes, explained Robert Miller, law professor at Arizona State University and an enrolled citizen of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe in Oklahoma.“If federal law enforcement is woefully weak, which it is on most reservations, it’s not carrying out its duty as the trustee, as the guardian of Indian nations,” he said.Indigenous nations have increasingly advocated for treaty rights, including hunting, fishing and education, in the courtroom, with some success. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court made its landmark McGirt decision, ruling that a large portion of eastern Oklahoma, promised in treaties to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, would remain a reservation.In court documents in this case, the Oglala Sioux Tribe points to treaties such as the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which states that if someone commits a crime against Native Americans, the U.S. will “proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.”Star Comes Out said he hopes Oglala Sioux’s lawsuit, which was filed just days after the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana filed a similar one, will help to serve as an example for other tribes in the Great Plains and beyond who are facing similar situations.The South Dakota reservation, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Rapid City, is located between the Nebraska border and the Bakken oil fields.The location has made it convenient for both human and drug trafficking, explained Patricia Marks, an attorney with the tribe, while its lack of police has meant it's known as a “lawless area.”“We’ve had a radical increase in guns, gun violence,” she said. “We’ve had a radical increase in hard narcotics. It is heroin. It’s fentanyl. It’s meth. It is things that are life threatening.”Between January and June 2022, tribal law enforcement received 285 reports of missing persons, 308 gun-related calls and 49 reports of rape, Oglala Sioux officials said. There are typically only five tribal officers on any given shift, and response time for weapon-related calls can be anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour, Marks said.In 2020, there were 155 more violent crimes reported by the Oglala Sioux tribal law enforcement compared to 2017, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country is complicated and depends on whether the suspect, victim or both are Native American, and where the crime occurs.The federal government, tribes and counties have tried to bolster public safety on reservations — where, in some locations, Native women are killed at a rate more than 10 times the national average — with approaches that include cross-commissioning agreements, expanding sentencing authority for tribes and programs that allow tribal prosecutors to try cases in federal court.The landmark Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, for example, expanded sentencing authority of tribal courts under certain conditions.The Justice Department has also worked to increase funding given to tribes to address crime, including last year when officials announced it would award over $246 million in grants to Native communities to improve public safety and help crime victims.But the tribe says none of this has been enough.On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the FBI has jurisdiction over a set of major crimes. But its closest office is in Rapid City, so it can take more than two hours for agents to arrive, explained Marks.“For all practical purposes, it is the tribal police who are the first responders regardless of the type of crime,” she said. “They’re the ones that have to get out there and answer the call.""The tribe would need over 140 more police officers on the reservation to fight the rampant crime, according to court documents.JoAnn Sierra, 79, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said two of her sons and two of her grandsons were killed on or near the reservation. The most recent case involved her grandson, Justin Little Hawk, 40, who in November 2020 was ambushed by a man he did not recognize while driving two of Sierra’s teenage grandchildren, she said.The man got in the backseat of Sierra’s car and shot Little Hawk after the other grandchildren ran out. He died shortly before Christmas, and the person responsible was never convicted, Sierra said.“It just makes me feel like I’m lost … Why does this have to happen here?"" Sierra asked. ""Why didn’t I move?”Since the death of Logan, who was given the Lakota name Petá Zi Hoksila, meaning Yellow Fire Boy, Wilson has plastered the reservation with signs that say things like, “Justice for Logan” and “Who killed grandma’s baby?” in hopes of bringing attention to his death.She said after Logan was shot, she waited months to hear from the FBI, and when she tried to talk with tribal law enforcement, they were limited in what they could say due to jurisdictional issues.Wilson said she believes if there had been more law enforcement responding quickly, her grandson’s case could have been solved.“It’s sad that we had to take those measures as a tribe to get the help that should have been there,"" she said through tears.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806802,"US sanctions Bulgarian officials, firms for corruption","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department on Friday announced sanctions on five current and former Bulgarian officials, as well as five entities accused of illicit personal gain, undermining the country’s democratic institutions and perpetuating “corrosive dependence on Russian energy sources.”

            Brian Nelson, treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the U.S. “supports our NATO ally Bulgaria in its fight against both entrenched corruption and Russian influence, which undermine democratic institutions.”

            “Corruption robs the Bulgarian people of hundreds of millions of dollars and hinders investment and economic growth in the country,” he said. 











            Those sanctioned include Rumen Stoyanov Ovcharov, a Bulgarian member of parliament; Vladislav Ivanov Goranov, a former Bulgarian politician; Aleksandar Hristov Nikolov, a former CEO and deputy director of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, Bulgaria’s sole nuclear power plant owned by the government, and Ivan Kirov Genov, a former CEO of KNPP and former Bulgarian politician.

            In addition, the State Department also imposed visa restrictions on Ovcharov, Nikolov and Goranov for involvement in significant corruption, which will impact their immediate family members making them ineligible for entry into the United States.

            The Biden administration relies on sanctions authority from a Donald Trump-era executive order that implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act that “targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806803,Andy Reid aims to lead Chiefs past former team in Super Bowl,"PHOENIX (AP) — Andy Reid already proved he can win the big game in Kansas City after coming up short several times throughout his 14 seasons in Philadelphia.

            Leading the Chiefs to a victory over the Eagles in the Super Bowl on Sunday would further cement his Hall of Fame credentials and add to his legacy. 

            “Listen, I had 14 great years there,” Reid said about Philadelphia, where he won more games than any coach in franchise history. “I loved every minute of it. It’s a great organization. I still am close with the people there. It was great to see the kids that we had drafted that are now these veteran players — All-Pro players — on that team. I had the chance to give them a hug, and now we go our separate ways and get ready to play.” 











            
                Reid, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs (16-3) are aiming to win their second Super Bowl championship in four seasons. They beat the San Francisco 49ers three years ago and lost to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season.

            
                Jalen Hurts and the Eagles (16-3) present a tough challenge. They have a dynamic offense and a stingy defense with both units being powered by dominant lines.

            The matchup is filled with intriguing storylines beyond Reid facing his former team. Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles All-Pro center Jason Kelce will become the first brothers to play each other in the Super Bowl. It’ll be the first Super Bowl with two Black starting QBs. Also, Reid didn’t retain now-Eagles coach Nick Sirianni when he was an assistant in Kansas City in 2013.

            All that filled stories, created content and increased the hype leading into the game.

            But, on the field, this is a true matchup of heavyweights. It’s the first time the NFL’s two No. 1 seeds are here since the Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33 to capture their first Lombardi Trophy five years ago.

            The teams are evenly matched. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring offense and total yards. The Eagles were third overall in both categories. The Eagles have an edge on defense with the No. 2 ranked unit while the Chiefs are 11th.

            Philly’s defense is so nasty Mahomes couldn’t even point to one standout area.

            “They’re great everywhere,” Mahomes said. “It’s hard to pick one. I’d probably say the defensive line because they’re on an historic sack rate, and the way they’re able to get to the quarterback. Everybody knows that everything starts up front. So that’ll be a great challenge for our offensive line to try to do what they can in the run game and pass game of protecting and run-blocking. But they got great DBs, great linebackers.”

            Mahomes and Hurts finished 1-2 in voting for the AP NFL MVP. Both have been dealing with injuries. Mahomes played the AFC championship game with a badly sprained ankle. Hurts missed two games late in the season with a shoulder injury.

            They’ll go all-out one more time and have plenty of time to rest in the offseason. Whichever QB gets better protection will likely determine the winner.

            “If you slip up, he can make you pay with his legs, his arm, anyway he can,” Chiefs linebacker Willie Gay said. “We just have to approach it as he’s a weapon. This week we know he’s a big key for us. We have to slow him down.” 

            Mahomes can do it all, too. He won his second MVP award by a landslide, taking 48 of 50 first-place votes. The extra week off has helped his ankle heal so the Eagles will have to be wary of his ability to create plays with his legs.

            “He’s one of the quarterbacks in the league that I haven’t been able to sack yet or haven’t gotten to yet,” said Eagles edge rusher Haason Reddick, who was a one-man wrecking crew in the NFC title game against the 49ers. “If I’m able to get to him and I get him in the Super Bowl, that’s going to be historic for me.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806804,Farrell given more control to unlock England backs vs Italy,"LONDON (AP) — England under new management did not have an auspicious start.

            And after England was overtaken by Scotland 29-23 last Saturday at Twickenham to open the Six Nations, new coach Steve Borthwick wasn't slow with excuses.

            Defeat was the fault of his predecessor and mentor Eddie Jones.











            After wanting a no-excuses environment, Borthwick blamed Jones for leaving him a squad that “weren't good at anything.” Borthwick's data on tier one teams showed England had the worst scrum and one of the slowest ruck clearances. The players, he added, were muddled about the game plan when things go wrong.

            And, yet, England led Scotland 20-12 after halftime, and 23-22 with seven minutes to go.

            The scrum got better through the game, and the attack dominated before and after halftime. England's three tries were well constructed.

            The trouble was Scotland punched in four tries, and a big part of the fault in the first three was England captain Owen Farrell, fresh off a four-week suspension.

            Farrell's deliberate targeting of Finn Russell gave Scotland the initial break that led to the opening Huw Jones try. Farrell had the first crack at Duhan van der Merwe in his breakout run and didn't take it. And Farrell miscommunicated with Marcus Smith so both were missing when Ben White began Scotland's comeback.

            But when the malfunctioning Smith-Farrell playmaking axis was broken up by Borthwick this week, Farrell survived to face Italy on Sunday at Twickenham and Smith didn't.

            That was no surprise. Farrell drives England, is captain and goalkicker, and been playing out of position. He's restored to flyhalf for the first time in two years, with Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade outside him. Smith is on the bench.

            “Owen's ability to manage a game and dictate the game and where and how it should be played is very, very good,” Borthwick says. ""He's also a very good defender in that channel and in the last couple of years at Saracens his ball movement has really developed.

            “What we have with the combination of Owen, Ollie and Henry is right and left-footed kickers, carrying ability and distribution. There's a great blend of strengths there.”

            The Italy game is normally when England makes sweeping changes, giving starts to reserves and squad players. It's never hurt England because it has never lost to Italy. Only four changes mark the side this time, one of them moving Farrell from 12 to 10, because Borthwick is trying to get England to play his way, and Italy has earned their respect.

            The Azzurri could have, and maybe should have, beaten France last Sunday in Rome. They gave France a 19-6 head start and fought back to lead 24-22 going into the last quarter. France barely prevailed 29-24 and finished with relief.

            Italy coach Kieran Crowley has favored continuity. Edoardo Padovani was on the wing because he was a little more physical than Pierre Bruno, who was in the reserves.

            And Crowley cunningly decided England-based forwards Marco Riccioni and Jake Polledri were ready to face their clubmates after recovering from career-threatening knee injuries while on Italy duty. Both World Cup players have made remarkable comebacks.

            Riccioni tore knee ligaments in November 2021 and resumed at Saracens in October. Polledri tore up his left leg in November 2020 and returned for Gloucester in September.

            “They have had the right time to learn our style and get to a good level of form,” Crowley says. ”Riccioni will play immediately, Polledri will do it in the second half.”

            Italy remains a heavy underdog at Twickenham, and shouldn't be able to surprise England after the France result. But after an auspicious start, it is full of self-belief.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806816,Brazil denies deal to sign Real Madrid's Ancelotti,"SAO PAULO (AP) — The Brazilian Football Confederation denied media reports on Friday that Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti agreed to become the new national coach.

            Also, Ancelotti said he intends to see out his Madrid contract, which has more than a year left.

            The Brazil job has been vacant since December when Tite stood down after Brazil was eliminated in the World Cup quarterfinals by Croatia.











            Earlier Friday, media in Brazil said the CBF and Ancelotti agreed on a three-year deal that was yet to be signed.

            But the CBF said in a statement the report was not true and president Ednaldo Rodrigues “is dealing with the matter in a transparent way.” The statement added the new coach “will be announced in the timely moment.”

            Ancelotti is in Morocco, where his team plays the Club World Cup final on Saturday against Saudi champion Al-Hilal.

            Ancelotti is contracted to Real Madrid to the end of the 2023-24 season. He told a news conference on Friday he intends to fulfil his obligations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806818,EPA awards $1B to clean up 22 toxic waste sites nationwide,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Projects to clean up 22 toxic waste sites across the country will receive $1 billion from the federal Superfund program to help clear a backlog of hazardous sites such as landfills, mines and manufacturing facilities, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.

            The money is the second installment in $3.5 billion appropriated under the 2021 infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden. Sites targeted for cleanup include a lead-contaminated neighborhood on Atlanta’s Westside and a former dry cleaning solvents distributor in Tampa, Florida.

            The money also will be used to speed cleanup of 100 ongoing Superfund projects across the United States, the EPA said. The agency has vowed to clear a longtime backlog in the Superfund program, which was established in 1980 to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. The program has languished for years because of a lack of funding.











            The EPA announced an initial $1 billion in funding from the infrastructure law in December 2021. 

            While the agency is moving faster to clean up contaminated sites in communities across the country, “our work is not yet finished,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Friday. “We’re continuing to build on this momentum to ensure that communities living near many of the most serious uncontrolled or abandoned releases of contamination finally get the investments and protections they deserve.”

             Of the new cleanup sites announced on Friday, 60% are in low-income or minority communities that are chronically over-polluted, Regan said.

            Thousands of contaminated sites exist across the country as a result of hazardous waste being dumped — often illegally — left out in the open, or otherwise improperly managed, including in manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites. 

            Superfund cleanups help transform contaminated properties and create jobs in overburdened communities, while repurposing these sites for a wide range of uses, including public parks, retail businesses, office space, homes and solar power generation, EPA said. 

            Besides the Atlanta and Tampa projects, money also will go to a groundwater contamination site in Indianapolis, a former tannery in Danvers, Massachusetts, and a former metal stamping and tool and die shop near St. Louis. The funding also includes new cleanup of a former General Motors foundry in Upstate New York that has been on the Superfund list since 1984. The site in Massena has long been contaminated by toxic chemicals known as PCBs and other pollutants.

            In all, new projects in 14 states and Puerto Rico will receive funding, EPA said.

            About $50 million will go to clean up lead contamination in a residential neighborhood in Atlanta. The Westside project has been waiting for years to access federal funds. Experts say it’s unclear exactly where the lead came from, but it is likely from metal foundries that were once common on Atlanta’s Westside.

            The cleanup money “couldn’t come soon enough,” Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said on a conference call Friday with Regan and other officials. ""This accelerated timeline would not be possible without this historic investment.”

            Similarly, a project in Tampa was identified as a Superfund site in 1999 but remains contaminated, said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla.

            The site is near where she and her husband got married, Castor said. In an apparent nod to Warnock's status as a pastor, Castor said that while ""it's important to have faith, there's nothing like having resources'' to clean up pollution.WASHINGTON (AP) — Projects to clean up 22 toxic waste sites across the country will receive $1 billion from the federal Superfund program to help clear a backlog of hazardous sites such as landfills, mines and manufacturing facilities, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.The money is the second installment in $3.5 billion appropriated under the 2021 infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806821,Quake brings chance for Syria's Assad to ease isolation,"BEIRUT (AP) — On his first public visit touring the destruction wreaked by this week’s deadly earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, Syrian President Bashar Assad on Friday pointedly shamed the West for shunning his country. 

            The embattled president may see the disaster, which shattered much of northern Syria, as an opportunity to push for an easing of his country’s isolation — if not from the United States and the European Union, which have enforced sanctions for years over the long, brutal civil war, then from Arab nations. 

            “The West prioritized politics over the humanitarian situation,” Assad told a group of reporters while visiting the Aleppo neighborhood of Masharqa, devastated by Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake. “It’s natural that they politicize the situation, but there is no humanitarianism, neither now nor in the past.”











            Assad's carefully choreographed tour came five days after the quake hit, a contrast to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been visiting devastated parts of Turkey for several days.

            The tragedy presents a danger for Assad from the sheer weight of new misery the quake brings to Syrians. The country has been crippled by an economic crisis that has pulled 90% of its population into poverty. Now as many as 5.3 million people may have been left homeless in Syria by the disaster, the U.N. refugee agency estimated. 

            Major fighting in the 12-year-old civil war eased years ago, but Syrians have only seen conditions get worse. Many were already struggling to afford food and fuel for heating. Rising frustration has sparked rare protests and critical voices against Assad in government-held territory for the first time in a decade. Failure to deliver aid or recover from the quake could further stoke public discontent. 

            The quake — the world’s deadliest in decades with more than 23,000 dead — left widespread destruction across southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, both in the last rebel-held pocket of territory in the northwest and in swaths of government-held territory, particularly the city of Aleppo. 

            Officials in Assad’s government claim American and European sanctions are obstructing delivery of aid to Syria and slowing down search and rescue operations to save families still trapped under the rubble. 

            “Assad is trying to exploit the earthquakes to get out of international isolation,” Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told The Associated Press. 

            “His regime’s call for the lifting of sanctions is an attempt at de facto normalization with the international community,"" she added. 

            The EU said Syria did not formally request aid until three days after the quake, and six member countries are sending help via the U.N.’s World Food Program. The U.S. said it has temporarily lifted sanctions that would hamper earthquake relief. Assad and Syrian officials have not commented. 

            But the U.S. and the EU have made clear they will not end the sanctions imposed over Assad’s crackdown on the opposition and his forces' brutal methods against rebels in the civil war. 

            Assad himself has not called for sanctions to be lifted since the earthquake. Khatib said she expects he won’t do so because it would make him look weak in front of his people after years of hard-line rhetoric against Western countries.

            He may see hope in Arab countries. 

            Assad’s closest allies, Russia, Iran and China, all sent aid after the disaster. But so did key U.S. Arab allies, notably the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan.

            Arab countries that shunned Syria since 2011 have been slowly reestablishing diplomatic ties with Damascus. A growing number of countries have called for Syria to be reinstated into the Arab League.

            “These dynamics were already in place, led by the United Arab Emirates,” and the earthquake could accelerate them, said Nadim Houry, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative, a think tank.

            The quake allows Arab countries “to work in a non-controversial manner due to the humanitarian urgency and provides space for this rapprochement to materialize,” he said.

            Delays in getting aid into opposition-held northwestern Syria have renewed debates about the U.N. system already in place to provide humanitarian help to the territory. 

            U.N. aid is delivered through a single border-crossing from Turkey because Russia has blocked the use of a second. The United Nations has also been delivering some aid to the rebel-held northwest from within Syria, across conflict lines, from Damascus. 

            U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that the U.N. has been in contact with the Syrian government about getting a cross-line convoy into the northwest quickly.

            Assad and Russia have called for aid deliveries to the enclave to be done exclusively through Damascus, which the U.N. agencies and Western countries oppose, fearing he would divert aid to supporters. But experts say the Syrian leader and Moscow may use the urgency of the situation to push for a change. 

            “There is an urgent need now for more assistance. There needs to be a solution that doesn’t get politicized, while at the same time does not play into the hands of the regime,” Houry said.

            Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.BEIRUT (AP) — On his first public visit touring the destruction wreaked by this week’s deadly earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, Syrian President Bashar Assad on Friday pointedly shamed the West for shunning his country.The embattled president may see the disaster, which shattered much of northern Syria, as an opportunity to push for an easing of his country’s isolation — if not from the United States and the European Union, which have enforced sanctions for years over the long, brutal civil war, then from Arab nations.“The West prioritized politics over the humanitarian situation,” Assad told a group of reporters while visiting the Aleppo neighborhood of Masharqa, devastated by Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake. “It’s natural that they politicize the situation, but there is no humanitarianism, neither now nor in the past.”Assad's carefully choreographed tour came five days after the quake hit, a contrast to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been visiting devastated parts of Turkey for several days.The tragedy presents a danger for Assad from the sheer weight of new misery the quake brings to Syrians.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806822,"Spring training's start brings pitch clocks, shift limits","PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jeff McNeil thinks he’ll adapt quickly to baseball’s big shift — really, an anti-shift.

            “I’m playing a normal second base now instead of in short right field. I’ve been playing second base my whole life so it shouldn’t be too hard to adjust to,” the New York Mets All-Star infielder and big league batting champion said.

            Spring training opens Monday in Florida and Arizona for players reporting early ahead of the World Baseball Classic, and the rest of pitchers and catchers will start workouts two days later.











            Following an offseason of record spending in which the New York Mets approached a $370 million payroll, opening day on March 30 will feature three of the biggest changes since the pitcher's mound was lowered for the 1969 season:

            — Two infielders will be required on either side of second base and all infielders must be within the outer boundary of the infield when the pitcher is on the rubber.

            — Base size will increase to 18-inch squares from 15 inches, causing a decreased distance of 4 1/2 inches.

            — A pitch clock will be used, set at 15 seconds with no runners on base and 20 seconds with runners.

            “This has been an eight-year effort for us,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday, thinking back to when the first experiments were formulated. “I hope we get what our fans want — faster, more action, more athleticism.”

            
                Spring training started a month late last year because of the lockout, and many players scrambled for deals as camps opened. This offseason has proceeded more normally and some of the focus will be on stars with new homes: Jacob deGrom (Texas), Justin Verlander (New York Mets), Trea Turner (Philadelphia) and Xander Bogaerts (San Diego).

            Some teams also have new bosses in Bruce Bochy (Texas), Matt Quatraro (Kansas City), Pedro Grifol (Chicago White Sox) and Skip Schumaker (Miami). What they face is far different from the challenges thrown at John McGraw and Connie Mack, or even Earl Weaver and Billy Martin.

            Baseball’s timelessness spanned a century and a half in a sport obsessed with its sepia-toned history of flannel-clad pioneers.

            “In baseball, there’s no clock,” Richard Greenberg wrote in his Tony Award-winning play “Take Me Out.” “What could be more generous than to give everyone all these opportunities and the time to seize them in, as well?”

            Turns out, all those dead minutes became an annoyance in an age of decreased attention spans and increased entertainment competition.

            The average time of a nine-inning game stretched from 2 hours, 30 minutes in the mid-1950s to 2:46 in 1989 and 3:10 in 2021before dropping to 3:04 last year following the introduction of the PitchCom electronic device to signal pitches.

            “Pitch clock, I’m thrilled about,” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “Speed the game up. They get too long. If we’re playing the Red Sox or playing the Yankees, they turn into four-hour ballgames.”

            Use of a slightly stricter clock in the minors (14/19 at Triple-A and 14/18 at lower levels) cut the average game time from 3:03 in 2021 to 2:38 last year.

            “My guess is in April you’re going to probably see some incidents. It’s inevitable,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “Hitters are going to step out or somebody’s going to get a ball.”

            With the rise in shifts and higher velocity pitches, the batting average dropped from .269 in 2006 to .243 last year, its lowest since the record of .239 in 1968. Batting average for left-handed hitters was .236 last year, down from .254 in 2016, when lefties were one point below the big league average.

            Defensive shifts on balls in play totaled 70,853 last season, according to revised totals from Sports Info Solutions. That's up from 59,063 in 2021 and 2,349 in 2011.

            “I think for left-handed hitters, we’re trying to put the game back where it was historically,” Manfred.

            McNeil, a lefty batter, is the big league batting champion and likely to benefit from infielders repositioned back to where they were before the Analytics Era.

            “When they do shift me, I just hit against the shift. And when they don’t shift me, I just hit,” he said. “When they do give me a giant hole somewhere, then I’m going to pad to get the ball through there and try to get my single.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806826,Could Big Oil's bumper profits grow bigger?,"Financial markets were stunned in April 2020 when the price of oil turned negative for the first time ever. As demand plummeted during the first COVID lockdown, the main US oil benchmark price fell to minus $30 (minus €28) a barrel.Naysayers said prices would never recover. They warned that Big Oil's days were numbered and the end of the hydrocarbon era was nigh. While they are correct about the direction of travel, their timing was way off.The same five Western oil giants — ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total — who made huge losses in 2020, have just collectively announced more than $196 billion in annual profits, helped on by a spike in oil demand caused by the Ukraine war and the post-pandemic recovery.For much of the first half of last year, the oil price surpassed $100 and in March, Brent crude hit $139 a barrel. For the remainder of the year, it settled between $70 and $95 — much higher than the $40 to $50 needed for oil majors to make profits.Exxon's profit in 2022 was a record not just for itself but for any US or European oil giant. BP's $28 billion profit was the highest in its 114-year history, while Shell made more than double the profit it made in the previous year.As well as soaring oil prices, falling debt levels helped the oil majors to increase capital spending on fossil fuel production as governments prioritized energy security due to the supply shock caused by Western sanctions on Moscow and the Kremlin's inconsistent energy supplies to Europe after the invasion of Ukraine.BP CEO Bernard Looney was denounced by the green lobby when he said he wanted to ""dial back"" some of the energy giant's investments in renewable energies due to the risk of oil and gas supply shortages causing more price volatility.Public anger at Big Oil's announcements of record profits is visceral, not only due to the urgent green energy push.Over the last year, households and businesses have been hit hard by skyrocketing utility bills and the price of gasoline. While many governments have tried to limit the damage with subsidies, many see Big Oil as profiteering from public misery, so calls for windfall taxes on profits are growing louder.The UK and the European Union have already imposed temporary levies on oil and gas sector profits. Politicians and unions have called for those to be increased. In their results updates, Shell, Total and BP revealed that the new taxes would cost them each about $2 billion — about 5% to 8% of profits.ExxonMobil, meanwhile, is suing the EU to get the bloc to scrap its new windfall tax. The US's largest oil firm argues that Brussels has exceeded its authority by imposing the levy, which it says is normally a role for national governments.Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said in December that the tax would ""undermine investor confidence, discourage investment and increase reliance on imported energy.""US President Joe Biden used his State of the Union address this week to call for energy giants to be squeezed further, demanding a quadrupling of taxes paid on share buybacks.""When I talked to a couple of [energy companies], they said, 'We are afraid you are going to shut down all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?' We are going to need oil for at least another decade,"" Biden told Congress. ""Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing.""The top Western oil companies paid out a record $110 billion in dividends and share repurchases to investors in 2022, according to a tally by Reuters news agency.Oil giants have slashed their longer-term investments in recent years, partly after the US shale oil bust of the last decade but also after nursing heavy pandemic losses. With an ever-uncertain future due to the green energy transition, reticence remains over major capital spending.More pain could be on the way for consumers and businesses as China reopens after a 3-year zero-COVID policy, further fuelling demand for oil while boosting Big Oil's profits further still.Although oil prices aren't expected to reach their July 2008 all-time high of $150 a barrel anytime soon, some analysts predict the price could reach $100 again later this year — before a recession or downturn hits major economies and stalls demand.In its latest oil market forecast published Tuesday, the Oxford Energy Institute forecast that oil prices would reach $95.7 a barrel, partly as a result of demand from Asia's powerhouse economy. Goldman Sachs sees prices returning to $100 by December.Russia said this week it planned to cut production by half a million barrels a day from next month, a move that sent prices higher. Moscow blamed the move on Western oil sanctions, including a European Union price cap of $60 on Russian crude oil. The Kremlin has so far diverted the oil it used to send to Europe to China and India, albeit at a 30% discount.A further sign of strong oil demand came this week from Barclays Capital which forecast even higher profits for the oil majors. It set a share price target of 10 pounds ($12, €11.29) for BP, a near doubling from its Friday price of 5.61 pounds.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806827,Could the Syrian earthquake help rehabilitate Assad?,"Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has stepped up efforts to return his country to the international stage following the devastating earthquake that hit parts of northern Syria as well as the south of Turkey.In a surprise move on Friday afternoon, he said he would agree to international demands and allow aid  into regions not under state control and that aid would no longer have to go via the capital Damascus.It is still unclear whether the EU will accept Assad's offer as it would still mean dealing with his regime.Earlier this week, the Syrian parliament had called on the international community ""to immediately and urgently lift the unjust siege and unilateral coercive measures imposed on the Syrian people,"" the state-run Sana news agency reported on Tuesday.According to Sami Hamdi, managing director of International Interest, a London-based global risk and intelligence company, ""the earthquake offers an opportunity to strongarm the international community into official recognition by insisting that either all efforts are coordinated with Damascus on the basis that it is the sole authority of all Syrian territory, or [by insisting for four days that] no aid will be permitted to reach north-west Syria via Assad-controlled territories,""For Hamdi, this shows that Assad was not prioritizing disaster relief ""but that he pins his hopes on normalization and international rehabilitation.""In response to Assad's initial ban on aid for areas not under government control,Turkey on Thursday began allowing UN-trucks with supplies to pass the Bab-al-Hawa crossing at its border with Syria.This means international aid can also Syrians in rebel-controlled areas both in the country's northwest and the Kurdish semi-autonomous northeast.As a consequence of the earthquake, the Syrian government is already seeing increasing support by Arab nations, even by those who had cut ties with Damascus over the civil war that has been raging since 2011.On Monday, Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi reportedly called Bashar al-Assad for the first time since the beginning of the war. The Egyptian side later confirmed that the country was coordinating aid deliveries with the government in Damascus.Similarly, Qatar and Oman, who both firmly oppose the Assad-regime, announced an air bridge with aid supplies to Turkey and indicated that it was directed to the Syrian people as well, albeit by circumventing the Syrian government.Iraq's government meanwhile reiterated calls for Syria's return to the Arab League, a group of 22 countries that suspended Syria in 2011 as a consequence of Assad's brutal crackdown on protesters.Similarly, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Lebanon, Oman and Algeria have all signalled they would like to see Syria back in the fold.Even Turkey, the main supporter of the opposition-held regions in the northwest has been thawing ties with Damascus earlier this year.""Turkey is engaging in talks with the Assad regime,"" Guney Yildiz, a political risk analyst in London and researcher on Syria, told DW. ""Although the details of the conversations remain unknown, it is plausible to believe that they encompass the gradual restoration of Assad's control over these areas.""However, Hamdi doesn't believe that Assad is likely to gain the upper hand in the country's northeast or north west anytime soon. ""Security is neither guaranteed by the opposition groups nor by Turkey which remains adamantly against Assad re-establishing his authority in the northwest without first agreeing terms regarding buffer zones, relocation of refugees, and zones of influence,"" he told DW.""The same applies to the northeast where security is guaranteed by the US which seems adamantly on facilitating Kurdish autonomy as a check on Assad,"" he added.The US Agency for International Development (USAID) promised Friday morning to send humanitarian assistance worth $85 million (€79 million) for Turkey and Syria, including to the vulnerable population of some 4 million people in the rebel-controlled Idlib region.""US sanctions on Syria will not stand in the way of life-saving efforts for the Syrian people,"" the US Treasury said in a statement.""While US sanctions programs already contain robust exemptions for humanitarian efforts, today Treasury is issuing a blanket General License to authorize earthquake relief efforts so that those providing assistance can focus on what's needed most: saving lives and rebuilding.""Ismail Azzam contributed to this article

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806829,NASCAR champion Kyle Busch returns to Xfinity Series,"LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Busch will end a one-year break and drive in NASCAR’s second-tier Xfinity Series for Kaulig Racing this season.

            Busch won 102 races over 362 starts in the series and continued to drop down and race in the developmental level even as he became a champion at the Cup level. NASCAR eventually restricted in 2020 the number of Xfinity races a regular Cup driver could compete in each season. Busch, who made the jump to Richard Childress Racing this season, raced just five times each of his last two seasons.

            “I’m looking forward to having some fun in the Xfinity Series again,” he said. “What Matt Kaulig and Chris Rice have built in just a few short years at Kaulig Racing is impressive, and with the team’s alliance with Richard Childress Racing, this made for an easy decision to be back competing in a series that I’ve had success in over the years.”











            Busch is expected to compete in five races, starting with the March 4 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He’ll also race in Kaulig Racing’s No. 10 Chevrolet at Phoenix Raceway, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Watkins Glen International, and Darlington Raceway.

            Busch was detained last last month at a Mexican airport, and a handgun and ammunition were discovered in his luggage. The NASCAR star acknowledged this week, apologizing for the incident and calling it “a mistake.”

            Busch has 60 wins in the Cup Series and 62 in the Truck Series.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806830,Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura dies at 91,"MADRID (AP) — Carlos Saura, Spain’s celebrated filmmaker whose career spanned over seven decades during which he earned three Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Language Film has died. He was 91.

            Spain’s Cinema Academy said Saura died Friday, a day before he was to receive an honorary Goya award for his prolific career.

            Saura was a popular director among arthouse cinema enthusiasts.











            He had earned international recognition for his 1965 movie “La Caza″ (The Hunt) which was awarded the Silver Bear at the International Berlin Film Festival. He later earned another two Silver Bear awards for his work. 

            While Spain was under the rule of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco until his death in 1975, Saura’s work tried to evade censorship while addressing social issues that where unpalatable to the ruling regime. 

            Saura's three films that earned Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Language Film included “Mamá cumple 100 años″ in 1979, ”Carmen″ in 1984 and ″Tango″ in 1999.

            Saura focused in recent years on traditional music, producing several movies featuring flamenco singers and dancers, as well as fado or jota, the traditional song and dance of his birthplace, the Aragon region.

            Spanish film star Antonio Banderas was among a host of artists who mourned Saura's loss.

            ""With Carlos Saura, a very important part of the history of Spanish cinema dies. He leaves behind him an indispensable work for deep reflection on the behavior of the human being,” Banderas said.

            Saura was active until his final days. His most recent film documentary about the origins and evolution of plastic arts ""Las paredes hablan″ was released in movie theaters a week ago. ”It shows his tireless activity and his love for work until the last moment″, the Film Academy said in a message, describing him as a fundamental and irreplaceable filmmaker in the history of Spanish cinema.MADRID (AP) — Carlos Saura, Spain’s celebrated filmmaker whose career spanned over seven decades during which he earned three Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Language Film has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806831,Why Chiefs will win Super Bowl: experience and talent,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are on the Super Bowl stage for the third time in four years, the first time triumphantly marching off with the Lombardi Trophy and the second time slinking away home after a lopsided loss in the big game.

            Patrick Mahomes and Co. know better than anyone winning the Super Bowl is a whole lot better than losing it.

            Experience alone gives the Chiefs a major advantage as they prepare to face the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. But then you throw in Mahomes, the league's newly minted two-time MVP, along with transcendent tight end Travis Kelce, Chris Jones and the rest of the stars of their rebuilt defense, and coach Andy Reid pulling all the right strings and, well, there are plenty of reasons why the Chiefs will be celebrating another championship by the end of the weekend.











            “I think you have a better understanding of the whole process,” Mahomes said of the Super Bowl buildup, ""so you can kind of find those little windows where you can get a little extra film study and a little extra rest.

            “Especially the first one, when I was in Miami, it was kind of, ‘You got to go here. You got to go here.’ And you were just trying to figure out a way to get it all done. Whereas now I have a better understanding of the process.”

            Mahomes has a pretty good understanding of just about everything.

            He set career bests for yards passing with 5,250 this season, led the league with 41 touchdown passes and helped the Chiefs win a seventh consecutive AFC West title, all while juggling plenty of off-the-field life: the birth of his son, ownership in several Kansas City sports franchises and a myriad other business opportunities and investments.

            It's why he earned 48 of 50 first-place votes for MVP at NFL Honors on Thursday night.

            “I think we've just seen him grow as a quarterback. His talent level goes far beyond his ability,” Kelce said. “He's a step ahead. He's playing chess out there, like he has three or four moves in his pocket depending on what a defense does. That's why he's going to be the greatest to ever go down.”

            That's an apt title for Kelce among NFL tight ends: the greatest.

            He's had another historic season, setting both franchise and league records, and only Jerry Rice now has more postseason touchdowns than Kelce does. When the Chiefs lost three wide receivers to injuries in the AFC title game, and Mahomes was hobbling along on his ailing right ankle, he still had his dependable tight end — who had been racked by back spasms early that week — when he was under pressure and needed somewhere to go with the ball.

            On the opposite side of the ball, the Chiefs defense rarely gets the credit it deserves.

            Jones had 15 1/2 sacks in the regular season, two more in the AFC title game and was a finalist for AP Defensive Player of the Year. 

            Frank Clark is quickly climbing the list of career playoff sacks. And a secondary that often throws four rookies onto the field at once shut down Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and his flotilla of receiving threats two weeks ago.

            “I think we're peaking at the right time, especially after the past three to four weeks,” Jones said. “Everyone is ready. We're excited about the game. But we know what we're here for and we're going to keep at it.”

            Reid wouldn't let them do anything else.

            This will actually be his fourth time as a head coach in the Super Bowl — he lost his only try with Philadelphia — and for the past two weeks, he's been guiding the Chiefs through their preparations to his typical exacting standard. 

            Every meeting and walk-through and practice has been laid out to the minute, the product of all those years of experience.

            “This all can take you out of your normal routine,” Reid explained. “You try to keep it as close to possible, but you've got the media obligations and a couple other things that they throw in there. But for the most part, we try to keep the practices the same, and we're on the same schedule.”

            There's an argument to be made that the Eagles have the most complete roster in the NFL, and a side-by-side comparison with the Chiefs might leave the impression that they are the heavy favorites to walk away winners Sunday night.

            But the Eagles don't have Mahomes or Kelce. They don't have Jones or “Big Red” on the sideline.

            They also haven't experienced the thrill of a Super Bowl victory or the crushing disappointment of a defeat.

            “I don't want to have any regrets,” Mahomes said. “When I step off this football field, I understand how lucky I am to be in this organization. I understand how lucky I am to play with guys that are going to be Hall of Famers. And so when I look back at the end of my career, I don’t want to look back and be like, ‘Man, I didn’t give everything I have to win to win Super Bowls,’ because of the great people I have around me. When I get done with my career, I want to make sure that I know that I gave everything I had on that football field.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806833,1st officer in Nichols arrest accused of brutality at prison,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Years before Memphis Police officer Demetrius Haley pulled Tyre Nichols from his car on Jan. 7, setting in motion a deadly confrontation, Haley was accused of taking part in the savage beating of an inmate at a county prison.

            The 2015 assault of the inmate was so disturbing that 34 others — the entire cellblock — signed a letter to the corrections director.

            “We are truly asking that this matter gets looked into before someone gets hurt really bad or lose their life because of some unprofessional officers,"" the letter stated.











            The warning from dozens of inmates at the Shelby County prison is the clearest indication yet that one of the five officers who took part in the violent beating of Nichols had an event in his past that should have raised concerns before he was hired as a police officer. Nichols died three days after the beating. 

            The letter asks how the inmates are supposed to feel “safe and secure when the staff members at the Shelby County Correctional Center are assaulting and threatening us?” 

            It concludes, “Please put a stop to this madness.”

            Shelby County did not respond to a request Friday seeking information about its investigation into the beating allegations, so it is unclear if Haley was disciplined or cleared of the assault. An email was sent Friday to a police spokesperson asking if the department knew about the allegations when Haley was hired.

            There is no national database of officers found guilty of misconduct who resign or are fired, meaning in a lot of cases they can apply for jobs in other police agencies and departments. There is a national database for officers who lose their certification — the equivalent of their professional license to be a police officer in a particular state. That wouldn't have made a difference in Haley's case because his job at the county prison didn't require police certification. 

            The former officer has been charged with second-degree murder in Nichols’ death, along with ex- officers Tadarrius Bean, Desmond Mills Jr., Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith. All except Bean have infractions in their work records. Policy violations include using minor physical force during an arrest and failing to fill out a form about it; failing to report a domestic violence situation; and a car crash, records show.

            The prior accusations against Haley came to light because the inmate, Cordarlrius Sledge, filed a federal lawsuit in 2016 against him and two others. It accused Haley and another officer of punching him, and a third of slamming his head into the floor. The suit was ultimately dismissed on procedural grounds, because Sledge had failed to file a grievance with the prison, which houses inmates in the Memphis area who have been tried and convicted.

            Haley continued to work for the Division of Corrections until hired by Memphis Police in 2020, at a time when the department was lowering its standards for recruits in an attempt to fill vacancies. According to records in his personnel file, a previous application to the police department was rejected, but the reason for that rejection is blacked out.

            A sixth officer who participated in Nichols’ arrest and beating, Preston Hemphill, has been fired but not criminally charged. He initially failed a physical after he was hired in 2019 and spent several months in a civilian position.

            Van Turner, president of the NAACP’s Memphis branch, said Tyre Nichols’ death could have been prevented if the police department had not hired Haley.

            “The culture of violence and bravado and the lack of empathy for individuals is not only here in our neighborhoods and communities, but unfortunately also in our jails and prison system,” said Turner, who is running for mayor.

            Haley, Hemphill, and the four other officers were all eventually assigned to the Scorpion unit, an acronym for Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace In Our Neighborhoods. The anti-crime task force that Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis started when she took over the department in June 2021 was designed to focus on repeat violent offenders, but has been accused of violent and illegal tactics.

            Black residents of Memphis have described police sweeps in which unmarked cars roll into neighborhoods and armed plainclothes officers jump out, rushing traffic violators and issuing commands. The resulting fear has led people to text, call and use social media to caution each other to stay inside or avoid the area when police operations are underway.

            Davis initially defended but later disbanded the Scorpion unit after Nichols’ death.

            Haley has not spoken publicly about his role in Nichols' arrest and beating. He declined to make a statement at his disciplinary hearing, and his attorney has declined to comment. When a reporter from The Associated Press knocked on Haley’s door this week, no one answered.

            Neighbors who live in single-family homes near Haley, in a quiet section of the Memphis suburb of Cordova, said he moved into the house about two years ago. Michael Cassie said he didn’t have many conversations with Haley, but the ones he did have were friendly. Haley mostly kept to himself and has not been seen around the neighborhood in recent weeks, said Cassie, a 74-year-old minister. 

            Asked about his reaction when he learned of Haley’s involvement with Nichols, Cassie said, “I was totally shocked that it was him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806834,"No Super Bowl interview for Biden, White House official says","NEW YORK (AP) — The on-again, off-again Super Bowl interview between President Joe Biden and a Fox Corp. streaming service appears to be off again.

            A White House official said Friday evening that it was “inaccurate” to say the interview had been rescheduled, contradicting a Fox Corp. spokesperson who said earlier in the day that it was happening.

            The statement appeared to signal the definitive end of a pingpong saga over whether Biden would sit down with Fox interviewers ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday. Presidents traditionally grant an interview to the network that's broadcasting the football game — in this case, Fox. 











            However, this year negotiations broke down.

            The back-and-forth began Friday with a tweet from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. 

            “The President was looking forward to an interview with Fox Soul to discuss the Super Bowl, the State of the Union, and critical issues impacting the everyday lives of Black Americans,” she wrote. “We’ve been informed that Fox Corp. has asked for the interview to be cancelled.”

            Fox Soul was created in 2020, and it's geared toward Black viewers. 

            Hours later, a Fox Corp. spokesperson released a contradictory statement.

            “After the White House reached out to Fox Soul Thursday evening, there was some initial confusion,"" the spokesperson said. ""Fox Soul looks forward to interviewing the President for Super Bowl Sunday.”

            The spokesperson added that the interviewers — Vivica A. Fox, the actress and host of “Cocktails with Queens,” and sportscaster Mike Hill — had arrived in Washington after flying in from the Los Angeles. 

            But the White House statement later Friday added another twist. 

            “As we said earlier, we had arranged an interview with FOX Sports Host Mike Hill & Vivica A. Fox with the President ahead of the Super Bowl and Fox Corp. had the interview cancelled,"" the statement said. ""Fox has since put out a statement indicating the interview was rescheduled, which is inaccurate.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806835,"Marines, bonded by kidney donation, now head to Super Bowl","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Two former Marines bonded by a kidney donation and their love of football are now headed to the Super Bowl.

            John Gladwell, a Kansas City resident and Chiefs fan, donated a kidney to Philadelphia Eagles backer Billy Welsh two years ago after Welsh, who lives in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. 

            The two men first met at a military base in the early 2000s and remained in touch through social media after they left the service. When Welsh made a post in 2019 asking if anyone was willing to become a donor, Gladwell responded and soon learned he was a 99% match. He eventually flew to Philadelphia, where the 10-hour surgical procedure was performed.











            “It meant the world to me. I was speechless. John Gladwell is my hero,” Welsh said Wednesday when the two men appeared on NBC's Today show.

            Gladwell said he didn’t hesitate to make the donation because Welsh has a son who is a little older than his own grandson.

            “I wasn’t going to let his son grow up without his dad being there for everything,” Gladwell said.

            The all-expenses-paid Super Bowl trip was put together by Eagles President Don Smolenski and his Chiefs counterpart Mark Donovan. Smolenski said the story symbolizes the unifying aspects of the Marine Corps and the NFL. The team presidents spoke with the two men during a video call last Sunday, letting them know they would be flown to Arizona on Friday, put up in hotel rooms and have side-by-side seats for the big game.

            “The opportunity to bring these two guys together, their two teams playing on the biggest stage in sports, it’s very, very humbling and gratifying,” Smolenski told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

            Welsh said he was ""speechless” when he got the news. Gladwell, meanwhile, thought he was getting a spam call when a Super Bowl Host Committee representative contacted him Sunday morning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806836,Missouri officials investigate transgender youth clinic,"COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey on Friday called for doctors to pause giving puberty blockers and hormones to new patients at a transgender youth clinic. The call comes a day after he announced an investigation into claims that the facility rushed to give children gender-affirming care without informed consent.

            Bailey publicly announced an investigation of Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital on Thursday after he said a whistleblower went public with allegations against the clinic. 

            The state Social Services Department, state licensing agency, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and Washington University also are investigating. 











            Former case manager Jamie Reed claimed in an affidavit claimed that the center mainly provides gender-affirming care and does little to address mental health issues that patients also faced.

            Reed worked at the clinic from 2018 through November 2022. In a post published Thursday by The Free Press, Reed described herself as a 42-year-old queer woman who is “politically to the left of Bernie Sanders.” She said she's married to a transgender man. 

            In her affidavit, Reed claimed one minor treated at the center received a mastectomy and months later wanted the procedure to be undone. She said one doctor prescribed a medication to enlarge breasts that also caused liver damage.

            Reed said she saw ""healthcare providers lie to the public and to parents of patients about the treatment, or lack of treatment, and the effects of treatment provided to children."" 

            “I witnessed staff at the center provide puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children without complete informed parental consent and without an appropriate or accurate assessment of the needs of the child,"" Reed wrote. ""I witnessed children experience shocking injuries from the medication the center prescribed.”

            Missouri Division of Professional Registration Director Sheila Solon said in a statement that licensing boards will “take any necessary action against the licenses of Missouri professionals in violation of the boards’ statutory and regulatory authority to ensure health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Missouri.” Solon previously served as a Republican state representative. 

            Reed also claimed that physicians often referred patients to on-site therapists who would recommend gender-affirming treatments to children after spending one or two hours with them. She said doctors would “bully” parents into giving permission for treatment by saying, “You can either have a living son or a dead daughter.”

            Studies have found some children and teens resort to self-mutilation to try to change their anatomy. And research has shown that transgender youth and adults are prone to stress, depression and suicidal behavior when forced to live as the sex they were assigned at birth.

            Reed also alleged that the center billed some treatments to the federal Medicaid health care program. 

            “I took the job because I support trans rights and firmly believed I would be able to provide good care for children at the Center who are appropriate candidates to be receiving medical transition,” Reed wrote in the affidavit. “Instead, I witnessed the Center cause permanent harm to many of the patients.”

            Missouri LGBTQ advocacy group PROMO spokesman Robert Fischer in a statement said the organization has heard “dozens upon dozens of positive personal stories from transgender and gender non-conforming youth and families about the ethic of care they’ve received” at the center.

            “We’ve also sat in rooms with over 30 parents who have shared stories about how their children thrived when they received interdisciplinary, holistic care from a team of providers at the Center,” Fischer said. “We have no insight into these allegations and accusations from one person.”

            
                Transgender medical treatment for children and teens is increasingly under attack in many states, labeled child abuse and subject to criminalizing bans. But it has been available in the United States for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations.

            Many clinics use treatment plans pioneered in Amsterdam 30 years ago, according to a recent review in the British Psych Bulletin. Since 2005, the number of youth referred to gender clinics has increased as much as tenfold in the U.S., U.K, Canada and Finland, the review said.

            Several Missouri lawmakers this year filed bills to ban gender-affirming treatment for transgender youth, and Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden said that's a priority for Senate Republicans.

            Bailey in a statement called the allegations against the center “disturbing.”

            “We take this evidence seriously and are thoroughly investigating to make sure children are not harmed by individuals who may be more concerned with a radical social agenda than the health of children,” Bailey said. 

            Bailey has been outspoken on social issues since he took office in January. Republican Gov. Mike Parson appointed Bailey, the former top lawyer for the Governor's Office, to replace now-U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt as the state attorney general. 

            During his roughly one month in office so far, Bailey has called on school boards to adopt policies against children attending drag shows and warned CVS and Walgreens not to sell abortion medications.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806838,Depth of roster gives Eagles edge in Super Bowl matchup,"PHOENIX (AP) — If the Super Bowl is decided in the trenches: Advantage Philadelphia Eagles with their two All-Pro offensive linemen and four double-digit sack artists.

            If it comes down to which team has better receiving and running options: Advantage Eagles with their pair of 1,000-yard receivers and record-setting running game.

            If it comes down to the superior secondary: Advantage Eagles and their two proven cornerbacks.











            Philadelphia has built a team without any holes, which should set the stage for a repeat from five years ago when Eagles used a more complete roster to outduel an MVP quarterback and win the Super Bowl.

            The Eagles will do to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs what they did to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots and deliver Philadelphia its second Lombardi Trophy.

            “We’ve been getting overlooked all year, but for what reason I don’t know,” edge rusher Haason Reddick said. “Because we have dogs across every position, people who can make plays. This team is talented from top to bottom. I don’t think I’ve been on a more talented team.” 

            This version of the Eagles might be even better than the 2017 team, which got to the title game with backup quarterback Nick Foles. 

            While Foles delivered a surprise MVP performance in that 41-33 victory with three TD passes, one TD catch and a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter, it would be little shock to see Jalen Hurts lead the way on Sunday.

            While Hurts isn't at the level of two-time MVP Mahomes, he proved in his third season that he is a legitimate threat of his own and the Eagles lost just once when he started this season. 

            Hurts was a second-team All-Pro and finished second to Mahomes in MVP voting after tying a franchise record with 35 combined TD passes and runs despite missing two games with a shoulder injury.

            Hurts hasn't looked in peak form since returning from the injury that sidelined him in Weeks 16 and 17, but the two weeks since the NFC championship game should help him regain his deep passing prowess that should prove the difference on Sunday.

            At the time of his injury, Hurts was tied for the NFL lead with 11 touchdown passes on throws at least 20 yards downfield and ranked fourth in yards gained on those plays with 786. Since returning in Week 18, Hurts is 3 for 10 on deep throws with no TDs.

            A healthier Hurts should be able to connect with A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith on a few long balls against a Kansas City defense that allowed the third-highest passer rating on deep passes in the regular season.

            If the big-play pass doesn't do it, Philadelphia has the running game that has set a record with 39 touchdowns on the ground in the regular season and playoffs.

            The Chiefs allowed the fifth-most rushing yards to opposing quarterbacks this season, which could be a major problem against Hurts, who rushed for 760 yards in the regular season and has a quarterback-record 15 TDs runs, including the playoffs.

            Hurts' rushing ability opens up holes for a trio of backs in Miles Sanders, Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott running behind a line that ranks near the top in all run-blocking metrics thanks to All-Pro center Jason Kelce and All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson.

            To beat Mahomes and the Chiefs, the Eagles defense will also need to step up and the league's deepest group of pass rushers should do the trick.

            Reddick led the way for Philadelphia with 16 sacks in the regular season and he has been even better in the playoffs with 3 1/2 sacks in wins over the Giants and 49ers.

            Reddick will line up against the weak link on Kansas City's line — right tackle Andrew Wylie, whose nine sacks allowed in the regular season were fourth most in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus.

            If the Chiefs want to pay extra attention to Reddick, good luck against the rest of the defensive line. Brandon Graham, Javon Hargrave and Jose Sweat each had 11 sacks as the Eagles had the highest sack rate in the NFL in more than 30 years.

            With Fletcher Cox and Ndamukong Suh also in the mix, Mahomes could be on the run on his gimpy ankle as he was in Kansas City's Super Bowl loss to Tampa Bay two years ago.

            The fierce front four allows the Eagles to get pressure without blitzing, which will make life easier for cornerbacks Darius Slay and James Bradberry against Kansas City's less-than-stellar wideouts.

            That will allow the rest of the back seven to focus on limiting All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce and making sure the Chiefs don't get big gains in the screen game. 

            If that happens, get ready for another parade down Broad Street.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806839,"Siakam, Edwards, Fox added to NBA All-Star Game roster","NEW YORK (AP) — Toronto forward Pascal Siakam, Minnesota guard Anthony Edwards and Sacramento guard De'Aaron Fox have been added to the player pool for the All-Star Game as injury replacements.

            Commissioner Adam Silver's office announced the picks Friday, after they were first reported by ESPN.

            Siakam, Edwards and Fox replace Golden State's Stephen Curry, New Orleans' Zion Williamson and Phoenix's Kevin Durant — all of whom are injured and will be unable to play in the Feb. 19 game at Salt Lake City. 











            It’s the second All-Star selection for Siakam, and the first for Edwards and Fox.

            Curry, Williamson and Durant were all selected as starters for the game. Those starting spots will now go to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, Utah's Lauri Markkanen and Memphis' Ja Morant, the NBA said.

            All-Star starters are chosen in a weighted vote that takes into account fan, media and player balloting. All-Star reserves are chosen by NBA coaches. Injury replacements are selected by Silver.

            The rosters for the game will be chosen by captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks shortly before tip-off. This is the sixth year that the NBA has used the captain-draft format for the game, but the first time that those selections will be made on game day.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806841,Raleigh police release video of stun gun use before man dies,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Police in North Carolina's capital city released body and dashboard camera footage Friday that shows the arrest of a Black man who died after officers repeatedly used stun guns on him. 

            Darryl Tyree Williams, 32, died at a hospital after being confronted and handcuffed by officers in a southeast Raleigh neighborhood about 2 a.m. on Jan. 17, according to a report by Police Chief Estella Patterson released days later. 

            The footage authorized to be released by a state judge this week shows officers approaching and searching Williams near a parked car. Police have said officers had been conducting proactive patrols of nearby businesses.











            A man can be heard on several of the body-worn camera recordings saying “I’m not doing anything.” 

            Williams’ family had no comment Friday on the release of the footage, according to Dawn Blagrove with Emancipate NC, a criminal justice reform group that has been in contact with the family. Family members viewed the footage on Thursday, a city spokesperson said. 

            The footage from one body camera shows officers directing him multiple times to place his hands either up or behind his back. A struggle ensues, and someone can be heard threatening to fire a Taser unless he stops. The police report says a Taser was deployed, temporarily stopping Williams and causing him to fall. The video shows officers on the ground with Williams near a trash can.

            The police report said Williams then broke away from the officers. The video shows him stopped moments later in the parking lot, with officers telling Williams to get on the ground and trying again to arrest him.

            “Why are you all doing this to me?” he asks. 

            “Hands behind your back or you’re going to get Tased again,” an officer said about 20 seconds later, following other orders by his colleagues.

            The footage confirms the report’s statement that Williams can then be heard saying “I have heart problems” after he was stunned again and before officers said another one would be coming if he didn’t cooperate. Police have said Williams was stunned three times, twice through direct body contact with the Taser.

            Once Williams appears to be detained, someone says, “Relax man, relax. Chill out.” Seconds later, officers become worried about whether he still had a pulse, but they turn him over and say he’s breathing. 

            One of the videos begins with Williams already on the ground and officers kneeling over him. He can be heard moaning. 

            Williams became unresponsive and stopped breathing after he was handcuffed, according to the written account. The footage shows police doing chest compressions to try to resuscitate him. Emergency services arrived, and Williams was pronounced dead at a hospital about 3 a.m. The cause of his death is under investigation. 

            Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said Friday that an autopsy has been performed on Williams but that a final report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has not yet been provided.

            The report said officers initially approached Williams as he sat in the driver's seat of a parked car. An officer observed an open container of alcohol and marijuana in the car. Police tried to arrest him for possession of a controlled substance after they found a folded dollar bill with white powder in his pocket, the report said. 

            In one of the videos, an officer approaches the car from the passenger side, the door opens and the officer asks “Hey what’s up? How’s it going? What are y’all doing?”

            A man inside explains that he’s walking to his house. The officer responds, “OK, just do me a favor. Come over here. Have a seat, both of you.” As the men in the car repeatedly ask “Why? and “For what?” the officer just repeats “Have a seat,” six times.

            A search of Williams’ car also found two firearms, one of which had been reported stolen, the report states. A passenger in the car left the scene on foot, the report adds.

            Six officers involved in the arrest are on administrative leave, and the State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe. The police department sought a judge’s permission to release the body camera and dash camera video from patrol cars. 

            Emancipate NC and other advocacy groups this week presented a list of demands to the Raleigh City Council. They include firing the officers involved in the arrest, retooling the city’s police advisory board and discontinuing for now the use of Tasers.

            “How many times do we have to watch public executions before policing will be held accountable?” Blagrove said. “Emancipate NC stands behind the demands presented to Raleigh City Council and expect to see officers held accountable for Darryl Williams' death.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806842,DeSantis to run Disney district after 'Don't Say Gay' feud,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will soon take control of Walt Disney World's self-governing district after Senate Republicans approved a bill Friday punishing the company over its opposition to the law critics call “Don't Say Gay.”

            The legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, would require DeSantis to appoint a five-member board to oversee the government services the district provides in the company's sprawling properties in Florida. 

            The vote on the Disney bill ended a special legislative session focused on the conservative agenda of a governor who has leveraged national political tensions to become a national GOP star and potential White House contender. 











            The session itself, which was hastily called and completed, also signaled DeSantis' willingness to leverage the Republican supermajority in the statehouse to accomplish his political goals, a strategy he will continue in the coming months as he builds toward his expected presidential candidacy. 

            The Disney district takeover was initiated last year when Disney publicly opposed “Don’t Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate. 

            DeSantis moved to penalize the company, directing lawmakers to dissolve the district during a special legislative session in April, beginning a closely watched restructuring process.

            Last week, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate, in coordination with the governor, ordered lawmakers to return for another special session to complete the state takeover of the district.

            “This all seems a retaliation by the governor for Disney voicing its support for the LGBTQ community,” Democratic Sen. Linda Stewart said Friday before the bill's passage. 

            The measure also changes the district's name from the Reedy Creek Improvement District to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and subjects it to various layers of state oversight. Board members are currently named through entities controlled by Disney. 

            The bill leaves the district and its financial abilities and debt obligations intact, addressing a chief concern of surrounding governments. It also prevents people who have worked with or contracted with a theme park in the past three years from serving on the district’s new governing board. 

            Having a separate government allows the district to issue bonds and provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. Republican critics of the district argue it gives Disney a commercial advantage unavailable to others. 

            “This bill takes an old district and modernized it and updated it,"" said Republican Rep. Fred Hawkins, the bill sponsor. ""It took rights away that no corporation should have in being able to construct or have an unfair competitive advantage over its competitors.” 

            The creation of the district was instrumental in the company's decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s. 

            Disney officials had told the state they planned to build a futuristic city that would include a transit system and urban planning innovations, so the company needed autonomy in building and deciding how to use the land. The futuristic city never materialized and instead morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982.

            Separately on Friday, Republicans in the House gave final passage to two bills that amount to technical fixes to key DeSantis initiatives on immigration and voter fraud. The proposals now move to the governor's office to be signed into law. 

            One bill is meant to cut off a legal challenge to the governor's migrant relocation program, which began last year when DeSantis used taxpayer dollars to fly a group of South American migrants from Texas to the liberal enclave resort island of Martha's Vineyard. 

            The trip drew legal questions because the administration paid for the flight using money intended to remove migrants who were located in Florida, not migrants who were in any other state. 

            The legislation creates a dedicated program in the governor’s office on migrant relocation and specifies that future flights could move migrants from anywhere in the U.S. The measure increases the likelihood of additional trips as DeSantis continues his criticism of federal border policy along his path to an expected 2024 presidential bid. 

            Republicans have repeatedly said the bill would help migrants by taking them to sanctuary cities and states, while Democrats have slammed the program as a political stunt meant to serve the governor’s political ambitions. 

            The other proposal is meant to strengthen the prosecutorial power of the governor’s election police unit, clarifying in state law that the statewide prosecutor has authority to prosecute election crimes in federal and state races. 

            “This ensures fraud will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, as it should,” said Republican Rep. Juan Alfonso Fernandez-Barquin. 

            Some cases tied to the election police unit have been dismissed by judges who said the statewide prosecutor did not have jurisdiction to bring charges. 

            DeSantis pushed lawmakers to create the election police unit last year to address Republican concerns about voter fraud, which have proliferated among conservatives following former President Donald Trump's false claims that he reelection was stolen. 

            The unit, housed in the governor's department of state, reviews fraud allegations and conducts preliminary investigations, with a special group of state police officers who pursue violations. 

            Democrats have said the unit is meant to dissuade people from voting and that it is unnecessary since local prosecutors can investigate and charge voter fraud. 

            “This is a fear tactic and it's voter suppression, plain and simple,” said Rep. Dianne Hart, a Democrat. 

            DeSantis is expected to sign the bills into law. Lawmakers will return to Tallahassee in early March for their regular legislative session, where they are expected to approve another slate of DeSantis priorities on guns, education, capital punishment and abortion.TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

The proposals now move to the governor's office to be signed into law.One bill is meant to cut off a legal challenge to the governor's migrant relocation program, which began last year when DeSantis used taxpayer dollars to fly a group of South American migrants from Texas to the liberal enclave resort island of Martha's Vineyard.The trip drew legal questions because the administration paid for the flight using money intended to remove migrants who were located in Florida, not migrants who were in any other state.The legislation creates a dedicated program in the governor’s office on migrant relocation and specifies that future flights could move migrants from anywhere in the U.S. The measure increases the likelihood of additional trips as DeSantis continues his criticism of federal border policy along his path to an expected 2024 presidential bid.Republicans have repeatedly said the bill would help migrants by taking them to sanctuary cities and states, while Democrats have slammed the program as a political stunt meant to serve the governor’s political ambitions.The other proposal is meant to strengthen the prosecutorial power of the governor’s election police unit, clarifying in state law that the statewide prosecutor has authority to prosecute election crimes in federal and state races.“This ensures fraud will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, as it should,” said Republican Rep. Juan Alfonso Fernandez-Barquin.Some cases tied to the election police unit have been dismissed by judges who said the statewide prosecutor did not have jurisdiction to bring charges.DeSantis pushed lawmakers to create the election police unit last year to address Republican concerns about voter fraud, which have proliferated among conservatives following former President Donald Trump's false claims that he reelection was stolen.The unit, housed in the governor's department of state, reviews fraud allegations and conducts preliminary investigations, with a special group of state police officers who pursue violations.Democrats have said the unit is meant to dissuade people from voting and that it is unnecessary since local prosecutors can investigate and charge voter fraud.“This is a fear tactic and it's voter suppression, plain and simple,” said Rep. Dianne Hart, a Democrat.DeSantis is expected to sign the bills into law. Lawmakers will return to Tallahassee in early March for their regular legislative session, where they are expected to approve another slate of DeSantis priorities on guns, education, capital punishment and abortion.",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806843,"Recovering Twins welcome Maeda back, seek healthier season","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Kenta Maeda first takes the mound for Minnesota in the 2023 season, his wait between appearances will have passed 19 months.

            The Twins are more than eager to return the right-hander to their rotation, part of a welcome-back theme surrounding this team entering spring training after an injury-wrecked 2022.

            “The time flew by relatively quickly,” Maeda said recently through a translator, reflecting on his rehabilitation from Tommy John elbow surgery. “But you never know. The first pitch that I throw on the big league mound, I might get so nervous I might drill someone. So watch out.”











            Maeda flashed his dry sense of humor as he spoke in Japanese to reporters at the team's annual fan festival at Target Field on Jan. 28. He declared his arm “100% ready” for camp, which formally begins for Twins pitchers and catchers on Thursday morning in Fort Myers, Florida.

            Maeda last pitched on Aug. 21, 2021. He had the ligament replacement procedure 11 days later. He could've been back in game action last September, but once the Twins faded down the stretch they decided to be cautious and keep him sidelined until 2023.

            The AL Cy Young award runner-up in 2020, Maeda slumped to a 4.66 ERA in 21 starts in 2021 before the injury became too much. Last year, there was no opponent batting average or strikeouts-per-nine-innings rate, only an opportunity to reflect on his strategy while building up his overall body strength to be ready to go without limitation this season.

            “There was so much discomfort prior to the surgery. Obviously, right after surgery there are limitations to movement, but now everything is free, whether that’s throwing a baseball or just doing daily stuff,” Maeda said. “Everything feels free.”

            Fellow starting pitcher Chris Paddack, who had just arrived in Minnesota in a trade with San Diego, joined Maeda on the Tommy John recovery track after only five starts. Paddack won't be back until midseason, much like top position player prospect Royce Lewis in his comeback from another repair of a torn ACL.

            The major injuries are largely unpreventable. The smaller-scale issues are what dogged the Twins in 2022, enough of a concern that they changed head athletic trainers and hired Nick Paparesta away from Oakland. Paparesta traveled to meet in person with several players this winter.

            “It’s easy to say that when a guy has a particular issue that the return plan should be prescribed the same way for everybody with the same issue,” president of baseball operations Derek Falvey said. “Well, some guys have different tolerances. Some guys are able to play through certain things. So Nick getting to know the players, that’s going to be important.”

            Alex Kirilloff will have the most-watched wrist in camp. 

            The 2016 first-round draft pick's ascendance to the heart of the batting order has been severely hampered by his health. Each of his first two major league seasons have been halted by surgery on the wrist, a vital joint for any hitter.

            After a series of setbacks, Kirilloff opted last August for a shortening procedure that involved an intentional breaking and then shaving of the ulna bone to decrease the friction around it. The 25-year-old, who could wind up as either the regular left fielder or first baseman, said at TwinsFest he's aiming for a mostly normal spring training with minimal restriction.

            “I’m kind of just taking it day by day. But it does feel good, and I’m very optimistic,” Kirilloff said. ""They cut my bone so there’s definitely some aches and stuff to go along with that, but from a pain standpoint it feels good.”

            Second baseman Jorge Polanco's ailing knee limited one of the team's true iron men to just 104 games last season after he appeared in 94% of the games over the previous three years.

            “Sometimes we play hurt, with a little bit of pain or something. But that kind of injury was something I couldn’t play through,” Polanco said, later adding: “I have been working on it almost every day. I’m ready to go.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806844,Feds: Tenn. plan to forgo school funds 'political posturing',"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The U.S. Department of Education is criticizing a proposal floated by a top Tennessee Republican lawmaker to cut off federal K-12 funds, describing the proposal as “political posturing. ”

            “Our students need more — not less — to support their academic recovery and address the youth mental health crisis,"" a department spokesperson told The Associated Press. “This political posturing will impede the basic education of young people throughout the entire K-12 school system and limit opportunities — particularly for students most in need — to access tutoring and academic support, afterschool and summer programs, school counselors, mental health professionals, and other assistance.”

            The agency added that anyone in favor of such a plan “should have to answer to their local educators and parents in their community about the detrimental impact it would have on their community’s education system and their students’ futures.”











            Earlier this week, Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton confirmed that he has introduced legislation that would allow Tennessee to reject the nearly $1.8 billion of federal K-12 education funds that help provide support for low-income students, English learners and students with disabilities. Sexton said Tennessee is currently in the financial position to use state tax dollars to replace federal education funds and doing so would free the state from burdensome requirements that come with accepting federal dollars.

            Sexton said the Department of Education's response encapsulated “everything wrong with federal bureaucrats.”

            “The Washington education regime is afraid of freedom, hates states’ rights, and knows that us rejecting federal money for overbearing policies like common core will ultimately lead to a total demise of their bureaucratic big brother approach,” he said in an email.

            Federal dollars make up about 20% of Tennessee’s K-12 education funding, which had an almost $8.3 billion budget as of fiscal year 2023. The federal money is seen as a key tool to supporting schools in low-income areas and special education. 

            To date, no state has successfully rejected federal education funds, but many Republican politicians and candidates at the federal level have made a habit of calling for the outright elimination of the U.S. Department of Education.

            Yet in Tennessee, Sexton's effort has sparked alarm among education advocates who argue the state already isn't spending enough on public education.

            It's unclear whether Tennessee would have fewer conflicts with the federal government if the state chose to forgo the education funding. While the U.S. Constitution says public education is a state responsibility, states are still required to follow federal laws.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806845,UN human rights chief calls for special forces to Haiti,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The U.N.’s human rights chief on Friday urged the international community to consider deploying a specialized armed force to Haiti, warning that violent gangs are creating a “living nightmare” for thousands of people.

            The appeal from U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Volker Türk came at the end of a two-day visit to Haiti at the request of a government unable to control gangs that are killing, raping and pillaging in a growing number of neighborhoods. Violence has spiked in the impoverished country since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

            “It is time for the international community to help the Haitian authorities regain full control so this suffering can be stopped,” Türk said.











            He added that since multiple crises around the world are competing for attention, he fears that ""the situation in Haiti is not receiving the urgent spotlight that it deserves.""

            Hours later, at an Organization of American States meeting in Washington, the U.S. government said it continues to discuss with international partners the possibility of sending a multinational force composed primarily of police.

            Francisco Mora, U.S. ambassador to the OAS, added that the U.S. is still working with others on a framework with the aim to provide security and stability and that it would also soon implement new sanctions and visa restrictions.

            Mora spoke after Haiti’s Foreign Minister, Jean Victor Généus, requested that a specialized international force “be allowed to stand with us.”

            “There is a deepening crisis in the country that cries out for humanitarian aid,” he said.

            The plea came as the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti released a 24-page report on what it described as mass incidents of murder, gang rapes and sniper attacks in Cite Soleil, Haiti’s biggest slum. It is in the capital of Port-au-Prince.

            “The findings of this report are horrifying,” Turk said. “It paints a picture of how people are being harassed and terrorized by criminal gangs for months without the state being able to stop it.” 

            The report said that from last July 8 to Dec. 31, at least 263 people were killed and at least 57 women and girls were raped in just one neighborhood within Cite Soleil known as Brooklyn. That area became ground zero for intense fighting between warring gangs.

            During that time, the report said, residents lived in “an almost permanent climate of terror due to the use of snipers that killed, at random, any person who passed in their field of vision.” 

            Officials added that snipers would stand on schools and other buildings during broad daylight to attack innocent residents, with an average of six people killed or wounded every week. Among the targets were at least 17 women and several children, the youngest just 8 years old.

            Gang members also entered houses at random in rival territory, killing at least 95 people this way, including six children, one of whom was 2 years old, the report said. People who tried to flee the violence were killed at makeshift checkpoints.

            “It is important to emphasize … that this violence and these abuses are not committed randomly but are motivated by the interest of political actors in controlling territories,” the report said.

            Officials noted that three men were killed by one gang leader because they had been talking about the possibility of foreign military intervention, which Prime Minister Ariel Henry urgently requested in October to no avail amid a fuel terminal siege that shuttered gas stations and crippled life in Haiti.

            The report blamed the violence on at least eight gangs, including Haiti’s largest one — G9 Family and Allies, which is a gang federation led by former police officer Jimmy Chérizier. It has been accused of blocking access to food and water in part by damaging public water mains and threatening to kill water truck drivers if they went to certain neighborhoods.

            As a result, the first cholera deaths in nearly three years were recorded in October 2022 in the Brooklyn neighborhood, officials said.

            In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Chérizier denied the accusations, saying he is simply carrying out a “social fight.”

            The report said warring gangs use weapons including assault rifles illegally smuggled into Haiti and even rely on motorboats to attack rivals. The wave of violence has displaced tens of thousands of Haitians who remain homeless after their homes were bulldozed or set on fire, the report said.

            The U.N. office urged local officials to hold elections, provide more training and equipment to a severely understaffed police department and arrest those responsible for “gross human rights abuses.” 

            It also once again called on the international community to urgently consider the deployment of foreign troops.

            “The issues are vast and overwhelming,” Türk said. “They need the international community's attention.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806846,"GM: Hornets to rely on player development, not free agency","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets are projected to have approximately $40 million in salary cap space this coming offseason, but that doesn’t mean owner Michael Jordan’s club will be big players in free agency come July.

            Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak said Charlotte’s focus moving forward will be on drafting well and developing its young players.

            “I don’t think that is something that we can bank on as a small market team -- I just don’t,” Kupchak said Friday of Charlotte’s ability to land elite players in free agency. “The way we are going to get better is through the draft and player development. And then if we get lucky, make a couple savvy trades. ... We are a small market team and we have to look at the world a little differently.”











            The Hornets haven't participated in a playoff series since 2015-16 — and haven't won one in more than two decades.

            This season has been a monumental struggle, especially with injuries. Forward Miles Bridges was charged with domestic violence in July. Then the Hornets had a string of injuries to key players — LaMelo Ball, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Cody Martin and Kelly Oubre Jr.

            It has contributed to Charlotte having the league's fourth-worst record (15-41) heading into Friday night's game against at Boston. While that may put the Hornets in contention to land Victor Wembanyama or Scoot Henderson — largely considered the top two prospects in the upcoming draft — it doesn't make them an attractive free agent destination.

            Kupchak said he's hopeful at some point down the road “maybe we can get a big fish,” but quickly added ""right now I don’t think that is how we have to look at it. I think what is more important is our draft assets.”

            The Hornets added a few more assets on Thursday.

            Charlotte traded veteran center Mason Plumlee, who is in the midst of the best season of his 10-year career, and small forward Jalen McDaniels in separate deals that netted them three second-round draft picks.

            Charlotte has five draft picks this year, two in the first round.

            The decision to part ways with Plumlee allows the Hornets to develop young centers Mark Williams and Nick Richards, who've both shown promise. It's a position the Hornets have struggled to fill since losing out on landing Anthony Davis with the No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft after finishing the previous season with a league-worst 7-59 record.

            “As good as Mason has been with us this last year in particular, our future is not with Mason Plumlee,” Kupchak said. “Our future is going to be with our young players.”

            Kupchak said moving McDaniels, a four-year player who has made big strides this season, was a difficult one. But it was clear he didn't want to make a big investment in McDaniels given how much he likes young swingmen JT Thor and Bryce McGowens.

            “We hate to lose Jalen, but you can't keep everybody,” Kupchak said.

            Despite rampant trade rumors, the Hornets decided against moving Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier before the trade deadline. If nothing else, it shows that Kupchak isn't willing to blow up the roster.

            “You have to be careful. This is one of those years where you can't really look at it and say ‘this is who we are and let's plan accordingly,'"" Kupchak said referring to Bridges and the injury situation. ""I'm not sure that this year shows where this team is in its growth. Maybe, I'm wrong. But a lot of this stuff this team and organization has had to deal with doesn't happen every year. They are unique situations.”

            As for Bridges, the team's leading scorer last season, Kupchak offered little in the way of the team's plans with him moving forward. For now, Bridges remains a restricted free agent.

            “The NBA is conducting an investigation and I don't know when that is going to end,"" Kupchak said. ""When it ends, we'll have more information and we'll go from there. I'll leave it up to you to decide what kind of impact that had on our team this year.""

It's a position the Hornets have struggled to fill since losing out on landing Anthony Davis with the No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft after finishing the previous season with a league-worst 7-59 record.“As good as Mason has been with us this last year in particular, our future is not with Mason Plumlee,” Kupchak said. “Our future is going to be with our young players.”Kupchak said moving McDaniels, a four-year player who has made big strides this season, was a difficult one. But it was clear he didn't want to make a big investment in McDaniels given how much he likes young swingmen JT Thor and Bryce McGowens.“We hate to lose Jalen, but you can't keep everybody,” Kupchak said.Despite rampant trade rumors, the Hornets decided against moving Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier before the trade deadline. If nothing else, it shows that Kupchak isn't willing to blow up the roster.“You have to be careful. This is one of those years where you can't really look at it and say ‘this is who we are and let's plan accordingly,'"" Kupchak said referring to Bridges and the injury situation. ""I'm not sure that this year shows where this team is in its growth. Maybe, I'm wrong. But a lot of this stuff this team and organization has had to deal with doesn't happen every year. They are unique situations.”As for Bridges, the team's leading scorer last season, Kupchak offered little in the way of the team's plans with him moving forward. For now, Bridges remains a restricted free agent.“The NBA is conducting an investigation and I don't know when that is going to end,"" Kupchak said. ""When it ends, we'll have more information and we'll go from there. I'll leave it up to you to decide what kind of impact that had on our team this year.""___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806847,Housekeeper never saw Alex Murdaugh clothes after killings,"Alex Murdaugh's housekeeper testified Friday at his double murder trial that she never saw the shirt and shoes the disgraced South Carolina attorney was wearing in a video hours before his son and wife were killed after their deaths.

            Prosecutors were trying to explain why certain expected things — like bloody clothes — have still not been put into evidence after three weeks of trial.

            Under cross examination, the housekeeper testified she never saw in Murdaugh's wardrobe a large blue rain jacket that tested positive for a significant amount of gunshot residue. She said Murdaugh wore extra-extra large clothes.











            Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering his wife, 52-year-old Maggie, and their 22-year-old son Paul near dog kennels at the family's Colleton County home on June 7, 2021.

            Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson said she did all sorts of work for the Murdaughs for well over a decade. She cooked, cleaned and did laundry, as well as did Maggie Murdaugh's banking. After the killings, she and her husband took care of the family's home when Alex Murdaugh couldn't bear to return.

            Murdaugh called her early the morning after his wife and son were killed and she rushed to check on him at his mother's home. Simpson testified that an emotional Murdaugh asked her to go to the family home and clean it up the way his wife would want it because there would probably be lots of people coming by to pay respects.

            Simpson got there about 12 hours after the killings. She said she saw state agents near the kennels where the killings took place, but no one at the home. There also was no crime scene tape up and no one stopped her before she went inside.

            Simpson testified about finding pots of leftovers in the refrigerator when normally the family left them out for her to clean up. She said Maggie Murdaugh's pajamas were also folded neatly in a doorway, which was unusual. She picked up a damp towel near a small puddle of water by the shower and a pair of khaki pants and washed them.

            State agents entered the home while Simpson was there, looking under beds and other areas, Simpson said.

            “I didn’t ask any questions. They didn’t ask me,” Simpson said.

            Earlier witnesses testified that state agents sent Murdaugh and several attorney friends, family members and others who gathered after the killings to the home so they wouldn't be in crime scene photos near the kennels. The defense estimated there were 12 to 15 people inside in the first hours after the bodies were found.

            During his questioning Friday, prosecutor John Meadors honed in on the clothes Murdaugh was wearing in a Snapchat video his son took a few hours before the killings — khaki pants, loafers and a seafoam-colored shirt.

            “Have you ever, ever, ever seen that shirt again?” Meadors asked.

            “Not to my knowledge,"" Simpson said.

            In cross examination, Simpson testified she never saw Murdaugh with a blue rain jacket that was found at his mother's home three months after the killing.

            State agents said the jacket had a significant amount of residue left on the inside after a weapon was fired. So far prosecutors have not put into evidence any bloody clothing, the shotgun they think was used to kill Paul Murdaugh, the rifle used to kill Maggie Murdaugh or fingerprints.

            Simpson said she never saw the couple have bad arguments — just a few disagreements over the paint to use while remodeling one of their homes.

            “The thing I remember Maggie saying is she wanted him to sit still and listen to her for at least 10 minutes,” Simpson said.

            Prosecutors again emphasized through Simpson that Maggie Murdaugh preferred to stay at the family's beach house on Edisto Island instead of the Colleton County home called Moselle. They said in opening arguments that Alex Murdaugh lured her to the other home to kill her.

            In cross examination, Simpson agreed with the defense that Maggie Murdaugh started retreating more to the beach house because she was getting harassed and treated badly in nearby Hampton after Paul Murdaugh was charged with felony boating under the influence in a 2019 crash that killed a 19-year-old passenger.

            Simpson said she considered all the Murdaughs family, but was especially close to Maggie Murdaugh.

            Months before the killings, Simpson said Maggie Murdaugh asked her to talk, closing the door behind her. She said she feared her family could have to pay $30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit over the boat crash.

            “We don’t have that kind of money,"" Simpson recalled Maggie Murdaugh saying.

            Later, she said of her husband, “He doesn't tell me everything.""

            Friday afternoon, an FBI agent testified about the locations of Alex, Maggie and Paul Murdaugh's cellphones the night of the killings. The information didn't differ from earlier testimony.Alex Murdaugh's housekeeper testified Friday at his double murder trial that she never saw the shirt and shoes the disgraced South Carolina attorney was wearing in a video hours before his son and wife were killed after their deaths.Prosecutors were trying to explain why certain expected things — like bloody clothes — have still not been put into evidence after three weeks of trial.Under cross examination, the housekeeper testified she never saw in Murdaugh's wardrobe a large blue rain jacket that tested positive for a significant amount of gunshot residue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806849,Cuban president to get Mexico's highest medal for foreigners,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — In the latest chapter in Mexico’s love-fest with Cuba, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be awarded Mexico’s highest medal when he visits the southern Mexico city of Campeche on Saturday.

            The Friday edition of the Mexican government's official gazette said Díaz-Canel will be awarded the “Order of the Aztec Eagle,” presumably with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador placing it around his neck during the Cuban leader's visit.

            The award — the country's highest honor for foreigners and decided mainly by the president — has previously been given to leaders ranging from Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran. 











            The award notification said the Cuban leader “has promoted cooperation between the two nations on health issues.”

            López Obrador praised Cuba on Friday for sending doctors to Mexico, some of whom serve in dangerous or remote areas. But those doctors, and the salaries they are paid, have raised controversy in Mexico. Some said the jobs should go to Mexican doctors, while other suspected that much of their salaries would go to the Cuban government.

            As president, López Obrador has gone out of his way to buy as much as he can from Cuba. But his purchase of everything from Cuban crushed stone ballast to the Abdala coronavirus vaccine have raised eyebrows. 

            Mexico bought 9 million doses of the Cuban-made Abdala vaccine in September 2022, with the doses arriving at year's end, when Mexico's vaccination efforts had already tailed off. 

            López Obrador's administration is using the Cuban vaccine as a booster, even though it was designed for coronavirus variants circulating in 2020 or 2021, not current variants. Few Mexicans have shown up to get the Cuban booster shots.

            In the rush to build his pet project, a tourist train that will run in a rough loop around the Yucatan peninsula, López Obrador has said he will import boatloads of crushed stone ballast from Cuba at great cost.

            The ballast is needed to stabilize the ties of the train tracks. Local stone in the Yucatan is not the right kind, and much has been shipped to Yucatan ports from Mexico's own Gulf coast.

            López Obrador has long been a fan of Cuba, and frequently plays Cuban “nueva trova” music at his daily news briefings.

            The president also been criticized for his links to other leftist regimes. His administration drew complaints for appointing a former Venezuelan official to a key position in the Public Education Department at a time when Mexico is revamping teaching methods and textbooks. 

            Despite his infatuation with leftist regimes abroad, the Mexican president has largely been conservative on social and fiscal issues at home.

            He brushes off critics who cite human rights abuses by the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes. 

            “It is conservative political posturing,” López Obrador said earlier this month. “It is like, ‘We are going to turn into Venezuela, we are going to turn into Cuba.’”MEXICO CITY (AP) — In the latest chapter in Mexico’s love-fest with Cuba, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be awarded Mexico’s highest medal when he visits the southern Mexico city of Campeche on Saturday.The Friday edition of the Mexican government's official gazette said Díaz-Canel will be awarded the “Order of the Aztec Eagle,” presumably with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador placing it around his neck during the Cuban leader's visit.The award — the country's highest honor for foreigners and decided mainly by the president — has previously been given to leaders ranging from Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran.The award notification said the Cuban leader “has promoted cooperation between the two nations on health issues.”López Obrador praised Cuba on Friday for sending doctors to Mexico, some of whom serve in dangerous or remote areas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806851,US jet shoots down unknown object flying off Alaska coast,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. military fighter jet shot down an unknown object flying off the remote northern coast of Alaska on Friday on orders from President Joe Biden, White House officials said.

            White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the object was downed because it was flying at about 40,000 feet (13,000 meters) and posed a “reasonable threat” to the safety of civilian flights, not because of any knowledge that it was engaged in surveillance. Asked about the object's downing, Biden on Friday said only that “It was a success.”

            Commercial airliners and private jets can fly as high as 45,000 feet (13,700 meters).











            Kirby described the object as roughly the size of a small car, much smaller than the massive suspected Chinese spy balloon downed by Air Force fighter jets Saturday off the coast of South Carolina after it transited over sensitive military sites across the continental U.S.

            The twin downings in such close succession are extraordinary, and reflect heightened concerns over China's surveillance program and public pressure on Biden to take a tough stand against it. Still, there were few answers about the unknown object downed Friday and the White House drew distinctions between the two episodes. Officials couldn’t say if the latest object contained any surveillance equipment, where it came from or what purpose it had. 

            The Pentagon on Friday declined to provide a more precise description of the object, only saying that U.S. pilots who flew up to observe it determined it didn’t appear to be manned. Officials said the object was far smaller than last week's balloon, did not appear to be maneuverable and was traveling at a much lower altitude.

            Kirby maintained that Biden, based on the advice of the Pentagon, believed it posed enough of a concern to shoot it out of the sky — primarily because of the potential risk to civilian aircraft. 

            “We’re going to remain vigilant about our airspace,"" Kirby said. ""The president takes his obligations to protect our national security interests as paramount."" 

            The president was briefed on the presence of the object Thursday evening after two fighter jets surveilled it. 

            Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, told reporters Friday that an F-22 fighter aircraft based at Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson shot down the object using an AIM-9X short-range air-to-air missile, the same type used to take down the balloon nearly a week ago.

            The object flew over one of the most desolate places on the nation. Few towns dot Alaska’s North Slope, with the two apparently closest communities — Deadhorse and Kaktovik — combining for about 300 people. The Prudhoe Bay oil field on the North Slope is the largest such field in the United States.

            Unlike the suspected spy balloon, which was downed to live feeds and got U.S. residents looking up to the skies, it's likely few people saw this object given the blistering frigid conditions of northern Alaska this time of the year, since there are few people outside for a prolonged period of time.

            Ahead of the the shoot-down, the Federal Aviation Administration restricted flights over a roughly 10-square mile (26-square kilometer) area within U.S. airspace off Alaska's Bullen Point, the site of a disused U.S. Air Force radar station on the Beaufort Sea about 130 miles (210 kilometers) from the Canadian border, inside the Arctic Circle.

            Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a tweet Friday that he had been briefed and supported the decision. “Our military and intelligence services will always work together,"" he said. 

            The object fell onto frozen waters and officials expected they could recover debris faster than from last week's massive balloon. Ryder said the object was traveling northeast when it was shot down. He said several U.S. military helicopters have gone out to begin the recovery effort.

            Later Friday, the Pentagon said: “Recovery is happening in a mix of ice and snow. Units located in Alaska under the direction of U.S. Northern Command, along with the Alaska National Guard, are involved in the response.”

            The unknown object was shot down in an area with harsh weather conditions and about six and a half hours of daylight at this time of year. Daytime temperatures Friday were about minus 17 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).

            After the object was detected Thursday, NORAD — North American Aerospace Defense Command —sent F-35s to observe it, a U.S. official said, adding that the military queried U.S. government agencies to make sure it did not belong to any of them, and had confidence it was not a U.S. government or military asset. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about sensitive national security matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

            Because it was much smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon, there were fewer safety concerns about downing it over land, so the decision was made to shoot it down when it was possible. That happened over water. 

            The mystery around what exactly the flying object was lingered late into Friday night. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement saying it was “not a National Weather Service balloon.”

            ""They do not hover,"" said NOAA spokesperson Scott Smullen.

            The development came almost a week after the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America. China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian craft and threatened repercussions.

            Biden issued the order but had wanted the balloon downed even earlier. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.

            The balloon was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for “several years,” the Pentagon has said. The U.S. has said Chinese balloons have flown over dozens of countries across five continents in recent years, and it learned more about the balloon program after closely monitoring the one shot down near South Carolina. 

            China responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”

The official was not authorized to speak publicly about sensitive national security matters and spoke on condition of anonymity.Because it was much smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon, there were fewer safety concerns about downing it over land, so the decision was made to shoot it down when it was possible. That happened over water.The mystery around what exactly the flying object was lingered late into Friday night. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement saying it was “not a National Weather Service balloon.”""They do not hover,"" said NOAA spokesperson Scott Smullen.The development came almost a week after the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America. China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian craft and threatened repercussions.Biden issued the order but had wanted the balloon downed even earlier. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.The balloon was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for “several years,” the Pentagon has said. The U.S. has said Chinese balloons have flown over dozens of countries across five continents in recent years, and it learned more about the balloon program after closely monitoring the one shot down near South Carolina.China responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”___Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington, Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska, and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage contributed to this report.",2023/02/11,104,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806852,Body-camera shows commander confront reporter before arrest,"A cable news reporter pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference had a heated confrontation with the leader of the Ohio National Guard just before the reporter was arrested, body-camera footage showed.

            NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest Wednesday after authorities said he was told to stop his live broadcast and then refused their orders to leave the news conference with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

            Lambert said afterward that he was just trying to do his job.











            
                Body-camera footage released by the Ohio State Highway Patrol showed Maj. Gen. John Harris Jr., commander of the state's national guard, talking with a camera operator before a state trooper motioned to stop the live shot. Police said Lambert was talking loudly while on the air from the back of the gym where DeWine was speaking at the same time.

            Harris started to walk away before he turned around, confronted and pointed a finger at Lambert and then briefly pushed the reporter with one hand in the chest, the body-camera footage showed. Lambert was also pointing and talking to Harris. A state trooper then stepped in between the two and moved away the commander, the footage showed.

            Harris later told police the reporter was coming at him in an aggressive manner and he felt threatened.

            “I instinctively put my hands on his chest to keep him from bumping into me, which I felt was inevitable if I had not protected myself,” Harris said in a statement made to investigators and provided by his office. He declined Thursday to comment beyond his statements to police.

            Authorities said that after the confrontation, Lambert was told to leave the news conference but refused several times. Officers then pulled him toward the exit and told him he was under arrest.

            Body-camera footage showed Lambert pull away from two officers who then pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him.

            ""This is what it’s like to be a Black reporter in 2023,” Lambert said while he was being held down, according to the footage.

            The two officers who handcuffed Lambert are white as is the Columbiana County sheriff who ordered Lambert to leave. Both Lambert and Harris, the national guard commander who is a member of the governor's cabinet, are Black.

            Lambert and NewsNation officials did not say in their statements afterward that race was a factor in the arrest.

            Lambert, who spent about five hours in jail before being released on a bond, said “no journalist expects to be arrested when you’re doing your job, and I think that’s really important that that doesn’t happen in our country,”

            Michael Corn, president of news for NewsNation, said Friday that the videos and body camera footage of the arrest speak for themselves.

            “Evan acted professionally and at a minimum is owed an apology,” Corn said.

            DeWine, who as governor was at the news conference giving an update about the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals, said he did not authorize the arrest or even see the disagreement, adding that reporters have “every right” to report during briefings.A cable news reporter pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference had a heated confrontation with the leader of the Ohio National Guard just before the reporter was arrested, body-camera footage showed.NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest Wednesday after authorities said he was told to stop his live broadcast and then refused their orders to leave the news conference with Ohio Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806853,Biden to visit Poland for anniversary of Ukraine war,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will travel to Poland this month to rally allies one year after Russia's assault on Ukraine began, the White House announced Friday, as he aims to sustain a coalition that has supported Kyiv's defenses.

            The visit, scheduled for Feb. 20-22, comes as polling in the United States and abroad suggests waning support for maintaining tens of billions of dollars worth of military and economic assistance for Ukraine in the protracted war. In addition, Republicans who recently took control of the House have voiced skepticism — or outright opposition — to continuing the funding.

            Russia, meanwhile, is believed to be planning a renewed offensive in conjunction with the anniversary, and has stepped up its long-range strikes on Ukraine's military and civilian infrastructure in recent weeks.











            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and the leaders of the Bucharest Nine, which are NATO allies in Eastern Europe, to discuss his “unwavering support” for the alliance.

            She added that Biden would deliver a speech on how the U.S. ""will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes.”

            It remained unclear whether Biden might attempt a visit to Ukraine as many other Western leaders and members of Congress have done. 

            Jean-Pierre said the administration will “continue to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes.” 

            Biden visited Poland just weeks after the war began on Feb. 24 when he delivered a forceful case for supporting Ukraine's defense in front of Warsaw's iconic Royal Castle. At the time, Biden said Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" though the White House swiftly backed off what initially seemed to be call for regime change in Moscow.

            First lady Jill Biden briefly crossed the border on a trip in May and met her counterpart, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska, in the latter's first public event since the war began. Biden, as well as White House officials, have highlighted the unique security challenges raised by a potential visit by a U.S. president to a country under invasion by nuclear-armed Russia.

            Biden in December hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, where the Ukrainian leader also pressed for additional Western weapons and support during an address to Congress.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806854,Nicaraguan bishop who refused exile gets 26 years in prison,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Roman Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez, an outspoken critic of Nicaragua’s government, was sentenced to 26 years in prison and stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship Friday, the latest move by President Daniel Ortega against the Catholic church and his opponents.

            A day after he refused to get on a flight to the United States with 222 other prisoners, all opponents of Ortega, a judge sentenced Álvarez for undermining the government, spreading false information, obstruction of functions and disobedience, according to a government statement published in official outlets.

            The sentence handed down by Octavio Ernesto Rothschuh, chief magistrate of the Managua appeals court, is the longest given to any of Ortega's opponents over the last couple years.











            Álvarez was arrested in August along with several other priests and lay people. When Ortega ordered the mass release of political leaders, priests, students and activists widely considered political prisoners and had some of them put on a flight to Washington Thursday, Alvarez refused to board without being able to consult with other bishops, Ortega said. 

            Nicaragua's president called Álvarez's refusal “an absurd thing."" Álvarez, who had been held under house arrest, was then taken to the nearby Modelo prison.

            Álvarez had been one of the most outspoken religious figures still in Nicaragua as Ortega intensified his repression of the opposition.

            Nicaragua’s Episcopal Conference did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sentence. Reached by the AP, Managua vicar Mons. Carlos Avilés said he hadn't heard anything official. “Maybe tomorrow.”

            The church is essentially the last independent institution trusted by a large portion of Nicaraguans and that makes it a threat to Ortega's increasingly authoritarian rule.

            Andrew Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said Álvarez's sentence “constitutes the most severe repression against the Catholic Church in Latin America since the assassination of Guatemalan Bishop Juan José Gerardi in 1998.”

            “Since first becoming the ruling party in 1979 the Sandinistas have repressed the Catholic Church like few other regimes in Latin America,” Chesnut said. “Pope Francis has refrained from criticizing President Ortega for fear of inflaming the situation, but many believe that now is the time for him to speak out prophetically in defense of the most persecuted Church in Latin America.” 

            Monsignor Silvio Báez, the former outspoken Managua auxiliary bishop who was recalled to the Vatican in 2019, said on Twitter “the Nicaraguan dictatorship’s hatred toward Mons. Rolando Álvarez is irrational and out of control.” 

            Álvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua, has been a key religious voice in discussions of Nicaragua’s future since 2018, when a wave of protests against Ortega’s government led to a sweeping crackdown on opponents.

            When the protests first erupted, Ortega asked the church to serve as mediator in peace talks. 

            On April 20, 2018, hundreds of student protesters sought refuge at Managua’s cathedral. When police and Sandinista Youth descended, the students retreated inside, leaving only after clergy negotiated their safe passage.

            “We hope there would be a series of electoral reforms, structural changes to the electoral authority — free, just and transparent elections, international observation without conditions,” Álvarez said a month after the protests broke out. “Effectively the democratization of the country.”

            By that summer, the Church was under attack by Ortega's supporters.

            A pro-government mob shoved, punched and scratched at Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes and other Catholic leaders as they tried to enter the Basilica San Sebastian in Diriamba on July 9, 2018.

            For nearly 15 hours overnight on July 13-14, 2018, armed government backers fired on a church in Managua while 155 student protesters who had been dislodged from a nearby university lay under the pews. A student who was shot in the head at a barricade outside died on the rectory floor.

            More recently, Ortega has accused the Church of being in on an alleged foreign-backed plot to depose him.

            Last summer, the government seized several radio stations owned by the diocese. At the time, it appeared Ortega’s administration wanted to silence critical voices ahead of municipal elections.

            The Holy See has been largely silent on the situation in Nicaragua, believing that any public denunciation will only inflame tensions further between the government and the local church.

            The Vatican’s last comment came in August when Pope Francis expressed concern about the raid of Álvarez's residence and called for dialogue.

            Earlier this week, judges sentenced five other Catholic priests to prison. They were all aboard Thursday's flight.

            Before the sentence was announced Friday, Emily Mendrala, a deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said “we see yesterday’s event as a positive step that could put the (bilateral) relationship on a more constructive trajectory.” But she added that “we still have concerns with the human rights situation and the situation with democracy in Nicaragua.”

            The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone Friday with Nicaragua Foreign Minister Denis Moncada about the prisoners’ release and “the importance of constructive dialogue between the United States to build a better future for the Nicaraguan people.” Presumably the conversation occurred before Álvarez’s sentence was announced.

            Vilma Núñez, director of the Nicaragua Center for Human Rights, which had been supporting prisoners in their cases, called the sentence “arbitrary and last minute,” noting that it included crimes that were not part of his original conviction.

            “The personal well-being and life of the Monsignor is in danger,” Núñez said. 

            After expelling nearly all of his most vocal critics, Ortega found himself stuck with the bishop in a still heavily Catholic country.

            “The Catholic Church, I think, is one of the main institutions that the Ortega regime really, really fears,” Antonio Garrastazu, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the International Republican Institute in Washington, said before the the sentencing. “The Catholic Church are really the ones that can actually change the hearts and minds of the people.”

            Prior to the release of prisoners, sanctions and public criticism of Ortega had been building for months, but both United States and Nicaraguan officials say the decision to put 222 dissidents on a plane to Washington came suddenly.

            The majority had been sentenced in the past couple years to lengthy prison terms. The release came together in a couple of days and the prisoners had no idea what was happening until their buses turned into Managua’s international airport.

            “I think the pressure, the political pressure of the prisoners, the political prisoners became important to the Ortega regime, even for the people, the Sandinista people who were tired of abuses,” opposition leader Juan Sebastian Chamorro, who was among those released, said during a press conference Friday. “I think (Ortega) wanted to basically send the opposition outside of the country into exile.”

            In Ortega’s mind, they are terrorists. Funded by foreign governments, they worked to destabilize his government after huge street protests broke out in April 2018, he maintains.

            Ortega said Vice President Rosario Murillo, his wife, first came to him with the idea of expelling the prisoners. 

            “Rosario says to me, ‘Why don’t we tell the ambassador to take all of these terrorists,’” Ortega recounted in a rambling speech Thursday night. In a matter of days, it was done.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806855,Blackhawks F Patrick Kane unsure about possible trade,"CHICAGO (AP) — While Patrick Kane is deciding if he is OK with leaving the Chicago Blackhawks — his only NHL home — the veteran forward is keeping track of the rest of the league.

            So, yeah, he definitely noticed the New York Rangers trading for fellow winger Vladimir Tarasenko on Thursday.

            “If things were going to happen ... that was a team that I was definitely looking at,” Kane said. “Yeah, it seems like they kind of filled their void and went ahead and made a deal.”











            The Rangers may be out of the picture, shelving a potential reunion for Kane and former teammate Artemi Panarin, but there are plenty of possibilities as Kane contemplates his future ahead of the NHL trade deadline on March 3.

            Kane and Chicago captain Jonathan Toews are in the final year of their contracts. The Blackhawks (16-29-5) are one of the league's worst teams, but Kane and Toews have no-movement clauses in the extensions they finalized in July 2014.

            They could decide to finish the season with their only NHL team. Or the three-time Stanley Cup winners could provide general manager Kyle Davidson the name of a team or teams they would be willing to join.

            As the deadline approaches, their decisions are being closely watched. 

            “Just trying to figure things out,” Kane said before Friday's 4-3 overtime win against Arizona. “Probably make a decision in the next couple weeks here and just go with that.”

            There has been no word of late from Toews, who has been out all week with an illness. He was scratched for the victory over the Coyotes, and he has been ruled out for Saturday night's game in his hometown of Winnipeg.

            “We're just letting him get his feet wet and get some strength back,” first-year coach Luke Richardson said. “He had, I guess, a really solid bike ride yesterday and felt good after, so that's a good first step.”

            Depending on what Kane and Toews decide — along with interest in forwards Max Domi and Sam Lafferty — the lowly Blackhawks could look much different very soon. 

            Richardson sounds prepared for whatever happens.

            “I knew the plan coming in, and we're not sure where it's going to go,” he said. “It just depends on what other teams call and want to do, more so than what we really want to do here.”

            Kane has nine goals and 26 assists in 47 games. His numbers are down this year, but he has been hurt by the lack of talent around him.

            Just last season, when Chicago had Alex DeBrincat and Dylan Strome, Kane scored 26 times and matched a career best with 66 assists in 78 games.

            The 34-year-old Kane also brushed off reports of a hip issue drawing concerns from contenders.

            “I feel better than I did last year, and I had a pretty good season last year,” he said. “So it's just one of those things. I think maybe the story leaks out and it piles up a little bit.”

            The Blackhawks are rebuilding under Davidson, and Kane and Toews could bring in more assets for the team's future plans. But the return on any trade could hinge on how many teams are in the mix for each player's services.

            That is solely up to Kane and Toews — something Kane said he is conscious of as he thinks about his next step.

            “You want to do right by the franchise, and the organization here has been amazing to me and given me so much,” he said. “So definitely want what's best for both sides.”

The Blackhawks (16-29-5) are one of the league's worst teams, but Kane and Toews have no-movement clauses in the extensions they finalized in July 2014.They could decide to finish the season with their only NHL team. Or the three-time Stanley Cup winners could provide general manager Kyle Davidson the name of a team or teams they would be willing to join.As the deadline approaches, their decisions are being closely watched.“Just trying to figure things out,” Kane said before Friday's 4-3 overtime win against Arizona. “Probably make a decision in the next couple weeks here and just go with that.”There has been no word of late from Toews, who has been out all week with an illness. He was scratched for the victory over the Coyotes, and he has been ruled out for Saturday night's game in his hometown of Winnipeg.“We're just letting him get his feet wet and get some strength back,” first-year coach Luke Richardson said. “He had, I guess, a really solid bike ride yesterday and felt good after, so that's a good first step.”Depending on what Kane and Toews decide — along with interest in forwards Max Domi and Sam Lafferty — the lowly Blackhawks could look much different very soon.Richardson sounds prepared for whatever happens.“I knew the plan coming in, and we're not sure where it's going to go,” he said. “It just depends on what other teams call and want to do, more so than what we really want to do here.”Kane has nine goals and 26 assists in 47 games. His numbers are down this year, but he has been hurt by the lack of talent around him.Just last season, when Chicago had Alex DeBrincat and Dylan Strome, Kane scored 26 times and matched a career best with 66 assists in 78 games.The 34-year-old Kane also brushed off reports of a hip issue drawing concerns from contenders.“I feel better than I did last year, and I had a pretty good season last year,” he said. “So it's just one of those things. I think maybe the story leaks out and it piles up a little bit.”The Blackhawks are rebuilding under Davidson, and Kane and Toews could bring in more assets for the team's future plans. But the return on any trade could hinge on how many teams are in the mix for each player's services.That is solely up to Kane and Toews — something Kane said he is conscious of as he thinks about his next step.“You want to do right by the franchise, and the organization here has been amazing to me and given me so much,” he said. “So definitely want what's best for both sides.”___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806856,Lawsuit seeks white woman's arrest in Emmett Till kidnapping,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A relative of Emmett Till is suing to try to make a Mississippi sheriff serve a 1955 arrest warrant on a white woman in the kidnapping that led to the Black teenager's brutal lynching.

            The torture and killing of Till in the Mississippi Delta became a catalyst for the civil rights movement after his mother insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago and Jet magazine published photos of his mutilated body.

            Last June, a team doing research at the courthouse in Leflore County, Mississippi, found an unserved 1955 arrest warrant for Carolyn Bryant, listed on that document as “Mrs. Roy Bryant.”











            Till's cousin Priscilla Sterling of Jackson, Mississippi, filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the current Leflore County sheriff, Ricky Banks. The suit seeks to compel Banks to serve the warrant on Carolyn Bryant, who has since remarried and is named Carolyn Bryant Donham.

            “We are using the available means at our disposal to try to achieve justice on behalf of the Till family,” Sterling's attorney Trent Walker told The Associated Press on Friday.

            The AP left a phone message for Banks on Friday, seeking comment. The sheriff did not immediately respond. Court records showed that the lawsuit had not been served on him by Friday.

            Till, who was 14, had traveled south from Chicago to visit relatives in Mississippi in August 1955. Donham accused him of making improper advances on her at a grocery store in the small community of Money. A cousin of Till who was there has said Till whistled at the woman, an act that flew in the face of Mississippi’s racist social codes of the era. 

            Evidence indicates a woman, possibly Donham, identified Till to the men who later killed him. The arrest warrant against Donham was publicized in 1955, but the Leflore County sheriff at the time told reporters that he did not want to “bother” the woman since she was raising two young children.

            Weeks after Till's body was found in a river, her husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam were tried for murder and acquitted by an all-white jury. Months later, the men confessed in a paid interview with Look magazine.

            Now in her late 80s, Donham has lived in North Carolina and Kentucky in recent years. She has not commented publicly on calls for her prosecution. 

            The U.S. Justice Department announced in December 2021 that it had ended its latest investigation into the lynching of Till, without bringing charges against anyone.

            After researchers found the arrest warrant last June, the office of Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said in July there was no new evidence to try to pursue a criminal case against Donham. In August, a district attorney said a Leflore County grand jury had declined to indict Donham. 

            Walker, the attorney for Till's cousin, said Friday that the South has a history of cases of violence that were not brought to justice until decades later — including the 1963 assassination of Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers, for which white supremacist Byron de la Beckwith was convicted of murder in 1994.

            “But for Carolyn Bryant falsely claiming to her husband that Emmett Till assaulted her Emmett would not have been murdered,” Sterling's lawsuit says. ""It was Carolyn Bryant's lie that sent Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam into a rage, which resulted in the mutilation of Emmett Till's body into (an) unrecognizable condition.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806868,"First war, now earthquake: Many Syrians displaced again","BEIRUT (AP) — Living for years in a tent camp for displaced people in Syria’s rebel-held northwest, Ali Abu Yassin used to envy friends and relatives who had brick walls around them and solid ceilings over their heads.

            The situation was turned on its head after Monday’s devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, killing more than 23,000 people, collapsing and damaging tens of thousands of buildings and potentially leaving millions displaced. 

            More than 20 of Abu Yassin’s relatives were killed when their apartment buildings collapsed from the quake in the nearby village of Bisnya, he said, including one cousin’s entire family of 14. 











            Abu Yassin made it to the village to help with rescue efforts.

            “It took us two days to pull out their bodies and bury them in a mass grave,” Abu Yassin said by telephone from the rebel-held province of Idlib. From the tent he had once wished to leave, the father of three said, “I am so lucky. It’s God’s will.”

            Before the earthquake, Syria's 12-year-old uprising-turned-civil war had already displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million. Abu Yassin was among them, fleeing from his home in another part of Idlib years ago.

            Now the earthquake has caused a new wave of displacement.

            The swath of destruction included the rebel-held enclave, centered on Idlib province, as well as heavily populated government-held cities like Aleppo, Hama and Latakia. The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said Friday that as many as 5.3 million people in Syria may have been left homeless. 

            For many, this is their second displacement.

            Wassim Jaadan left his house in the rebel-held village of Zardana in Idlib, then under bombing by government forces, and fled to Lebanon with his family in 2013. Nine years later, after Lebanon collapsed into a protracted economic crisis and they could no longer afford rent, Jaadan brought his wife and four children home to Zardana.

            “The economic situation was better than Lebanon, and we had our family, our parents here,” he said. 

            When the earthquake struck on Monday, the family was awoken by a light shaking that quickly became more violent. They escaped before the building fell and crumbled to rubble.

            The family now lives in a tent, which is nearly empty since all their possessions were destroyed. “We are about to die from the cold,” Jaadan said. “I am unable to think because of the shock.”

            UNHCR said in a statement that it is trying to ensure that shelters housing displaced people have adequate facilities, as well as tents, plastic sheeting, thermal blankets, sleeping mats and winter clothing. 

            However, aid has been slow to reach many areas. The first earthquake-related aid convoy of 14 trucks crossed through Turkey into northwestern Syria on Friday, a U.N. spokesperson told The Associated Press. The road to the Bab al-Hawa border crossing was obstructed for days following the earthquake due to road damage and debris from collapsed buildings.

            In the rural areas of northwest Syria, there are “tens of thousands of displaced people staying under olive trees in freezing temperatures,” Raed Saleh, head of the opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, said during a news conference Friday. Saleh said 500 buildings in northwest Syria have been completely destroyed, 1,400 partially crumbled and tens of thousands of homes were damaged.

            In other earthquake-damaged areas, displaced people crowded into temporary shelters in churches and mosques, schools, hotels and gyms.

            On Friday, in his first visit to areas hit by the earthquake, President Bashar Assad and his wife Asma visited two shelters in the northern city of Aleppo and a kitchen preparing 3,000 meals a day for displaced people. 

            In the coastal city of Latakia, a base of support for Assad, some 2,000 people on Friday evening crammed into the city's sports center.

            Under a banner with Assad’s face and a Syrian flag, the floor of the center’s basketball court was crowded with mattresses and sleeping bags. Families huddled in winter jackets to stay warm and ate hot meals provided by a local aid organization.

            Wardah al-Hussein, a 67-year-old mother of nine, said she has been sleeping in the stadium since the earthquake. Originally from Aleppo, she was now starting her second displacement.

            “We fled from our city and our house was destroyed, and we came here,” she said. “Now because of the earthquake we went through it all again.”

            Those whose homes were spared have opened them to relatives and neighbors.

            A resident of the rebel-held northwestern town of Atmeh, Mustafa Ali, said that already two families of relatives moved in with his family in his three-room apartment while they wait to see if experts will make sure their own homes are suitable for living. 

            “What people urgently need now is tents” as well as warm clothes and baby formula, Ali said.

            An aid worker based in northern Syria, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said eight sprawling facilities, including a center where coronavirus patients were once kept, have been opened to host the displaced in the region.

            Adding to the troubles of the displaced, he said, food prices are going up in the wake of the earthquake due to limited supplies. 

            “Our conditions are miserable,” he said. “I need aid now.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806873,Tiger Woods returns to Riviera to play 1st event of the year,"Tiger Woods is returning to competition for the first time without the use of a cart since July, announcing Friday he will play at the Genesis Invitational in Los Angeles.

            Woods was hopeful of playing next week's tournament at Riviera, where he is the host of an event that typically had the strongest field of the West Coast swing even before it became elevated with a $20 million purse.

            The uncertainty came from a bout with plantar fasciitis as he was preparing to play in December. That kept him from playing in his Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He played a made-for-TV exhibition over 12 holes and the PNC Championship with his son. Both times he was allowed to ride in a cart.











            Carts are not allowed on the PGA Tour — Casey Martin used one under the Americans with Disabilities Act — and Woods has said he was not interested in using one to play at the highest level.

            “I'm ready to play an ACTUAL PGA Tour event next week,” Woods said on Twitter, a reference to playing only three majors last year.

            It will be his first regular PGA Tour event since Oct. 25, 2020, when he tied for 72nd against a 78-man field in his title defense of the Zozo Championship. The tournament had moved that year from Japan to Sherwood Country Club in California because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Woods has said he can hit all the shots, “I just can't get from Point A to Point B.”

            “That’s awesome,” Max Homa said of the news after his second round in the Phoenix Open. “I imagine we’ll be carrying him down the hill on 1 and up it on 18, which no one would mind. But it’s awesome. I’m really glad he’s back. I think we’re privileged any time he plays now.”

            That Woods can play next week is an encouraging sign that he will return to the Masters in April, although missing the Bahamas was an indication Woods doesn't entirely control when his legs and feet will act up.

            “Any time Tiger can be present on the golf course playing makes the tournament even better,” Jon Rahm said at the Phoenix Open. “So, I’m hoping he can play comfortably and I’m hoping he can play well.”

            Woods was recovering from a fifth back surgery in February 2021 when he crashed his SUV on a coastal road in Los Angeles two days after the Genesis Invitational, suffering multiple fractures of his right leg and ankle. 

            Woods missed 14 months, and it was remarkable that he returned to the Masters last April and made the cut. He also made the cut in the PGA Championship, only to withdraw after the third round of Southern Hills with a severe limp. He skipped the U.S. Open to make sure he was ready for St. Andrews, but missed the cut in the British Open.

            “It’s great,” Justin Thomas said at the Phoenix Open. “Any time he is on property, let alone playing, is great for the event.”

            Riviera is where Woods made his PGA Tour debut as a 16-year-old amateur in 1992, and remains the one course he has never quite mastered. He played 11 times at Riviera as a pro, the most of any course without winning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806874,"Florida backs off athlete menstrual data, but debate lingers","Florida has backed off its effort to force athletes to give their high schools information about their menstrual cycles after the debate sparked opposition nationwide, and now, the state is facing questions about whether the plan was based on politics or policy.

            Doctors often ask students about their periods to figure out whether they are healthy enough to compete. But the issue exploded when the Florida High School Athletic Association proposed using a form that called for providing that information directly to schools, rather than just to health providers. 

            Critics questioned whether there were political motives as Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis weighs a run for the presidency. Opposition to abortion and transgender female athletes are core GOP tenants, and DeSantis has signed bills on both issues. 











            Amid the backlash, the association voted Thursday to recommend that most personal information revealed on medical history forms stay at the doctor’s office and not be stored at school. The new form, though, was changed to ask athletes their sex assigned at birth, rather than just their sex.

            Here is a guide on the conflict, what experts have to say about it and the lack of data on what other states have been asking families to share.

            WHAT CHANGES WERE PROPOSED?

            The proposed revisions to the form included four mandatory questions about menstruation: if the student has ever had a period, the age they had their first period, the date of their most recent period and how many periods they’ve had in the past year.

            An earlier version had asked questions about periods, too, but answering them was optional. 

            WHO WAS BEHIND THE PUSHBACK?

            Anger erupted over the proposal, with Democratic state lawmakers sending a letter calling the requirement “highly invasive” and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten decrying it as “dystopian"" in a tweet.

            Hundreds also went online to sign a Change.org petition called, “Privacy. Period!” Petition writer Jenn Meale Poggie said her 16-year-old, soccer-playing daughter was moved almost to the point of tears when she heard about the proposal.

            “That,” Poggie said, “is how profound these young girls are emotionally affected by this type of policy.”

            Questions about transgender athletes and abortion added to the debate. 

            “If this is being used to screen for risk for abortion or transgender, it’s a really misguided screen,"" said Dr. Judith Simms-Cendan, a pediatric-adolescent gynecologist in Miami, noting that irregular periods are commonplace among young teens. 

            DeSantis thrust himself into the national cultural debate over transgender rights in 2021 when he signed a bill restricting participation in girls sports in public schools to athletes identified as female at birth. He also signed into law last year a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. 

            The association’s spokesperson has said the proposed changes were not in response to concerns about transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, as some social media users have said. And association president John Gerdes stressed that neither the governor nor politics played a role in the discussions

            WHY DID THE COMMITTEE WANT THE CHANGES?

            The association’s medical advisory committee said it recommended making menstrual histories mandatory based on guidance from groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics.

            The pediatrician group, though, insisted that they never intended for information about menstrual histories to be provided to schools. “They’re not following our guidance,"" said Dr. Rebecca Carl, the chair-elect of the AAP’s Council on Sports Medicine & Fitness.

            Gerdes didn’t immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press asking why the association had misstated the medical group's guidance.

            WHAT DOES THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY RECOMMEND?

            The American Academy of Pediatrics worked with sports organizations to come up with a set of forms that doctors could use to evaluate would-be athletes, said Carl, also a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University in Chicago.

            One form, designed to be filled out by athletes and their families, inquires about things like drug use, eating disorders, mental health and menstrual histories. Period questions are important because heavy exercise can make menstruation stop temporarily, lowering estrogen levels and increasing the risk of broken bones, Carl said. 

            But only a medical eligibility form — with no information on menstrual histories — is intended to be provided to a school or sports organization, and it states that clearly. That form includes a spot for the doctor to include information about allergies, medications and whether the student is healthy enough to compete. 

            There are 26 states that use the latest version of the pediatrician group’s forms. Another 23 states and the District of Columbia use a variation of it. Only one state, New Hampshire, does not have a stated preferred form, said Andrea Smith, a nursing professor at Auburn University, who researched which forms states use as part of a study on cardiac risks in athletes.

            The National Federation of State High School Associations recommends that each state has an evaluation process, but doesn’t have details on what has been put in practice. 

            Carl, the pediatrician, said that there is variation. 

            “But,” she stressed, “they really should only be asking for this medical eligibility form. The AAP has been very clear and consistent on this.”

            WHAT IS THE CONCERN ABOUT PRIVACY?

            Even making menstrual history questions optional, as they were in the earlier form, raised alarms this fall. The Palm Beach County School District asked the association to ditch the menstruation questions altogether because it was offering a digital option for submitting the forms. In the past, the district maintained the records only in paper form.

            “Our concern is really that this is the information for health care providers,"" Carl said. “So where does it go when it goes to the schools? I mean, it could go to a third party to store it online. It could go into a filing cabinet that’s not protected adequately.""

            That was exactly the concern the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists expressed in a statement, noting the information supplied to schools isn't subject to HIPAA, the federal privacy rules that govern the health care industry.

            Simms-Cendan, a fellow with ACOG, said she spends lots of time instructing adolescents to even be careful about which period-tracking apps they use to ensure their data stays private.

            “There are really unscrupulous people out there,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806875,Super Bowl Guide: Where to watch and who to watch,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs is rapidly approaching. Here are some things to know ahead of Sunday's game: 

            HOW DO I WATCH?

            The game begins at 6:30 p.m. EST on Sunday and can be viewed on Fox, Fox Deportes and the NFL+ app. It can also be streamed on multiple services, including YouTube TV. The national radio broadcast is on Westwood One. 











            WHO ARE THE TEAMS AND PLAYERS?

            The Kansas City Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl for the third time in four years after winning another AFC Championship. The Chiefs won Super Bowl 54 against the 49ers after the 2019 season but lost to the Buccaneers after 2020.

            The Chiefs are led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who claimed his second MVP award on Thursday night. They've also got several other stars, led by tight end Travis Kelce and defensive lineman Chris Jones. 

            The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC championship and are trying to win their second Super Bowl in six years. They're led by quarterback and MVP finalist Jalen Hurts, receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and linebacker Haason Reddick.

            WHAT’S THE HALFTIME SHOW?

            Nine-time Grammy Award winner Rihanna is the headline act of this year’s halftime show.

            She’s had 14 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including “We Found Love,” “Work,” “Umbrella” and “Disturbia.” She and rapper A$AP Rocky recently welcomed her first child.

            “The setlist was the biggest challenge. That was the hardest, hardest part. Deciding how to maximize 13 minutes but also celebrate — that’s what this show is going to be. It’s going to be a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together,” Rihanna said.

            WHERE'S THE GAME BEING PLAYED?

            The Super Bowl will be played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. Glendale is a suburb of Phoenix.

            It's the third Super Bowl the stadium has hosted.

            The Phoenix area is no stranger to big events: In fact, two of them are happening right now. The Super Bowl is obviously attracting a lot of attention but the yearly WM Phoenix Open is also this week, drawing thousands of golf fans — and a steady stream of private planes — to the city to watch players like top-ranked Rory McElroy.

            The NBA even made a brief cameo: The Phoenix Suns acquired superstar Kevin Durant in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets late Wednesday that rocked the sport and galvanized the city's fan base.

            WHO IS FAVORED?

            The Eagles are favored by 1 1/2 points to beat the Chiefs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook, and the line has stayed fairly constant over the past two weeks. The over-under is 50.5 points.

            Picking the game’s winner is one of the basic ways to bet, but there are many, many prop bets gamblers can also choose.

            Sportsbooks have taken advantage of the increasing popularity of prop bets, which could range from whether there will be a safety to whether the Chiefs or Eagles will score more points than NBA stars LeBron James or Steph Curry when their teams meet the day before the big game.

            Professional sports bettors tend to make the more traditional wagers and look for value in the props if they believe they can find a betting number to exploit. For the most part, the props belong to the general public.

            WHAT WERE THE TOP MOMENTS FROM NFL HONORS?

            The league had its yearly “NFL Honors” show on Thursday night, with Mahomes receiving his second MVP and Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott earning the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year.

            Another highlight: Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin made his second appearance of the week, paying tribute to those who had a hand in giving him a second chance at life.

            Hamlin was on stage a little more than a month after he went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.

It’s going to be a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together,” Rihanna said.WHERE'S THE GAME BEING PLAYED?The Super Bowl will be played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. Glendale is a suburb of Phoenix.It's the third Super Bowl the stadium has hosted.The Phoenix area is no stranger to big events: In fact, two of them are happening right now. The Super Bowl is obviously attracting a lot of attention but the yearly WM Phoenix Open is also this week, drawing thousands of golf fans — and a steady stream of private planes — to the city to watch players like top-ranked Rory McElroy.The NBA even made a brief cameo: The Phoenix Suns acquired superstar Kevin Durant in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets late Wednesday that rocked the sport and galvanized the city's fan base.WHO IS FAVORED?The Eagles are favored by 1 1/2 points to beat the Chiefs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook, and the line has stayed fairly constant over the past two weeks. The over-under is 50.5 points.Picking the game’s winner is one of the basic ways to bet, but there are many, many prop bets gamblers can also choose.Sportsbooks have taken advantage of the increasing popularity of prop bets, which could range from whether there will be a safety to whether the Chiefs or Eagles will score more points than NBA stars LeBron James or Steph Curry when their teams meet the day before the big game.Professional sports bettors tend to make the more traditional wagers and look for value in the props if they believe they can find a betting number to exploit. For the most part, the props belong to the general public.WHAT WERE THE TOP MOMENTS FROM NFL HONORS?The league had its yearly “NFL Honors” show on Thursday night, with Mahomes receiving his second MVP and Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott earning the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year.Another highlight: Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin made his second appearance of the week, paying tribute to those who had a hand in giving him a second chance at life.Hamlin was on stage a little more than a month after he went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.___AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson and John Marshall, AP Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. and Associated Press Writer Terry Tang contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/12,400,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806876,Native dancers want Arizona gallery owner held on hate crime,"PHOENIX (AP) — Native American dancers who were the target of a suburban Phoenix gallery owner's racist rant as they were being filmed for Super Bowl week are pushing for hate crime charges.

            Gilbert Ortega Jr., the owner of Gilbert Ortega Native American Galleries, has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct regarding the incident, Scottsdale police said. 

            Cody Blackbird, a dancer and flutist who filmed the man's tirade, said his group doesn't feel safe, and that the confrontation has ruined what should have been a celebratory week. 











            “Us performers are now going in different entrances and parking in different places. This man is known,” Blackbird said. “There’s a 10-year-old girl who was there. She’s forever imprinted with ‘This is what happened when the Super Bowl came to town.’”

            The group is seeking the involvement of the FBI, U.S. Justice Department and Arizona Attorney General's Office.

            The confrontation happened Tuesday afternoon in Old Town Scottsdale, which has been seeing a high volume of visitors in town for the big game and the Phoenix Open. Ten dancers were performing in front of the Native Art Market on Main Street. ESPN was filming the group in the store and then had them pose outside by a Super Bowl sign.

            That's when Ortega started yelling at them, Blackbird said. In the video, Ortega can be seen mocking them and yelling “you (expletive) Indians” at one point.

            His shop was closed Friday, and a listed number appears to not be in service. There was no immediate response to messages from The Associated Press left at multiple phone numbers and personal email addresses listed for him seeking comment.

            In Arizona, there is no law specific to a hate crime itself. It can be used as an aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime where the motive was bias against a victim's race, religion, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability. 

            Disorderly conduct does not qualify for a hate crime designation under the FBI's definition, according to Scottsdale authorities. The FBI website describes a hate crime as “often a violent crime, such as assault, murder, arson, vandalism, or threats to commit such crimes.”

            Blackbird, who is of Eastern Band Cherokee and Dakota descent, said some Navajo performers heard Ortega make threats in their language that had violent and sexual innuendos. He also alleges Ortega charged at them and had to be physically restrained. He said he doesn't see why it's not being treated as a hate crime.

            “That’s what it’s seeming like, which really creates some horrible precedents, dangerous precedents,” said Blackbird, who has retained an attorney. 

            Meanwhile, the video has gained traction on social media and brought unwanted attention to Scottsdale. Mayor David Ortega, who is not related to the gallery owner, called his behavior “reprehensible and inexcusable.”

            “The behavior exhibited by this individual saddens and disgusts the people of our community,"" David Ortega said in a statement.

            The business is associated with a larger group of stores known for selling Native American items in the Southwest. But Ortega’s on the Plaza, located in New Mexico, said Gilbert Ortega Jr. is a distant relative and the Santa Fe store is not affiliated with him.

            “The family and employees of Ortega’s on the Plaza in Santa Fe condemn racism and discrimination in all forms,” Janelle Ortega said in a statement Thursday. “Furthermore, we consider it a great honor to carry and showcase the work of Indigenous artists and a privilege to support them in other important public and personal endeavors.”

            Blackbird said there are growing calls on social media for artists to boycott Gilbert Ortega Jr.'s business. He said racism exists even among people whose business hinges on Indigenous people.

            “That’s always been a thing in the Indian trader world,” Blackbird said. “They don’t care about the people that are making the items they’re selling and redesigning.""PHOENIX (AP) — Native American dancers who were the target of a suburban Phoenix gallery owner's racist rant as they were being filmed for Super Bowl week are pushing for hate crime charges.Gilbert Ortega Jr., the owner of Gilbert Ortega Native American Galleries, has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct regarding the incident, Scottsdale police said.Cody Blackbird, a dancer and flutist who filmed the man's tirade, said his group doesn't feel safe, and that the confrontation has ruined what should have been a celebratory week.“Us performers are now going in different entrances and parking in different places.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806879,"Prepped and eloquent, Zelenskyy wows Europe's leaders","BRUSSELS (AP) — Before the Ukraine war, Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to western European capitals as a junior partner, one of many leaders of poorer eastern countries looking for aid and attention.

            This week, he strode confidently through the halls of power in London, Paris and Brussels, pushing for warplanes and EU membership, and drawing admiring crowds.

            He showered European leaders with thanks, hugs and kisses for all their support so far to counter the Russian invasion — but grew ever bolder in his demands for more.











            The man in olive drab proved to be an overpowering presence who knows how to set the agenda in Western minds, as much as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has done from the other side of the frontline. 

            Behind closed doors during a whirlwind tour of European allies, Zelenskyy even surprised some European leaders by knowing more than they did about what weapons their arsenals hold that could help Ukraine, according to diplomats in Brussels.

            “He left an enormous impression, honestly, on all the leaders,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

            While Zelenskyy didn’t go home with fighter jets or promise of quick EU membership, his daring trip stepped up pressure on Western allies to do more to help.

            In Britain, he made an impact with a sweeping address to Parliament that prompted fawning praise from the Times of London: “In Churchillian cadences he echoed Britain’s wartime leader in insisting that ‘freedom will win — we know Russia will lose.’”

            For months Zelenskyy wanted Western tanks, and as part of Germany’s sea change in strategic policy Berlin agreed to provide some and let others do too. Immediately, the Ukraine president pressed on for fighter jets. And during Wednesday’s visit to Britain, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said combat planes were “part of the conversation,” adding that “nothing is off the table.” 

            As a trained performer — he is a former actor — Zelenskyy made a similarly strong impression appearing in the European Union’s Parliament and a summit of the bloc’s 27 leaders on Thursday. Host Charles Michel reminisced about the fateful Feb. 24 opening day of the Russian attack when Zelenskky took time to address the leaders from a bunker. Many were left wondering if they would ever see him again.

            Since then, the EU has spent or committed some 67 billion euros ($71.48 billion) in aid on Kyiv, and opened up a channel to funnel military hardware into the nation — a move that few would have thought possible just a year ago. 

            And Zelenskyy pressed on, insisting on more help in what he painted as an existential battle for Europe’s civilization. 

            Everybody wanted a piece of him in Brussels — and to be seen in a photo with him. Some leaders took him almost in a wrestling grip, pressing hands and elbows, kisses flying all around.

            An EU official who took part in the meeting described “a certain pride in having been able to mix with the star of the day.”

            And before the night was done, Zelenskyy’s magic started to have some effect.

            EU leaders pledged to look at boosting ammunition production for Ukraine. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a new 10-billion euro sanctions package under discussion would focus on depriving Russia of military goods it needs and cannot get anywhere else.

            And Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger promised to “work on” giving Ukraine its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets.

            It is not just the silver-tongued rhetoric. Some EU officials and leaders were stunned at Zelenskyy’s pinpoint preparation. 

            At the summit, he had meetings in small groups with EU leaders to ask them directly for the weapons he wanted. “Zelenskyy gave all leaders, each of them, a list of the material that was needed for the war,” said the EU official, speaking anonymously because the discussions took place behind closed doors. 

            “In fact, Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian team know better what each member has in his stocks than the leaders themselves,” the official said. “They know exactly what they need, and they know what they should ask for.”

            Some leaders vied to show they’re giving him what Ukraine wants.

            European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said allies should consider “quickly, as a next step, providing long-range systems” and fighter jets to Ukraine. Since the head of the EU legislature really has no say in this, EU member states were quick with criticism behind the scenes.

            And even Zelenskyy can get ahead of himself. Much though he has pressed to get EU membership talks started, a process that can take years, the EU has been holding off with polite diplomatic talk. 

            “Of course we need it this year,“ Zelenskyy said, then looked at summit host Charles Michel, and insisted, tongue-in-cheek: “When I say this year, I mean this year. Two, zero, 23.”

            Then he fell back on his past as a comedian. He laughed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806880,Defense: Club Q shooting suspect visited before bloodbath,"DENVER (AP) — The person charged with fatally shooting five people and wounding 17 others at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs last year was at the venue for more than an hour earlier that night before returning to carry out the mass shooting, according to information disclosed Friday during a procedural court hearing.

            Authorities have previously only said that Anderson Lee Aldrich was seen pulling into a parking lot at Club Q just before midnight on Nov. 19, 2022, where they entered and immediately opened fire.

            The new timeline was revealed in passing during the hearing by a defense attorney hoping to get an evidentiary hearing scheduled for later this month delayed, but he did not elaborate.











            Defense attorney Joseph Archambault argued that the hearing should be delayed until they can see all the security footage from inside the club that night to determine if, for instance, Aldrich was involved in any arguments or conversations with others or had been drinking. That information, he contended, could provide key evidence about whether the crime was premeditated or motivated by bias.

            Aldrich, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, is charged with hate crimes as well as murder and attempted murder. Someone who is nonbinary can be charged with a hate crime for targeting peers, because hate crime laws are focused on the victims, not the perpetrator. However, prosecutors must prove what motivated a defendant, a higher standard than what is usually required in court. 

            Prosecutors and the judge did not dispute the timeline, but what happened during that period earlier that night was not discussed directly, including what time Aldrich was there. There was also a reference to Aldrich being at the club on other occasions in 2021 and 2022, but those visits were not discussed. 

            Archambault wanted to delay a three-day hearing starting Feb. 22 to determine if Aldrich will stand trial in the case partly because there is no audio yet available for surveillance video showing them in the club before, which may have captured statements they or others made. 

            Archambault did not return a call seeking more details. His office has a policy of not speaking with reporters. 

            Chief Deputy District Attorney Reginald Short explained that technical problems had led to a delay of matching up audio with video by forensic video experts. He said he did not think any audio that is joined with the relevant video portions would likely do much to shed light on Aldrich's state of mind because it would be difficult to hear people talking. The surveillance video that does have audio has lots of disco music and other loud background noise, with people shouting over the din to order drinks at the bar, he said.

            Short also argued that the upcoming preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for Aldrich to stand trial only requires prosecutors to show probable cause that Aldrich committed the crimes, with the evidence viewed in the prosecution's favor at this stage of the proceedings. 

            “This is not a whodunit,” he said. 

            Matthew Haynes, Club Q’s co-owner, declined to comment on the disclosure and said he wants to remain focused on rebuilding the venue.

            Judge Michael McHenry denied the defense's request to delay the hearing, noting that not all the evidence must be presented, because the preliminary hearing is not a “mini trial."" However, he said that if new information comes to light after the hearing he would be open to considering whether that would be enough to consider releasing Aldrich on bond while the case proceeds.

The surveillance video that does have audio has lots of disco music and other loud background noise, with people shouting over the din to order drinks at the bar, he said.Short also argued that the upcoming preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for Aldrich to stand trial only requires prosecutors to show probable cause that Aldrich committed the crimes, with the evidence viewed in the prosecution's favor at this stage of the proceedings.“This is not a whodunit,” he said.Matthew Haynes, Club Q’s co-owner, declined to comment on the disclosure and said he wants to remain focused on rebuilding the venue.Judge Michael McHenry denied the defense's request to delay the hearing, noting that not all the evidence must be presented, because the preliminary hearing is not a “mini trial."" However, he said that if new information comes to light after the hearing he would be open to considering whether that would be enough to consider releasing Aldrich on bond while the case proceeds.__Associated Press/Report for America journalist Jesse Bedayn contributed to this report.

            Russian law requires organizations and individuals who are determined to have received foreign funding to identify themselves as “foreign agents,” potentially undermining their credibility and stifling dissent.

            The Justice Ministry said Abbas Gallyamov “distributed materials created by foreign agents to an unlimited circle of people, spoke out against the special military operation in Ukraine, (and) participated as an expert and respondent on information platforms provided by foreign structures.”











            Gallyamov, who wrote speeches for Putin during his 2008-12 stint as prime minister, is frequently quoted by foreign media. He recently attracted attention with an appearance on CNN in which he suggested Putin could face a military coup.

            The ministry said it also put pop star Zemfira Ramazanova, who performs using only her first name, on the list. She had publicly opposed Russia's military actions in Ukraine and received unspecified foreign funds, the ministry said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806883,Super Bowl's grass turf required nearly 2-year process,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Nick Pappas said tending to natural grass in the middle of the Sonoran Desert requires a little art, a little science and a little intuition.

            It also requires a whole lot of modern machinery.

            The NFL's players have made it no secret they prefer playing on natural grass as opposed to synthetic turf. They'll get their wish in Super Bowl 57 — thanks to Pappas and his small group of field specialists who are getting the surface ready at State Farm Stadium for Sunday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.











            “For this one, obviously, we're giving it a little extra care,” said Pappas, who is one of the NFL's field surface directors. “We've got a lot of groundskeepers here for about a month, putting eyes on it, putting hands on it, working on it all day, every day, getting it ready for game day.”

            The home field of the Arizona Cardinals is unique in that the grass is on a giant, rolling track. Every day, the entire field is rolled outside of the retractable roof stadium, where it can get unobstructed access to Arizona's abundant sunshine. Then it can be rolled back inside for the chilly winter nights. 

            It's quite a process: The stadium's website says the grass is on a “single 40-inch deep tray measuring 234 feet wide and 403 feet long. Rolling on 546 steel wheels which rest on 13 railroad-like tracks, the field travels the 740 feet inside or out of the stadium in approximately 70 minutes at the push of a button.”

            Only one of the NFL's other venues has a similar setup — Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas which is the site of Super Bowl 58 next year.

            The Super Bowl's field looked immaculate on Tuesday morning, with thick, lush grass, the NFL logo painted in the center and team logos in each of the end zones. This particular batch of turf — which has a Bermuda grass base that includes rye grass overseed — started growing at a local sod farm in May 2021.

            “It's a long process to get it as heavy, thick and dense as we've been talking about,” Pappas said. “We've got to make sure it takes its time, cures and gets ready.”

            Some of the NFL's players — including Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers — have said that they would like for the league to switch to natural grass in all of its venues.

            Fourteen of the league's 30 stadiums still use a version of synthetic turf. The Hellas Matrix Turf used in Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles is widely considered the best. It’s created using a textured and twisted monofilament fiber.

            But there's nothing quite like grass.

            “I prefer natural grass,” Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid said in November. “I’ve listened to all the studies, density studies, I’ve seen all the different compounds they’ve put in there. I still like grass.”

            So does Pappas, though he's worked with all kinds of surfaces during his time in turf management. This will be his fourth Super Bowl and he also helped the NFL manage its fields for international games this season played in London, Munich and Mexico City. 

            The Super Bowl presents some unique challenges, particularly with the extravagant halftime show. This year, nine-time Grammy Award winner Rihanna will take center stage. The yearly mid-game performance is essentially a minor miracle, with operations crews setting up and taking down a made-for-TV concert in about 30 minutes.

            That's a lot of moving parts that could potentially tear up Pappas' field.

            But the field surface director said it's just part of the NFL's biggest event, and there are rehearsals so everyone knows what to expect.

            “I sleep pretty well, all in all, because of the fact that we're disciplined,” Pappas said. “We have a large team here. We're doing everything we can every day. 

            ""We're doing a lot of testing, getting a lot of data and making data-based decisions on how we're managing the field.”

(AP) — A police officer in eastern Oklahoma shot and killed a 20-year-old man who brandished a weapon and fired at the officer, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806886,Safety investigators subpoena pilots over close call at JFK,"Federal investigators said Friday they issued subpoenas to force the pilots of an American Airlines jet to sit for recorded interviews about a close call with a Delta plane on a runway at New York's Kennedy Airport last month.

            The National Transportation Safety Board said it attempted to interview the crew members three times, but a union representative said the pilots refused to have their statements recorded.

            “NTSB has determined that this investigation requires that the flight crew interviews be audio recorded and transcribed by a court reporter to ensure the highest degree of accuracy, completeness, and efficiency,” the agency said in a preliminary report. “As a result of the flight crew’s repeated unwillingness to proceed with a recorded interview, subpoenas for their testimony have been issued.”











            The three pilots have seven days to respond to the subpoenas, which direct them to appear for interviews at NTSB headquarters in Washington. American said they are not currently flying for the airline.

            NTSB investigators won’t get to hear any conversation that took place among the pilots in the cockpit during the incident — in some cases, a very valuable investigative tool. The recording was taped over when the crew took off for London shortly after the close call. 

            The NTSB said the American Airlines Boeing 777 crossed an active runway on Jan. 13 without approval from air traffic controllers, and that led to a close call with a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737 that was taking off on the same runway.

            Disaster was averted when an air traffic controller, using an expletive, urgently told pilots of the Delta jet to stop their takeoff. Audio recordings show that the controller immediately communicated the severity of the situation to the American Airlines crew.

            The pilots have not been identified. The union that advised them not to sit for interviews said it objects that NTSB now records such interviews instead of merely taking notes, which the union says is accurate enough.

            “NTSB investigations are intended to be fact-finding proceedings with no adverse parties. We do not believe that this should be an adversarial issue,” the Allied Pilots Association said in a statement. 

            The union said that changing the interviews from notes to recordings “discourages otherwise cooperative witnesses from participating in the fact-finding process"" and runs against the purpose of promoting safety.

            The NTSB said that it has a long practice of recording some interviews, and that doing so is especially important in this case because the cockpit voice recording was overwritten.

            “It is unusual for pilots not to agree to be interviewed,"" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.

            American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it was cooperating with the NTSB. 

            The American crew took off shortly after the nighttime incident and completed its scheduled flight to London. The Delta pilots returned their plane to the gate. Delta put up passengers overnight, and the plane left the next morning for the Dominican Republic. 

            The cockpit voice recordings in both planes were lost as a result. The devices typically capture a two-hour loop before being recorded over.

            The NTSB said an air traffic controller at JFK was alerted to the danger of the American jet crossing the wrong runway by a surveillance system that lets controllers track the movement of planes and vehicles on the ground.

            The board said the American Airlines Boeing 777 and the Delta Boeing 737 were separated by about 1,400 feet at the closest point — a bit farther apart than previously reported.

            
                Another close call occurred last weekend at the airport in Austin, Texas, when a FedEx cargo plane was cleared to land on the same runway from which a Southwest Airlines plane was taking off. The FedEx pilots were able to abort their landing and avoid a collision.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806887,Column: No Super Bowl? No problem for millions of Americans,"For years, Sue Ferrara has followed the same routine on Super Bowl Sunday.

            And, no, it has nothing to do with the big game. 

            About the time the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs kick it off for the NFL championship, Ferrara will head to her two favorite grocery stores, reveling in aisles and checkout lines that are more wide open than a wide receiver after busted coverage.











            “I'm sure it will be a very, very well-watched game where I live,” said Ferrara, whose home in Princeton, New Jersey is pretty much the dividing line between those who root for the Eagles and those who back the New York Giants.

            “Which means when I got to Trader Joe's, there will be no one there. When I go to Wegmans, there will be no one there.”

            Get this: There are tens of millions of Americans who couldn’t care less about the Super Bowl.

            Count Ferrara, a freelance writer and school board member, among them.

            “I never connected with football,"" she said. “Then they started doing studies on CTE and the brain damage that can be done. I think football is past its prime, quite honestly.”

            Try telling that to all those folks who will be throwing elaborate parties and wagering billions of dollars on the outcome of a game that has become our unofficial national holiday.

            The Super Bowl is essentially the last major event that can unite so many Americans in a common purpose: sitting in front of a TV all day, washing down wings and nachos with plenty of ice cold beer, lamenting how they just lost 50 bucks because the coin toss was tails instead of heads.

            The official viewing audience — which came in at more than 112 million a year ago — dwarfs anything else in our increasingly fragmented media landscape. 

            A survey commissioned in part by the NFL claims 208 million-plus tuned in for at least some portion of last season's extravaganza, perhaps just to watch the halftime show and/or commercials.

            But even if you take the NFL's word for it, that means more than 100 million Americans didn't watch at all.

            People like Deepak Sarma, a professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who also serves as a cultural consultant for television shows and streaming networks.

            Until he went to the gym the other day, he didn't even realize Super Bowl Sunday was this Sunday.

            “I go to my locker and two guys I know are sitting around talking about some players and quarterbacks,” Sarma said, chuckling. “Now, I don't know the names of any of these things. I look at them like, ‘Ohhh, did someone say the Chiefs? Hey, are you talking about the Super Bowl?' And they're like, ‘Yeah, you big dummy.’

            “So I said to them, ‘Who’s in it?' And they said the Kansas City Chiefs and, uhh, the Philadelphia Eagles, I believe. They kept on going and I said, ‘When is it?’ And they were like, ‘Dude, it’s this weekend.' It was really funny. I had no clue because it's not interesting to me.""

            Many of Sarma's students apparently feel the same way.

            When he assigned two papers that are due on Monday — again, before he even realized what was happening the day before — no one in the class objected.

            “These kids will not be watching the game,” Sarma said.

            Neither will Alonso Duralde, a Los Angeles-based film critic. He and his husband don't have any special plans for Super Bowl Sunday, and they're hardly alone in Southern California.

            “We used to live in Dallas,” he said. “Super Bowl Sunday was a great day to go to the movies. You could count on it being pretty empty. In California, not so much. There's a lot of people who watch the game, but a lot of people who don't. People act like the streets are empty during the Super Bowl, but that doesn't really happen here.""

            Putting on his academic cap, Sarma wonders why sports — and the Super Bowl, in particular — has such an effect on American society.

            “It brings communities together in a really artificial way,” he said. “Do we need this? Why do we need this? They are great distractions when there's so many more important things going on.”

            From a more practical standpoint, this Sunday provides the rarest of opportunities for those who aren't worshipping at the Church of Goodell. (For those non-believers, Roger Goodell is commissioner of the NFL.)

            “We get to enjoy empty restaurants, empty gyms,” Sarma said, a hint of glee in his voice. “In a way, we get to reclaim our country. It's become kind of a meditative space apart from it all. We're not going to get sucked into it.”

            It's becoming easier and easier to avoid the Super Bowl hype. 

            With so many networks and streaming services, there are countless counter-viewing options for those who don't wish to watch a football game Sunday evening. 

            Come Monday morning, far fewer people will feel left out around the water cooler because so many are now working from home. (Do they even have water coolers anymore?)

            Even before the pandemic changed our work habits, Duralde found it was much easier to connect with those who didn't want to talk about zone coverages and point spreads.

            “Like anything, the internet has its good and bad sides,” he said. “But people are able to find other people who share the exact same interests as they do, whatever that is.

            ""The virtual water cooler is wherever you want to find it.”

            For those who tune out the game, there are some drawbacks to Super Bowl Sunday.

            For instance, when Ferrara is perusing the shelves at Trader Joe's and Wegmans, she probably won't find everything on her list.

            “Will there be any food left? Who knows?"" she quipped. “We could be eating the remains of the sushi no one wanted. Or the last sandwich that has something funky on it, like brie.”

            Duralde is planning a low-key day, like so many of his fellow Americans who won't be watching the Super Bowl.

            “There was a time when we would plan alternative events,” he said. “Ahh, yes, this is the day we go to the movies, or this is a day we go shopping.”

            Then Duralde uttered the words that many will consider heresy, but just as many view as gospel.

            “It's just,"" he said, ""another Sunday.""

I think football is past its prime, quite honestly.”Try telling that to all those folks who will be throwing elaborate parties and wagering billions of dollars on the outcome of a game that has become our unofficial national holiday.The Super Bowl is essentially the last major event that can unite so many Americans in a common purpose: sitting in front of a TV all day, washing down wings and nachos with plenty of ice cold beer, lamenting how they just lost 50 bucks because the coin toss was tails instead of heads.The official viewing audience — which came in at more than 112 million a year ago — dwarfs anything else in our increasingly fragmented media landscape.A survey commissioned in part by the NFL claims 208 million-plus tuned in for at least some portion of last season's extravaganza, perhaps just to watch the halftime show and/or commercials.But even if you take the NFL's word for it, that means more than 100 million Americans didn't watch at all.People like Deepak Sarma, a professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who also serves as a cultural consultant for television shows and streaming networks.Until he went to the gym the other day, he didn't even realize Super Bowl Sunday was this Sunday.“I go to my locker and two guys I know are sitting around talking about some players and quarterbacks,” Sarma said, chuckling. “Now, I don't know the names of any of these things. I look at them like, ‘Ohhh, did someone say the Chiefs? Hey, are you talking about the Super Bowl?' And they're like, ‘Yeah, you big dummy.’“So I said to them, ‘Who’s in it?' And they said the Kansas City Chiefs and, uhh, the Philadelphia Eagles, I believe. They kept on going and I said, ‘When is it?’ And they were like, ‘Dude, it’s this weekend.' It was really funny. I had no clue because it's not interesting to me.""Many of Sarma's students apparently feel the same way.When he assigned two papers that are due on Monday — again, before he even realized what was happening the day before — no one in the class objected.“These kids will not be watching the game,” Sarma said.Neither will Alonso Duralde, a Los Angeles-based film critic. He and his husband don't have any special plans for Super Bowl Sunday, and they're hardly alone in Southern California.“We used to live in Dallas,” he said. “Super Bowl Sunday was a great day to go to the movies. You could count on it being pretty empty. In California, not so much. There's a lot of people who watch the game, but a lot of people who don't. People act like the streets are empty during the Super Bowl, but that doesn't really happen here.""Putting on his academic cap, Sarma wonders why sports — and the Super Bowl, in particular — has such an effect on American society.“It brings communities together in a really artificial way,” he said. “Do we need this? Why do we need this? They are great distractions when there's so many more important things going on.”From a more practical standpoint, this Sunday provides the rarest of opportunities for those who aren't worshipping at the Church of Goodell. (For those non-believers, Roger Goodell is commissioner of the NFL.)“We get to enjoy empty restaurants, empty gyms,” Sarma said, a hint of glee in his voice. “In a way, we get to reclaim our country. It's become kind of a meditative space apart from it all. We're not going to get sucked into it.”It's becoming easier and easier to avoid the Super Bowl hype.With so many networks and streaming services, there are countless counter-viewing options for those who don't wish to watch a football game Sunday evening.Come Monday morning, far fewer people will feel left out around the water cooler because so many are now working from home. (Do they even have water coolers anymore?)Even before the pandemic changed our work habits, Duralde found it was much easier to connect with those who didn't want to talk about zone coverages and point spreads.“Like anything, the internet has its good and bad sides,” he said. “But people are able to find other people who share the exact same interests as they do, whatever that is.""The virtual water cooler is wherever you want to find it.”For those who tune out the game, there are some drawbacks to Super Bowl Sunday.For instance, when Ferrara is perusing the shelves at Trader Joe's and Wegmans, she probably won't find everything on her list.“Will there be any food left? Who knows?"" she quipped. “We could be eating the remains of the sushi no one wanted. Or the last sandwich that has something funky on it, like brie.”Duralde is planning a low-key day, like so many of his fellow Americans who won't be watching the Super Bowl.“There was a time when we would plan alternative events,” he said. “Ahh, yes, this is the day we go to the movies, or this is a day we go shopping.”Then Duralde uttered the words that many will consider heresy, but just as many view as gospel.“It's just,"" he said, ""another Sunday.""___Paul Newberry is the national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806888,Mexico turns to new national team soccer coach Diego Cocca,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Diego Cocca will have his work cut out as Mexico's new national soccer team coach, after Mexico failed to make it out of the group stage at the 2022 World Cup. 

            It was the first time Mexico hadn’t advanced to the round of 16 since 1978. 

            But the Argentine coach has a reputation for breaking losing streaks. Cocca, 50, was presented Friday as the new national coach, replacing Gerardo “Tata” Martino. 











            Some had been pulling for Miguel Herrera or Uruguayan Guillermo Almada to take over the helm. But Cocca was the coach who helped Mexico’s first-division Atlas team win its first domestic championship in 70 years.

            “I believe a lot in Mexican soccer players and their talent,” Cocca said. “But talent is not enough, you have to give them a whole lot of tools so they can take off, and that is my goal, I want to make them take off.” 

            “I want it to be a winning team and to be able to face whatever is thrown at it,” he said of the national team. “They sky is the limit.” 

            Cocca has something that Martino may have lacked: a deep connection and experience with Mexican soccer.

            Cocca played for Atlas, Veracruz and Querétaro in the Mexican league and has coached Atlas, Santos, Tijuana and, during a brief stint, the Tigres of Nuevo Leon.

            Cocca has his sights set firmly on doing better in the 2026 World Cup, which is to be held jointly in North America. Mexico hopes to have something of a home field advantage.

            “It is beautiful to dream of going to a World Cup and having happy people and filling stadiums, and even more so because it is going to held here,” he said.

            The director of Mexico's national teams, Jaime Ordiales, said the choice was the right one.

            “The analysis that we came to was that it isn't enough to debut players, rather you have to consolidate them to win,” Ordiales said.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Diego Cocca will have his work cut out as Mexico's new national soccer team coach, after Mexico failed to make it out of the group stage at the 2022 World Cup.It was the first time Mexico hadn’t advanced to the round of 16 since 1978.But the Argentine coach has a reputation for breaking losing streaks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806890,"Fox's Burkhardt, Olsen prepared to call their 1st Super Bowl","PHOENIX (AP) — Greg Olsen and his teammates at Wayne Hills High School in New Jersey knew it was a big game when Kevin Burkhardt showed up for interviews to prepare to call their game on local radio over the weekend.

            More than two decades later, Burkhardt and Olsen will be together in the booth for the biggest football game of the season.

            They will call their first Super Bowl for Fox on Sunday when the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.











            “I mean, it’s crazy, the full circle nature of Kevin and I’s relationship from where it started as a 16-year-old kid in high school who was just happy the local radio station guy wants to cover his game,” Olsen said. “He’s been by my side the entire time, and I’m very grateful for that comfort and friendship. We all know everything is about relationships and being around people you enjoy. I think that’s what makes this job a lot of fun.”

            Burkhardt’s career began in North Jersey as the sports director of a tiny AM station. He called some of Olsen’s games when he was a standout at Wayne Hills.

            As Olsen was winding down a 15-year NFL career, he expressed interest in becoming an analyst once his playing days were over. His audition with Fox ended up being with Burkhardt.

            In 2017, while playing for the Carolina Panthers, Olsen was part of a three-person booth with Burkhardt and Charles Davis for a game when the Panthers were on their bye week.

            In 2020, Burkhardt and Olsen worked five XFL games. After Olsen’s retirement in 2021, he joined Burkhardt again as Fox’s No. 2 crew on NFL games.

            When Joe Buck and Troy Aikman moved to ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” for the 2022 season, they moved up to Fox’s top team.

            Fox Sports CEO and Executive Producer Eric Shanks has been pleased with Burkhardt and Olsen’s work this season.

            “The amazing thing about people like Greg is kind of that essence of John Madden is that you’re a teacher and an analyst. If you have that gear of seeing things that other people don’t and explaining it, that’s the perfect combination,” Shanks said.

            While there have been 35 Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, the number of announcers who have called the game is smaller. Burkhardt becomes only the 12th to handle play-by-play duties for what is the most-watched television program every year. Al Michaels and Pat Summerall have the most with 11.

            Burkhardt joins a group that includes Dick Enberg, Curt Gowdy, and Jim Nantz.

            “I know how rare it is and how much of an honor it is,” Burkhardt said. “I looked up to those guys throughout my childhood and adulthood even. I feel very lucky to be in that group and be mentioned in the same breath.”

            Burkhardt, who has been with Fox since 2013, said he and Olsen maintained the same approach during the week they had even when they were the second crew. The only changes have been more viewers and cameras.

            “It’s been seamless, not just on the game but the whole week,” Burkhardt said. “We’re talking through things, and I’m picking his brain on certain ideas, and it just feels so easy.”

            Erin Andrews said the switch from Buck and Aikman to Burkhardt and Olsen has provided new energy to the crew.

            “You can feel the excitement they have. We’re doing Cowboys-Packers at Lambeau Field, and they start playing ‘Jump Around’ in the fourth quarter, and Greg’s like, ‘This is awesome.’ It’s been a cool jolt for all of us,” Andrews said.

            Olsen, who becomes the 24th analyst to call a Super Bowl, has emerged as one of the top analysts despite working under pressure this season. 

            Fox announced last May that Tom Brady would become the network’s No. 1 analyst and team up with Burkhardt after he retired.

            Brady said last Monday that he won’t begin with Fox until the 2024 season after he announced on Feb. 1 that he was wrapping up his playing career for good.

            That announcement was a relief to Olsen and the rest of the crew that they would be in place for another season.

            “To know now that we’re going to be able to go past this Sunday and move into next season is a big relief for me and something I’m excited about,” Olsen said. “I’ll approach this game the same way I did the entire year. You don’t know how many of these moments you’re going to get. As a player, you never know how many Super Bowls you will get to. We’ve had so many cool moments this year, but it can be fleeting and go fast.

            “I’ll try to continue to improve and just keep doing what we’re doing.”

            Olsen said the biggest key to Sunday’s game will be Kansas City trying to prevent Philadelphia from jumping to a big lead early. The Eagles have scored on their opening drives 12 times, including both playoff games.

            “The opening possession is going to tell us a lot. If I’m Kansas City, I have the best player in the world (Patrick Mahomes), but Philadelphia is such an aggressive team early that you’ve got to match or exceed that,” he said. “If the Chiefs fall behind, the Eagles will run at you, and those pass rushers will come at you. They’re built to play with the lead.”

            Vargas, a 22-year-old left-hander, has not pitched in a game since 2021 in the Arizona Rookie League. He was released by the Giants on Sept. 19.

            He became the second player disciplined under the minor league program this year after Arizona pitcher Jose Valdez, who was suspended for 120 games on Jan. 20.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806894,Tennessee GOP introduces bills that would shake up Nashville,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — For years, Nashville leaders have watched Tennessee's GOP-dominated Legislature repeatedly kneecap the liberal-leaning city's ability to set its own minimum wage, regulate plastic bag use and place higher scrutiny on police officers.

            Yet that simmering tension has only escalated this year as Republican lawmakers have introduced a string of proposals that local officials warn would drastically upend Music City.

            It's a common scenario felt in cities across the United States as statehouses flex their authority over municipalities, often while ignoring concerns raised by community members seeking to maintain local control.











            In Mississippi, Black lawmakers are denouncing a plan by the state's majority-white and Republican-led Legislature to take over power from the capital city of Jackson. Over in Missouri, lawmakers are pursuing legislation to strip power from St. Louis' prosecutor — a plan supporters say will address violent crime but is criticized by Black leaders. While the disputes in Mississippi and Missouri reflect racial tensions, the issue in Tennessee also involves conflicts in political ideology. 

            In Tennessee, the latest statehouse backlash stems back to last summer when Nashville's metro council spiked a plan to bring the 2024 Republican National Convention to the city. Progressive leaders argued that hosting the massive Republican gathering would go against the city’s values. Others expressed hesitation toward tying up so many city resources — particularly for an event that residents largely wouldn't attend. 

            For GOP leaders, who had spent months lobbying and wooing party officials on why Music City should host the convention, Nashville had crossed yet another line. Warnings began trickling in that consequences were imminent. 

            Nashville continued to attract political ire after council members began discussing whether to cover expenses for employees who cross state lines to get an abortion. That's because Tennessee's abortion ban — which was enacted after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — currently has no explicit exemptions.

            Lawmakers have been swift in filing bills that offer retribution. Legislation has been introduced that would slash Nashville's 40-member city council in half. A separate bill would give the state control of the governing board for the city's airport, stadiums and other landmarks, while another proposal would remove Nashville's ability to charge the tax that funds its convention center. Republicans then introduced a bill that would block cities from using public funds for reimbursing employees who travel to get an abortion.

            Advocates have raised alarm at lower-profile bills, like the proposal to eliminate all police oversight boards in Tennessee. Nashville has one, and lawmakers already restricted it under a 2019 law. Some Republicans have proposed a bill that would rename a portion of Nashville Rep. John Lewis Way to Trump Boulevard.

            Specifically, the effort to cut Nashville's abnormally large city council has sparked some of the fiercest concerns, as advocates warn that doing so will undo representation of minority communities and erode council members' ability to address constituent needs. 

            “When people reach out to us about trash pickup, about deaths in their family, about needing things and resources, these are individuals that we are in community with,” said Delishia Porterfield, who has served on Nashville's council since 2019. “And when you raise the number of constituents that we as council members serve, not only do you make our jobs harder, but you make us further from the people that elected us to serve.

            Nashville has a combined city-county government has operated under a 40-member council — significantly larger compared to some even more populous cities, including San Francisco — since 1963, when leaders were wrestling with consolidating the city with the surrounding county, and others were working to ensure Black leaders maintained a strong representation inside the southern city. 

            “When the city was consolidated, and the size increased to 40, there was a promise that we would have more Black representation,” said Democratic Rep. Harold Love Jr., whose father was among the first Black members to be elected to the newly expanded city council in 1963.

            “So for me, there are some deep historical ties to the size of metro council when it comes to Black and minority representation that I hope my colleagues would understand,” he said.

            To date, a quarter of the council's seats are held by Black members, half are held by women and five identify as LGBTQ. 

            Republican lawmakers, however, push back that they're explicitly punishing Nashville. House Majority Leader William Lamberth has said that reducing Nashville's city council would help make it more efficient.

            “There's a reason why juries are just 12 folks, not 50. When you have a group of individuals trying to make a decision, quite frankly, it's just less effective the more people that you have,” Lamberth said during a Tuesday hearing. “A smaller more cohesive group of individuals that fairly represent the diverse communities just work better.”

            House Speaker Cameron Sexton downplayed that the Legislature was “bigfooting” cities that dare to defy Republican policies and instead argued that lawmakers have an obligation to oversee local governments.

            “We want to make sure we don't get progressiveness in these cities that will limit businesses from coming into the state,” he said.

            Over the years, Tennessee Republicans have limited Nashville and other cities' ability to ban short-term rentals, including Airbnb. Lawmakers have barred cities from decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, which Nashville and Memphis had moved to do. And when Nashville's district attorney said he would no longer bring those cases or prosecute certain GOP social issue laws, lawmakers passed a requirement that puts a special prosecutor in place when a district attorney has pledged not to charge anyone under a law as a whole.

A separate bill would give the state control of the governing board for the city's airport, stadiums and other landmarks, while another proposal would remove Nashville's ability to charge the tax that funds its convention center. Republicans then introduced a bill that would block cities from using public funds for reimbursing employees who travel to get an abortion.Advocates have raised alarm at lower-profile bills, like the proposal to eliminate all police oversight boards in Tennessee. Nashville has one, and lawmakers already restricted it under a 2019 law. Some Republicans have proposed a bill that would rename a portion of Nashville Rep. John Lewis Way to Trump Boulevard.Specifically, the effort to cut Nashville's abnormally large city council has sparked some of the fiercest concerns, as advocates warn that doing so will undo representation of minority communities and erode council members' ability to address constituent needs.“When people reach out to us about trash pickup, about deaths in their family, about needing things and resources, these are individuals that we are in community with,” said Delishia Porterfield, who has served on Nashville's council since 2019. “And when you raise the number of constituents that we as council members serve, not only do you make our jobs harder, but you make us further from the people that elected us to serve.Nashville has a combined city-county government has operated under a 40-member council — significantly larger compared to some even more populous cities, including San Francisco — since 1963, when leaders were wrestling with consolidating the city with the surrounding county, and others were working to ensure Black leaders maintained a strong representation inside the southern city.“When the city was consolidated, and the size increased to 40, there was a promise that we would have more Black representation,” said Democratic Rep. Harold Love Jr., whose father was among the first Black members to be elected to the newly expanded city council in 1963.“So for me, there are some deep historical ties to the size of metro council when it comes to Black and minority representation that I hope my colleagues would understand,” he said.To date, a quarter of the council's seats are held by Black members, half are held by women and five identify as LGBTQ.Republican lawmakers, however, push back that they're explicitly punishing Nashville. House Majority Leader William Lamberth has said that reducing Nashville's city council would help make it more efficient.“There's a reason why juries are just 12 folks, not 50. When you have a group of individuals trying to make a decision, quite frankly, it's just less effective the more people that you have,” Lamberth said during a Tuesday hearing. “A smaller more cohesive group of individuals that fairly represent the diverse communities just work better.”House Speaker Cameron Sexton downplayed that the Legislature was “bigfooting” cities that dare to defy Republican policies and instead argued that lawmakers have an obligation to oversee local governments.“We want to make sure we don't get progressiveness in these cities that will limit businesses from coming into the state,” he said.Over the years, Tennessee Republicans have limited Nashville and other cities' ability to ban short-term rentals, including Airbnb. Lawmakers have barred cities from decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, which Nashville and Memphis had moved to do. And when Nashville's district attorney said he would no longer bring those cases or prosecute certain GOP social issue laws, lawmakers passed a requirement that puts a special prosecutor in place when a district attorney has pledged not to charge anyone under a law as a whole.___This story has been corrected to delete reference to Nashville having more city council members than New York and Chicago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806895,MATCHDAY: Arsenal hosts Brentford; PSG at Monaco,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Saturday:

            ENGLAND

            Arsenal is hardly in panic mode after a surprise 1-0 loss to Everton but the Premier League leader will want to get back on track when Brentford visits Emirates Stadium. Next week there's a showdown with second-placed Manchester City. Arsenal has a five-point lead and a game in hand over City. Brentford has four wins and two draws in its past six games. Chelsea will try to reboot its top-four hopes when it travels across London to face West Ham in a match that should offer an intriguing midfield duel between Enzo Fernandez and Declan Rice. Chelsea paid a British record fee to sign Fernandez, and Rice could fetch similar figures if he leaves the Hammers. Fourth-placed Newcastle visits second-from-bottom Bournemouth in the evening match. Leicester hosts Tottenham. Brighton is at Crystal Palace. Wolverhampton will try to build off its 3-0 win over Liverpool when it visits last-place Southampton. Fulham hosts Nottingham Forest.











            SPAIN

            While Real Madrid tries to win the Club World Cup final against Al-Hilal in Rabat, Morocco, Real Betis visits Almeria in the league trying to get back on track. With five losses to go with just one win in its last six games overall, Manuel Pellegrini’s side has slid into seventh place. Javier Aguirre’s Mallorca wants to build on its win over Real Madrid in the last round when it visits a struggling Sevilla that is perilously close to the relegation zone. Valencia is likewise near the bottom before it welcomes Athletic Bilbao, the team that eliminated it from the Copa del Rey quarterfinals last month.

            GERMANY

            League leader Bayern Munich is under pressure to beat Bochum at home with rivals all looking to capitalize on any dropped points by the 10-time defending champion. Union Berlin is just a point behind before its trip to Leipzig, which sees itself as a more likely title challenger. Fourth-placed Leipzig is just four points behind Bayern. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund is three points behind before it visits Werder Bremen. Both Union and Dortmund have won all their games since the league returned after its long winter break. Also, Pellegrino Matarazzo makes his debut as Hoffenheim coach against visiting Bayer Leverkusen, Freiburg hosts Stuttgart and Mainz welcomes Augsburg.

            FRANCE

            Paris Saint-Germain leads the league with an eight-point cushion over Marseille and Lens. On a seven-game unbeaten run, Monaco could snatch second place when it hosts an inconsistent PSG team that will be without Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. Monaco coach Philippe Clement is spoiled for choice up front with Wissam Ben Yedder and Breel Embolo. Ben Yedder has seven goals in his last six games while Embolo has notched five in his last five games. PSG has looked fragile lately, losing to Lens and Rennes in the league last month and getting knocked out of the French Cup by Marseille on Wednesday. Mbappe is still sidelined by a thigh injury, and Messi strained his hamstring against Marseille. Marseille plays at mid-table Clermont and will have defender Eric Bailly available again after he served a seven-game suspension. But Marseille will miss wing back Nuno Tavares, who is nursing a thigh injury. Clermont hasn’t found the net in its last three games.

            ITALY

            Lazio hosts Atalanta in Serie A with both sides locked in a tight battle for the Champions League qualifying spots. Lazio is just a point above Atalanta and one below city rival Roma, which visits lowly Lecce. Lazio and Atalanta endured setbacks last week. Lazio was held to a surprise draw at relegation-threatened Hellas Verona. Atalanta travels to the Italian capital without two key players after defender Joakim Mæhle and forward Luis Muriel were sent off in a loss at struggling Sassuolo. At the other end of the table, Spezia will be aiming to snap a four-match losing run when it travels to Empoli. That streak has left Spezia just four points above the relegation zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806897,Review: Jazz pianist Brad Mehldau and Beatles come together,"“Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays The Beatles,” Brad Mehldau (Nonesuch Records)

            Brad Mehldau and the Beatles make a captivating jazz combo.

            It helps that Mehldau’s piano stylings have a range worthy of the Fab Four. He bridges the divides between Debussy and Professor Longhair, between rock and Rachmaninoff, his rhythms tipsy at times as he evokes saloon music and comic opera.











            And that’s just on a 6½-minute rendition of “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer,” one of the 11 tunes on his new live solo album, “Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays The Beatles.”

            The album pairs jazz’s most lyrical living pianist with songwriting masters of melody, and Mehldau finds fresh radiance in the familiar tunes by exploring their elasticity, which is considerable. These performances show how Beatles songs invite improvisation thanks to their lilt, sturdy construction and sophisticated chord changes. Plus, as Mehldau observes in his liner notes, they swing.

            He plays “Your Mother Should Know” as jaunty, sunny ragtime, and “She Said She Said” calls to mind film noir. A slow, gentle account of “Here, There and Everywhere” twinkles with discordant splashes and hints of Thelonious Monk, while “I Saw Her Standing There” is rollicking boogie-woogie that would be at home in the French Quarter.

            Mehldau has long excelled as an interpreter of rock, the Beatles included, and to show the breadth of their influence, he closes the album with David Bowie’s “Life on Mars?” Mehldau’s version seesaws from Broadway buildups to blues reflections before a closing symphonic flourish, which provides the exclamation mark the album deserves.“Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays The Beatles,” Brad Mehldau (Nonesuch Records)Brad Mehldau and the Beatles make a captivating jazz combo.It helps that Mehldau’s piano stylings have a range worthy of the Fab Four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806899,"Adam 4th Ray in arbitration; Javier, Alvarado reach deals","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Reliever Jason Adam became the fourth Tampa Bay player to go to a salary arbitration hearing this year, asking a panel for $1,775,000 on Friday while the Rays argued for $1.55 million.

            Houston pitcher Cristian Javier avoided a hearing by agreeing to a $64 million, five-year contract, and Philadelphia reliever José Alvarado got a $3.45 million, one-year deal.

            Adam was 2-3 with a career-low 1.56 ERA and a career-best eight saves in 67 relief appearances, striking out 75 and walking 17 in 63 1/3 innings. He earned $1.15 million.











            A decision is expected Saturday from the panel that heard Adam’s case.

            Tampa Bay also is awaiting decisions in the cases of relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1,175,000) and outfielder Harold Ramirez ($2.2 million vs. ($1.9 million). Those decisions are being held for later cases to be argued or settled.

            Teams have won three of five decisions: All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle, while pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat Miami.

            A decision also is pending for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe.

            Javier gets a $2 million signing bonus, payable within 30 days of the deal’s approval by the commissioner’s office, and salaries of $3 million this season, $7 million in 2024, $10 million in 2025 and $21 million in each of the following two years.

            His salaries in the final two years can increase based on Cy Young Award voting, by up to $6 million in 2026 and $8 million in 2027. He would get a $2 million boost for each first-place finish, $1 million for second and $500,000 for third through fifth,

            Javier has the right to block trades to 10 teams without his approval in 2026 and 2027.

            A 25-year-old right-hander, Javier went 11-9 with a 2.54 ERA in 25 starts and five relief appearances last year, striking out 198 and walking 52 in 148 2/3 innings. He set career bests for wins, ERA, strikeouts and innings.

            Javier won both his postseason starts, pitching 11 1/3 scoreless innings in Game 3 of the AL Championship Series against the Yankees and Game 4 of the World Series against Philadelphia.

            He started a pair of no-hitters, pitching seven innings at the Yankees on June 25 and six innings in the game at the Phillies — just the second no-hitter in World Series history.

            Javier had asked for $3.5 million in arbitration and had been offered $3 million. He made $749,100 last year.

            New Houston general manager Dana Brown said Thursday that he’s als attempting to negotiate a long-term deal with outfielder Kyle Tucker, who was awarded the team’s $5 million offer Thursday rather than his $7.5 million request.

            Brown said he also is trying to reach long-term deals with second baseman Jose Altuve and third baseman Alex Bregman, whose contracts expire after the 2024 season.

            Alvarado went 4-2 with a 3.18 ERA and two saves in 59 relief appearances. He had a 5.56 ERA in 12 postseason appearances for the NL champions, getting the win in the Game 5 pennant-clincher against San Diego. Alvarado failed to hold a one-run lead in the sixth inning of World Series Game 6, relieving Zack Wheeler with two on and giving up a long three-run homer to Houston’s Yordan Alvarez. The Astros went on to a 4-1 victory that won the title.

            Alvarado had filed for $3.7 million and the Phillies’ $3.2 million.

            Ten players remain scheduled for hearings, which run through Feb. 17, including Philadelphia reliever Seranthony Domínguez.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806900,Louisiana man allegedly cut tails off live rodents in videos,"FRANKLIN, La. (AP) — Nutria — the large, semi-aquatic rodents native to South America — have become so invasive in Louisiana that the state wants them shot on sight, offering a $6 bounty for their tails. But the culling has to be done correctly, and animal abuse is a crime. 

            A Louisiana man has been arrested for allegedly cutting the tails off live nutria and then releasing the injured animals back into the wild. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release that agents were told Monday about videos showing the abuse on social media.

            They show the 45-year-old man from Patterson using a hook to catch a nutria and then severing the rodent's tail before letting it go. Agents found multiple similar videos, including images where the man taught a minor how to remove the tail while keeping the nutria alive, the department said.











            It's unclear why the man didn't kill the nutria, which cause widespread marsh damage on Louisiana's coast, The Advocate reported. The animals must be shot, not gaffed or speared. Using pitchforks, bows and arrows, and similar weapons also is not allowed.

            The man was arrested the next day on charges of aggravated animal cruelty, illegal hunting and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. He was fined $50, for failing to provide the juvenile with a personal flotation device while on his boat. Agents seized his Nutria Control Program permit and cell phone as part of the investigation.

            Penalties for cruelty to animals include a fine of $5,000 to $25,000 and up to 10 years in jail. Contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile carries a fine of up $1,000 and six months in jail. The illegal hunting charge could add another $950 fine and 120 days in jail.FRANKLIN, La.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806901,"How they compare: Trump, Biden, Pence classified documents","Classified documents keep showing up where they shouldn't be.

            
                The FBI search on Friday for additional classified documents at former Vice President Mike Pence's home in Indiana — after ot hers were found by his lawyers recently — followed the revelation of classified materials at President Joe Biden's Delaware home and former office and the seizure last year of hundreds of documents marked classified from Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of former President Donald Trump. 

            A look at similarities and differences among the cases:











            HOW MANY CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

            PENCE: “A small number of documents bearing classified markings” were discovered last week at Pence's home north of Indianapolis, Pence’s lawyer, Greg Jacob, wrote in a Jan. 18 letter to the National Archives and Records Administration, shared with The Associated Press.

            In all, four boxes containing copies of administration papers — two in which “a small number” of papers bearing classified markings were found, and two containing “courtesy copies of vice presidential papers” — were discovered, according to Jacob.

            On Friday, an FBI search of Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, uncovered an additional document that contained one page with classified markings, according to Pence spokesperson Devin O'Malley.

            BIDEN: It's unclear precisely how many classified papers have been recovered from Biden's home and former office. Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, said this month that “a small number of documents with classified markings” were discovered on Nov. 2, 2022, in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank in Washington, as Biden's personal attorneys were clearing out the offices.

            Sauber said Jan. 12 that a second batch of documents with classified markings — a “small number,"" he said — had been found in a storage space in Biden's garage near Wilmington, Delaware, along with one document located in Biden's personal library in his home. Days later, Sauber clarified that six pages, not a single one, had been found in the library.

            During a nearly 13-hour search on Jan. 20, FBI agents searching Biden’s Delaware home located six additional items that contained documents with classified markings and also took possession of some of his handwritten notes, said Bob Bauer, a lawyer for the president.

            TRUMP: Roughly 300 documents with classification markings — including some at the top secret level — have been recovered from Trump since he left office in January 2021. 

            In January 2022, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of documents, telling Justice Department officials they contained “a lot” of classified material. In August, FBI agents took more than 33 boxes and containers totaling 11,000 documents from Mar-a-Lago, including roughly 100 with classification markings found in a storage room and an office.

            HOW QUICKLY WERE THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS TURNED OVER? 

            PENCE: Jacob said the records were discovered by Pence lawyers on Jan. 16, secured in a locked safe and retrieved by FBI agents on Jan. 19. The four boxes of papers were delivered to the Archives on Jan. 23.

            BIDEN: After the materials were discovered at the think tank on Nov. 2, Biden's personal attorneys immediately alerted the White House counsel's office, which notified the National Archives, Sauber said. The Archives took custody of the documents the next day.

            Biden’s personal lawyers then began examining other locations where records might have been shipped after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017. They found documents on Dec. 20 in his Wilmington garage and on Jan. 11 and 12 in his home library.

            Sauber said that the Justice Department was “immediately notified” and took custody of the records.

            On Jan. 20, Biden voluntarily allowed the FBI to search his Wilmington home, where additional documents were located.

            TRUMP: A Trump representative told the National Archives December 2021 that presidential records had been found at Mar-a-Lago, nearly a year after Trump left office. Fifteen boxes of records containing some classified material were transferred to the Archives in January.

            A few months later, investigators from the Justice Department and FBI visited Mar-a-Lago to get more information about classified materials taken to Florida. Federal officials served a subpoena for some documents believed to be at the estate.

            In August 2022, FBI agents conducting a search retrieved 33 boxes from Mar-a-Lago while executing a warrant that showed they were investigating possible crimes including the willful retention of national defense information and efforts to obstruct the federal probe.

            The search came after lawyers for Trump provided a sworn certification that all government records had been returned.

            WHAT ABOUT POSSIBLE CHARGES?

            PENCE AND BIDEN: There is no indication either was aware of the existence of the records before they were found and turned over. 

            It appears both turned over the records quickly, without intent to conceal. That’s important because the Justice Department historically looks for willfulness, or an intent to mishandle government secrets, in deciding whether to bring criminal charges.

            In Biden's case, even if the Justice Department were to find the case prosecutable on the evidence, its Office of Legal Counsel has concluded that a president is immune from prosecution during his time in office. Former special counsel Robert Mueller cited that guidance in deciding not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump should face charges as part of the investigation into coordination between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.

            On Jan. 12, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of documents in Biden's possession. Robert Hur, the Trump-appointed former U.S. attorney in Maryland, will lead the investigation.

            TRUMP: The former president possibly faces exposure for obstruction over the protracted battle to retrieve the documents. And, since he's no longer in office, he wouldn't be afforded protections from possible prosecution.

            In November, Garland appointed Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor with a background in public corruption probes, to lead investigations into Trump's retention of classified documents, as well as key aspects of a separate probe involving the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to undo the 2020 election.

            WHAT HAVE THE THREE MEN HAD TO SAY?

            PENCE: In August, Pence told The Associated Press that he did not take any classified information with him when he left office, answering, “No, not to my knowledge” when asked directly if he had retained any such information.

            As vice president, Pence would have had the power to declassify some documents, though he hasn’t said that he did.

            On Friday, spokesperson O'Malley said the former vice president and his legal team “fully cooperated with the appropriate authorities and agreed to a consensual search of his residence.""

            BIDEN: Biden said earlier this month he was “surprised to learn"" that documents had been found at his think tank. He said he didn't know what was in the material but takes classified documents “very seriously.”

            His team ""did what they should have done,” Biden said. “They immediately called the Archives.”

            Biden told reporters at the White House Jan. 12 that he was “cooperating fully and completely” with a Justice Department investigation into how classified information and government records were stored.

            TRUMP: Trump, who had the ability when he was president to declassify documents, has contended at times that he did so regarding the documents that he took with him — though he has provided no evidence of that. He said in a Fox News interview in September that a president can declassify material “even by thinking about it.”

            The former president has called the Mar-a-Lago search an “unannounced raid” that was “not necessary or appropriate” and represented “dark times for our nation.”

            WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS?

            PENCE: As he lays the groundwork for a possible 2024 White House bid, the document discovery thrusts Pence into the debate over the handling of secret materials by officials who have served in the highest ranks of government. He had previously insisted that he followed stringent protocols regarding classified documents.

            BIDEN: His document disclosure could intensify criticism by Republicans and others who say that if Trump is guilty of anything, so is he.

            There are also possible ramifications in a new, GOP-controlled Congress where Republicans are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden’s administration.

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has said, “I think Congress has to investigate this."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, has requested that intelligence agencies conduct a “damage assessment” of potentially classified documents.

            TRUMP: The documents probe is one of many that complicate the former president's bid for the White House in 2024, particularly after it became clear that the DOJ had launched a criminal investigation into the retention of top secret government information.

            Trump and his supporters have described the Mar-a-Lago search as a partisan attack from Democrats.

            During his 2024 campaign launch in November, at the same club agents had searched months earlier, Trump cast himself as a victim of wayward prosecutors and “festering, rot and corruption of Washington.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806902,Polish leader asks court to vet bill that's key for EU aid,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said Friday he is sending a controversial new law on judicial accountability for constitutional review instead of rejecting it, because it could help unfreeze billions in European Union funds earmarked for Poland. 

            Brussels has suspended payment of the pandemic recovery funds to Warsaw saying the government’s policies of exerting control over the judiciary, especially through the Supreme Court, violate democratic principles. The EU has called for essential changes before Poland can get access to more than 35 billion euros ($37 billion) of grants and loans. Some previous changes proposed by Poland did not go far enough for the EU.

            The current law is intended to amend that, but the EU’s response is still to be heard. 











            Duda said in a televised address that he understands the urgency of the matter but needs to be sure the new law — approved by parliament on Wednesday, but criticized by the opposition and by some judges — is in line with the constitution before he gives his approval.

            “I have always been, and I remain, a supporter of compromise,” Duda said.

            “I want the (recovery) funds to be put to use as soon as possible since they are needed for the growth of Poland’s economy,” he said. “This is why I decided not to veto this amended law.”

            Duda, who has the authority to appoint judges, has voiced reservations as to the new bill and is referring it to the top Constitutional Court. The court has on many occasions upheld government-proposed legislation, including bills generally seen as controversial.

            Following months of negotiations, the government presented changes that removed the controversial powers of the Supreme Court to punish and suspend judges, as one of the so-called ’milestones” that Poland has agreed to meet to receive the recovery funds.

            Duda argued that sending the bill to the court will not delay efforts to have EU funds released for Poland, because there are still the other “milestones” to be met. He has appealed to the court to act swiftly.

            The bill was criticized in Poland, including among judicial circles where some argued that it was inconsistent with the country’s legal system. But the right-wing governing coalition insists it’s a compromise that should lead to the releasing of the funds, a process they say will take many months.

            The new regulations move the divisive disciplinary and immunity procedures regarding judges from the Supreme Court to the main administrative court. They also broaden the possibility for the sides in a court trial to vet judicial independence and authority.

            Other “milestones” that Poland needs to meet before the EU funds can be released include a bill that should liberalize permissions for installation of wind turbines.WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said Friday he is sending a controversial new law on judicial accountability for constitutional review instead of rejecting it, because it could help unfreeze billions in European Union funds earmarked for Poland.Brussels has suspended payment of the pandemic recovery funds to Warsaw saying the government’s policies of exerting control over the judiciary, especially through the Supreme Court, violate democratic principles. The EU has called for essential changes before Poland can get access to more than 35 billion euros ($37 billion) of grants and loans. Some previous changes proposed by Poland did not go far enough for the EU.The current law is intended to amend that, but the EU’s response is still to be heard.Duda said in a televised address that he understands the urgency of the matter but needs to be sure the new law — approved by parliament on Wednesday, but criticized by the opposition and by some judges — is in line with the constitution before he gives his approval.“I have always been, and I remain, a supporter of compromise,” Duda said.“I want the (recovery) funds to be put to use as soon as possible since they are needed for the growth of Poland’s economy,” he said. “This is why I decided not to veto this amended law.”Duda, who has the authority to appoint judges, has voiced reservations as to the new bill and is referring it to the top Constitutional Court. The court has on many occasions upheld government-proposed legislation, including bills generally seen as controversial.Following months of negotiations, the government presented changes that removed the controversial powers of the Supreme Court to punish and suspend judges, as one of the so-called ’milestones” that Poland has agreed to meet to receive the recovery funds.Duda argued that sending the bill to the court will not delay efforts to have EU funds released for Poland, because there are still the other “milestones” to be met. He has appealed to the court to act swiftly.The bill was criticized in Poland, including among judicial circles where some argued that it was inconsistent with the country’s legal system. But the right-wing governing coalition insists it’s a compromise that should lead to the releasing of the funds, a process they say will take many months.The new regulations move the divisive disciplinary and immunity procedures regarding judges from the Supreme Court to the main administrative court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806903,Sri Lanka surprises South Africa at Women's T20 World Cup,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Sri Lanka threw up a big surprise in the opening game of the Women's Twenty20 World Cup on Friday, holding its nerve in the field in a frantic finish to beat host South Africa by three runs.

            Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu hit 68 from 50 balls to set up a total of 129-4 after her team was put in to bat.

            Sri Lanka's bowling and fielding carried it home, though, with spinners Inoka Ranaweera, Oshadi Ranasinghe and Sugandika Kumari accounting for seven of the wickets as South Africa fell short on 126-9.











            Sri Lanka also pulled off two important run outs in the last two overs to cut short late counterattacks by South Africa tailenders Sinalo Jafta and Shabnim Ismail.

            Last batter Nonkululeko Mlaba lofted a drive over mid-off for four off the last ball of the game for South Africa but it didn't matter as the host needed eight off that delivery to win.

            Sri Lanka's players celebrated their famous win energetically at Newlands in Cape Town, and all ended up in a huddle on the field doing a team chant.

            Athapaththu was a crucial leader with her performance with the bat but also for marshaling her bowlers and fielders in the tense final overs.

            “I always try and lead from the front,” Athapaththu said. “I try and be a role model for the team. We played good cricket today.”

            Athapaththu hit 12 fours in her half-century and put on a partnership of 82 off 62 balls with 17-year-old Vishmi Gunaratne, who made 35 off 34 batting at No. 3 and promises to be the next star of Sri Lankan women's cricket after Athapaththu.

            The defeat for South Africa was a bitter blow and came after a tumultuous buildup to its home tournament when captain and allrounder Dane van Niekerk, one of the world's top players, was left out of the squad for the tournament for failing a fitness and conditioning test.

            The decision to drop Van Niekerk because she missed the cutoff time for a two-kilometer (1.2-mile) run by 18 seconds has stoked hot debate in South Africa. Coach Hilton Moreeng said the team's fitness requirements were “non-negotiable” and Van Niekerk ended up working as a TV commentator at the tournament-opener as her team lost.

            ""One game doesn’t define a team and the World Cup still has a long way to go,"" new South Africa captain Sune Luus said.

            Defending champion Australia, which has won five of the seven T20 World Cups played, starts its tournament against New Zealand in a night game in Paarl on Saturday. 

            England plays West Indies earlier the same day.

            The Aussies are favored to retain their title at the World Cup despite a surprise loss to Ireland in a warmup game this week, their first T20 defeat in nearly two years.

            “We come into this World Cup on level pegging with everybody else and we’re coming here to win and we know how difficult that is,” said Australia captain Meg Lanning, who has led her country to three of those World Cup titles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806916,Schalke fighting for Bundesliga survival after another draw,"GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) — Schalke’s bid for Bundesliga survival continued after drawing against Wolfsburg 0-0 on Friday, the struggling team’s third consecutive draw after a string of defeats.

            Schalke had two goals ruled out in the second half for offside, but can take heart from another encouraging performance after last weekend’s draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach as it cut the gap on relegation rival Hertha Berlin to just two points.

            Wolfsburg’s winless run stretched to four games. Captain Maximilian Arnold had the visitors’ best chance when he struck an early penalty against the left post.











            It was the only real chance offered by Schalke, which failed to create any attacking opportunities of its own before the break.

            Alex Kral headed just over after the break, then had a goal ruled out by VAR for offside. Schalke had another goal ruled out for offside in the 76th, when Michael Frey’s celebrations were cut short.

            Schalke remained last after 20 games. 

            Hertha hosts Gladbach on Sunday, while Stuttgart, Bochum and Hoffenheim are also fighting the drop.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806918,Police: Fatal stabbing reported at Minnesota high school,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A 15-year-old male student was fatally stabbed at a high school in St. Paul on Friday, and a 16-year-old boy was arrested, police said.

            The victim and suspect were both students at Harding High School, police Sgt. Mike Ernster said. 

            Investigators were working to determine what led up to the stabbing. Ernster said the preliminary investigation indicates that no one else was involved. 











            The school district said on Twitter that it locked down the high school at about 11:45 a.m. “due to a serious incident.” School was dismissed and students were sent home at about 1:20 p.m. All evening and weekend school events have been canceled. 

            Tish Tensley told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that her daughter, a sophomore, called her Friday morning and asked to be picked up immediately because someone had been stabbed. 

            “I told her that she needed to stay calm and that she needed to sit tight, because if she’s on lockdown, then there’s no way that I could get her out,” Tensley said. 

            The incident comes less than a month after a 15-year-old was arrested with a handgun at the school, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. No one was hurt in that incident.

            Tensley and another parent, Felicia Henderson, said violence has escalated at the school in recent years. Tensley said a group of boys assaulted a girl two weeks ago near the school’s entrance, sparking a brawl among dozens of kids while parents frantically tried to load their kids into their cars.

            “There was no police presence at the time,” Henderson said. “There was just kids fighting.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806919,US takes another step toward gearing up nuclear pit factory,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — 

            The U.S. agency in charge of producing key components for the nation’s nuclear arsenal has cleared the way for new equipment to be installed at a New Mexico laboratory as part of a multibillion-dollar mission, but nuclear watchdog groups say the project already is behind schedule and budgets have ballooned. 

            Approval for moving equipment into place at Los Alamos National Laboratory was first outlined in an internal memo issued by the deputy secretary of energy in January. The National Nuclear Security Administration, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Energy, made a public announcement Thursday.











            The work will include the design, fabrication and installation of gloveboxes and other special equipment needed to make the plutonium cores. The work will be split between Los Alamos in northern New Mexico and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, with the locations facing a congressional mandate to make at least 80 of the cores each year by 2030.

            The deadline for meeting that capacity has been pushed back, with the memo being the latest evidence that the minimum equipment necessary will be in place at Los Alamos by August 2030, or four years later than expected.

            The nuclear agency contends that installation of the equipment isn't necessary for Los Alamos to produce 30 pits per year, and that the lab will be building war reserve pits using existing equipment as the project proceeds. 

            Agency spokeswoman Shayela Hassan said in an email to The Associated Press that the NNSA expects an increasing number of pits to be produced each subsequent year until the new equipment is installed. She said that's when the capability will be in place to produce 30 pits each year “with moderate confidence.”

            The long-shuttered Rocky Flats Plant outside Denver was capable of producing more than 1,000 war reserve pits annually before work stopped in 1989 due to environmental and regulatory concerns. In 1996, the DOE provided for limited production capacity at Los Alamos, which produced its first war reserve pit in 2007. The lab stopped operations in 2012 after producing what was needed at the time.

            Greg Mello, director of the watchdog Los Alamos Study Group, said the NNSA has made contradictory statements about the delays and what they mean for the overall plutonium pit project. He pointed to NNSA statements in 2017 and 2018 in which the agency predicted problems if it were producing pits while also replacing gloveboxes and other equipment at the same time.

            “There is more they aren't saying,” Mello said. “We believe NNSA and LANL will struggle mightily, with further setbacks, failures and accidents in a misguided attempt to produce any meaningful number of pits in that cramped, aging facility.""

            The memo provides formal cost and schedule estimates for getting equipment in place at Los Alamos, but it's unclear when construction will begin. The cost has been pegged at roughly $1.85 billion.

            More details about spending and schedules are expected when the NNSA submits its budget request to Congress next month. 

            In January, the Government Accountability Office said in a report that NNSA plans for reestablishing plutonium pit production do not follow best practices and run the risk of delays and cost overruns.

            The GAO described the modernization effort as the agency’s largest investment in weapons production infrastructure to date, noting that plutonium is a dangerous material and making the weapon cores is difficult and time consuming.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806922,Kentucky governor: Storm relief fund 'open book' for review,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Donations that poured into a tornado relief fund started by Kentucky's Democratic governor have been spent or pledged, but Republicans are pushing for greater legislative oversight after reports surfaced that some checks went to people unaffected by the tragedy.

            Gov. Andy Beshear this week stoutly defended his administration's handling of the relief fund, formed in the aftermath of deadly storms that left trails of utter destruction in portions of western Kentucky in late 2021. The scenes of devastation spurred private donations from around the world, as the Team Western Kentucky Tornado Relief Fund swelled to more than $52 million.

            Beshear touted the fund's ability to respond quickly to help people in dire need, and for its level of transparency with a website tracking the distribution of money. The fund paid funeral expenses of storm victims and helped affected homeowners, renters and farmers.











            “This is an open book,” Beshear said at his news conference Thursday. ""Everything here is a public record. I’ve announced every single thing that we’ve done with it. It’s been on the website.”

            His administration's handling of the aid came under greater scrutiny after the state Public Protection Cabinet late last year issued more than $10 million in $1,000 increments from the relief fund. Reports surfaced that some people unaffected by the tornadoes were mistakenly sent payments. The Lexington Herald-Leader and WPSD-TV reported on the misdirected checks.

            State Treasurer Allison Ball’s office said it stopped payment on 196 checks from the fund. Republicans quickly unleashed election-year attacks on the governor's handling of the aid.

            Beshear is seeking reelection this year, and his response to storm disasters on both ends of Kentucky has contributed to his strong approval ratings in the GOP-trending Bluegrass State. A dozen Republicans will compete in the spring primary for the chance to challenge him.

            On Thursday, Beshear presented a specific breakdown of the reasons payments were stopped as part of his forceful defense of his team's handling of the fund.

            Nineteen checks were flagged for possible fraud, he said. Twenty-six payments were returned with explanations but did not necessarily indicate fraud, he said. Other reasons included recipients who had died, checks that had the wrong name or weren't received in a timely manner.

            Beshear said Thursday the relief fund had “an error or a fraud rate that is at or below 1%,” which he said compares favorably to similar publicly managed funds across the country.

            But state Sen. Whitney Westerfield, a prominent Republican, said the misdirected payments raised questions about how the fund was administered, prompting him to introduce a bill this week calling for legislative oversight of such relief funds.

            “How did they make distribution and disbursement decisions?” Westerfield asked. “How did they prioritize disbursements? How did they know how much to give each person?”

            The new bill would require that a report and analysis of all relief funds — including information on donors, expenditures and recipients — be submitted to lawmakers at the end of each fiscal year. It also seeks information on guidelines used to determine eligibility and allocate relief funds.

            Ball, the Republican state Treasurer, signaled her support for legislation to “rectify” what she called the lack of “appropriate oversight” of the fund, her office said in a statement Friday.

            A similar relief fund supported by private donations was set up by Beshear noted that the fund already is subject to public scrutiny through open records requests.

            “There’s nothing to investigate,” he said. “It’s all right there. But in terms of oversight or reporting, we’re happy to do regular reports — and if people want to put that into law, that’s fine.”

            Beshear, however, urged lawmakers to avoid actions that could jeopardize future relief funds or their flexibility to assist people in desperate need after disasters.FRANKFORT, Ky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806923,AP Source: Browns owners seeking share of NBA's Bucks,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam are taking another shot at the NBA.

            Looking to expand their professional sports portfolio outside of Ohio, the Haslams are in talks to buy a minority stake in the Milwaukee Bucks, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Friday.

            The Haslams have explored buying other pro teams, including the Minnesota Timberwolves in the past, and now are seeking the 25% share currently held by Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.











            There is no timeline for an agreement or sale, the person said. Sportico was first to report the Haslam Sports Group’s interest in the Bucks.

            Lasry and Wesley Edens, both New York investment firm executives, bought the Bucks from former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl for about $550 million in 2014 with pledges to keep the team in Milwaukee.

            The Haslams purchased the Browns in 2012 from Randy Lerner for $1.05 billion. They also own the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer and manage the stadiums for both of those franchises.

            The Haslams' tenure as NFL owners has been defined by losing and change. Cleveland has gone 60-119-1 and had one playoff appearance in the past 11 seasons. The team has also had six full-time coaches in that span.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806925,Alec Baldwin says part of shooting charge unconstitutional,"Alec Baldwin on Friday asked a judge in New Mexico to dismiss a five-year firearm sentencing enhancement in the charges against him, saying it is unconstitutionally based on a law passed after the shooting on the set of the film “Rust.” 

            “The prosecutors committed a basic legal error by charging Mr. Baldwin under a version of the firearm-enhancement statute that did not exist on the date of the accident,” a court filing from Baldwin’s attorneys said. 

            
                Baldwin and Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the weapons supervisor on the set of the Western, were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. 











            Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza. Hutchins' parents and sister filed a lawsuit over the shooting Thursday, after a similar suit filed by her husband and son was settled. 

            Baldwin's attorneys also filed a motion on Tuesday to disqualify the special prosecutor in the case, asserting that her position as a state lawmaker constitutionally prohibits her from holding any authority in a judicial capacity.

            Baldwin's legal team is mounting an aggressive legal fight against the charges before he has even made his initial court appearance, which is scheduled to take place by videoconference later this month. Baldwin has not been arrested.

            “Another day, another motion from Alec Baldwin and his attorneys in an attempt to distract from the gross negligence and complete disregard for safety on the ‘Rust’ film set that led to Halyna Hutchins’ death,"" district attorney's spokeswoman Heather Brewer said in an email. 

            She added that the prosecution team ""will review all motions — even those given to the media before being served to the DA. However, the DA’s and the special prosecutor’s focus will always remain on ensuring that justice is served and that everyone — even celebrities with fancy attorneys — is held accountable under the law.”

            The manslaughter charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed include two alternative standards and sets of penalties, and a jury can decide which to pursue, according to prosecutors.

            One version would require proof of negligence, which is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.

            The second alternative is reckless disregard of safety “without due caution and circumspection.” It carries a higher threshold of wrongdoing and includes the gun enhancement that could result in a mandatory five years in prison.

            But legal experts said Baldwin has a strong chance of seeing it thrown out. 

            “This is a violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution,"" said Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. “The government can’t pass a law and retroactively punish someone under that law. The judge is likely going to toss that enhancement and so Baldwin is just looking at a maximum sentence of 18 months in jail.”

            In court documents, the district attorney's office said reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset, and that Baldwin's ""deviation from known standards, practices and protocol directly caused” Hutchins’ death. 

            They cited Baldwin’s failure as an actor to appear for mandatory firearms training prior to filming and his decision as a producer to work with Gutierrez-Reed, who was an uncertified and inexperienced armorer.

            Baldwin's attorney Luke Nikas said when the charges were announced that they were “a terrible miscarriage of justice."" He said Baldwin relied on the professionals with whom he worked and “had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806926,"Giroud scores to beat Torino, end Milan's 7-game winless run","MILAN (AP) — AC Milan’s seven-game winless run across all competitions ended after Torino was beaten 1-0 by an Olivier Giroud goal in Serie A on Friday.

            The visitors failed to close down Théo Hernandez on the wing and the French left back crossed for his compatriot Giroud to score with a glancing header inside the far post in the 62nd minute. Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinković-Savić was powerless to stop it.

            Hernandez should have made it 2-0 minutes later but scuffed his shot wide in front of an open goal.











            Still, the defending league champions will be relieved to end their negative run after four straight defeats.

            Torino created more chances in the first half but the home team stepped up a gear in the second and missed a couple of opportunities before Giroud scored.

            Milan forward Zlatan Ibrahimović remained on the substitutes’ bench after returning to the team for the first time since his knee operation in May.

            It’s Milan’s first win since Jan. 4. The Italian giant next hosts Tottenham in the Champions League on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806927,Florida doctors' board tightens ban on gender-affirming care,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A prohibition against puberty blocking hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for minors in Florida was tightened further after a board overseeing doctors eliminated an exception for clinical trials Friday at the request of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration. 

            Some members of the public attending the meeting in Tallahassee shouted expletives, and law enforcement officers positioned themselves in the front of the room after the vote by the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine.

            The decision came after one member of the public after another testified at the packed meeting of the osteopathic medicine board and the Florida Board of Medicine that gender-affirming treatment had been ”magical"" and like “opening a prison door"" for them or their children. One transgender adult man during his testimony gave himself an injection of hormones in front of the doctors' boards. Others said treatment had stopped them from “fighting with themselves"" and contemplating suicide. 











            “I’m a teenager. Without getting this medicine at this crucial age I would have been waiting for my life to start,"" said L.J. Valenzuela, a trans man in high school who said he was getting hormone replacement treatment. 

            Judy Schmidt told board members that she worried that her trans son, who was 6 when he told her he was a boy, will have been transitioning socially for four to five years before he reaches puberty and won’t be able to get the gender-affirming care he needs.

            “You as doctors are supposed to do no harm,” Schmidt to the boards made up primarily by doctors. “If you make this blanket rule, you are doing harm.”

            The Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine approved rules last fall that prohibited gender-affirming surgery and puberty blocking hormones for minors, though minors receiving puberty blockers prior to the rules taking effect could continue to take them. The osteopathic medicine board made an exception for clinical research trials that examined the long-term impact of the treatments.

            During Friday's meeting, the Florida Department of Health asked the boards to tweak the rules to eliminate the osteopathic medicine board's exception for research. The DeSantis administration's health department got the ball rolling on curbing gender-affirming treatment for minors in Florida last year by petitioning the boards to pass the prohibition. In 2021, DeSantis, who is widely considered to be weighing a run for the Republican presidential nomination, signed a bill barring transgender girls and women from playing on public school teams intended for student athletes assigned female at birth.

            John Wilson, general counsel for the Department of Health, told the boards that the exception would create confusion since one board allowed it, but the other didn't.

            “The department is concerned the exception undermines the purpose of this rule,” Wilson said.

            State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, called the prohibition against gender-affirming care “politically motivated.""

            “We should not be making policy based on who can make a fundraising letter off it,” Eskamani said.

            Florida Board of Medicine member Hector Vila disputed that interpretation of the boards' actions.

            “This isn’t about trans- or homophobia,” said Vila, a doctor in Tampa. “This isn’t about politics.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806929,Nice wins 4th straight in Ligue 1 after beating Ajaccio 3-0,"NICE, France (AP) — Billal Brahimi scored twice with spectacular long-range strikes as Nice beat Ajaccio 3-0 for a fourth straight win in the French league on Friday.

            Nice climbed to seventh place to pull within three points of a Europa Conference League spot while Ajaccio remained in the relegation zone.

            Brazilian veteran Dante scored his first goal of the season by meeting a cross from Badredine Bouanani to fire home a half-volley in the third minute.











            Brahimi came off the bench to double the lead with a curling shot from the edge of the box in the 70th. The Algeria international sealed the win with an even more outrageous strike into the far corner in the 90th.

            Nice coach Didier Digard was full of praise for Brahimi, who has been struggling for playing time this season.

            “He was making a lot of efforts and wasn't rewarded with goals until recently,” Digard said. “We simply told him what we saw in him and maybe he's realizing that he has qualities.”

            Teenage winger Bouanani proved the main threat for Nice in the first half. He picked out Gaetan Laborde, who failed to make contact with the ball at the far post. Bouanani then had a deflected cross that bounced off the bar.

            Nice has taken 16 points from 18 since since Didier Digard replaced Lucien Favre as coach last month.

            On Saturday, league leader Paris Saint-Germain visits Monaco while second-placed Marseille plays Clermont.

            The lawsuit filed Thursday by two Pennsylvania residents calls for the rail operator to pay for medical screenings and related care for anyone living within a 30-mile (48-kilometer) radius of the derailment to determine who was affected by toxic substances released after the derailment. The lawsuit also is seeking undetermined damages.

            About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed Feb. 3 in the Ohio village of East Palestine. No one was injured in the derailment that investigators said was caused by a broken axle.











            Three days after the accident, authorities decided to release and burn vinyl chloride inside five tanker cars, sending hydrogen chloride and the toxic gas phosgene into the air.

            Environmental regulators have been monitoring the air and water in surrounding communities and have said that so far the air quality remains safe and drinking water supplies have not been affected.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806932,Ace Yu Darvish's contract with Padres runs through age 42,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — After Yu Darvish finished answering a question about his new $108 million, six-year contract, the 36-year-old San Diego Padres ace turned to his interpreter, Shingo Horie, and added a thought.

            “He still doesn’t believe if this is true or not; if it’s a prank,” Horie said.

            It’s true, all right. Neither Darvish nor the Padres think the tall right-hander is anywhere close to being finished. He’s coming off one of his better seasons, when he helped lead the Padres on a stirring run to the NL Championship Series, and said he’ll do what it takes to still be pitching at a high level when he turns 42 late in the 2028 season, the last year of his deal.











            “I just want to go as far as I can go and just kind of push myself as hard as I can,” Darvish said at a news conference Friday. “One thing I can say is the preparation will always be there; the hard work is always going to be there. We’ll see how far we can go.”

            Darvish, who has a baffling array of pitches, is set to make $108 million over six years, including the $18 million he was already due in 2023 before he was to become a free agent.

            Darvish was traded by the Cubs to the Padres before the 2020 season. He’s coming off one of the best years in his 11-year big league career, when he was 16-8 with a 3.10 ERA and 197 strikeouts. He was 2-1 in the postseason.

            “I never thought I would get six years. You’re not really 100% sure of how far you can go just because it’s something in the future,” Darvish said.

            The pitcher mentioned a conversation he had with owner Peter Seidler, who has shown he’s not afraid to spend big, and Preller.

            “You really feel the appreciation, the trust that they have for me,” Darvish said. “That’s a big deal to me. That means a whole lot to me. That’s probably a big reason why I decided to stay here.”

            The extension comes as the Padres head into arguably the most anticipated season in the history of a franchise that hasn’t played in the World Series since 1998 and has never won one. The Padres signed shortstop Xander Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year deal in December and will add Fernando Tatis Jr. to the active roster on April 20 after he finishes an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.

            “I’m just tremendously honored to be in their plan,” Darvish said. “Obviously this organization is going the right way as far as winning games and just being considered as part of that piece is very comforting.”

            The Padres made this deal “with a lot of belief in him,” Preller said. “He’s a unique pitcher. He’s got a unique style; he’s got a lot of different ways to get you out. It’s not just based on velocity and power. He’s got all different weapons and pitchability components. I think from our standpoint we feel he’s going to perform as a top guy through this contract.”

            Preller added that Darvish “has different versions of himself. We’ve seven, eight, nine different pitches and I think his ability to continue to reinvent and do different things on the mound, that will serve him well really at any stage, we feel, over the next six years.”

            Preller said it gives the Padres “a lot of comfort” to have their two top pitchers, Darvish and Joe Musgrove, locked up long-term. Musgrove, who grew up a Padres fan in suburban El Cajon and was a first-time All-Star in 2022, signed a $100 million, five-year deal in July.

            “They exemplify what we want to be about in terms of work ethic and always wanting to get better,” Preller said. “Those are the guys that usually beat the aging curve and will be the long-time performers. We’ve got a lot of talented guys and feel like Darvish is up there with anybody on our roster.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806933,Texas state police won't punish more officers over Uvalde,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas state police will not discipline any more of its officers over the Uvalde school shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead as heavily armed agents hesitated to confront the lone gunman, a spokesperson confirmed Friday.

            The decision is a turning point nearly nine months after one of the worst school attacks in U.S. history, and the widespread outrage over the officers who allowed more than 70 minutes to go by before stopping the massacre. 

            It also raises new questions about how many of the nearly 400 law enforcement personnel who were at Robb Elementary School last May might face discipline. They came from a constellation of agencies in South Texas, including the Texas Department of Public Safety, U.S. Border Patrol and local police. Two DPS officers have been fired, and one of them is appealing his termination. 











            In total, five officers in Texas who were on the scene that day are known to have either been fired or resigned.

            State police had 91 officers on the scene, more than any other law enforcement agency. Travis Considine, a spokesman for the department, confirmed Friday that four of seven officers placed under internal review after the shooting were cleared of wrongdoing. DPS Director Steve McCraw told The Dallas Morning News on Thursday that no others would face discipline. 

            “Just the two,” McCraw said.

            Officers on the scene waited more than 70 minutes before a team finally breached a fourth-grade classroom and confronted the 18-year-old gunman, who had been armed with an AR-15 style rifle and fired more than 140 rounds inside the school, according to an investigative report by Texas lawmakers.

            Body camera video, school surveillance footage and witness accounts have since laid bare the lengthy inaction by police and how no officers rushed to stop the attack. McCraw has called the response an “abject failure.""

            The first DPS officer was fired in October. Another of the seven resigned before the review was finished, then joined the Uvalde school district as a campus police officer. She was fired less than 24 hours after outraged parents in Uvalde found out about her hiring.

            Uvalde's school police chief at the the time of the attack was fired in August and the city's acting police chief that day later stepped down. 

            Several parents of the victims have demanded for months that McCraw resign. Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district includes Uvalde, has also said McCraw should go. But the longtime DPS director reiterated to reporters Thursday that he planned to stay on the job.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806935,"SC's Boston, LSU's Reese square off in undefeated seasons","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Angel Reese thought hard about joining South Carolina when she was transferring from Maryland last offseason. 

            If she had, there might not have been enough points or rebounds for anyone other than herself or hypothetical teammate Aliyah Boston. 

            That would've worked for Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley, no matter who she had to sit. ""There's always room,” Staley said Friday, “for Angel Reese.” 











            Reese and Boston, the two most dynamic players and reliable double-double producers in the Southeastern Conference will be center stage when the top-ranked Gamecocks (24-0, 11-0 SEC) face Reese's No. 3 LSU Tigers (23-0, 11-0) in a Super Bowl Sunday showdown at 2 p.m. EST on ESPN. 

            
                Reese, the 6-foot-3 sophomore, has 23 consecutive double-doubles, an SEC record to start a season. 

            
                Boston, at 6-5, is the reigning AP player of the year and has continued her consistent success in her fourth season. She has 76 career double-doubles, a South Carolina career record, and 16 in 24 games this season. 

            Reese knows the focus Sunday is on her against Boston. But it should be the Tigers against the Gamecocks in a matchup of the country’s last two undefeated Division I programs.

            “Our team knows what we have and they know what they have,” Reese said. ""I think it’s great for women’s basketball overall. It’s going to be a great game.”

            LSU with Reese is now in elite status in coach Kim Mulkey's second season, with the Tigers right on the heels of SEC's current powerhouse team. 

            Reese leads the SEC with 23.5 points and 15.8 rebounds a game. Boston is second in boards. 

            “I hope they both declare early” to turn pro, Arkansas coach Mike Neighbors said of Reese and Boston. 

            The two are similar forces around the basket, skilled in their movement and impossible to slow down, he said.

            “What do you tell a kid? Box out? That's not going to do it,” Neighbors said. “There's not really a solution to some of the things that they do.” 

            Boston's minutes have decreased because South Carolina has had control of most games by halftime. She was two rebounds away from her ninth straight double-double in Thursday's 83-48 win at Auburn. Staley asked if she wanted to stay in late to keep the streak alive, but Boston was content with the outcome and not personal goals. 

            However, when it's time to compete, Boston's ready: She scored 23 of her 26 points in the second half of South Carolina's 81-77 win at No. 5 UConn last Sunday. 

            Boston has heard what others think is at stake in this matchup, including SEC and national player of the year awards. 

            “If that's what they're looking at, I guess I leave that up to them,” she said. “But coming into this game, I can't look at it as ‘Oh, I need to win. I need to do this or that to get national player of the year,’ because in reality that's not the biggest goal. The biggest ... is the national championship.”

            Reese is known for her game and her sense of fashion — long eyelashes, painted nails. She has embraced her nickname, “Bayou Barbie"" to the point that she's applied to have it trademarked and intends to produce merchandise. 

            Reese's NIL evaluation is worth $258,000, according to On3.com’s tracker. That’s about $150,000 more than Boston. 

            Around the holidays, Reese persuaded one of her top sponsors, handbag company Coach, to provide bags retailing at about $500 to each of her teammates. She wanted them to benefit from her financial success.

            “I can’t do this without them,” she said. “I feel like I’ve grown my platform here at LSU and without my teammates and my coaches, I wouldn’t be able to do this.” 

            ESPN analyst Debbie Antonelli thinks Staley and her No. 1 defense will look to end Reese’s double-double streak in front a sold-out arena Sunday.

            “It’ll be fun to watch,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806936,Cadiz beats Girona 2-0 to escape drop zone in Liga,"MADRID (AP) — Cadiz beat Girona 2-0 at home to escape from the Spanish league relegation zone on Friday.

            The modest team from southern Spain jumped from 18th to 15th place before the rest of the round.

            Valencia fell into the bottom three and in danger of the drop.











            Midfielder Gonzalo Escalante and striker Sergi Guardiola, who both joined Cadiz in the winter transfer market, scored for the hosts.

            Escalante controlled a cross by Brian Ocampo and fired into the upper part of the net for the sixth-minute opener — and his second goal in three games for his new club.

            Guardiola added another goal in the 34th with a strike from an angle after Theo Bondonga led a counterattack.

            Coach Sergio González has managed to turn Cadiz around after its horrible start to the season of five straight losses with no goals scored. Since then it has gone unbeaten at home in eight games. It has been in the relegation zone since Round 2.

            “We needed this win,” Guardiola said. “Like I said when I arrived here, if we stick together we will pull through.”

            Girona remained in 11th place.

            Super Bowl ads keep it light by using nostalgia and stars

            NEW YORK (AP) — Super Bowl ads are more than just breaks between gameplay during the biggest sporting event of the year: they offer a glimpse of the country’s zeitgeist, along with how major industries are faring. Advertisers spend millions for a chance to capture the attention of more than 100 million viewers expected to tune in for the big game. This year, crypto ads and automakers are advertising less since those industries are facing problems. Major food brands like M&Ms, tech companies like Google, streaming services including Peacock and more alcohol brands have jumped in to take their place.

            Doja Cat, John Travolta, Adam Driver star in Super Bowl ads

            NEW YORK (AP) — Big name advertisers from T-Mobile to Google are paying as much as $7 million for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl on Sunday. To get the most out of those millions, most advertisers release their ads in the days ahead of the big game to maximize publicity for their spots. In the ads released so far, John Travolta and “Scrubs” stars Donald Faison and Zach Braff sing a T-Mobile themed version of “Summer Nights” from “Grease,” Adam Driver creates multiple versions of himself for Squarespace, and Alicia Silverstone reprises her “Clueless” character for online shopping site Rakuten.

            Year after ‘Crypto Bowl,’ crypto ads vanish from big game

            NEW YORK (AP) — Cryptocurrency companies grabbed the spotlight during the 2022 Super Bowl, with commercials from a handful of newcomers to advertising’s biggest stage: FTX, Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro. Some marketing experts dubbed it the “Crypto Bowl.” A year later, the industry has been humbled by a massive downturn in crypto prices, as well as the bankruptcy of several well-known companies. The dramatic turnaround harkens back to 2000, when dot-com companies such as Pets.com ran Super Bowl ads, only to go out of business within a year or two. This year, crypto ads are nowhere to be found.

            Russia announces cut to oil output over Western price caps

            MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has announced it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day next month after Western countries capped the price of its crude over its action in Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Friday that “we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the ‘price ceiling.’” The Group of Seven major democracies have imposed a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil shipped to non-Western countries. The goal is to keep oil flowing to global markets to prevent price spikes, while limiting Russia’s financial gains that can be used to pay for its campaign in Ukraine.

            Judge rejects bid to nullify Boeing deal over Max crashes

            DALLAS (AP) — A federal judge is rejecting a move to consider criminal prosecution for Boeing over the 737 Max jet. The judge says courts don’t have the power to overturn agreements that federal prosecutors make with criminal defendants. Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, declined to re-open a settlement that Boeing made with the Justice Department two years ago, after two Max crashes killed 346 people. Families of the passengers say they will appeal the ruling. In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion in exchange for the government not prosecuting the company on a felony fraud charge.

            UK economy avoids decline but cost of living pains many

            LONDON (AP) — The British economy has stagnated in the final three months of last year amid cost-of-living crisis that’s squeezing household budgets, crimping business investment and fueling labor unrest. The Office for National Statistics said Friday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, failed to grow during the fourth quarter of 2022. Britain faces a prolonged economic slowdown triggered by soaring food and energy prices. Carlton Peters, who cooks for the Margins Project charity’s free lunch program, sees it in his own life. He now buys all of his food in the reduced-price section of the supermarket and has cut out butter altogether because it is too expensive.

            Safety investigators say they have issued subpoenas for pilots of an American Airlines plane involved in a close call at New York’s Kennedy Airport last month. The National Transportation Safety Board said Friday the pilots have refused three times to sit for recorded interview. The NTSB says the American plane crossed an active runway without approval from air traffic controllers, and that led to a close call with a Delta Air Lines jet. The Delta plane had to abort its takeoff.

            Dutch-owned grid operator mulls sale to German government

            BERLIN (AP) — A state-owned Dutch company that is Germany’s biggest electricity grid operator says it plans to hold talks on selling its entire German business to the government in Berlin. Germany welcomed the announcement Friday. TenneT, which is one of four transmission network operators in Germany, pointed to the need to find a “structural solution” to funding needs for its German business as the grid is bolstered to handle the transition to renewable energy. It put that cost at about 15 billion euros, or $16.1 billion. TenneT operates electricity grids across a large swath of Germany. Those transmission lines are crucial for Germany’s plans to completely shift its power production from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2045.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806940,Heartbreak and hope in Turkish city after quake,"Everyone was waiting for a miracle in Cukurova.Most people in this multi-story apartment building in an Adana district died when the first quake caused it to crumble. But more than 36 hours later, an SOS had come via WhatsApp from under the massive pile of broken concrete. Someone was still alive under there.It wasn't unthinkable — one survivor had been pulled out alive earlier Tuesday — so the Turkish rescue teams called on the assistance of the Bulgarian Red Cross, one of the first international organizations to have arrived in Adana, and the sniffer dogs they'd brought with them. The canines, who do not signal for corpses, confirmed it — it was possible a person was still alive in there. Excavation efforts were redoubled overnight, with machines, trained specialists and ordinary citizens pitching in, digging with plastic containers and their bare hands.Word had spread in the neighborhood and crowds were gathering to watch. Any shred of positive news would be most desperately welcomed by the thousands of people now living in Adana's streets — in the middle to stay away from buildings — and trying to keep themselves warm with fires in freezing temperatures.Even in a city more than 200 kilometers from the epicenter, the fact that several large buildings had been destroyed meant plenty of death and displacement.Then, Wednesday morning, a body was retrieved. Whenever this happens, the teams hold up a cloth to respectfully shield the process from bystanders and to solemnly wrap the remains. There was a moment of silence while it was hoisted out of the debris, then murmurs of ""Allahu ekber” — ""God is great” — while the body was carried away.Watching this with a sunken heart, I had to find out: Was this the sender of the WhatsApp message? Must we give up hope for a survivor? I darted around the diggers seeing if anyone spoke English, and I was lucky enough to meet Tervel Totev from the Bulgarian Red Cross team.We're not giving up, he said, explaining that they had already known about this body, sadly, as the hands had been visible for some time. Within about an hour, the dog detectives came back to check again.An incredible hush fell across the block, near-complete silence, so that everyone could hear whether the dogs barked as they scrambled around the rubble. And again, their reaction encouraged those on the scene to cling to the hope that, even more than 48 hours after the first quake, this could still be a ""rescue” and not a ""recovery” operation.As residents of Cukurova continued to mass, many of them shared supplies amongst themselves — and even with the growing crowd of journalists — water, food, cups of tea, even gloves insistently thrust upon this reporter who'd forgotten hers in the car. ""Do you need anything?” they would ask, and then say, ""Thank you for coming. Thank you for showing the world that we need help.”Up on the pile of concrete, an impressive operation involving a heavy chain and crane had just lifted away a massive piece of concrete. There was palpable excitement in the air as the teams could now get to what was believed to be the crucial area.But then, as everyone held their breath, the telltale cloth went up. There would be no rescue here.It felt personal. No, that's not fair to those for whom it actually was. But it was clear I wasn't the only one feeling this way. With the overwhelming weight of a death toll going up by the thousands every hour, it was incredible how desperately locals and foreigners alike wanted to experience even one more happy outcome. I'd have to get mine from Turkish television, which I watched obsessively whenever possible, and which shared that people were still being saved in other cities.It was somewhat of a relief, in comparison, to speak then with those who had survived. A few blocks away sat 400 tents housing some 1,200 people who had been made homeless. Cukurova Mayor Soner Cetin, there at the site, told me there were thousands more people who urgently needed shelter but that officials were checking buildings to see if some of them could safely return to standing buildings once the aftershocks stopped.Cetin deflected my questions about whether he shared the views of those criticizing the Turkish government and the international community for the slow arrival of help. He said his community, which had seen about 400 deaths out of a population of roughly 400,000, was doing relatively well for now in terms of food supplies, but that warm blankets were still needed.Again, the people in the camp kept offering items from their stockpiles. Did we want soup? Tea? Juice?But for the first time since I'd arrived in Turkey, something was asked of me.Two adorable girls, aged three and eight, had run from their parents and campfire right up to me when my cameraman and I got to the camp, gesturing to my face. What could they want? They made movements like painting their own faces.Lipstick, really?! I pulled mine out of my pocket, applied it to their lips and gave it to them as they squealed with delight and ran back to their parents to show them.They likely had few clothes and toys, and some extremely difficult days ahead, but they at least had one small distraction now.The pink kisses they joyfully left on my cheeks brought tears to my eyes and hope to my heart that their homes, cities and futures can be rebuilt.Edited by Andreas Illmer",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806941,EU agrees on stricter measures against 'irregular migration',"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said early Friday that EU leaders agreed tougher measures to tackle ""irregular migration.""""We will act to strengthen our external borders and prevent irregular migration,"" von der Leyen said after Thursday's EU summit.The move came after several EU countries called for stricter rules to curb high numbers of asylum requests to the 27-member bloc.The EU hosts millions of refugees who had fled conflicts in Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan. But the bloc often deems asylum claims from nationals of relatively safer countries, such as Bangladesh, Turkey and Tunisia, as economic migrants ineligible for asylum.Von der Leyen said EU countries wanted to recognize each others' deportation decisions in a bid to increase such expulsions.They agreed on a ""principle"" to prevent migrants from seeking asylum in a different EU country after being rejected in an initial one.EU leaders agreed on a set of measures, including initiatives to strengthen protection infrastructure on the EU's external borders.They called on the Commission ""to immediately mobilize substantial EU funds"" to reinforce the bloc's external border with ""protection capabilities and infrastructure, means of surveillance, including aerial surveillance, and equipment,"" according to the summit document.The issue of building fences on the EU's borders has been a flashpoint in talks, with von der Leyen previously saying the EU would not pay for such walls.Before Thursday's summit, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer called for the EU to fund fences on borders with the EU's neighboring countries, like Turkey.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was important that EU members work together on migration, whether ""it's about controls at the external borders, improving infrastructure, or cooperation with countries of origin and transit.""Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg's prime minister, sharply criticized the calls for building such fences.""It would be a shame if a wall were built in Europe with the European stars on it,"" he said, adding that for him, Europe stood for the ""fall of a wall.""The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said ""Fortress Europe"" was not the answer and called for offering immigrants legal processes to get in the EU instead.""People move because in their countries there is not a future, there is no peace, there is no stability,"" he said.fb/jcg (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806942,Amsterdam bans public cannabis smoking in red-light district,"The Dutch capital, famed for its liberal laws on drug use and sex work, has banned the smoking of cannabis on the streets of its red-light district, city authorities said on Friday.The ban, which will come into effect in mid-May, is seeking to tackle crime and anti-social behavior to improve the quality of life for the area's residents.Amsterdam is a popular tourist hotspot and its marijuana cafes as well as its brothels and strip clubs draw in millions of visitors every year.""Residents of the old town suffer a lot from mass tourism and alcohol and drug abuse in the streets"", the city said in a statement.""Tourists also attract street dealers, who in turn cause crime and insecurity,"" it added.The move, hailed as a ""historic intervention"" by Dutch newspaper Het Parool, is part of a larger campaign to crack down on the city's ""huge anti-social behavior"" issues.The initiative comes from Amsterdam's first female mayor, Femke Halsema, who has set out to make the city more livable for its residents.Other measures have also been introduced, such as restricting drinking hours and enforcing earlier closing times for cafes, bars, restaurants and brothels.The ban on the public smoking of cannabis will be limited to the canal-lined streets that host the city's sex shops and strip clubs.But if the intended effects are not achieved, the city has said it may extend the rule to the terraces of marijuana cafes too.According to Dutch law, consuming cannabis is technically illegal but possession of anything under 5 grams (0.18 ounces) was decriminalized in 1975.In principle, only Dutch residents are allowed to purchase cannabis in so-called ""coffee shops,"" but there is an exception for shops in Amsterdam.There are 570 shops across the country — euphemistically called coffee shops — of which 166 are in Amsterdam, according to Health Ministry and city data.Halsema has previously said she wants to encourage tourism to Amsterdam for other reasons than sex and drugs, but studies have shown that banning tourists from marijuana cafes would lead to a sharp decline in visitors.ab/jcg (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806946,Super Bowl week turns Phoenix area into Valley of Fun,"PHOENIX (AP) — The winter and spring months are tourist season in Arizona, with visitors descending upon the Valley of the Sun to escape the cold and enjoy the outdoors.

            
                The Super Bowl adds another layer of boisterousness, the extra 100,000-plus people filling bars, restaurants and parties across the desert. 

            Throw in the Phoenix Open, the PGA Tour's version of a boozy mosh pit on grass, and the Phoenix area transforms into a weeklong Valley of Fun.











            “The buzz is definitely here,” said Jay Parry, president and CEO of the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee. “It’s going to be bigger and better than the last one.”

            The last one, in 2015, was a massive hit. 

            The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks played an epic Super Bowl that turned on a goal-line stand in the closing seconds. The Phoenix Open had already established itself as the Greatest Show on Grass and Tiger Woods fueled the festivities by playing in the event for the first time since 2001.

            This year's Super Bowl has the ingredients for another memorable mix. 

            
                The Kansas City Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, trying to win their third championship overall, while the Philadelphia Eagles are vying for their second title in six years. It will also feature two of the NFL's most dynamic quarterbacks in Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts.

            Sunday's game is obviously the centerpiece, but the build-up is a rollicking weeklong bash.

            For previous Super Bowls, Glendale — where the stadium is — Scottsdale and downtown Phoenix were the festive focal points. The revelry has spread across the Valley for this year's game.

            The NFL and the host committee have 20 sanctioned events in the four days leading up to the Super Bowl, part of more than 200 events in the Phoenix area. 

            This Super Bowl has not one, but two NFL Experience sites for fans. One is at the Phoenix Convention Center, where fans can kick field goals, throw passes or run through a gauntlet of tackling dummies.

            The experience at Hance Park on the north side of downtown has live music in the evenings and will host an outdoor watch party that will include the largest video screens in Arizona. The Navy flyover for the game in Glendale also will pass over the park just after the national anthem.

            “It’s awesome,” said Eagles fan Sean Duffy, who flew from Philadelphia with his family to attend the game. “We go to every game and being here is great, especially the weather.”

            So is the music.

            Rihanna is performing at halftime and will likely have a surprise guest or two. Country singer Chris Stapleton is singing the national anthem with Oscar-winning actor Troy Kotsur performing it in sign language. Babyface will sing “America The Beautiful.”

            For those not going to the game there are plenty of other big-name acts performing in the Valley, like Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, Paramore, Machine Gun Kelly, Dave Matthews Band, Tim McGraw and numerous others. 

            “This time around, the fan interest in the Super Bowl has been really high and being a part of it has been incredible,” said Parry, who also was a part of the 2015 Super Bowl.

            The Phoenix Open has added to it.

            The tournament at TPC Scottsdale has transformed from just another stop on the PGA Tour's West Coast swing into the circuit's party place. Hundreds of thousands of fans descend upon the desert course every year — a record 216,000 in 2018 — to cheer and jeer at decibel levels better suited for a football game.

            The par-3 16th hole is the rowdy epicenter, a three-layer cake of pandemonium with more than 20,000 often-inebriated fans creating golf's version of a party cruise. 

            The Phoenix Open has an even higher profile this year.

            The PGA Tour elevated the purses of four tournaments in response to the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league. The Phoenix Open is one, with a purse of $20 million and $3.6 million to the winner — up from $8.2 million and $1.4 million last year. 

            Another change: beer will be sold in cups instead of cans at the 16th hole after fans created a beer storm for a pair of aces.

            Don't expect it to slow the rowdiness.

            “I don’t think it’s everybody’s favorite,” said PGA Tour player Jon Rahm, who played at nearby Arizona State. “I think either you love it or hate it. There’s no in between. With my case, I love it.”

            Find something you don't like in Phoenix this week, there's likely something else right around the corner in the Valley of Fun.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806947,"Tests negative, Sen. John Fetterman leaves hospital","WASHINGTON (AP) — Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman left a hospital in Washington after a two-day stay, his office said Friday, following a spell of lightheadedness that prompted the visit as he recovers from a stroke he suffered last year on the campaign trail.

            In a statement, Fetterman's office said he was discharged from George Washington University Hospital after tests found no evidence of a new stroke or a seizure. 

            “In addition to the CT, CTA, and MRI tests ruling out a stroke, his EEG test results came back normal, with no evidence of seizures. John is looking forward to spending some time with his family and returning to the Senate on Monday,” Fetterman’s communications director Joe Calvello said in the statement.











            Fetterman checked himself in on Wednesday after feeling lightheaded during a Senate Democratic retreat. 

            He continues to suffer the aftereffects of the stroke, in particular auditory processing disorder, which can render someone unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning.

            In November, Fetterman, 53, won the seat held by now-retired Republican Pat Toomey, spending the last five months of the campaign recovering from the stroke even as he waged a hard-fought contest against GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz. 

            Fetterman, who was Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, defeated the celebrity heart surgeon by 5 percentage points, flipping a seat that was key to Democrats holding the Senate majority. More than $300 million was spent during the campaign, making it the most expensive Senate race in 2022.

            Fetterman is an outsized presence on Capitol Hill, standing 6-foot-8 with a clean-shaven head and a goatee, and is a rising star in progressive politics.

            His campaign was temporarily derailed on May 13, just days before the Democratic primary, when he suffered a stroke that he said nearly killed him. 

            He underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy, and spent much of the summer recovering and off the campaign trail. 

            He refused to release his medical records or allow his doctors to answer reporters’ questions, as Oz made an issue of whether his opponent was honest about the effects of the stroke and whether Fetterman was fit to serve. The Democrat insisted his doctors said he could have a full recovery.

            The effects of the stroke were apparent in Fetterman’s uneven performance during the fall campaign’s only debate when he struggled to complete sentences and jumbled words.

            On election night, he told cheering supporters he ran for “anyone that ever got knocked down that got back up.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Pennsylvania Democratic Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806951,Canopy at Memphis riverside park named after Tyre Nichols,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A charitable foundation on Friday named a canopy at a Memphis park for Tyre Nichols, who died last month after he was brutally beaten by officers in a case that has intensified calls for police reform and led to emotional tributes in this Mississippi River city and around the country.

            With Nichols' mother and stepfather in attendance, the Hyde Family Foundation and the Memphis River Parks Partnership dedicated the “Sunset Canopy” in honor of Nichols at Tom Lee Park, which sits along the river and is currently under major renovation. 

            
                Nichols was kicked, punched and hit with a police baton during a Jan. 7 arrest near his home. He died in a hospital three days later. 











            Police said he had been suspected of reckless driving, but no verified evidence of a traffic violation has emerged in public documents or in video released by the city. 

            Nichols, 29, was known to enjoy taking pictures of sunsets, and the park is known as a prime location for viewing them over the river. 

            Nichols' mother and stepfather signed the first wooden roof slat of the canopy before it was lifted to the top of the large canopy and drilled into place. When finished, the high, wing-shaped canopy will cover a large area of the park overlooking the river. 

            Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, wrote, “Mommy miss you so much! Love you. Mom.” Stepfather Rodney Wells wrote, “Love you Tyre. Dad.” 

            RowVaughn Wells said her son was ""smiling down right now, and he's just jumping up for joy.”

            “Like my wife said, he would love this,” Rodney Wells said. “There's nothing he likes more than watching the sunset over the Mississippi.”

            Nichols has been honored at memorials and other events in Memphis and other cities. An avid skateboarder, Nichols was the subject of a tribute at a Memphis skate park last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806954,Lawyer: Trump offers DNA to compare against accuser's dress,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump is willing to provide a DNA sample to be compared against stains on the dress of a woman who accused him of rape, though only under certain conditions, his lawyer said Friday.

            Attorney Joseph Tacopina told a Manhattan federal court judge in a letter that Trump will turn over the sample as long as lawyers for his accuser, columnist E. Jean Carroll, provide missing pages from a DNA report on the dress first.

            Carroll’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, called that offer a disingenuous effort to delay an April trial and prejudice potential jurors.











            She submitted a letter to the judge saying the sudden offer of DNA after Trump refused to provide it for three years was a “legally frivolous delay tactic.”

            “The time has come for him to face a jury,” Kaplan wrote, noting that the period when new facts could be unearthed for trial expired in October.

            According to a court filing Thursday, Trump and Carroll are both listed as their lawyers’ first possible witnesses at a trial scheduled to start April 24.

            Carroll, 79, has sued Trump for defamation and for rape, saying Trump turned a friendly encounter at a luxury Manhattan department store in late 1995 or early 1996 into a violent rape.

            She did not speak publicly about it until releasing a book in 2019: “What Do We Need Men For?”

            
                Trump has insisted the meeting never happened, including during an October deposition, and his lawyer said the same in his latest court filing.

            Tacopina said Carroll and her lawyers were trying to gain a publicity advantage by claiming Trump's DNA is on the dress she wore the night she said she was raped.

            “Mr. Trump's DNA is either on the dress or it is not,” he said.

            Tacopina said Carroll's lawyers have declined to produce a dozen pages of the DNA report they obtained because “she knows his DNA is not on the dress because the alleged sexual assault never occurred.”

            Kaplan, though, said Carroll decided to proceed to trial without a protracted battle over DNA evidence after Trump's repeated refusals to provide a sample.

            “There is no DNA evidence in this case, and none will be introduced at trial,” Kaplan wrote.

            Her client instead “has amassed powerful proof that Trump sexually assaulted her” without the sample, Kaplan said.

            The lawyer said a report by an expert showed there was unidentified male DNA present on the dress Carroll wore when she encountered Trump, but she said it was not an isolated sample of male DNA but rather a mix of DNA that would require complex analysis if the judge permitted the issue to be reopened prior to trial.NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump is willing to provide a DNA sample to be compared against stains on the dress of a woman who accused him of rape, though only under certain conditions, his lawyer said Friday.Attorney Joseph Tacopina told a Manhattan federal court judge in a letter that Trump will turn over the sample as long as lawyers for his accuser, columnist E.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806957,Ex-Louisville player Valentine charged with strangulation,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Louisville police have accused former Louisville men’s basketball great Robbie Valentine of strangulation following an argument with his girlfriend.

            The incident occurred Thursday night at a residence Valentine shared with the woman, the arrest citation stated. The couple went to dinner and the woman sought to discuss moving out and getting her own place, the citation added, and they argued after returning home.

            Valentine, 59, allegedly took the woman’s phone and emptied her purse in the sink, according to the citation. He later threw the woman off the bed and began strangling her, the report added, leaving her with pain and redness on the sides of her neck and bruising to the back.











            Alcohol was involved, the arrest citation said.

            Valentine was initially arrested for second-degree strangulation before the charge was upgraded to first-degree strangulation, a Class C felony, in a court appearance Friday. He paid a $2,500 bond and was ordered not to have contact with the woman.

            Valentine faces a preliminary hearing in Jefferson County District Court on Feb. 20. His attorney, Brian Butler, had no comment on Friday evening.

            Valentine played with Louisville from 1982-86 and was a member of the 1986 NCAA championship and 1983 Final Four squads. He’s a member of Louisville Athletics’ Hall of Fame.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806958,Ousted election clerk hit with ethics lawsuit in New Mexico,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A local elections regulator in rural New Mexico who was recently declared missing from work and replaced is now facing possible sanctions from a commission that oversees ethics and conduct by government officials.

            The civil lawsuit against Yvonne Otero was filed Tuesday by the State Ethics Commission. It alleges that Otero used her office for personal gain and to exchange favors, seeking sanctions that include fines of up to $5,000.

            Otero, a Republican elected as Torrance County clerk in 2020, was replaced in office last month by a decision of the board of county commissioners. The all-Republican board says Otero went missing from work and abandoned her duties. Linda Jaramillo was appointed in her place to serve as clerk through 2024.











            Jacob Candelaria, an attorney for Otero, called the misconduct allegations by the State Ethics Commission “outlandish, sexist and politically motivated,"" and said that Otero has not abandoned her elected post.

            “We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations,” he said Friday.

            Separately, Otero has petitioned the state Supreme Court to reinstate her as county clerk.

            Otero's conduct has come under scrutiny at the same time that Torrance County officials grapple with simmering mistrust about voting systems. 

            Torrance was one of a handful of rural counties in New Mexico that considered delaying certification of the results of its June 2022 primary election as angry crowds gave voice to unproven conspiracy theories about voting systems. Commissioners later ordered a hand-tally of primary ballots and assigned a county manager to ensure adequate preparations for the general election.

            Commissioners last year accused Otero in a censure resolution of harassing employees of the clerk’s office and botching the certification of the county’s ballot-counting machines in the run-up to the November 2022 election. Machines were recertified.

            Otero's petition to the Supreme Court argues that county commissioners decided without proper evidence or due process that she had abandoned her duties as clerk. Otero also is challenging the constitutionality of a statute that was used to remove and replace her. The court has yet to respond.SANTA FE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806960,San Francisco's DA drops charges against former officer,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she plans to drop manslaughter charges against a former police officer who became the first ever to be charged for an on-duty killing in the city because the charges were politically motivated. 

            Jenkins said in a letter sent Wednesday to Attorney General Rob Bonta that she intends to drop the charges against San Francisco police officer Christopher Samayoa at a March 1 hearing. 

            Samayoa was on his fourth day on the job when in 2017 he fatally shot Keita O’Neil, a carjacking suspect, during a police chase. 











            
                Chesa Boudin, Jenkins' predecessor, charged Samayoa with manslaughter and other charges after he took office in 2020, calling his decision “historic.” Boudin was part of a politically progressive wave of prosecutors committed to seeking restorative justice over mass incarceration. He was recalled from his post last year amid frustration and anxiety over the pandemic and viral footage of Asian seniors being assaulted in San Francisco. 

            In the letter obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, Jenkins said that an investigation into the Boudin's handling of the case revealed internal conflicts. She said the charges were filed just before the statute of limitations for manslaughter was to expire and the warrant was signed by an investigator who had been assigned to the case days earlier — while the longtime lead investigator was on vacation.

            “The irregularities and facts that have come to light surrounding the case against officer Samayoa suggest that the charges were not filed in good faith, appear to have been politically-motivated, and have made it impossible for us to proceed forward with this prosecution,” Jenkins said in a statement Friday. 

            Boudin didn't immediately return a message Friday seeking comment. He told the San Francisco Chronicle he filed the case on the facts, which he said also led the Police Department to fire Samayoa and the city to pay O’Neil’s family a $2.5 million settlement.

            “It’s clear Jenkins has been coordinating with the officer’s defense team to avoid a public hearing on the disturbing facts of the case,” he said. “She is scapegoating me to try to divert attention from what this decision ultimately reveals about her: Jenkins will not hold everyone equally accountable under the law, she is deeply politically motivated, and she does not care about victims of police violence.”

            Jenkins said that her office has asked the state Attorney General’s Office to review the case in support of O'Neil's family’s wishes.

            The office on Friday confirmed it received the request and is reviewing it.

            O’Neil, who died at a hospital, was suspected of assaulting a California Lottery employee and stealing a van that belonged to the agency. Police said they chased the van and another SUV seen traveling with it to a public housing area. O’Neil abandoned the stolen vehicle and started running toward the patrol car occupied by Samayoa, who was in the passenger seat, and his training officer.

            Body camera footage shows Samayoa drawing his pistol while the cruiser was still moving. The video then shows him opening the side door and firing a single shot through the window as O’Neil runs by in the opposite direction. O’Neil, who died later at a hospital, was not armed.

            An attorney for O’Neil’s family, Brian Ford, called Jenkins’ decision to drop the charges “shameful and cowardly.”

            “She is more interested in protecting murderous cops and attacking Boudin than in seeking justice for the citizens of San Francisco,” Ford told the newspaper. “But it means that Attorney General Rob Bonta has all the more duty to investigate and take up the prosecution of Christopher Samayoa for the murder of Keita O’Neil.”SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she plans to drop manslaughter charges against a former police officer who became the first ever to be charged for an on-duty killing in the city because the charges were politically motivated.Jenkins said in a letter sent Wednesday to Attorney General Rob Bonta that she intends to drop the charges against San Francisco police officer Christopher Samayoa at a March 1 hearing.Samayoa was on his fourth day on the job when in 2017 he fatally shot Keita O’Neil, a carjacking suspect, during a police chase.Chesa Boudin, Jenkins' predecessor, charged Samayoa with manslaughter and other charges after he took office in 2020, calling his decision “historic.” Boudin was part of a politically progressive wave of prosecutors committed to seeking restorative justice over mass incarceration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806961,Irvin files lawsuit seeking $100M after misconduct claim,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP) — Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver and Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages, claiming he was falsely accused of misconduct by a female employee at a Phoenix hotel.

            Irvin, 56, was pulled off the remainder of NFL Network's Super Bowl week coverage following a complaint about his behavior in a hotel on Sunday. He has worked at the network since 2009.

            The lawsuit against a “Jane Doe” and Marriott International, Inc., was filed Thursday in Collin County, Texas. Marriott International declined to comment. 











            In interviews this week with with Dallas’ 105.3 The Fan and the Dallas Morning News, Irvin said he had a conversation with a woman at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel that lasted between 45 seconds and one minute. Irvin said he didn't know her and “there was no sexual wrongdoing.""

            Irvin also said he initially didn’t remember the meeting because “I had a few drinks, to tell you the truth.”

            In his lawsuit, Irvin said he returned to the hotel, he briefly greeted, shook hands and talked with several fans, including the woman, for a few minutes before going to his room alone.

            The lawsuit claims a hotel manager reported “false information” to the NFL, accusing Irvin of improper behavior toward a hotel employee. Irvin was then “shockingly woken up by a crew of security” and removed from the hotel “without any explanation or questions,” the lawsuit said.

            Witnesses have come forward in Irvin's defense, said Irvin's attorney, Levi McCathern.

            “It is clear Michael is the latest victim of our cancel culture where all it takes is an accusation to ruin a person’s life. Michael looks forward to clearing his name in court and hopes the court of public opinion will see the truth come out as well,” McCathern said.

            The league announced the fine Friday for violating the SEC policy limiting access to the competition area. This is Vanderbilt's fourth offense and second in three months. Vanderbilt also was docked $250,000 in November for fans coming onto the field following a 31-24 win over Florida on Nov. 19. 

            Teammates mobbed Tyrin Lawrence after his 3-pointer from the right corner in front of the Vanderbilt bench snapped an 11-game skid to in-state rival Tennessee with a 66-65 victory Wednesday night, the biggest win yet of coach Jerry Stackhouse's four-year tenure. Students and other fans quickly ran onto the court to celebrate.











            Security lined the court, and Vanderbilt made an announcement warning fans to stay off the court with about a minute left in the tight game. 

            The SEC announced in November a group is reviewing its policies on fans coming onto fields or courts with rules expected to be updated for the 2023-24 season. Currently, fines for such violations go to the SEC's Post-Graduate Scholarship Fund. 

            A member's first offense costs $50,000, $100,000 for the second and up to $250,000 after that. League members adopted the original policy in 2004 with fines hiked during the 2015 SEC spring meetings.

(AP) — All-Star midfielder Emanuel Reynoso has been suspended without pay by Major League Soccer for failure to report to preseason training with Minnesota United FC, the club announced Friday.

            Minnesota United's statement provided no further details on the situation. The 27-year-old Reynoso has remained in his native Argentina since the Loons opened camp more than a month ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806964,AP sources: Bally Sports owner to miss payment next week,"Diamond Sports Group, the largest owner of regional sports networks, will miss a $140 million interest payment next week, which would put the company closer to filing for bankruptcy.

            Two people familiar with the financing plans told The Associated Press that the missed interest payments would begin a 30-day grace period, where Diamond Sports Group could negotiate with creditors and restructure its debt. Another avenue could be a pre-arranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

            The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not at liberty to discuss financial transactions.











            Diamond owns 19 networks under the Bally Sports banner. Those networks have the rights to 42 professional teams — 14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL.

            Bloomberg reported last month that Diamond Sports Group has an overall debt of $8.6 billion.

            Sinclair Broadcast Group — which owns Diamond — bought the regional sports networks from Walt Disney Company for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks in order for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s film and television assets to be approved.

            Diamond has nearly $1 billion in rights payments, mostly to baseball teams, due in the first quarter this year. Commissioner Rob Manfred told the AP earlier this week after an owners' meeting that MLB would be in a position to step in if Diamond was unable to broadcast games.

            “Our goal would be to make games available not only within the traditional cable bundle but on the digital side, as well,” Manfred said. “What we do is largely dependent on how Diamond and the creditors play their cards, what they decide to do.""

            Bally Sports has tried to offset the effects of cord cutting by offering a Bally Sports+ digital package, where fans in some markets would be able to stream their team's games.

            Stevens said Brown has been fitted with a mask. Brown was diagnosed with a maxillary fracture after he took an inadvertent elbow from Jayson Tatum on Wednesday while going for a rebound during Boston's win over Philadelphia. 

            Brown was sitting Friday night with Boston hosting Charlotte and will be evaluated over the next few days. That will determine how long he will be sidelined.











            “He’s still feeling it. It doesn’t feel great. We’ll see how he feels when he starts moving around,” Stevens said. “Then we’ll get together early in the week and kind of figure out what’s next. But it doesn’t look like it’s going to be too long, which is a good thing.” 

            Stevens also said point guard Marcus Smart, who will miss his ninth straight game Friday with a sprained right ankle, continues to get closer to a return but still is experiencing pain. 

            Boston (36-16) entered Friday with the best record in the the NBA.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806969,Protest against refugees in England turns violent; 3 arrests,"LONDON (AP) — A protest outside a hotel housing asylum-seekers in northwest England erupted into violence on Friday, with projectiles thrown and a police van set aflame.

            Merseyside Police said three people were arrested over “incidents of disorder” near the Suites Hotel on Knowsley, near Liverpool. 

            The force said there was an “initially peaceful” protest outside the hotel as well as a counter-protest by demonstrators supporting refugees.











            Police said there were no reports of serious injuries but called the violence “completely unacceptable.”

            Local lawmaker George Howarth said the demonstration was triggered by “an alleged incident on social media.”

            “The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety,” he said. “Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community.”

            Britain takes in fewer asylum-seekers than some of its European neighbors including France and Germany, but has seen a sharp increase in the number of people trying to reach the U.K. across the English Channel in dinghies and other small boats.

            More than 45,000 people reached Britain by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum. The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many migrants stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodation.

            The Channel crossings have become a hot political issue, with the Conservative government promising to “stop the boats.” Opponents accuse the government of demonizing desperate people fleeing war and poverty.

            In October, a processing center for new arrivals in the Channel port of Dover was firebombed by an attacker police said was motivated by far-right ideology.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806970,CSX railroad promises paid sick time to two more unions,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — CSX railroad has promised to give more of its workers the paid sick time they demanded in contract negotiations last fall.

            CSX is the only major freight railroad so far to agree to give its employees sick time in the wake of contentious negotiations last year that ended only after Congress stepped in to block a potential strike.

            The Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad said Friday that it had reached agreements with two more of its unions, just days after announcing pacts with a pair of other unions.











            CSX said about 500 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union and the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers union, which represents the company’s utility workers, will soon get four paid sick days. The workers will also be able to convert three of their personal leave days into sick days to give them a total of seven days.

            The machinists union said employees will be paid for any unused sick time at the end of each year, or they can have the value of those days added to their 401k retirement accounts.

            CSX CEO Joe Hinrichs is trying to repair relations with his workforce after the bitter contract talks, and these sick time agreements represent a step in that direction. He said providing sick time shows how much the railroad values its employees.

            “We have a great respect for the work they do in service to our customers and the nation, and we will continue to partner with them and their representatives to ensure they have the best possible employment experience with our railroad,” Hinrichs said in a statement.

            The unions said they will press the other major freight railroads for similar agreements.

            “Our strength and solidarity have made the case to the carriers, policymakers and the general public that we deserve paid sick leave,” said Josh Hartford, with the amchinists union's rail division. “We are now seeing the results of years of advocacy by our union and many others on this critical issue.”OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806971,Indiana jail officer fired after inmate hit during struggle,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — A white correctional officer in southwestern Indiana who is seen in body camera footage punching a Black inmate during a struggle has been fired.

            Monroe County Sheriff Ruben Martè said Friday that the decision to terminate James Mitchell was part of his vow to make “accountability and transparency” a “top priority” of the sheriff’s department.

            Mitchell and two other officers at the county jail in Bloomington were attempting to move Marcus Ford from a holding cell to a medical observation cell Jan. 31 after the inmate complained of health issues to nurses at the facility.











            Ford refuses to leave the holding cell. In the footage released by the sheriff's office, Ford is seen threatening the officers if they try to move him.

            “Soon as you touch me, it’s going down,"" Ford says. “You all better know how to fight.”

            He later repeats: “I’m not going in that room. I’m not going in that room.”

            As the officers move in, Mitchell is struck in the mouth and suffers a bloody lip. He is seen throwing punches at Ford's head and striking Ford as the inmate is being restrained by other officers.

            Martè said Ford suffered a broken nose and broken orbital bone.

            A document detailing the decision to fire Mitchell states that he failed to transition to nonviolent strategies, failed to reduce the need for force and failed to comply when instructed twice to leave the area, WTTV-TV reported.

            “No corrections officer wants to have to use force when they come to work,” Martè said. “But even when my staff is forced to use force due to a combative inmate, they must continue to follow our policies requiring de-escalation whenever the situation allows it.”

            Martè ordered an internal review and asked the state police to conduct an independent investigation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806972,Ukrainian boys team embracing respite from horrors back home,"QUEBEC CITY (AP) — The travel, the diplomatic paperwork and out-of-pocket cost of $20,000 Sean Berube estimated spending crisscrossing Europe to gather a group of 21 Ukrainian refugees to form a hockey team of 11- and 12-year-old boys is a mere pittance compared to the payoff.

            The Quebec City businessman would do it all over again in a heartbeat based on the transformation in the children’s demeanor — from worrying to wowed — Berube has witnessed over the past two weeks.

            “When I met them first in Romania, I could see that some of them were reserved, quiet to themselves. Some of them, I didn’t see them smile,” Berube told The Associated Press on Friday. “And now, I mean they’re totally embracing the moment.”











            That moment will come Saturday, when the Ukrainian Selects make their debut facing the Boston Junior Bruins in the Class AA division of the International Peewee Tournament before what is expected to be a capacity crowd of 18,000 — the first sellout in the tournament’s 63-year history — at Quebec City’s Videotron Centre.

            Whatever the outcome, the boys have already won as far as Berube is concerned for the two-week respite they will have enjoyed from the daily horrors of the Russian invasion of Ukraine back home. 

            And that includes getting a good night’s sleep.

            “In Ukraine, usually there’s sirens at 4 in the morning, so they always have to wake up and rush to the most fortified area of their building,” Berube said, referring to what one player told him of experiencing near daily rocket warnings. “Now, he can sleep the whole night.”

            The game in the two-loss elimination tournament is the culmination of a process Berube and tournament organizers first launched in August, when the possibility of the team being assembled was first broached by Evgheniy Pysarenko. 

            A former tournament participant and friend of Berube, Pysarenko was inspired after watching many refugee children fleeing Ukraine and crossing into Romania with hockey equipment in tow. He started holding practices as a way to keep the boys occupied before realizing they were talented enough to compete. 

            The idea, coupled with the team’s arrival in Quebec City some 10 days ago, has resulted in an outpouring of support from across Canada, and generated international attention at a time the strife in Ukraine is intensifying a little less than a year since the war began.

            Fans attending the game have been asked to wear white as a statement of peace. A contingent of Quebec City’s small Ukrainian community will be on hand waving yellow and blue in cheering on a team considered to be a symbol of hope for their country’s future.

            Olga Grayvoronska Sharpe never cared much for hockey during the 11 years she has lived in Canada after leaving behind her family in Kharkiv, Ukraine. She's now eagerly excited to be attending her first game on Saturday.

            “I’m sure I won’t be able to hold my tears back out of joy for those young men,” she said. “It’s for the future, the future of life, that life no matter what — no matter (Russian President) Vladimir Putin’s plan — will prevail and young people would win.”

            What hit home for Grayvoronska Sharpe is the memory of crossing into Ukraine by foot last summer and seeing her bombed-out hometown devastated, while visiting her 82-year-old parents, who refused her pleas to leave Karkhiv by saying, “If we leave, who would stay?”

            She then turned her attention to Berube by saying, “this wouldn’t be possible without Sean. I view him as a hero.”

            Berube deflected the attention. 

            “I’m doing this because I want to give back to Ukraine and to those boys,” he said. “The heroes are their fathers who risk their lives.”

            One player’s father died in action. Another five have fathers fighting on the front line defending Ukraine. In the meantime, the remainder of their families are scattered around Europe. 

            Berube is impressed by how the players have handled the spotlight, while enjoying themselves during tours of the city, which included a shopping spree at a local sports equipment store.

            “They’re like rock stars,” he said. “They’re very mature for their age. I think probably what they went through, they have a big sense of duty for their country. And that’s how the coaches prepared them too, that they’re doing that for Ukraine and they want to prove to the world that Ukrainians are proud and can be great hockey players.”

            There’s little doubt Berube will grow emotional once the game begins on Saturday. 

            “I think it’s a message of unity,” Berube said. “Tomorrow is going to be a celebration of hockey and how hockey unites people. And it’s going to be an event for peace for Ukraine.”

She's now eagerly excited to be attending her first game on Saturday.“I’m sure I won’t be able to hold my tears back out of joy for those young men,” she said. “It’s for the future, the future of life, that life no matter what — no matter (Russian President) Vladimir Putin’s plan — will prevail and young people would win.”What hit home for Grayvoronska Sharpe is the memory of crossing into Ukraine by foot last summer and seeing her bombed-out hometown devastated, while visiting her 82-year-old parents, who refused her pleas to leave Karkhiv by saying, “If we leave, who would stay?”She then turned her attention to Berube by saying, “this wouldn’t be possible without Sean. I view him as a hero.”Berube deflected the attention.“I’m doing this because I want to give back to Ukraine and to those boys,” he said. “The heroes are their fathers who risk their lives.”One player’s father died in action. Another five have fathers fighting on the front line defending Ukraine. In the meantime, the remainder of their families are scattered around Europe.Berube is impressed by how the players have handled the spotlight, while enjoying themselves during tours of the city, which included a shopping spree at a local sports equipment store.“They’re like rock stars,” he said. “They’re very mature for their age. I think probably what they went through, they have a big sense of duty for their country. And that’s how the coaches prepared them too, that they’re doing that for Ukraine and they want to prove to the world that Ukrainians are proud and can be great hockey players.”There’s little doubt Berube will grow emotional once the game begins on Saturday.“I think it’s a message of unity,” Berube said. “Tomorrow is going to be a celebration of hockey and how hockey unites people. And it’s going to be an event for peace for Ukraine.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806973,Judge could bar comments to press after California shooting,"REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) — A judge on Friday barred attorneys from talking to the press about the criminal case of a farmworker accused of killing seven people last month in back-to-back shootings at two Northern California mushroom farms.

            San Mateo County Judge Elizabeth K. Lee on Friday issued a gag order prohibiting prosecuting and defense attorneys, as well as the alleged killer and the county Sheriff's Office, from talking to reporters about the facts of the case or sharing opinions about what happened. They can still discuss rulings that were made in open court and the procedural status of upcoming hearings.

            Earlier, the judge granted a request from defense attorneys to restrict remote access to court records, the Bay Area News Group reported.











            Press descended upon Half Moon Bay after the back-to-back Jan. 23 shootings, which authorities have said arose from workplace disputes. The violence was California’s third mass shooting in eight days last month and followed the killing of 11 people in the Los Angeles area amid Lunar New Year celebrations.

            Chunli Zhao, 66, is charged with seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. 

            Zhao has not yet entered a plea but admitted to the shootings during a jailhouse media interview. He has not responded to a request from The Associated Press through an online jail messaging system. 

            Lee on Friday heard the defense attorneys' motion to limit access to the case — proceedings which Zhao sobbed through part of, prompting the judge to call for a recess, the Bay Area News Group reported. 

            Jonathan McDougall, Zhao's defense attorney, called District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe's comments to the press “incredibly egregious” and asked Lee to bar the lawyers from speaking to media because the remarks could taint a jury, according to the news group.

            McDougall also said that the ""aggressiveness” of the press, citing his client's interviews with media, means Lee should limit what the attorneys can say to reporters.

            “Mr. Wagstaffe has confirmed information to the press from a law enforcement investigation, a disclosure of factual information,” McDougall said. “This is all information that had not even been disclosed to the bench yet and is now being articulated by Mr. Wagstaffe to the press.”

            Prosecutor Josh Stauffer objected to the characterizations of Wagstaffe's statements. Lee has asked both sides to draft a gag order, the Bay Area News Group reported.

            “My responsibility as District Attorney, in addition to being the county prosecutor, is to be a source of information for the public as to what is occurring in their criminal justice system,” Wagstaffe said in an email Friday to the AP.

            Wagstaffe wrote that he responds to every media inquiry and his role is different from that of Zhao's defense team. 

            “They have a duty to one person: the defendant charged with murders. My responsibility is to the public,"" he wrote, and to ensure ""that criminal justice does not work behind a curtain.”

            Wagstaffe has made few public comments about the case besides confirming what media outlets had already written. For example, he confirmed the Bay Area News Group's previous reporting that the shooting rampage at one of the farms occurred after Zhao's supervisor there demanded he pay a $100 repair bill for his forklift after he was involved in a crash with a co-worker’s bulldozer.

            No classified documents were believed to be in the Boston documents. But the emails show Archives officials were concerned enough to take them into their possession.

            “Pat, we would like to pick up the boxes that are in your Boston office and move them to the JFK Library. Would it be possible to do that tomorrow?” Archives General Counsel Gary Stern wrote to Pat Moore, one of Biden’s lawyers handling the preservation of the documents, in a Nov. 8, 2022, email.











            That note was among a series of emails released under a Freedom of Information request from The Associated Press and more than two dozen other entities. The notes do not go into detail on why the Archives would have sought the material that was sent to Boston. But a person familiar with the matter said Moore had been packing up papers at the Penn Biden Center, a Washington think tank where Biden had an office, that could be of use for a potential future presidential library, mostly personal details about Biden's family. 

            Moore had sent the boxes to Boston, where his law offices were located, and as he continued to sort through other boxes at the Washington-based think tank he came across a classified document, said the person, who had knowledge of the investigation but was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. 

            Since the November discovery, Biden's attorneys have uncovered other documents and so has the FBI, which searched his Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, homes as well as the Penn Biden Center, the think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. Biden has turned over records voluntarily and agreed to the searches. 

            Discovery of the classified documents touched off a special counsel probe by the Justice Department.

            In a Nov. 7, 2022, email, Stern advised Moore to “ensure that the boxes in your office in Boston remain secure in a locked space and are not accessed by anyone.” But no classified records appear to have been discovered in the boxes, according to the person.

            The White House Counsel’s Office had no comment on the material in Boston. Biden's personal lawyers didn't respond to a request for comment. 

            The dozens of pages of emails between the National Archives and Biden’s lawyers released on Friday were mostly on arranging logistics for Archives staff to take custody of material from the Penn Biden Center.

            After the news first surfaced about Biden documents, former Vice President Mike Pence said he also had found classified information at his home, and the FBI on Friday discovered an additional document with classified markings after he allowed them to search his home in Indiana. Archives officials have asked administrations going back to the Reagan presidency to comb through their records to make sure there are no more classified records or other items that should belong with the Archives. 

            Occasionally, former officials from various levels of government discover they are in possession of classified materials and turn them over to the authorities at least several times a year, the AP has reported. It’s been a problem off and on for decades, from presidents to Cabinet members and staff across multiple administrations stretching as far back as Jimmy Carter. 

            But the issue has taken on greater significance since former President Donald Trump insistently retained classified material at his Florida estate, prompting the unprecedented FBI seizure of thousands of pages of records last year. 

            Biden has said he was surprised by the presence of classified documents. He said the items were “to the best of my knowledge … from 1974, stray papers.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806975,Judge to rule Tuesday on Missouri's man's murder conviction,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A judge will announce next week whether he will overturn the conviction of a Missouri man who was imprisoned for a 1994 murder that he has always said he didn't commit.

            St. Louis Circuit Judge David Mason has set a hearing for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday to announce his decision in the case of Lamar Johnson, who was been serving a life sentence after being convicted in 1995 of killing Marcus Boyd. 

            St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner is seeking to vacate Johnson’s murder conviction, while the Missouri Attorney General’s Office wants to keep Johnson behind bars.











            Mason heard testimony in December from both sides under a law that allows prosecutors to get seek hearings in cases where there is fresh evidence of a wrongful conviction.

            Boyd was shot to death on the front porch of his St. Louis home by two men wearing ski masks on Oct. 30, 1994. 

            Johnson was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison but a second suspect, Phil Campbell, who has since died, was given a seven-year prison term after pleading guilty to a reduced charge.

            Johnson, now 49, testified during December's hearing that he was with his girlfriend the night of Boyd's death, except for a few minutes when he was selling drugs. The drug sale occurred about the same time Boyd was killed and blocks away from the scene, he said. 

            James Howard, who is serving a life sentence for murder and several other crimes committed three years after Boyd was killed, testified that he and Campbell killed Boyd during a scuffle. He said Johnson was not there.

            Campbell, years before his death, signed an affidavit saying Johnson was not involved in the killing.

            Prosecutors from Missouri Attorney General’s Office argued that none of the new evidence presented at the hearing was credible.ST.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806986,"Prepped and eloquent, Zelenskyy wows Europe's leaders","BRUSSELS (AP) — Before the Ukraine war, Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to western European capitals as a junior partner, one of many leaders of poorer eastern countries looking for aid and attention.This week, he strode confidently through the halls of power in London, Paris and Brussels, pushing for warplanes and EU membership, and drawing admiring crowds.He showered European leaders with thanks, hugs and kisses for all their support so far to counter the Russian invasion — but grew ever bolder in his demands for more.The man in olive drab proved to be an overpowering presence who knows how to set the agenda in Western minds, as much as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has done from the other side of the frontline.Behind closed doors during a whirlwind tour of European allies, Zelenskyy even surprised some European leaders by knowing more than they did about what weapons their arsenals hold that could help Ukraine, according to diplomats in Brussels.“He left an enormous impression, honestly, on all the leaders,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.While Zelenskyy didn’t go home with fighter jets or promise of quick EU membership, his daring trip stepped up pressure on Western allies to do more to help.In Britain, he made an impact with a sweeping address to Parliament that prompted fawning praise from the Times of London: “In Churchillian cadences he echoed Britain’s wartime leader in insisting that ‘freedom will win — we know Russia will lose.’”For months Zelenskyy wanted Western tanks, and as part of Germany’s sea change in strategic policy Berlin agreed to provide some and let others do too. Immediately, the Ukraine president pressed on for fighter jets. And during Wednesday’s visit to Britain, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said combat planes were “part of the conversation,” adding that “nothing is off the table.”As a trained performer — he is a former actor — Zelenskyy made a similarly strong impression appearing in the European Union’s Parliament and a summit of the bloc’s 27 leaders on Thursday. Host Charles Michel reminisced about the fateful Feb. 24 opening day of the Russian attack when Zelenskky took time to address the leaders from a bunker. Many were left wondering if they would ever see him again.Since then, the EU has spent or committed some 67 billion euros ($71.48 billion) in aid on Kyiv, and opened up a channel to funnel military hardware into the nation — a move that few would have thought possible just a year ago.And Zelenskyy pressed on, insisting on more help in what he painted as an existential battle for Europe’s civilization.Everybody wanted a piece of him in Brussels — and to be seen in a photo with him. Some leaders took him almost in a wrestling grip, pressing hands and elbows, kisses flying all around.An EU official who took part in the meeting described “a certain pride in having been able to mix with the star of the day.”And before the night was done, Zelenskyy’s magic started to have some effect.EU leaders pledged to look at boosting ammunition production for Ukraine. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a new 10-billion euro sanctions package under discussion would focus on depriving Russia of military goods it needs and cannot get anywhere else.And Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger promised to “work on” giving Ukraine its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets.It is not just the silver-tongued rhetoric. Some EU officials and leaders were stunned at Zelenskyy’s pinpoint preparation.At the summit, he had meetings in small groups with EU leaders to ask them directly for the weapons he wanted. “Zelenskyy gave all leaders, each of them, a list of the material that was needed for the war,” said the EU official, speaking anonymously because the discussions took place behind closed doors.“In fact, Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian team know better what each member has in his stocks than the leaders themselves,” the official said. “They know exactly what they need, and they know what they should ask for.”Some leaders vied to show they’re giving him what Ukraine wants.European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said allies should consider “quickly, as a next step, providing long-range systems” and fighter jets to Ukraine. Since the head of the EU legislature really has no say in this, EU member states were quick with criticism behind the scenes.And even Zelenskyy can get ahead of himself. Much though he has pressed to get EU membership talks started, a process that can take years, the EU has been holding off with polite diplomatic talk.“Of course we need it this year,“ Zelenskyy said, then looked at summit host Charles Michel, and insisted, tongue-in-cheek: “When I say this year, I mean this year. Two, zero, 23.”Then he fell back on his past as a comedian. He laughed.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/11,181,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806987,Japan's earthquake recovery offers hard lessons for Turkey,"TOKYO (AP) — Mountains of rubble and twisted metal. Death on an unimaginable scale. Grief. Rage. Relief at having survived.What's left behind after a natural disaster so powerful that it rends the foundations of a society? What lingers over a decade later, even as the rest of the world moves on?Similarities between the calamity unfolding this week in Turkey and Syria and the triple disaster that hit northern Japan in 2011 may offer a glimpse of what the region could face in the years ahead. They're linked by the sheer enormity of the collective psychological trauma, of the loss of life and of the material destruction.The combined toll of Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake rose past 23,000 deaths on Friday as authorities announced the discovery of new bodies. That has already eclipsed the more than 18,400 who died in the disaster in Japan.That magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m., March 11, 2011. Not long after, cameras along the Japanese coast captured the wall of water that hit the Tohoku region. The quake was one of the biggest on record, and the tsunami it caused washed away cars, homes, office buildings and thousands of people, and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Huge boats were dropped miles away from the ocean in the towering jumbled debris of what had once been cities, cars toppled on their sides like playthings among the ruined streets and obliterated buildings.Many wondered if the area would ever return to what it was before.A big lesson from Japan is that a disaster of this size doesn't ever really have a conclusion — a lesson Turkey itself knows well from a 1999 earthquake in the country's northwest that killed some 18,000 people. Despite speeches about rebuilding, the Tohoku quake has left a deep gash in the national consciousness and the landscapes of people's lives.Take the death toll.Deaths directly attributable to the quake in Turkey will level off in coming weeks, but it's unlikely to be the end.Japan, for instance, has recognized thousands of other people who died later from stress-related heart attacks, or because of poor living conditions.And despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent in Japan on reconstruction, some things won't ever come back — including a sense of place.Before the quake, Tohoku was filled with small cities and villages, surrounded by farms, the ports filled with fleets of fishing boats. It’s one of the wildest, most beautiful coastlines in Japan.Today, while the wreckage of the quake and tsunami has largely been removed and many roads and buildings rebuilt, there are still large areas of empty space, places where buildings haven’t been erected, farms haven’t been replanted. Businesses have spent years trying to reconstruct decimated customer bases.Just as workers once did in Japan, an army of rescuers in Turkey and Syria are digging through obliterated buildings, picking through twisted metal, pulverized concrete and exposed wires for survivors.What comes next won't be easy.In Japan, there was initially a palpable pride in the country's ability to endure disaster. People stood calmly in long orderly lines for food and water. They posted notices on message boards in destroyed towns with descriptions of loved ones in the hopes that rescue workers would find them.After what locals called the Great East Japan Earthquake, the dead in Tohoku were left by piles of rubble, neatly wrapped in taped-up blankets, waiting to be taken away by workers still combing through the detritus for anyone left alive.The long haul of rebuilding has challenged this resolve. The work has been uneven and, at times, painfully slow, hampered by government incompetence, petty squabbling and bureaucratic wrangling. Nearly half a million people were displaced in Japan. Tens of thousands still haven’t returned home.The issue has seeped into politics, especially as the debate continues about how to handle the aftermath of catastrophic meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Years later, a fear of radiation permeates, and some areas of northern Japan have placed radiation counters in parks and other public areas. Officials and experts are still undecided how to remove the highly radioactive melted fuel debris in the reactor.There’s already been criticism that the Turkish government has failed to enforce modern construction codes for years, even as it allowed a real estate boom in earthquake-prone areas, and that it has been slow to respond to the disaster.The years since 2011 have seen another failure, one officials in Japan have acknowledged: an inability to help those traumatized by what they experienced.Some 2,500 people are unaccounted for across Tohoku, and people are still searching for their loved ones' remains. One man got a diving license and has gone on weekly dives for years trying to find evidence of his wife.People still occasionally unearth victims’ photo albums, clothes and other belongings.Perhaps the most telling connection, however, is the sharp empathy shared by those who have survived a cataclysmic disaster, and the gratitude at seeing strangers help ease their suffering.A group of about 30 rescue workers from Turkey were in the hard-hit town of Shichigahama for about six months in 2011 for search and rescue operations.Shichigahama locals have not forgotten. They have now started a donation campaign for Turkey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806988,"How they compare: Trump, Biden, Pence classified documents","Classified documents keep showing up where they shouldn't be.The FBI search on Friday for additional classified documents at former Vice President Mike Pence's home in Indiana — after ot hers were found by his lawyers recently — followed the revelation of classified materials at President Joe Biden's Delaware home and former office and the seizure last year of hundreds of documents marked classified from Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of former President Donald Trump.A look at similarities and differences among the cases:HOW MANY CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?PENCE: “A small number of documents bearing classified markings” were discovered last week at Pence's home north of Indianapolis, Pence’s lawyer, Greg Jacob, wrote in a Jan. 18 letter to the National Archives and Records Administration, shared with The Associated Press.In all, four boxes containing copies of administration papers — two in which “a small number” of papers bearing classified markings were found, and two containing “courtesy copies of vice presidential papers” — were discovered, according to Jacob.On Friday, an FBI search of Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, uncovered an additional document that contained one page with classified markings, according to Pence spokesperson Devin O'Malley.BIDEN: It's unclear precisely how many classified papers have been recovered from Biden's home and former office. Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, said this month that “a small number of documents with classified markings” were discovered on Nov. 2, 2022, in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank in Washington, as Biden's personal attorneys were clearing out the offices.Sauber said Jan. 12 that a second batch of documents with classified markings — a “small number,"" he said — had been found in a storage space in Biden's garage near Wilmington, Delaware, along with one document located in Biden's personal library in his home. Days later, Sauber clarified that six pages, not a single one, had been found in the library.During a nearly 13-hour search on Jan. 20, FBI agents searching Biden’s Delaware home located six additional items that contained documents with classified markings and also took possession of some of his handwritten notes, said Bob Bauer, a lawyer for the president.TRUMP: Roughly 300 documents with classification markings — including some at the top secret level — have been recovered from Trump since he left office in January 2021.In January 2022, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of documents, telling Justice Department officials they contained “a lot” of classified material. In August, FBI agents took more than 33 boxes and containers totaling 11,000 documents from Mar-a-Lago, including roughly 100 with classification markings found in a storage room and an office.HOW QUICKLY WERE THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS TURNED OVER?PENCE: Jacob said the records were discovered by Pence lawyers on Jan. 16, secured in a locked safe and retrieved by FBI agents on Jan. 19. The four boxes of papers were delivered to the Archives on Jan. 23.BIDEN: After the materials were discovered at the think tank on Nov. 2, Biden's personal attorneys immediately alerted the White House counsel's office, which notified the National Archives, Sauber said. The Archives took custody of the documents the next day.Biden’s personal lawyers then began examining other locations where records might have been shipped after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017. They found documents on Dec. 20 in his Wilmington garage and on Jan. 11 and 12 in his home library.Sauber said that the Justice Department was “immediately notified” and took custody of the records.On Jan. 20, Biden voluntarily allowed the FBI to search his Wilmington home, where additional documents were located.TRUMP: A Trump representative told the National Archives December 2021 that presidential records had been found at Mar-a-Lago, nearly a year after Trump left office. Fifteen boxes of records containing some classified material were transferred to the Archives in January.A few months later, investigators from the Justice Department and FBI visited Mar-a-Lago to get more information about classified materials taken to Florida. Federal officials served a subpoena for some documents believed to be at the estate.In August 2022, FBI agents conducting a search retrieved 33 boxes from Mar-a-Lago while executing a warrant that showed they were investigating possible crimes including the willful retention of national defense information and efforts to obstruct the federal probe.The search came after lawyers for Trump provided a sworn certification that all government records had been returned.WHAT ABOUT POSSIBLE CHARGES?PENCE AND BIDEN: There is no indication either was aware of the existence of the records before they were found and turned over.It appears both turned over the records quickly, without intent to conceal. That’s important because the Justice Department historically looks for willfulness, or an intent to mishandle government secrets, in deciding whether to bring criminal charges.In Biden's case, even if the Justice Department were to find the case prosecutable on the evidence, its Office of Legal Counsel has concluded that a president is immune from prosecution during his time in office. Former special counsel Robert Mueller cited that guidance in deciding not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump should face charges as part of the investigation into coordination between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.On Jan. 12, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of documents in Biden's possession. Robert Hur, the Trump-appointed former U.S. attorney in Maryland, will lead the investigation.TRUMP: The former president possibly faces exposure for obstruction over the protracted battle to retrieve the documents. And, since he's no longer in office, he wouldn't be afforded protections from possible prosecution.In November, Garland appointed Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor with a background in public corruption probes, to lead investigations into Trump's retention of classified documents, as well as key aspects of a separate probe involving the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to undo the 2020 election.WHAT HAVE THE THREE MEN HAD TO SAY?PENCE: In August, Pence told The Associated Press that he did not take any classified information with him when he left office, answering, “No, not to my knowledge” when asked directly if he had retained any such information.As vice president, Pence would have had the power to declassify some documents, though he hasn’t said that he did.On Friday, spokesperson O'Malley said the former vice president and his legal team “fully cooperated with the appropriate authorities and agreed to a consensual search of his residence.""BIDEN: Biden said earlier this month he was “surprised to learn"" that documents had been found at his think tank. He said he didn't know what was in the material but takes classified documents “very seriously.”His team ""did what they should have done,” Biden said. “They immediately called the Archives.”Biden told reporters at the White House Jan. 12 that he was “cooperating fully and completely” with a Justice Department investigation into how classified information and government records were stored.TRUMP: Trump, who had the ability when he was president to declassify documents, has contended at times that he did so regarding the documents that he took with him — though he has provided no evidence of that. He said in a Fox News interview in September that a president can declassify material “even by thinking about it.”The former president has called the Mar-a-Lago search an “unannounced raid” that was “not necessary or appropriate” and represented “dark times for our nation.”WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS?PENCE: As he lays the groundwork for a possible 2024 White House bid, the document discovery thrusts Pence into the debate over the handling of secret materials by officials who have served in the highest ranks of government. He had previously insisted that he followed stringent protocols regarding classified documents.BIDEN: His document disclosure could intensify criticism by Republicans and others who say that if Trump is guilty of anything, so is he.There are also possible ramifications in a new, GOP-controlled Congress where Republicans are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden’s administration.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has said, “I think Congress has to investigate this."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, has requested that intelligence agencies conduct a “damage assessment” of potentially classified documents.TRUMP: The documents probe is one of many that complicate the former president's bid for the White House in 2024, particularly after it became clear that the DOJ had launched a criminal investigation into the retention of top secret government information.Trump and his supporters have described the Mar-a-Lago search as a partisan attack from Democrats.During his 2024 campaign launch in November, at the same club agents had searched months earlier, Trump cast himself as a victim of wayward prosecutors and “festering, rot and corruption of Washington.”___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/02/11,110,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806993,U.S. shoots down car-sized unidentified object flying above Alaska,"A U.S. F-22 fighter jet on Friday shot down an unidentified object flying high over Alaska, U.S. officials said, less than a week after the military brought down a Chinese balloon that had flown across the United States.A Sidewinder missile downed the latest craft, which was about the size of a small car, said U.S. Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson.""We don't know who owns this object,"" said White House spokesperson John Kirby, adding that it was unclear where it began its flight.President Joe Biden ordered the shootdown, which was announced from the White House.On Feb. 4, another U.S. F-22 fighter jet brought down what the U.S. government called a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina following its week-long journey across the United States and portions of Canada. China's government has said it was a civilian research vessel.Some lawmakers criticized the president for not shooting down the Chinese balloon sooner. The U.S. military had recommended waiting until it was over the ocean out of fear of injuries from falling debris.The Pentagon and the White House declined to give a detailed description of the latest object, saying only that it was far smaller than the Chinese balloon.U.S. officials declined to speculate about what the object might be, even after a day of observation, raising questions about what kind of object could be so difficult to identify by experienced U.S. pilots and intelligence officials.The Pentagon said it was first detected on Thursday using ground radars. F-35 aircraft were then sent to investigate. The UFO was flying at about 40,000 feet (12,190 meters) in a northeasterly direction, posing a risk to civilian air traffic.The object was shot down off the coast of northeastern Alaska over frozen U.S. territorial waters near the Canadian border. Officials said it would be far easier to retrieve pieces of the object from the ice than it was with the Chinese balloon, pieces of which sank in the ocean when it was shot down.UNMANNED VESSELRyder said American pilots who flew alongside the latest object before it was downed determined that no human was aboard. He added it was incapable of maneuvering and did not resemble an airplane. Ryder and other officials would not say whether it could simply be a weather balloon or another type of balloon.""It wasn't an aircraft per se,"" Ryder told a news briefing.The F-22 shot down the object at 1:45 p.m. EST.Asked why Biden's authorization was necessary, Ryder acknowledged that the U.S. military commander overseeing North American airspace had the authority to shoot down objects that posed a military risk or risk to the American people.""In this particular case, it was determined that this posed a reasonable threat to air traffic,"" Ryder said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it closed some airspace in northern Alaska to support Department of Defense activities.Since the shootdown of the 200-foot-tall (60-meter-high) Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon, U.S. officials have been scouring the ocean to recover debris and the undercarriage of electronic gadgetry.Ryder told reporters ""a significant"" amount of the balloon had already been recovered or located, suggesting American officials may soon have more information about any Chinese espionage capabilities aboard the vessel.After Friday's object was shot down, some lawmakers praised Biden.""Glad to see the president act swiftly on this new intrusion to our airspace,"" Senator Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.During an often contentious Senate hearing on Thursday, lawmakers criticized the Pentagon for not shooting down the Chinese balloon earlier, underscoring persistent concern in Congress about gaps in the U.S. ability to safeguard its airspace.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal, Steve Holland, Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Editing by Chris Reese, Jonathan Oatis, Don Durfee, David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)",2023/02/11,388,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806996,Favre seeks dismissal from Mississippi welfare funds lawsuit,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Brett Favre's lawyers filed papers Friday again asking a Mississippi judge to dismiss the retired NFL quarterback from a lawsuit that demands repayment of millions of dollars of welfare money intended to help some of the poorest people in the U.S.

            The Mississippi Department of Human Services last year sued Favre and more than three dozen other people or businesses. The suit says money from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program was improperly spent, including on projects Favre supported: $5 million for a volleyball arena at the university where Favre's daughter played the sport and $1.7 million toward development of a concussion treatment drug.

            “It is apparent that MDHS has sued Favre, a Mississippi and national celebrity, to try to deflect responsibility for its own egregious wrongdoing in allowing tens of millions of dollars of its public funds to be misspent — funds for which MDHS itself admits it was ‘exclusively responsible,’” said the filing Friday by Favre's lawyers, including Eric D. Herschmann of Austin, Texas.











            Favre, who lives in Mississippi, sought to be dismissed from the state lawsuit in November, then the state revised its demand against him in December. The filing Friday responds to the state's December demand.

            The latest attempt to get out of the state lawsuit came a day after Favre filed three defamation lawsuits against Mississippi Auditor Shad White and two former NFL players who have sharply criticized Favre in their roles as national sportscasters — Pat McAfee and Shannon Sharpe.

            On his podcast Friday, McAfee scoffed at the defamation suit. He said he received a “warning shot” from Favre's lawyers before it was filed, in a letter that demanded he erase every video he had recorded that included mentions of Favre and the alleged misspending of welfare money.

            “I looked at that. I said, ‘That is hilarious.' Of course we're not doing that,"" McAfee said on ""The Pat McAfee Show.”

            McAfee said Favre's lawyers also demanded that he publicly apologize to Favre by Wednesday evening. Talking to others in his studio, McAfee said: “I'm one of the worst apologizers in the world.”

            In the lawsuit against McAfee, Favre said McAfee had used “outrageous falsehoods” that included calling Favre a “thief” who was “stealing from poor people in Mississippi.” McAfee said Friday that the lawsuit used quotes from him that were “certainly accurate.” He said he also frequently said “allegedly” when discussing Favre.

            The lawsuit against White said the Republican state auditor “has carried out an outrageous media campaign of malicious and false accusations"" against Favre to try to boost his own political career. Fletcher Freeman, a spokesperson for White, responded that White has spoken truthfully about the case with statements that are backed by years of work by professionals in the auditor's office.

            In the suit against Sharpe, Favre said Sharpe made “egregiously false” statements about him on the Fox Sports talk show “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,” including that Favre “stole money from people that really needed money.”

            The Associated Press left phone messages for Sharpe on Thursday, seeking comment about the defamation lawsuits. He did not immediately respond to those messages and had not publicly responded by Friday.

            John Davis, who was Mississippi Department of Human Services director from 2016 to mid-2019, pleaded guilty to state and federal charges last year in the Mississippi welfare scandal, and he agreed to testify against others in the state's largest public corruption case. His sentencing has been delayed.

            No criminal charges have been brought against Favre. He has repaid $1.1 million he received for speaking fees from a nonprofit group that spent TANF money with approval from the Mississippi Department of Human Services. White said Favre never showed up to give the speeches.

            Favre’s daughter started playing volleyball at his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi, in 2017. The volleyball arena was a pet project of the NFL Hall of Fame quarterback and he pledged to lead fundraising efforts for it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807005,"Fuel lines from Los Angeles to Vegas, Phoenix shut by leak","LAS VEGAS (AP) — A leak in a fuel pipeline facility in California forced a shutdown of deliveries of gasoline and diesel from the Los Angeles area east to areas including Las Vegas and Phoenix, but officials said Friday they believed supplies would not immediately be affected.

            Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan told The Associated Press the leak was discovered Thursday afternoon at a company station near Los Angeles and that its CALNEV and SFPP West pipelines were shut down while the Houston-based pipeline operator worked to resolve the issue.

            “There are no injuries or fire reported as a result of this incident,” said a company statement, provided by Katherine Hill, communications manager for the publicly traded company. It did not say how much fuel leaked or when service would be restored.











            Hill did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages seeking more information.

            “The appropriate regulatory agencies have been notified, and an investigation into the cause and quantity of the release will be conducted,” the statement said. “We are working closely with our customers on potential impacts.”

            In Las Vegas, officials were “monitoring the situation, believe we have adequate supply, and do not anticipate an immediate impact on gas availability,” according to a statement from Clark County spokesperson Erik Pappa.

            The county said the pipeline provides fuel storage facilities in Southern Nevada with unleaded and diesel fuel. Another pipeline operated by UNEV Pipeline LLC serves the Las Vegas area from northern Utah.

            The Kinder Morgan website says its 566-mile (911-kilometer) CALNEV pipeline transports gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Los Angeles refineries and marine terminals through parallel 14-inch (35.5-centimeter) and 8-inch (20-centimeter) diameter pipelines to Barstow, California, and the Las Vegas area.

            Hill said later that only the larger, 14-inch (35.5-centimeter) pipeline to Las Vegas had been shut down.

            Airports it serves include Nellis Air Force Base and Harry Reid International in Las Vegas and Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert, the company said.

            Kinder Morgan's SFPP West pipeline runs approximately 515 miles (829 kilometers) to transport petroleum products from the Los Angeles area to Colton and Imperial, California, and east to Phoenix.LAS VEGAS (AP) — A leak in a fuel pipeline facility in California forced a shutdown of deliveries of gasoline and diesel from the Los Angeles area east to areas including Las Vegas and Phoenix, but officials said Friday they believed supplies would not immediately be affected.Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan told The Associated Press the leak was discovered Thursday afternoon at a company station near Los Angeles and that its CALNEV and SFPP West pipelines were shut down while the Houston-based pipeline operator worked to resolve the issue.“There are no injuries or fire reported as a result of this incident,” said a company statement, provided by Katherine Hill, communications manager for the publicly traded company. It did not say how much fuel leaked or when service would be restored.Hill did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages seeking more information.“The appropriate regulatory agencies have been notified, and an investigation into the cause and quantity of the release will be conducted,” the statement said. “We are working closely with our customers on potential impacts.”In Las Vegas, officials were “monitoring the situation, believe we have adequate supply, and do not anticipate an immediate impact on gas availability,” according to a statement from Clark County spokesperson Erik Pappa.The county said the pipeline provides fuel storage facilities in Southern Nevada with unleaded and diesel fuel.

            Copley's 15 wins since making his Kings debut on Dec. 6 at Ottawa are the most in the league over the past two months. He is 15-3-1 with a 2.92 goals-against average and .897 save percentage in 20 games this season. 

            Copley, who has won three of his last four starts, has emerged as Los Angeles' top goaltender and has started 20 of the Kings' 26 games since being called up. He set a career high with 45 saves on 48 shots faced in a 4-3 win over Florida on Jan. 24.











            Copley began the year in the American Hockey League with the Ontario Reign and posted a 6-4-1 mark in 11 starts. He was promoted when Cal Petersen struggled the first two months before being placed on waivers and sent down to Ontario. 

            Petersen and Jonathan Quick were splitting time in net.

            This is Copley's ninth professional season. He spent time with Washington and St. Louis before signing with the Kings last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807008,AP source: Trump team turns over items marked as classified,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former President Donald Trump have in recent months voluntarily turned over to federal investigators additional papers marked as classified as well as a laptop belonging to a Trump aide, a person familiar with the situation said Friday night.

            The legal team also provided an empty folder with classified markings, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press to discuss an ongoing investigation. It was not immediately clear what material was supposed to have been in the folder.

            A Justice Department special counsel has been investigating the retention by Trump of hundreds of documents marked as classified at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. FBI agents who served a search warrant at the property in August recovered roughly 100 classified documents, including records classified at the top-secret level. A federal grand jury has been hearing evidence in the case for months. Prosecutors are investigating whether Trump willfully hoarded the material and whether he or anyone else sought to obstruct their probe, court filings show.











            ABC News first reported the discovery of the additional documents.

            The person familiar with the matter said a handful of pages with classified markings were found during a search weeks ago at the Mar-a-Lago complex that was supervised by the Trump legal team, and were promptly provided to the Justice Department. The documents were found in a box containing thousands of pages, the person said. The Trump legal team had enlisted investigators to search for any other classified documents that had not yet been recovered by the government.

            Separately on Friday, the FBI searched the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence and found an additional document with classified markings, following the discovery by his lawyers last month of sensitive documents. FBI officials have also searched the Delaware homes of President Joe Biden after his lawyers found documents with classified markings at his former office in Washington and at his Wilmington property.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807009,Chock and Bates lead at Four Continents figure skating,"Madison Chock and Evan Bates began preparing for the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships even before they were crowned U.S. ice dance champions for the fourth time in their careers.

            It's clearly paying off.

            Chock and Bates took the lead after the rhythm dance at Four Continents on Friday night, scoring 87.67 points to their program set to “Let's Dance” by David Bowie. That was enough to edge Canadian champs Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Soerensen, who scored 86.28 points, and Marjorie Lajoie and Zachary Lagha, who scored 79.04 points.











            “We were prepared and we let our training carry us into this week,” said Chock, who along with Bates won Four Continents in 2019 and 2020. “It feels so good to be skating the way we are training.”

            In the women's event, Haein Lee rode a personal-best free skate to vault from sixth after her short program into first place, becoming the first South Korean skater to win Four Continents since Yuna Kim in 2009 in Vancouver, Canada.

            Lee finished with 210.84 points to edge countrywoman Yelim Kim, who fell apart on the back half of her free skate and finished with 209.29 points. Mone Chiba broke up the South Korean sweep by taking the bronze medal for Japan.

            Isabeau Levito, the 15-year-old American champion who was second after the short program, withdrew with an illness.

            “I always try to do my best,” Lee said. “This time I tried to not think about final results, to focus on my training process, and I think I did well and I'm very happy right now.”

            Chock and Bates set a goal this season of finally winning an elusive world championship, and Four Continents — which brings together the top skaters from non-European countries — is an ideal final tune-up for next month in Japan.

            The pair showed their usual poise and precision on Friday night for their best international score this season.

            “Our season’s best is an amazing feeling going into world championships,” Chock said.

            Beaudry and Soerensen, performing to music from Gloria Estefan, also scored an international season's best, topping their rhythm dance from the NHK Trophy that set them up for the Grand Prix win that weekend.

            “We’ve really been focusing on changing our approach by having a little bit more fun and trying to combat some of the stress that’s inevitable in competition,” Soerensen said. “Inspire the people who watch skating and make them enjoy it.”

            Miura and Kihara, unbeaten in international competition this season, established their lead in the pairs event despite her fall on their side-by-side triple toe loop, thanks in part to a nice throw triple lutz to finish the program.

            “I was nervous and therefore I made the mistake,” Miura said. ""We were able to score higher than 70 points. That shows what we've been accumulating in the past and I think it's proof of how we've grown.”

            Nobody was perfect in pairs: Stellato-Dudek and Deschamps had a mistake on their throw triple loop, and Chan and Howe were shaky on their throw before he fell on their side-by-side triple toe loop.

            “Every time we come out to these competitions, we don’t have a lot of expectations for medals. When we are awarded with those, it’s a bonus for us,” Howe said. “Really we’re out here to just better ourselves.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807021,Clergy sex abuse suits could bankrupt San Diego diocese,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said Friday it may declare bankruptcy in the coming months as it faces “staggering"" legal costs in dealing with some 400 lawsuits alleging priests and others sexually abused children.

            In a letter that was expected to be shared with parishioners this weekend, Bishop Robert McElroy said the cases were filed after California lifted a statute of limitations on childhood sexual abuse claims.

            Assembly Bill 218, which was signed into law in 2019, allows alleged victims to sue up until age 40. Also, beginning in 2020, it opened a three-year window for filing lawsuits without age limitations.











            Most of the alleged abuse cited in the suits took place 50 to 75 years ago, and the earliest claim dates to 1945, Kevin Eckery, communications director for the diocese, said at a Friday news conference, KNSD-TV reported.

            Eckery predicted that it would cost the diocese $550 million to settle the cases, none of which have gone to trial. 

            In his letter, the bishop said none of the suits involve allegations against any currently serving priest.

            “This reflects the reality that the Church has taken enormous steps to root out the sexual abuse of minors in its life and to promote the protection of minors,"" McElroy wrote. 

            Even so, the diocese is facing “staggering"" legal costs and most of its assets were used to settle previous allegations with a $198 million payout in 2007, McElroy wrote.

            “Even with insurance, the diocese will not be able to pay out similar sums now,"" the letter said. “This challenge is compounded by the fact that a bill has now been introduced into the Legislature that seeks to eliminate the statute of limitations entirely, leaving the diocese vulnerable to potential lawsuits forever.""

            Bankruptcy would “provide a pathway"" for the diocese to compensate sexual abuse victims while continuing to run its ministries, the bishop said.

            The diocese has more than 100 active priests and covers San Diego and Imperial counties, an area of more than 8,800 square miles (about 22,800 square kilometers) with a Catholic population of nearly 1.4 million, according to its website.SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said Friday it may declare bankruptcy in the coming months as it faces “staggering"" legal costs in dealing with some 400 lawsuits alleging priests and others sexually abused children.In a letter that was expected to be shared with parishioners this weekend, Bishop Robert McElroy said the cases were filed after California lifted a statute of limitations on childhood sexual abuse claims.Assembly Bill 218, which was signed into law in 2019, allows alleged victims to sue up until age 40.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807023,Love of rare liquor lands Oregon officials in criminal probe,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — The Oregon Department of Justice is opening a criminal investigation into allegations that senior officials in the state's alcohol regulatory agency violated ethics laws by diverting rare, sought-after bourbons for personal use, the state attorney general said Friday.

            The officials said they were paying for the whiskey, which can cost thousands of dollars a bottle, but they allegedly used their knowledge and connections at the commission to obtain the products, according to an internal investigation by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. 

            The practice had purportedly been going on for many years and involved not only state employees but also members of the Oregon Legislature, the OLCC investigator was told. 











            The practice consequently deprived well-heeled whiskey aficionados among the public of the tiny-batch boutique bourbons.

            It also violated several Oregon statutes, including one that prohibits public officials from using confidential information for personal gain, according to the commission’s investigation.

            Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek expressed outrage at the findings and on Wednesday asked the OLCC board of commissioners to fire Executive Director Steve Marks and others who have been implicated. 

            Kotek also asked Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to conduct an independent civil investigation. Instead, the justice department's criminal division opened an investigation, Rosenblum announced, adding that a civil probe would come later.

            “The Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission will comply fully with the criminal investigation announced today by the Oregon Attorney General,” commission spokesman Mark Pettinger said in an email.

            Criminal law involves prosecuting defendants and holding offenders accountable, usually through imprisonment or probationary sentences. Civil law addresses situations in which an economic award or penalty might help remedy a situation.

            Chris Mayton, distilled spirits program director, who was one of the people accused of abusing his position, told the OLCC investigator that he had served as a “facilitator” for commission employees and legislators hundreds of times in acquiring the whiskeys as part of his work duties. He did not name any lawmakers.

            The officials purportedly had very limited bottles of top-shelf bourbon routed to a liquor store, often in the Portland suburb of Milwaukie where the commission headquarters is located, and would reserve them for pickup later.

            The Oregon Government Ethics Commission is in charge of investigating ethics violations by lawmakers. To date, the commission hasn't received any complaints against legislators about the matter, Executive Director Ronald Bersin said in an email Friday.

            Marks has not responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press, but in his responses during the investigation, he denied that he had violated Oregon ethics laws and state policy. However, he acknowledged that he had received preferential treatment “to some extent” in obtaining the whiskey as a commission employee. Marks and the other officials denied they resold the whiskeys they obtained.

            The board of commissioners is appointed by the governor and in turn selects the executive director, according to a commission spokesman.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807024,Defending champion Scottie Scheffler leads WM Phoenix Open,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Defending champion Scottie Scheffler took the lead into the weekend in the WM Phoenix Open, with local favorite Jon Rahm right behind at TPC Scottsdale.

            The second-ranked Scheffler played 25 holes Friday, completing a 3-under 68 in the first round and shooting a bogey-free 64 in the second to get to 10 under. He had a two-stroke lead over Rahm and Adam Hadwin when play was suspended because of darkness.

            Rahm, the former Arizona State star ranked No. 3, also returned early to finish the first round. He shot 68-66 to possibly set up a Super Bowl weekend showdown with Scheffler for the No. 1 ranking.











            “That would be a lot of fun,” Scheffler said. “It looks like right now we’re 1 and 2, but we’ll see how things shake out. A lot of guys still have a lot of golf out there to play. Should be a fun weekend.”

            Hadwin had eight holes left when play was suspended. None of the afternoon starters were able to finish the round.

            Last year, Scheffler beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his first PGA Tour title. Scheffler added victories in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Match Play and Masters and was the PGA Tour's player of the year.

            The Texan has hit 20 of 28 fairways and 27 of 36 greens in regulation.

            “Around this place when you’re hitting fairways and you’re hitting it well the golf course can kind of open up for you,” Scheffler said. “But the opposite can happen in a hurry because there’s trouble lurking on basically every hole.”

            After a frost delay and gusting wind Thursday, the players faced a lighter breeze that shifted frequently.

            “The wind was really moving around,"" Scheffler said. ""It could be difficult to judge at times. But it was nice and warm, so it was good.”

            Rahm opened the year with consecutive victories in the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. He had his best finish at TPC Scottsdale in 2015, when he tied for fifth as an amateur.

            Rahm played a four-hole stretch in 4 under on his first nine in the second round. He birdied the par-5 13th, holed out of a greenside bunker for eagle on the par-5 15th and made a 7-footer for birdie on the par-3 16th.

            “I hit a lot of great tee shots today,"" Rahm said. ""A lot of good iron shots that ... didn’t end up in great spots.”

            His mother and 87-year-old grandmother, visiting from Spain, watched him on No. 16.

            “Unexpected. Very unexpected,” Rahm said. “I’m glad I didn’t know until I hit the shot, honestly, because otherwise I think I would have tried too hard for my grandma to hit a good shot.”

            While Scheffler and Rahm topped the leaderboard, top-ranked Rory McIlroy had to rally after an opening 73 in the toughest conditions Thursday. He had four birdies in a five-hole stretch and was 3 under overall when play was suspended. 

            McIlroy is trying to make it three wins in a row on the PGA Tour after taking the Tour Championship in August and The CJ Cup in October. He also won two weeks ago in Dubai on the European tour in his first start of the year.

            Wyndham Clark was 7 under after rounds of 68 and 67. Sungjae Im also was 7 under with six holes left.

            Jason Day was 6 under, finishing off a 65 to take the first-round lead and adding a 71.

            “I’m glad I’m in the house,"" Day said. ""I’m just going to go rest up.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807026,IRS won't tax most relief payments made by states last year,"The IRS announced Friday that most relief checks issued by states last year aren’t subject to federal taxes, providing 11th hour guidance as tax returns start to pour in.

            A week after telling payment recipients to delay filing returns, the IRS said it won’t challenge the taxability of payments related to general welfare and disaster, meaning taxpayers who received those checks won’t have to pay federal taxes on those payments. All told, the IRS said special payments were made by 21 states in 2022.

            “The IRS appreciates the patience of taxpayers, tax professionals, software companies and state tax administrators as the IRS and Treasury worked to resolve this unique and complex situation,” the IRS said Friday evening in a statement.











            The states where the relief checks do not have to be reported by taxpayers are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. That also applies to energy relief payments in Alaska that were in addition to the annual Permanent Fund Dividend, the IRS said.

            In addition, many taxpayers in Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia also avoid federal taxes on state payments if they meet certain requirements, the IRS said.

            In California, most residents got a “middle class tax refund” last year, a payment of up to $1,050 depending on their income, filing status and whether they had children. The Democratic-controlled state Legislature approved the payments to help offset record high gas prices, which peaked at a high of $6.44 per gallon in June according to AAA.

            A key question was whether the federal government would count those payments as income and require Californians to pay taxes on it. Many California taxpayers had delayed filing their 2022 returns while waiting for an answer. Friday, the IRS said it would not tax the refund.

            Maine was another example of states where the IRS stance had created confusion. More than 100,000 tax returns already had been filed as of Thursday, many of them submitted before the IRS urged residents to delay filing their returns.

            Democratic Gov. Janet Mills pressed for the $850 pandemic relief checks last year for most Mainers to help make ends meet as a budget surplus ballooned.

            Her administration designed the relief program to conform with federal tax code to avoid being subject to federal taxes or included in federal adjusted gross income calculations, said Sharon Huntley, spokesperson for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.

            Senate President Troy Jackson called the confusion caused by the IRS “harmful and irresponsible.”

            “Democrats and Republicans worked together to create a program that would comply with federal tax laws and deliver for more than 800,000 Mainers,” the Democrat from Allagash said in a statement Friday.

            Sharp reported from Portland, Maine. Associated Press writer Adam Beam in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.The IRS announced Friday that most relief checks issued by states last year aren’t subject to federal taxes, providing 11th hour guidance as tax returns start to pour in.A week after telling payment recipients to delay filing returns, the IRS said it won’t challenge the taxability of payments related to general welfare and disaster, meaning taxpayers who received those checks won’t have to pay federal taxes on those payments. All told, the IRS said special payments were made by 21 states in 2022.“The IRS appreciates the patience of taxpayers, tax professionals, software companies and state tax administrators as the IRS and Treasury worked to resolve this unique and complex situation,” the IRS said Friday evening in a statement.The states where the relief checks do not have to be reported by taxpayers are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. That also applies to energy relief payments in Alaska that were in addition to the annual Permanent Fund Dividend, the IRS said.In addition, many taxpayers in Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia also avoid federal taxes on state payments if they meet certain requirements, the IRS said.In California, most residents got a “middle class tax refund” last year, a payment of up to $1,050 depending on their income, filing status and whether they had children.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 20, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Y-mAbs repeatedly misled investors about its meetings with the FDA, claiming that it was making progress in demonstrating the effectiveness and efficacy of its drug candidate, omburtamab. What was unknown to investors was that the FDA had repeatedly advised Y-mAbs that the treatment of effect of omburtamab cannot be objectively established or quantified based on a comparison between Study 03-133 and an external cohort comprised of data from the Central German Childhood Cancer Registry (CGCCR) database because of substantial differences in the patient populations, and the absence of tumor response data, and that Study 101 was neither sufficiently advanced nor indicative of efficacy to justify approval. Further, Y-mAbs failed to advise investors that it had elected to submit the March 31, 2022 BLA prior to reaching agreement with the FDA on the content of the application. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Y-mAbs, investors suffered damages.To join the Y-mAbs class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=9496 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807059,Lawsuit over man fatally shot by Indianapolis police settled,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A wrongful death lawsuit filed by the mother of a man fatally shot while being chased by a police officer in Indianapolis has been settled for $390,000.

            The settlement was reached Jan. 31, WRTV-TV reported Friday.

            “This agreement should not be construed as an admission of any liability or wrongdoing,” stated the agreement, which the television station says was provided by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.











            Filed in June 2020 by Demetree Wynn, the federal lawsuit named the city, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department's chief and deputy chief, and the officer who shot Dreasjon Reed.

            That lawsuit alleged the police department failed to adequately train, screen and supervise officers to prevent them from engaging in excessive or deadly force.

            The police department has said officers began pursuing Reed, 21, on May 6, 2020, after they saw someone driving recklessly on Interstate 65. Supervisors ordered an end to that pursuit because the vehicle was going at nearly 90 mph (145 kph), police said.

            Dejoure Mercer, another officer, later spotted the same car on a city street and chased Reed on foot before, police say, the two exchanged gunfire.

            Evidence reviewed by the state police showed that Reed fired two shots from his handgun and the officer fired 13 shots. Investigators were not able to determine who shot first.

            Reed livestreamed an earlier car chase and part of a foot chase on Facebook.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807060,Trail Blazers say they were confident Payton II was healthy,"Portland Trail Blazers general manager Joe Cronin said Friday the team was confident Gary Payton II was healthy before agreeing to trade him to Golden State in a four-team deal that could be at risk.

            The Athletic reported that Payton had failed Golden State’s physical on Friday. The Warriors can either allow the trade to go through anyway, or rescind it. 

            Cronin said he was aware of the report but hadn't been contacted by the Warriors, Hawks or Pistons, who were also in the deal.











            “I haven’t heard from any teams about this. So for now I have to defer,” said Cronin, who was at a news conference to speak about Portland's moves at the NBA trade deadline. 

            Payton’s time in Portland was brief. He signed a $28 million, three-year contract last summer after playing on Golden State’s NBA championship team. But he missed the first 35 games of the season in Portland because of a core injury that required surgery.

            The Athletic reported that that Payton could be sidelined for two to three months with the injury. The report also cite unnamed sources that said he had been playing through pain in Portland. 

            “He had been cleared and we were confident that he was healthy when he was playing,” Cronin said. “We would not have brought him back if we thought he wasn’t healthy or if he was at risk.” 

            Portland coach Chauncey Billups agreed. 

            “We would never push a guy to play. Whether it’s medical or whether a guy just doesn’t feel like he can play that night — say he’s got a headache or say he’s just got a lot of stress at home, or say he has a death in the family,"" Billups said. “I would never push somebody to play because I would always be scared of me doing that and then something actually happening.”

            As part of the trade, Golden State received unprotected 2026 and ‘28 second-round draft picks from Portland while giving up Memphis’ 2026 second-round pick and its own 2028 second-round selection to the Blazers.

            The Warriors sent center James Wiseman to Detroit in the four-team trade. The Pistons traded forward Saddiq Bey to the Hawks and the Blazers acquired forward Kevin Knox II from the Detroit along with three conditional second-round picks from the Hawks.

            In another move before the deadline, the Blazers also dealt forward Josh Hart to the New York Knicks in exchange for forward Cam Reddish, guard Ryan Arcidiacono and a 2023 first-round pick.

            Billups said Reddish would start Friday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder. 

            The Blazers also acquired guard Matisse Thybulle from the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2029 second round pick and sent a 2027 second-round pick to the Charlotte Hornets.

            The Panthers announced that Dom Capers, who served as the team’s first head coach from 1995-98, has been added to new coach Frank Reich’s staff as a senior defensive assistant. Capers coached Reich in 1995 when the Panthers broke into the league as an expansion team.

            The team has also hired Josh McCown, who spent two seasons as a Panthers quarterback, as their new quarterbacks coach, and Peter Hansen as the their linebackers coach. Hansen worked last season with the Denver Broncos under new defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero.











            The 72-year-old Capers brings a wealth of experience to Reich’s staff.

            He earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 1996, leading the Panthers to a 12-4 record and a trip to the NFC championship. He was fired after four seasons, and went on to coach another expansion team, the Houston Texans.

            Capers won a Super Bowl as defensive coordinator with the Green Bay Packers. He's also served as the defensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars and Pittsburgh Steelers. 

            Capers spent the past four seasons as a senior adviser in Jacksonville, Minnesota, Detroit and Denver. Last season he worked alongside Evero, and the Broncos finished seventh in the league in defense.

            The addition of Capers is likely another sign of the Panthers moving to a 3-4 defense.

            McCown, 43, spent 16 seasons in the NFL as a quarterback.

            He served as a backup quarterback for the Panthers in 2008 and 2009, and also coached high school football in the Charlotte area. He interviewed last season for the Houston Texans head coaching job despite never having served as an NFL assistant coach.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807063,"Wolf ousts Tiafoe in Dallas Open quarters, Isner advances","DALLAS (AP) — J.J. Wolf rallied for a three-set victory over No. 2 seed Frances Tiafoe, and John Isner won his 500th career tiebreaker in another straight-sets win in the quarterfinals of the Dallas Open on Friday.

            Top-seeded Taylor Fritz held on to beat No. 7 seed Marcos Giron 7-6 (7), 3-6, 6-3 in a rematch from the quarterfinals of the inaugural Dallas event last year, when Giron won in three sets to set up the first all-American semifinals on the ATP Tour since 2004.

            There wasn't a chance for a replay of four U.S. semifinalists in Dallas, with China's Yibing Wu facing eighth-seeded Adrian Mannarino of Italy in the last quarterfinal. Wu rolled to a 6-3, 6-4 victory and will face Fritz.











            Wolf, the No. 6 seed, reached his second career semifinal by erasing two break points in the deciding game of another all-American match, closing out the 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win with his 11th ace on his second match point.

            Wolf was broken twice by Tiafoe, a U.S. Open semifinalist last year, while facing nine break points in the first set. The 24-year-old didn't face another break point until the final game.

            “I usually don't think about the outcome, so I was just feeding off the energy of the fans and playing every point as hard as I could,” Wolf said.

            Wolf's opponent is the fifth-seeded Inser, who is back in the semifinals in the second year of his hometown event after a 7-6 (8), 7-5 win over Ecuador's Emilio Gomez, the unseeded 31-year-old son of 1990 French Open champion Andres Gomez.

            Isner is the first ATP Tour player to 500 wins in tiebreakers. Roger Federer is second with 466.

            Isner and Gomez, playing in his first tour-level quarterfinal, won every point on their own serve in the tiebreaker until Isner took a 9-8 lead on Gomez's serve before serving out the first set.

            Inser closed out the match with the only break, and the big-serving American hasn't had his serve broken in any of the three matches.

            Fritz, the highest-ranked American at No. 8, reached the semifinals after a disappointing second-round exit at the Australian Open. The 25-year-old won three titles in 2022 and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon.

            After dropping the second set, Fritz broke Giron's serve for a 2-0 lead in the deciding set and stayed in front from there. 

            Wu needed just 73 minutes to eliminate the journeyman Mannarino and reach an ATP semifinal for the first time.

            Wu saved all three break points he faced while converting three of four break chances against Mannarino.

            The 23-year-old Wu was the first Chinese man to reach the third round at the U.S. Open when he did it as a qualifier last year. Injured for much of 2019-20, Wu is ranked in the top 100 for the first time.

            Toronto Mayor John Tory said at a late Friday night news conference that he developed a relationship with an employee in his office. 

            The 68-year-old was known as a straight-laced, button down moderate conservative — almost the polar opposite of previous Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, whose term was plagued by scandals involving public drinking and illegal drug use.











             “I recognize that permitting this relationship to develop was a serious error in judgment on my part,” Tory said after the Toronto Star reported on the affair. 

            “It came at a time when Barb, my wife of 40-plus years and I were enduring many lengthy periods apart while I carried out my responsibilities during the pandemic,"" he said. 

            ""As a result, I have decided I will step down as Mayor so I can take the time to reflect on my mistakes and to do the work of rebuilding the trust of my family.”

            Tory was first elected mayor in 2014, in part on a promise to restore respectability to the office after the turbulent term of Ford. Tory recently won a third term. 

            Rob Ford’s four-year tenure as mayor of Canada’s largest city was marred by his drinking and crack cocaine use. He later died from a rare form of cancer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807067,New Mexico St. suspends operations of men's basketball team,"New Mexico State indefinitely suspended its men's basketball program Friday night in a virtually unheard of move that the university says is unrelated to a fatal shooting involving one of its players last year.

            The school also placed first-year coach Greg Heiar and his staff on administrative leave for what it said were violations of university policy and separate from the Nov. 19 shooting of a student from rival University of New Mexico. Aggies power forward Mike Peake was suspended in early December while a third-party investigator looks into his involvement in the shooting in Albuquerque.

            The shutdown of a Division I program in midseason for reasons other than a spate of injuries or, more recently, a COVID-19 outbreak, is virtually unheard of. SMU's football program canceled its 1988 season after the NCAA handed it the “death penalty” the year before, but that move was made before the season was underway.











            New Mexico State's game against California Baptist on Saturday has been canceled, and it is unknown how many more of the team's five remaining games, all in the Western Athletic Conference, will also be wiped out.

            The program has been teetering since the night of the Nov. 19 shooting. Shortly after the shooting, Heiar loaded the team onto a bus and left town, minus Peake and three players who had picked him up and taken him to the hospital with a leg injuries. Police stopped the bus on its way back to the school's campus, three hours south in Las Cruces.

            Peake has not been charged in the shooting. The district attorney in Albuquerque is conducting a separate investigation.

            The school's announcement said Friday's move was not related to the shooting and its aftermath. The board of regents released a separate statement saying it supported ""the action taken by the university leaders and is confident a full and thorough investigation will be conducted.”

            The Aggies had previously canceled the game against the Lobos in Albuquerque that had been scheduled for the day after the shooting, along with the Dec. 3 rematch in Las Cruces. 

            The Aggies have won seven WAC titles and made eight appearances in March Madness since 2007. They are supposed to move into Conference USA next year. But this year, they have struggled to a 9-15 record — including 10 losses in their last 12 games — under Heiar, who took over for Chris Jans when he left for Mississippi State. Jans went 122-32 in five seasons and took the Aggies to three tournaments.

            Leadership at the school is also in flux. The board of regents recently decided not to renew the contract of Chancellor Dan Arvizu, which expires in June. Over the past 14 months, both the school's president and provost have resigned or been removed from their positions.

            Pierre Engvall also scored and Mitch Marner added two assists for Toronto, which remains in second place in the Atlantic Division with 72 points — 11 points behind first-place Boston.

            “I thought we played a pretty solid and patient game,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “We didn’t give up a lot and extended our lead in the third period, which is what you want to do.”











            Joonas Korpisalo had 41 saves for Columbus, which has lost four straight and remains last in the NHL standings.

            Tavares put Toronto up at 5:45 of the first period with his team-lead-tying 10th power-play goal of the season, slipped between Korpisalo’s pads.

            “We did some good things, got involved,” Tavares said. “I think after the first period we controlled the neutral zone.”

            Korpisalo kept Columbus in the game through two periods, stopping 27 shots, before Toronto took charge in the third period, burying goals 48 seconds apart from Engvall and Tavares for a 3-0 lead at 8:38.

            “(We) were a shot away for a long time,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “We actually had a couple of decent looks there at the end of the second and early in the third, and then they get those two quick ones on us.”

            WELCOME BACK

            The Blue Jackets recalled D Tim Berni from Cleveland of the AHL. ... The Maple Leafs recalled F Pontus Holmberg, F Alex Steeves and G Joseph Woll from Toronto of the AHL after putting G Matt Murray on injured reserve.

            HURRY UP AND WAIT

            Lane Pederson, claimed off waivers from Vancouver before the All-Star break, remained on the sidelines as he does not yet have the proper documentation to join the Blue Jackets on the ice.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807070,Argentina worried over Russian women traveling to give birth,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine officials are expressing concern over the large number of pregnant Russian women who have recently entered the country to give birth as a way to obtain an Argentine passport, claiming three Russian spies who were recently detained in Slovenia were citizens of the South American country.

            Immigration authorities forbade six pregnant Russian women from entering Argentina this week — three on Wednesday and three on Thursday — saying they had falsely claimed to be tourists, Florencia Carignano, the national director for migration, told a local news channel. 

            At least some of the women have launched legal proceedings to be able to enter the country and a judge gave a green light to a habeas corpus petition Friday to allow the six women to provisionally enter Argentina.











            “These women who didn’t commit a crime, who didn’t break any migratory law, are being illegally deprived of their freedom,” Christian Rubilar, who represents three of the six women detained at the Ezeiza International Airport outside Buenos Aires, said prior to the judge's decision.

            The pregnant women have put a spotlight on a phenomenon that has become evident in Argentina in recent weeks.

            “The quantity really is very big each day, only last night in the last Ethiopian (Airlines) flight, 33 Russian citizens entered with pregnancies of approximately 32, 33, 34 weeks,” Carignano said.

            In the last year, 21,757 Russian citizens have entered Argentina, including around 10,500 pregnant women and “the numbers have been increasing in the last few months,” Carignano said. “In the last three months, 5,819 women who were about to give birth entered” Argentina.

            Anyone born on Argentine soil is immediately granted citizenship and having a national-born child accelerates the citizenship process for the parents.

            The judiciary is currently investigating whether there is some sort of criminal organization bringing Russian women to Argentina. While authorities did not say why such a ring would bring pregnant women to Argentina, some speculate the country has the right mix of lax immigration laws with Russians not needing visas, free universal healthcare and a passport that allows access to many countries without a visa.

            “They are ripping people off, taking advantage of the desperation of war,” Rubilar said.

            Authorities emphasized officials do not have any issues with Russian citizens arriving in Argentina, but they want to make sure they really have plans to live in the country.

            “We don’t have any problem with people from any nationality who want to come live in Argentina, who want to raise their kids here, invest in Argentina. The problem is that these people come, leave and don’t return to Argentina and they leave with a passport,” Carignano said.

            Argentina is a country that has traditionally been open to immigrants, but red flags were raised in immigration offices after three Russian spies were detained in Slovenia with Argentine passports, Carignano said. 

            “These people surely came to have children in Argentina,” she said.

            In late January, Slovenian media reported that authorities had detained two alleged Russian spies and this time the reports said one of the two held Argentine citizenship.

            “If we don’t start to control who we give passports to what’s going to happen to us Argentines is that they’re going to start asking for visas everywhere and the passport will no longer have the trust that it has with other countries,” Carignano said, noting that Argentines can enter 171 countries without a visa.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine officials are expressing concern over the large number of pregnant Russian women who have recently entered the country to give birth as a way to obtain an Argentine passport, claiming three Russian spies who were recently detained in Slovenia were citizens of the South American country.Immigration authorities forbade six pregnant Russian women from entering Argentina this week — three on Wednesday and three on Thursday — saying they had falsely claimed to be tourists, Florencia Carignano, the national director for migration, told a local news channel.At least some of the women have launched legal proceedings to be able to enter the country and a judge gave a green light to a habeas corpus petition Friday to allow the six women to provisionally enter Argentina.“These women who didn’t commit a crime, who didn’t break any migratory law, are being illegally deprived of their freedom,” Christian Rubilar, who represents three of the six women detained at the Ezeiza International Airport outside Buenos Aires, said prior to the judge's decision.The pregnant women have put a spotlight on a phenomenon that has become evident in Argentina in recent weeks.“The quantity really is very big each day, only last night in the last Ethiopian (Airlines) flight, 33 Russian citizens entered with pregnancies of approximately 32, 33, 34 weeks,” Carignano said.In the last year, 21,757 Russian citizens have entered Argentina, including around 10,500 pregnant women and “the numbers have been increasing in the last few months,” Carignano said. “In the last three months, 5,819 women who were about to give birth entered” Argentina.Anyone born on Argentine soil is immediately granted citizenship and having a national-born child accelerates the citizenship process for the parents.The judiciary is currently investigating whether there is some sort of criminal organization bringing Russian women to Argentina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807074,World Baseball Classic photos re-uploaded after Taiwan protests absence of representation,"UPDATE: 11 02 2023: 2:00 p.m.: WBC Chair Jim Small issued an apology regarding the incident through Bros Sports Marketing at noon, which read: “We posted a World Baseball Classic graphic to social media that inadvertently did not include a player from the Chinese Taipei, and we regret the error and the inconvenience we have caused to our friends in Taiwan. We truly appreciate the opportunity to bring the World Baseball Classic back to Taiwan, and we look forward to staging a successful event.”TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After Taiwan's lack of representation in the World Baseball Classic’s (WBC) promotional graphic caused controversy, Major League Baseball (MLB) added Taiwan's Lin Tzu-wei (林子偉) to the images.The controversy started on Friday (Feb. 10) when a user named ""CK5566"" on the online forum PTT expressed indignation in Taiwan at being left out from WBC’s promotional graphics. “I’m so pissed … It’s ridiculous, there is no sight of Taiwan’s team in Pool A’s image … There is even China in Pool B’s image! Outrageous! To think we’re the host country!”Other baseball fans echoed the author’s sentiment. ""Bmwnyy870915"" wrote, “Honestly, it’s pretty disrespectful. Even those weaker than Taiwan are on there, not to mention Taiwan is the only one missing.”In response, Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) Commissioner Tsai Chi-chang (蔡其昌) and Bros Sports Marketing, which is responsible for WBC arrangements in Taiwan, wrote on social media that they had protested to MLB and demanded immediate rectification. “If MLB wants to organize games in Taiwan, then it should respect the host country’s team!” Tsai said, adding in hashtags, “There is no room for negotiation.”WBC’s social media pages have now been replaced with a set of images showing a representative player of each country’s team. Pool A’s image features Lin Tzu-wei, though the pool’s roster is now missing from the pages.",2023/02/11,942,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807088,Dolphins' Tagovailoa says he's 'all in' to play next season,"PHOENIX (AP) — Tua Tagovailoa is grateful the Miami Dolphins kept him off the field after suffering his second concussion and he has no doubts about returning to play next season.

            The third-year quarterback missed Miami’s final three games, including a playoff loss to Buffalo, after being diagnosed with a concussion following a loss to Green Bay on Dec. 25.

            “One of the biggest things I was trying to do was get back on the field and it was something that I had to consult with my wife, consult with my parents, my family,” Tagovailoa told the AP Pro Football Podcast on Friday. “But at the end of the day, I think others had bigger interests in my health than I did. (I’m) talking about the Dolphins, and their whole plan was: ‘Hey, we want to just protect you from yourself and not put any pressure on you to return back for this year.’ And so, as much as I wanted to come back and a lot of the conversations that we’ve had, it’s just that’s how the cards played out. 











            “Looking back at it, I’m very, very grateful that they didn’t rush me back. I’ve been able to take care of myself that much more and better.”

            The NFL and the players’ union revised concussion protocols in October following a joint investigation into the procedures after Tagovailoa suffered what was described as a back injury against the Buffalo Bills in September.

            In the first half of a game against Buffalo on Sept. 25, Tagovailoa took a hit from Bills linebacker Matt Milano, which caused him to slam to the ground. He appeared disoriented afterward and stumbled as he tried to get to his feet.

            Tagovailoa was immediately taken to the locker room and returned after he was cleared of any head injury. 

            Just four days later, Tagovailoa started against the Cincinnati Bengals in a Thursday night game. He suffered a concussion in the first half after his head violently slammed the ground on a sack. He displayed the fencing response after the scary hit and was taken off the field by stretcher. Tagovailoa returned after missing two games. 

            When he suffered the second concussion, the Dolphins held him out.

            “I would say it’s very important,” Tagovailoa said about the team not allowing him to return. “In a game like this where masculinity is everything and how you portray yourself in a building like that, you either earn respect from your guys or you lose respect. There’s no ‘I respect you, but.’ It’s either you do or you don’t. 

            “And so having the doctors and all of those guys being able to kind of help take a lot of the load off with all that pressure has been really good.” 

            Tagovailoa was 8-5 in his 13 starts and threw for a career-high 3,548 yards and 25 touchdowns with an NFL-best 105.5 passer rating. He plans to be ready for offseason workouts when the Dolphins return.

            “No reservations here,” said Tagovailoa, who appeared on Radio Row on behalf of Subway. “I believe you’re either all in or you’re not. So I’m all in.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807089,"Tatum scores 41, White 33 as Celtics beat Hornets 127-116","BOSTON (AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 41 points and Derrick White set new career highs with 33 points and eight 3-pointers to help the Boston Celtics hold off the Charlotte Hornets 127-116 on Friday night. 

            Tatum began the fourth quarter on the bench but was reinserted after Charlotte cut Boston’s lead to 14 points with 7:03 to play. The Hornets trailed by 28 in the third quarter before closing period on 15-3 run. 

            It was Tatum’s eighth game this season with 40 or more points, but he played 37 minutes to do it on what was an otherwise light night of work for the MVP contender. 











            “You understand in the course of a game leads are never safe, regardless of a team's record they're always capable of making plays and knocking down shots,"" Tatum said. “I seen earlier (president of basketball operations) Brad (Stevens) told you guys he was making me sit out next week. So I'll get some rest then.”

            Boston has won five of its last six overall and swept the season series with the Hornets 4-0. 

            Terry Rozier led Charlotte with 27 points. LaMelo Ball added 24 points and 10 assists. The Hornets have lost their last six games. 

            White hit his first eight shots of the night, including six from beyond the arc as Boston built as much as a 20-point, first-half lead. White ended the opening half with 26 points and seven 3-pointers. He finished 8 of 14 from 3 for the game. He also had 10 assists. 

            “When you're in the zone it feels good and you just try to hit every shot,” White said.

            His early scoring punch helped fill the void created by the absence of All-Star Jaylen Brown, who was diagnosed with a maxillary fracture in his face after he took an inadvertent elbow from Tatum on Wednesday while going for a rebound during the Celtics’ win over Philadelphia. 

            Brown’s unavailability did little to slow Boston, which shot 49% on the night and hit 25 3-pointers. 

            Charlotte fell behind 6-0 and never led.

            The game also saw the debut of Boston’s newly acquired big man Mike Muscala after he was added at Thursday’s trade deadline in a deal with Oklahoma City for Justin Jackson and a pair of future second-round draft picks. 

            Muscala checked in for the first time at the 3:30 mark of the first quarter and netted his first points as a Celtic less than two minutes later when he connected on a 3-pointer from the wing. 

            He played 16 minutes and scored 12 points (hitting four 3s) with Al Horford missing his second straight game with a sore right knee. 

            With the No. 33 Muscala wore in Oklahoma City retired in the TD Garden rafters for Larry Bird, he chose to wear No. 57 with the Celtics. It honors his mother, who died before the season. She was born in 1957.

            NO SURGERY 

            Stevens said he doesn’t anticipate Brown missing a significant amount of time. 

            Stevens said Brown has been fitted with a mask and will be evaluated over the next few days. 

            Tatum he feels terrible for his role in the “freak accident” that injured Brown.

            “Whether it's the mask or buying him a card, I think I got it,” Tatum said.

            What kind of card?

            “Something safe.”

            Hornets: Outscored Celtics 28-26 in third quarter. … Shot 48% for the game and 35% from the 3-point line (8 of 23). 

            Celtics: With a 3 in the closing seconds of the second quarter, Tatum became the youngest player (24 years, 344 days) in NBA history to reach 1,000 3-pointers. He’s the first to do it before turning 25 years old. He beat friend and fellow St. Louis' native Bradley Beal's mark of 25 years, 223 days. … Boston led 71-53 at halftime, connecting on 16 of 31 from the 3-point line. … Marcus Smart sat for the ninth consecutive game with a sprained right ankle.

He also had 10 assists.“When you're in the zone it feels good and you just try to hit every shot,” White said.His early scoring punch helped fill the void created by the absence of All-Star Jaylen Brown, who was diagnosed with a maxillary fracture in his face after he took an inadvertent elbow from Tatum on Wednesday while going for a rebound during the Celtics’ win over Philadelphia.Brown’s unavailability did little to slow Boston, which shot 49% on the night and hit 25 3-pointers.Charlotte fell behind 6-0 and never led.The game also saw the debut of Boston’s newly acquired big man Mike Muscala after he was added at Thursday’s trade deadline in a deal with Oklahoma City for Justin Jackson and a pair of future second-round draft picks.Muscala checked in for the first time at the 3:30 mark of the first quarter and netted his first points as a Celtic less than two minutes later when he connected on a 3-pointer from the wing.He played 16 minutes and scored 12 points (hitting four 3s) with Al Horford missing his second straight game with a sore right knee.With the No. 33 Muscala wore in Oklahoma City retired in the TD Garden rafters for Larry Bird, he chose to wear No. 57 with the Celtics. It honors his mother, who died before the season. She was born in 1957.NO SURGERYStevens said he doesn’t anticipate Brown missing a significant amount of time.Stevens said Brown has been fitted with a mask and will be evaluated over the next few days.Tatum he feels terrible for his role in the “freak accident” that injured Brown.“Whether it's the mask or buying him a card, I think I got it,” Tatum said.What kind of card?“Something safe.”TIP-INSHornets: Outscored Celtics 28-26 in third quarter. … Shot 48% for the game and 35% from the 3-point line (8 of 23).Celtics: With a 3 in the closing seconds of the second quarter, Tatum became the youngest player (24 years, 344 days) in NBA history to reach 1,000 3-pointers. He’s the first to do it before turning 25 years old. He beat friend and fellow St. Louis' native Bradley Beal's mark of 25 years, 223 days. … Boston led 71-53 at halftime, connecting on 16 of 31 from the 3-point line. … Marcus Smart sat for the ninth consecutive game with a sprained right ankle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807090,No. 18 UCLA women hand Oregon State 5th straight loss,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gabriela Jaquez scored 14 points, Charisma Osborne had 12 points and 10 rebounds and No. 18 UCLA beat Oregon State 62-54 on Friday night for the Beavers' fifth straight loss.

            Oregon State took a 51-46 lead with 7:13 remaining in the fourth quarter but didn't make another field goal the rest of the way. 

            UCLA capitalized on back-to-back turnovers by Oregon State, leading to two fast-break layups by Jaquez, during a 12-0 run that gave the Bruins a 58-51 lead.











            Emily Bessoir missed the second of two free throws with 33 seconds left, but Lina Sontag grabbed the offensive rebound before being fouled and making 1 of 2 for a 60-54 lead.

            Kiki Rice and Sontag each had 11 points for UCLA (19-6, 8-5 Pac-12). The Bruins finished 3 of 27 from distance, with their first 3-pointer, in 15 attempts, coming with 2:39 left in the third quarter to pull within 43-39.

            UCLA had buzzer beaters to end the second and third quarters.

            Bendu Yeaney led Oregon State (11-13, 3-10) with 11 points. Talia von Oelhoffen, averaging a team-high 14.5 points per game, was held to four points on 1-of-9 shooting. Freshman Raegan Beers was helped off the floor with 1:50 left in the third quarter after a hard fall under the basket, and she finished with three points in 17 minutes.

            Oregon State started the second half on a 12-2 run, opened and closed by 3-pointers from Noelle Mannen and Shalexxus Aaron, to take a 41-33 lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807092,Late goaltending call sends Butler past No. 13 Xavier 69-67,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Butler center Manny Bates set the decisive screen, then watched Eric Hunter Jr. drive for the winning shot Friday night.

            He figured the call on the floor would stand — and so did Bulldogs coach Thad Matta.

            On a night Jayden Taylor scored 20 points and Bates added 19, it was Bates’ pick near midcourt and the ensuing goaltending call on Hunter’s dunk attempt with 2.5 seconds left that finally closed out Butler’s 69-67 win over No. 13 Xavier and sent students streaming onto the Hinkle Fieldhouse floor.











            “There was no doubt in my mind it would stand,” Bates said, describing the wait for the replay review. “I just got the screen and wanted to see Eric go finish.”

            The hometown fans have spent most of this season waiting to see Butler deliver a knockout punch, and the players seemed to feed off the sellout crowd at Hinkle Fieldhouse. The Bulldogs (13-13, 5-10 Big East) quickly built a double-digit lead, maintained their poise late and never trailed while holding the nation’s sixth-highest scoring team nearly 17 points below its average.

            Colby Jones led Xavier with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Nunge added 14 points and eight rebounds. But the Musketeers (19-6, 11-3) are now tied with No. 10 Marquette atop the conference standings.

            But it was the final wacky 30 seconds that created a rollercoaster of emotions for everyone.

            Butler appeared to seal its second straight two-point win this week when sixth-year senior Jack Nunge grabbed a loose ball with 23.4 seconds left and called a timeout Xavier didn’t have. Taylor sank both free throws on the technical foul call, but the Bulldogs’ empty ensuing possession led to a 3-pointer from Nunge with 15 seconds left that made it 66-65.

            Taylor answered by making 1 of 2 free throws then mistakenly fouled Souley Boum near midcourt with 9.1 seconds to go. Boum made both free throws to tie the score at 67.

            
                That set up Bates to free Hunter, who darted to the open basket as two Xavier defenders converged and knocked the ball away from the basket. While the officials huddled, Xavier coach Sean Miller was befuddled.

            “What I don’t understand is how, with 9.1 seconds left, we weren’t ready defensively,” Miller said. “All five of our defenders were at half court. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

            When the officials finally made the call, Hinkle Fieldhouse roared with approval as it awaited the review.

            “Somebody, I think one of our assistants, said they couldn’t overturn the goaltend so I was confident it would hold up,” Butler coach Thad Matta said.

            Xavier still had one more shot, though, and when Boum’s long heave bounced off the back of the rim, students mobbed Butler’s players and celebrated their first win over a ranked team in six tries this season.

            BIG PICTURE

            Xavier: Miller explained afterward that he believed Nunge's timeout call was just a reaction in the heat of the moment. He was far more critical of his team's effort, which he said “was not very good.” He knows that must change if the Musketeers intend to win the league title.

            Butler: This will go down as one of the Butler's best games all season. Whether this two-game winning streak leads to bigger things, though, is still to be determined. Butler needs to build off this week's momentum to finish this season with a flourish.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The loss should send Xavier sliding down the rankings. How far they slip will depend on the remaining results from this weekend.

            INJURY REPORT

            Xavier came into the game without its top rebounder and second-leading scorer, Zach Freemantle, who has a left foot injury. And in the first half, they lost Boum, their top scorer briefly with what appeared to be an injured left ankle. Boum finished with 12 points and three assists, but limped noticeably the rest of the game. Miller did not update Boum's status following the game. 

            UP NEXT Xavier: Visits Marquette on Wednesday in a matchup of the Big East’s top teams.

            Butler: Heads to Villanova on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807093,"Tarasenko scores in debut, Rangers beat Kraken 6-3","NEW YORK (AP) — Vladimir Tarasenko was still caught in the whirlwind of being traded for the first time when he put an emphatic stamp on his first game with the New York Rangers. 

            The 31-year-old Russian forward scored early in his New York debut, Kaapo Kakko and Vincent Trocheck each had a goal and an assist, and the Rangers beat the Seattle Kraken 6-3 on Friday night for their fourth straight win.

            “I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this in my life. It’s my first time getting traded in the NHL, like I spent 11 years in one city,″ Tarasenko said. “The guys give us a very warm welcome ... Crazy day though.”











            Ryan Lindgren also had a goal and an assist, and Jacob Trouba and Mika Zibanejad also scored for the Rangers, who have won five straight at home and are 12-3-0 in their last 15 at Madison Square Garden. Igor Shesterkin had 26 saves to improve to 13-4-4 in his last 21 starts.

            The Rangers are 19-4-3 since Dec. 5, when their season turned with a 6-4 home win over St. Louis, who traded Tarasenko and defenseman Niko Mikkola to New York on Thursday.

            Oliver Bjorkstrand had a goal and an assist, and Brandon Tanev and Jared McCann also scored for Seattle, who lost all three games against New York area teams this week. Vince Dunn had two assists and Martin Jones had 22 saves.

            Tarasenko paid quick dividends in his first game with his new team, converting a pass from fellow Russian Artemi Panarin past Jones just 2:49 into the contest. It was his 11th goal of the season and sent the home crowd into hysterics with many thunderously chanting Tarasenko’s name. 

            “Obviously it’s nice to connect for a goal,″ Tarasenko said of receiving the pass from Panarin. “We hope more are coming and we play well every game.” 

            Tarasenko said it took him by surprise to hear his name echoing throughout his new home rink after he scored. 

            “I was thinking I was mishearing,'' he said. ”It's different because as a visitor you really don't hear the crowd. This was exciting!""

            Kakko made it 2-0 at 5:01 with 10th goal, assisted by linemates Filip Chytil and Alexis Lafreniere. Kakko has a career-high of 26 points — including a career high-tying 10 goals — and Lafreniere has points in six of his last seven games.

            Trocheck scored his 15th with 5:31 left in the first and Trouba extended the margin to 4-0 at 1:03 of the second with his fourth.

            Bjorkstrand put the Kraken on the scoreboard at 2:07 of the second with his 10th goal.

            Zibanejad scored his team-leading 26th on the power play at 3:19 of the third to restore the Rangers' four-goal lead. 

            McCann scored his team-leading 24th at 5:59 of the third and Tanev made it 5-3 just 22 seconds later.

            “We dug ourselves too much of a hole,'' Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said. ""They are big and they are fast. They were good at puck retrieval and keeping plays alive.”

            Lindgren added his short-handed empty-netter with 2:09 left to cap the scoring.

            Rangers coach Gerard Gallant was succinct in his appraisal of Tarasenko, a six-time 30-plus goal scorer.

            “He’s excited to play, he’s a great hockey player,'' Gallant said. ”He’s going to help our team.""

            NOTABLE DEBUTS

            Only three previous Rangers have scored within the opening three minutes of their debuts: Norm Lowe (1:00 on Feb. 26, 1950), current Islanders coach Lane Lambert (2:28 on Dec. 10, 1986) and Mike Allison (2:44 on Oct. 9, 1980). 

            LINES

            Tarasenko skated on the right wing on a line with Zibanejad at center and Panarin on left wing. The 31-year-old forward played 11 seasons with the Blues where he had 262 goals in 644 games. He had a career-best 40 goals in 2015-16. ... Mikkola played on a defense pairing with Braden Schneider.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807095,"Jazz rally to beat Raptors 122-116, snap 3-game skid","TORONTO (AP) — Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler each scored 23 points, Collin Sexton had 22 and the Utah Jazz overcame a 12-point deficit in the final five minutes to beat the Toronto Raptors 122-116 on Friday night and snap a three-game losing streak.

            Kelly Olynyk scored 15 points and former Raptor Rudy Gay had 12 for the Jazz, who won despite shooting 6 for 24 from 3-point range, matching a season low. Utah also made six 3-pointers in a Feb. 6 loss to Dallas.

            The Jazz lost 143-118 to Minnesota on Wednesday, their worst home defeat of the season — the same day they traded four players, including veteran guard Mike Conley.











            “Last game, that’s a hard day,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “Today, I just felt like everybody was a little more settled. The nerves of the trade deadline are over, the uncertainty of all that is over, which helps settle everybody’s mind.”

            Sexton liked the way the Jazz responded to the emotions from Wednesday.

            “Tonight was one of those games where we had to play together,” Sexton said. “It was one of those games where we had to fight to the end and fight for one another, and that’s what we did.”

            Pascal Siakam scored 35 points, topping 30 for the second straight game, but Toronto couldn’t extend its three-game winning streak. The Raptors have not won four straight at any point this season.

            Gary Trent Jr. scored 19 points, Fred VanVleet had 17 and Precious Achiuwa 16 in a disappointing loss for the Raptors.

            “It’s unacceptable by our standards,” VanVleet said.

            Toronto led 112-100 with 4:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Jazz tied it with a 12-0 run capped by Sexton’s 3-point play with 2:34 left.

            Markkanen’s free throw with 2:07 to go completed a three-point play and gave the Jazz their first lead since the score was 4-3 in the first quarter.

            The Raptors led 96-83 through three quarters but shot 8 for 23 in the fourth. Utah outscored Toronto 39-20 in the final period.

            “A lot of guys made big plays down the stretch, but I’m most impressed with our defense,” Hardy said. “Fifty-five points (allowed) in the second half, 20 points in the fourth quarter, four points in the last five minutes of the game.”

            Hours after being named an injury replacement for the All-Star Game, Siakam shot 12 for 21, making a season-high five of his seven attempts from distance and going 6 for 7 at the free-throw line. Siakam scored 37 points in Wednesday’s 112-98 win over the Spurs.

            Center Jakob Poeltl came off the bench for Toronto after being acquired from San Antonio ahead of Thursday’s trade deadline. Poeltl, who began his career with the Raptors, had six points and four rebounds in 17 minutes.

            “I thought he played decent for just getting here,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807096,Bogandovic's 32 lead Pistons to double OT win over Spurs,"DETROIT (AP) — Bojan Bogdanovic scored 10 of his 32 points in overtime and the Detroit Pistons beat the San Antonio Spurs 138-131 in double overtime on Friday in a matchup of two of the NBA's worst teams.

            “That was two young teams with guys trying to make a mark in this league,” said Pistons rookie Jalen Duren, who had 30 points and 17 rebounds in 42 minutes. “I love games like this, where it is a bunch of young guys out there battling.”

            Duren joined Moses Malone, LeBron James and Paolo Banchero as the only teenagers to have 30 points and 15 rebounds in an NBA/ABA game.











            “He made a lot of big plays at the right time tonight,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He was big on the boards and he was catching the ball in traffic and finishing. He could have had even more if not for the (five) free throws he missed. 

            ""He could barely walk by the end.”

            San Antonio, which lost its 11th straight game, led 125-121 after Devonte' Graham hit his sixth 3-pointer of his Spurs debut with 18 seconds left in the first overtime.

            However, Bogdanovic hit a jumper and Isaiah Livers stole the inbounds pass. Bogdanovic, who missed a short jumper at the end of regulation, was fouled with 13.2 seconds left. He made both free throws, and the Spurs couldn't get off a shot before the buzzer.

            Detroit has the worst record in the Eastern Conference. San Antonio is slightly above Houston in the West and both are on pace to share the best odds to win the lottery and the No. 1 pick in the draft.

            “I couldn't ask any more out of those guys,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “They gave us a heck of a performance with teammates they had never played with before.”

            Livers hit a 3-pointer to give the Pistons a 132-131 lead with 1:54 left in the second overtime, and Isaiah Stewart's follow shot made it a three-point game. Graham missed a 3-pointer, and Bogdanovic clinched the game from the free-throw line.

            Graham, acquired at the trade deadline, set a franchise record with 31 points in his team debut.

            “They called me 15 minutes before the deadline and told me I had to get on a flight to Detroit,” he said. “I threw together two suitcases, grabbed some hoop shoes and met them here.”

            Zach Collins had 29 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out in the first overtime while rookie Malaki Branham had a career-high 27 points.

            “They both played great tonight,” Graham said. “(Branham) was really aggressive scoring the ball, and Zach did a great job playing a lot of minutes with five fouls. That shows he's a smart player.”

            Both teams were short-handed because of trade-deadline moves. James Wiseman, acquired for Saddiq Bey, wasn't available for Detroit with that four-team trade still pending, while Khem Birch didn't play for San Antonio after being picked up in the Jakob Poetl trade.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807116,"Ayton, Booker lead Suns past Pacers a day after Durant trade","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Deandre Ayton had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Devin Booker scored 21 points and Chris Paul chipped in 19 as the Phoenix Suns cruised past the Indiana Pacers 117-104 on Friday night. 

            Playing one day after their blockbuster trade for four-time NBA scoring champion Kevin Durant, the Suns led by as many as 26 and never trailed in a game they outrebounded the Pacers 64-45.

            ""It’s exciting times for the Phoenix Suns,” Booker said. “You have one of the best players to ever touch a basketball coming. He’s going to fit right in.”











            Durant, acquired from Brooklyn on Thursday, hasn't played since Jan. 8 when he sustained a knee injury in a game against Miami. Durant, who was not with the Suns in Indiana, is expected to be healthy enough to play at some point after the All-Star break. 

            Bennedict Mathurin posted 22 points for the Pacers, while All-Star Tyrese Haliburton finished with 18 points and five assists. Indiana, which has lost 14 of its past 16 games, shot 42% from the field and committed 15 turnovers.

            “Rebounding has been a challenge for us all year long,” Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. “They had 19 offensive rebounds. Rebounding is an attention-to-detail and effort area.”

            Phoenix shot 46% and capitalized on ball movement with 25 assists on its 43 baskets. Paul had nine assists and Booker five. Josh Okogie finished with 17 points and six boards, while former Pacer Torrey Craig started at power forward and racked up 11 points and 12 rebounds.

             Phoenix, which has won six of its past eight, led 30-24 after the first quarter, 60-47 at halftime and 95-77 entering the final period. The Suns bounced back from Thursday night’s loss in Atlanta.

            “We had a trade, emotions, travel,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “(Thursday night) on the bus, plane, gave us a chance to get back to normal. Sometimes it takes you a minute to process whatever is going on.”

            TIP-INS

             Suns: Film study will play a “huge” role in determining how to work Durant into Phoenix’s offense, according to Williams. “Huge as far as us figuring out what’s the most important thing to run,” he said. “Right now, it’s the old (Gregg Popovich) saying: less is more.” ... Cameron Payne (right foot sprain) and Landry Shamet (right foot soreness) sat out Friday’s game. T.J. Warren, reacquired before the trade deadline, was not yet with the team.

            Pacers: Indy native George Hill, acquired Thursday from Milwaukee in a four-team trade, chose to begin a second stint with the Pacers rather than be waived to pursue opportunities to join a contender, president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said in a pregame news conference. “It’s totally up to you,” Pritchard recalled telling the 36-year-old guard. “He immediately said, ‘I want to come back and teach.’ I don’t know if he’s going to coach, but he’s got valuable insights.” … Big man Serge Ibaka, sent to Indiana in the same deal, will be waived, Pritchard said. The 33-year-old has played in only 16 games this season, averaging 11.6 minutes. … Hill and forward Jordan Nwora, the third player obtained from the Bucks whom coach Rick Carlisle said will receive a “great opportunity” to play in Indiana, should be ready to suit up for the Pacers next week, Carlisle said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807117,Morant has near triple-double as Grizzlies top Timberwolves,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Ja Morant had 32 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, Desmond Bane added 20 points and the Memphis Grizzlies built a big lead through the fourth quarter and coasted to a 128-107 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night.

            Santi Aldama finished with 18 points, while Jaren Jackson added 15 points and four blocks as Memphis was still shooting close to 60% when both teams emptied their benches in the fourth. 

            Memphis, which built some cushion late in the first half, went on a 9-0 run to stretch its lead to 112-92 in the fourth. The win was the second straight for Memphis, after going through a stretch where the Grizzlies lost eight of nine.











            “This was just a product of getting a couple of practices under our belt. A couple of shootarounds,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “Guys watching film and craving it.”

            Like many teams, Minnesota had to choose how to try to stop Morant, who was 13 of 23 from the field. He was 10 of 15 in the paint, scoring 20 points in that area. But things got tougher with Morant connecting on a trio of 3-pointers in the first half. 

            Minnesota coach Chris Finch said his defenders were too far off the ball at the point of attack.

            “It's certainly a challenge for anyone to keep A, Ja out of the paint, and B, away from the rim,” Finch said.

            Jaylen Nowell led the Timberwolves with 21 points, while Anthony Edwards scored 17 points. Taurean Prince and Kyle Anderson scored 12 points apiece for Minnesota.

            With Thursday's trade deadline still working itself out, the Timberwolves pieces were available to play. Mike Conley, acquired by Minnesota from Utah at the trade deadline, started at point guard and had nine points. Luke Kennard, who the Grizzlies picked up from the Los Angeles Clippers, did not play.

            “It was weird,” Conley said of walking into the starting point guard role the day after the trade, “But it was like basketball at the end of the day. ... I didn't know anything as much as I would like to.”

            The teams played extremely close through the first two quarters. Neither team led by more than six points until Memphis went on a 12-2 run to close the half. There were nine ties and three lead changes before the Grizzlies took a 69-58 advantage.

            The teams' two electrifying guards — Morant and Edwards — led their respective teams in the half, with Morant scoring 20 points and Edwards, the top scorer for Minnesota, with 11.

            The teams played even through most of the third until another closing burst by Memphis stretched the lead to 103-86. At that point, Memphis was shooting 62% for the game.

            “They made a lot of tough shots,” Conley said, “but for the most part, we let them get too many easy ones.”

            TIP-INS

            Timberwolves: In addition to Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Wallace, picked up in trade deadline acquisitions, was available but did not play. ... Gobert grabbed seven rebounds in the first half to pass Caldwell Jones for 83rd on NBA's career list. In the fourth quarter, he tied Sam Perkins for 82nd. 

            Grizzlies: Bane passed Michael Dickerson for 20th in franchise scoring. ... Morant's 3-pointers in the first half, tied him with with Marc Gasol for 10th on franchise list with 301.

            A LUKE BOOST

            When asked about the improved play Friday night, Morant said it was due to “my dog, Luke (Kennard).”

            And Morant, not necessarily known for his 3-point shooting, said Kennard's presence helped him on his 3-pointers in the first half. “I had to step up a little bit,” Morant said. “Shoot like him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807120,Health crisis leads scores of Yanomami to roam the streets,"BOA VISTA, Brazil (AP) — From a distance, the small group lying on the sidewalk outside the city market could be confused with hundreds of homeless people spread through Boa Vista. 

            But they are Yanomami, an Indigenous people from the Amazon rainforest who traditionally live in relative isolation. Years of neglect during the previous government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro led to a health crisis that got worse while illegal gold miners swarmed into their territory. Dozens of Yanomami ended up roaming in the region’s largest city.

            The eldest ones in a group living in Boa Vista's food market are a couple — Oma Yanomami, 46, and Bonita Yanomami, 35. Both are from the Koroasipiitheri community, only accessible by air. In September, they were medivaced to Boa Vista to accompany their 3-year-old son, who was ill with malaria.











            Initially, they stayed in the Indigenous Health House known as Casai, a federal facility on the outskirts of Boa Vista, a sprawling city of 440,000 people and capital of Roraima state. But in the first few days, the family left the facility and began living on the streets.

            “It was too crowded,” Oma Yanomami told The Associated Press Thursday in broken Portuguese while sitting on the dirty sidewalk. Beside him, his wife was asleep despite the heavy car traffic nearby. Both had sustained bruises and appeared in poor health.

            A report published this week by the Ministry of Health paints a grim picture of Casai, which was built to host Yanomami under treatment and their relatives. Its capacity is 200 people, but it harbors many as 700, representing 2% of the Yanomami population. The figure doesn't include those hospitalized, including several children with severe malnutrition.

            “The bathrooms are unhealthy, and the dining areas are insufficient and unpleasant. In addition, the food was insufficient until a few months ago,” the report says. “The Yanomami lack space to prepare their food and other activities, so at night, there are several drunken people and reports of violence and car hit-and-runs.”

            According to the report, 150 Yanomami are eligible to return to their villages, but the wait for a place on a return flight can be very long — 10 years in one extreme case. 

            An estimated 30,000 Yanomami people live in Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, which covers an area roughly the size of Portugal and stretches across Roraima and Amazonas states in the northwest corner of Brazil’s Amazon.

            Life in the streets took its toll on Oma and Bonita Yanomami. Their son soon contracted pneumonia, while his parents fell into drinking sprees. Health workers found out about the situation and took the baby to a local hospital. There, he was admitted as “indigent,” which put him on the adoption path without the parents’ consent.

            For four months, the couple did not see their child. Then social workers affiliated with the Indigenous movement intervened to get them inside to visit. The future of the child now hinges on a judicial order.

            It is not uncommon to meet Yanomami in the streets of Boa Vista, most with drinking problems. Some go back to Casai during the night, while others end up under viaducts.

            Their life is rough. Two weeks ago, a Yanomami woman gave birth on a sidewalk. On Thursday, a Yanomami man died several days after being injured in a fight inside a prison, according to the State Secretary of Justice. There are 269 Indigenous inmates in Roraima of various peoples.

            In January, the federal government, led by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, declared a public health emergency for the Yanomami people. Since then, military doctors treated over 1,000 people in a field hospital in Boa Vista, and 4,000 food baskets were distributed in the vast territory.

            In parallel, security forces started to destroy equipment and control entry of illegal gold miners, estimated at 20,000 people. As a result, dozens have decided to leave the Indigenous territory, while many others keep mining gold.

            The Indigenous organizations now want the Yanomami child, now four years old, to be returned to his parents so they can board a plane and go back to Koroasipiitheri, where six siblings are waiting for them.

In addition, the food was insufficient until a few months ago,” the report says. “The Yanomami lack space to prepare their food and other activities, so at night, there are several drunken people and reports of violence and car hit-and-runs.”According to the report, 150 Yanomami are eligible to return to their villages, but the wait for a place on a return flight can be very long — 10 years in one extreme case.An estimated 30,000 Yanomami people live in Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, which covers an area roughly the size of Portugal and stretches across Roraima and Amazonas states in the northwest corner of Brazil’s Amazon.Life in the streets took its toll on Oma and Bonita Yanomami. Their son soon contracted pneumonia, while his parents fell into drinking sprees. Health workers found out about the situation and took the baby to a local hospital. There, he was admitted as “indigent,” which put him on the adoption path without the parents’ consent.For four months, the couple did not see their child. Then social workers affiliated with the Indigenous movement intervened to get them inside to visit. The future of the child now hinges on a judicial order.It is not uncommon to meet Yanomami in the streets of Boa Vista, most with drinking problems. Some go back to Casai during the night, while others end up under viaducts.Their life is rough. Two weeks ago, a Yanomami woman gave birth on a sidewalk. On Thursday, a Yanomami man died several days after being injured in a fight inside a prison, according to the State Secretary of Justice. There are 269 Indigenous inmates in Roraima of various peoples.In January, the federal government, led by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, declared a public health emergency for the Yanomami people. Since then, military doctors treated over 1,000 people in a field hospital in Boa Vista, and 4,000 food baskets were distributed in the vast territory.In parallel, security forces started to destroy equipment and control entry of illegal gold miners, estimated at 20,000 people. As a result, dozens have decided to leave the Indigenous territory, while many others keep mining gold.The Indigenous organizations now want the Yanomami child, now four years old, to be returned to his parents so they can board a plane and go back to Koroasipiitheri, where six siblings are waiting for them.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807121,Butler's dunk at end gives Heat 97-95 win over Rockets,"MIAMI (AP) — The play was drawn up by assistant coach Chris Quinn during a Miami Heat scrimmage at the NBA restart bubble in 2020. A lob to the rim off an inbounds pass, and the result was a Jimmy Butler dunk.

            When that happened, Butler hung on the rim, pointed to Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and demanded it be used in a game.

            Almost three years later, the play — “CQ"" on Spoelstra's game sheet, the initials of its inventor — finally got used. And it worked.











            Gabe Vincent threw an alley-oop inbounds pass to Butler for a dunk with 0.3 seconds remaining, giving the Heat a 97-95 win over the Houston Rockets on Friday night for their eighth consecutive home win.

            “It took us about three years to get back to it,"" Spoelstra said. “That's one of those benefits of all the time we had in the bubble.""

            Tyler Herro had 31 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Heat, who won despite scoring only 39 second-half points. Bam Adebayo scored 20 points, Butler had 10 of his 16 points in the fourth and Max Strus added 14 for Miami.

            “Any way to get a win, at this point in the season, it's all about wins,"" Herro said. “We'll take one any way we can get one.""

            Jabari Smith Jr. scored 22 points for the Rockets. Kenyon Martin Jr. had 17 and Alperen Sengun added 12. Jalen Green had 11 points, including a game-tying layup with 0.7 seconds left.

            But Miami called time, Vincent threw the lob and Butler ended up on his back — after the game-winner. The Heat swept the season series with the Rockets, winning two games by a combined five points.

            “There was confusion whether we were switching or not,"" Rockets coach Stephen Silas said of the final play. “I said in the huddle, ‘Stay home, stay home, stay home.' And we didn't stay home, and it was an avalanche after that. ... We've got to learn these lessons.""

            It was Houston’s first game since being involved in trade-deadline deals — sending Eric Gordon to the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team move that landed the Rockets Danny Green, and picking up Justin Holiday and Frank Kaminsky in another.

            “We are going to have the most cap space this summer of any team in the NBA, I believe. ... We’re going to have a lot of room to sign free agents, to make trades into that space, to really transform the team,” Rockets general manager Rafael Stone said. “And we decided that we’re really, really valuing that flexibility. Within that context, we think that we improved the team.”

            But the acquisition of John Wall, as expected, was essentially just to make salary math work. Barring a major change in thinking, his return to the Rockets only exists on paper.

            “We do intend, at this time, to waive John,” Stone said.

            TIP-INS

            Rockets: Houston's 28-game streak of allowing at least 100 points ended. ... The Rockets — as many teams have done this season when the schedule allows — are making a mini-vacation out of their trip to Miami. They’re not scheduled to leave town until Sunday. Some practice time before leaving Miami is planned.

            Heat: Jamaree Bouyea got his first basket, making him the 278th player to score in a Miami uniform. ... Udonis Haslem missed the game for personal reasons. ... Kyle Lowry missed his third consecutive game with left knee soreness and won’t play on Saturday either. It wouldn’t seem likely that he plays again before the All-Star break.

            MORE 3s

            The first five baskets of the game were 3-pointers — three by Miami, two by Houston. Miami was 8 for 20 from beyond the arc in the first half, after going 6 for 19 in the entirety of Wednesday’s win over Indiana. Miami ended up 12 for 38 on 3s, exactly doubling the numbers against the Pacers.

            CLANK

            The third quarter score was Rockets 17, Heat 17. The 34 combined points was the third-fewest in a third quarter this season — the Heat and Brooklyn combined for 31 on Jan. 8, and the Nets and Boston combined for 32 on Dec. 4.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807134,Stauber remains perfect as Blackhawks beat Coyotes 4-3 in OT,"CHICAGO (AP) — Jaxson Stauber is the first goaltender in Chicago Blackhawks history to win each of his first three NHL games.

            Jaxson ... Stauber.

            “It's pretty cool. ... Original Six team and so many great goalies, yeah, it feels good,” a smiling Stauber said.











            Stauber made 24 saves in his first home start and Caleb Jones scored 3:37 into overtime, sending Chicago to a 4-3 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Friday night.

            Andreas Athanasiou had a goal and two assists as the Blackhawks (16-29-5) rallied for the win in a matchup of two of the NHL's worst teams. Colin Blackwell and Seth Jones also scored.

            “After that first period, we came in and regrouped and started working and moving,” Athanasiou said, “and you can see that, when we start doing that, a lot of good things happen.”

            Clayton Keller had a goal and two assists for Arizona (17-28-7), and Nick Schmaltz had a goal and an assist. Connor Ingram made 40 stops.

            Blackwell snapped a 2-2 tie when he stuffed home a loose puck 14:34 into the third period. But Nick Bjugstad responded for Arizona, beating Stauber from the high slot with 2:27 remaining.

            ""They never quit. We never let go. We got better during the game so, we’ll build on the positive,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said.

            Athanasiou set up Caleb Jones' game-winner when he was denied by Ingram on a breakaway. Jones jumped on the loose puck and sent a wrist shot through the goaltender's legs for his second goal of the season.

            The Blackhawks played without captain Jonathan Toews, who missed his second straight game with a non-COVID-19 illness. He could return on the team's four-game road trip.

            Chicago trailed 2-1 after the first period, but Athanasiou flipped a backhand by Ingram on the goaltender's glove side 2:43 into the second. It was Athanasiou's 11th goal of the season.

            “We created some breakaways, 2-on-1s in the second period, and I think that kind of gave us some life offensively,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said.

            The Blackhawks appeared to move in front when Taylor Raddysh knocked in a great pass by Max Domi with 11:57 left in the second, but it was waved off for interference after Domi collided with Ingram.

            Bjugstad had a prime scoring opportunity for Arizona about 6 1/2 minutes into the third, but he was denied by Stauber.

            “It was a back-and-forth game,” Bjugstad said. ""It’s been kind of a theme. We’ve got to find a way to be better to start and play a full 60.”

            Arizona jumped in front when Keller converted a wrist shot from the left circle 1:28 into the first period. It was the first shot on goal for either team.

            Then Keller set up Schmaltz's one-timer with a pass through the legs of Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy. Schmaltz's 12th goal of the season in his 400th career game made it 2-0 at 12:34.

            Chicago got on the board on Seth Jones' sixth goal at 13:53. The All-Star defenseman, who also scored during Tuesday night's 3-2 loss to Anaheim, beat Ingram right after Boris Katchouk was unable to finish a drive to the net.

            WORTH NOTING

            Blackhawks defenseman Jarred Tinordi is expected to return to the lineup Saturday night at Winnipeg. Tinordi (facial fracture) hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 18. “Get fresh legs in tomorrow, against a bigger team, too,” Richardson said. ... Keller became the fifth player from the 2016 draft to record 300 career points, joining Auston Matthews (510), Matthew Tkachuk (453), Patrik Laine (358) and Alex DeBrincat (348).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807137,US blacklists 6 Chinese entities over balloon program,"BEIJING (AP) — The United States has blacklisted six Chinese entities it said were linked to Beijing's aerospace programs as part of its retaliation over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that traversed U.S. airspace. 

            The economic restrictions announced Friday followed the Biden administration's pledge to consider broader efforts to address Chinese surveillance activities and will make it more difficult for the five companies and one research institute to obtain American technology exports.

            The move is likely to further escalate the diplomatic row between the U.S. and China sparked by the balloon, which was shot down last weekend off the Carolina coast. The U.S. said the balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals, but Beijing insists it was a weather craft that had blown off course.











            The incident prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes trip to Beijing aimed at easing tensions.

            The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security said the six entities were being targeted for “their support to China's military modernization efforts, specifically the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aerospace programs including airships and balloons.”

            “The PLA is utilizing High Altitude Balloons (HAB) for intelligence and reconnaissance activities,” it said. 

            Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said on Twitter his department “will not hesitate to continue to use"" such restrictions and other regulatory and enforcement tools ""to protect U.S. national security and sovereignty.”

            The six entities are Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., China Electronics Technology Group Corporation 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology Co., and Shanxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co.

            The research institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The other five entities could not be reached.

            On Friday, a U.S. military fighter jet shot down an unknown object flying off the remote northern coast of Alaska on orders from President Joe Biden. The object was downed because it reportedly posed a threat to the safety of civilian flights, instead of any knowledge that it was engaged in surveillance.

            But the twin incidents in such close succession reflect heightened concerns over China’s surveillance program and public pressure on Biden to take a tough stand against it.BEIJING (AP) — The United States has blacklisted six Chinese entities it said were linked to Beijing's aerospace programs as part of its retaliation over an alleged Chinese spy balloon that traversed U.S. airspace.The economic restrictions announced Friday followed the Biden administration's pledge to consider broader efforts to address Chinese surveillance activities and will make it more difficult for the five companies and one research institute to obtain American technology exports.The move is likely to further escalate the diplomatic row between the U.S. and China sparked by the balloon, which was shot down last weekend off the Carolina coast.

            Irving played his second game since being traded by the Brooklyn Nets to the Mavericks. In his Dallas debut, he scored 24 points Wednesday night in a road win over the Los Angeles Clippers.

            Josh Green scored 17 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 15 as the Mavericks won for the fifth time in six games. Dallas led by as many as 24 points and never trailed. The Kings cut the deficit to six points with 20 seconds remaining.

            PHOENIX (AP) — Deandre Ayton had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Devin Booker scored 21 points and Chris Paul chipped in 19 as Phoenix cruised past Indiana. 

            Playing one day after their blockbuster trade for four-time NBA scoring champion Kevin Durant, the Suns led by as many as 26 and never trailed in a game they outrebounded the Pacers 64-45. Durant, acquired from Brooklyn on Thursday, hasn’t played since Jan. 8 when he sustained a knee injury in a game against Miami. Durant, who was not with the Suns in Indiana, is expected to be healthy enough to play at some point after the All-Star break. 

            Bennedict Mathurin posted 22 points for the Pacers, while All-Star Tyrese Haliburton finished with 18 points and five assists. Indiana, which has lost 14 of its past 16 games, shot 42% from the field and committed 15 turnovers.

            The Heat swept the season series with the Rockets, winning two games by a combined five points.

            CELTICS 127, HORNETS 116

            BOSTON (AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 41 points and Derrick White set career highs with 33 points and eight 3-pointers to help Boston hold off Charlotte. 

            Tatum began the fourth quarter on the bench, but was reinserted after Charlotte cut Boston’s lead to 14 points with 7:03 to play. The Hornets trailed by 28 in the third quarter before closing period on 15-3 run. It was Tatum’s eighth game this season with 40 or more points, but he ran his minutes total to 37 minutes to do it on what was an otherwise light night of work for the MVP contender. 

            Boston has won five of its last six overall and swept the season series with the Hornets 4-0. 

            Terry Rozier led Charlotte with 27 points. LaMelo Ball added 24 points and 10 assists. The Hornets have lost their last six games.

            DETROIT (AP) — Bojan Bogdanovic scored 10 of his 32 points in overtime and Detroit beat San Antonio in a matchup of two of the NBA’s worst teams.

            San Antonio, which lost its 11th straight game, led 125-121 after Devonte’ Graham hit his sixth 3-pointer of his Spurs debut with 18 seconds left in the first overtime. However, Bogdanovic hit a jumper and Isaiah Livers stole the inbounds pass. Bogdanovic, who missed a short jumper at the end of regulation, was fouled with 13.2 seconds left. He made both free throws, and the Spurs couldn’t get off a shot before the buzzer.

            Jalen Duren had a career-high 30 points and 17 rebounds for the Pistons.

            Graham, acquired at the trade deadline, had 31 points. Zach Collins had 29 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out in the first overtime.

            Kelly Olynyk scored 15 points and former Raptor Rudy Gay had 12 for the Jazz, who won despite shooting 6 for 24 from 3-point range, matching a season low. Utah also made six 3-pointers in a Feb. 6 loss to Dallas.

            Pascal Siakam scored 35 points, topping 30 for the second straight game, but Toronto couldn’t extend its three-game winning streak. The Raptors have not won four straight at any point this season.

            PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Tyrese Maxey provided a huge boost off the bench, scoring 27 points to help Philadelphia rally from a 13-point deficit for a win over New York.

            Joel Embiid had 35 points and 11 rebounds on 14-of-18 shooting from the floor, while James Harden added 20 points and 12 assists to help the Sixers gain a measure of revenge for a loss in New York on Sunday night when Philadelphia relinquished a 21-point lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807150,New York Fashion Week: Prabal Gurung explores impermanence,"NEW YORK (AP) — Does a butterfly know it was once a caterpillar? How do we fill those fleeting moments between beginning and end, joy and despair?

            With moody luxury clothes, of course.

            Prabal Gurung was thinking deep this season. He installed a mirrored square runway reflecting an opulent blue light display at the main branch of the New York Public Library for a fashion week show Friday exploring the Buddhist concept of “anichya,” or impermanence.











            In butterfly motifs, wool jackets and hues of vermilion, saffron, burgundy and dusty pinks, Gurung was thinking of his homeland, Nepal, where he hasn't been since before the pandemic. He was motivated by a 10-day meditative retreat he recently experienced to “silence everything.”

            “In Nepal, we talk about it all the time, what is present and how soon it can go,” he told The Associated Press in a backstage interview. “And there’s actually an optimism to that, especially during these challenging times.”

            The idea, in part, was finding hope “in the dark places,” he said. “There's light after darkness.”

            His silhouettes were sharper and longer this time around. His asymmetry challenged the idea of harmony. He draped softly and provided sharp angles at the same time. There were fluid, gliding skirts, wool jackets and glitzy golds and crystals.

            In short, Gurung explained, New York Fashion Week for him was a “magical, mystery journey. An inward spiritual journey” taken at night back home in Nepal.

            Moody, yes, but hopeful in turquoise and emerald silk organza, a black leather cropped jacket with a pink shearling collar and his butterfly print in a high-low, high-neck dress of black and white, and another in sheer red and black with sexy cutouts at the hip.

            There was an oversized sweater in an ivory and yellow butterfly knit and a pink and scarlet embroidered cocoon coat.

            “But there's a lot of strength to it,” Gurung said.

How do we fill those fleeting moments between beginning and end, joy and despair?With moody luxury clothes, of course.Prabal Gurung was thinking deep this season. He installed a mirrored square runway reflecting an opulent blue light display at the main branch of the New York Public Library for a fashion week show Friday exploring the Buddhist concept of “anichya,” or impermanence.In butterfly motifs, wool jackets and hues of vermilion, saffron, burgundy and dusty pinks, Gurung was thinking of his homeland, Nepal, where he hasn't been since before the pandemic. He was motivated by a 10-day meditative retreat he recently experienced to “silence everything.”“In Nepal, we talk about it all the time, what is present and how soon it can go,” he told The Associated Press in a backstage interview. “And there’s actually an optimism to that, especially during these challenging times.”The idea, in part, was finding hope “in the dark places,” he said. “There's light after darkness.”His silhouettes were sharper and longer this time around. His asymmetry challenged the idea of harmony. He draped softly and provided sharp angles at the same time. There were fluid, gliding skirts, wool jackets and glitzy golds and crystals.In short, Gurung explained, New York Fashion Week for him was a “magical, mystery journey. An inward spiritual journey” taken at night back home in Nepal.Moody, yes, but hopeful in turquoise and emerald silk organza, a black leather cropped jacket with a pink shearling collar and his butterfly print in a high-low, high-neck dress of black and white, and another in sheer red and black with sexy cutouts at the hip.There was an oversized sweater in an ivory and yellow butterfly knit and a pink and scarlet embroidered cocoon coat.“But there's a lot of strength to it,” Gurung said.All grew from the silence on his 10-day vipassana retreat, where reading, phones and exercise were banned.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807168,Japan's PM Kishida says sinus surgery went smoothly,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had sinus surgery at a Tokyo hospital on Saturday to treat chronic sinusitis that has caused him to have a stuffy nose since last year.

            “The surgery went smoothly and I have returned to my official residence,” Kishida said in his tweet Saturday night. “Thank you very much everyone for your concerns and encouragement.” 

            He also thanked his surgeon and other medical staff at the hospital.











            “Difficult problems are mounting in and outside Japan right now. I will make sure to stay in great shape to tackle the problems,"" he said, promising to be back to work on Monday.

            Kishida has suffered plunging public support over his handling of a controversy involving his governing party’s ties with a religious group, resignations of ministers and top aides following a political funding scandal, gaffes and discriminatory remarks against sexual minorities.

            His stuffy nose while speaking at meetings, parliamentary sessions and news conferences has been cited by local media, including some that speculated it was an aftereffect of COVID-19, which he contracted last summer.

            He told reporters Friday that since he had been diagnosed having chronic sinusitis with polyps, he was treated with medicine but decided to undergo surgery “in order to be in perfect health.” 

            Kishida's operation was said to have involved general anesthesia and during that time, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno temporarily assumed a leadership role as stipulated by the Cabinet Law.

            A footage by TBS television Saturday evening captured Kishida in his suit and wearing a white surgical mask bowing and thanking medial staff as he walked out the hospital.

            Matsuno said Kishida was expected to return to work Monday, though he will need to visit the hospital a few more times for post-surgery checkups and treatment.

            Kishida took office in October 2021 and has implemented drastic changes to Japan’s security and energy policies. In December, his government adopted a new security and defense strategy to bolster Japan’s strike-back capability in a break with its postwar self-defense-only principle. 

            On Friday, Kishida’s Cabinet approved a policy to maximize the use of nuclear power as green energy, reversing the country’s post-Fukushima nuclear phaseout plan.TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had sinus surgery at a Tokyo hospital on Saturday to treat chronic sinusitis that has caused him to have a stuffy nose since last year.“The surgery went smoothly and I have returned to my official residence,” Kishida said in his tweet Saturday night. “Thank you very much everyone for your concerns and encouragement.”He also thanked his surgeon and other medical staff at the hospital.“Difficult problems are mounting in and outside Japan right now.

            Mitchell scored 30 points and Cleveland maintained a double-digit lead most of the way for a 118-107 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night that extended the Cavaliers' winning streak to five games.

            “We just kept making the right play over and over again,"" Mitchell said. ""You’re starting to see us get more familiar with each other, get more comfortable and now you’re starting to see what that team looks like and the team we want to be ultimately.











            “We believe in ourselves,"" Mitchell added. “We believe in what we have.”

            Evan Mobley had 28 points and 13 rebounds, while Jarrett Allen added 20 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland, which snapped the Pelicans' three-game winning streak and won in New Orleans for the first time since March 2010.

            “Chemistry’s at an all-time high right now,"" Mobley said. ""Everyone’s clicking on offense. Everyone’s hitting shots, playing their role and on defense, we’re doing the same thing, getting to our spots and just running our system very well.”

            Cleveland shot 56.5% (48 of 85), outscored New Orleans 70-58 in the paint and outrebounded the Pelicans 41-34.

            “Offensively we were just completely selfless,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""It was one of our best games, I believe, in picking apart an opponent by the way they were playing us. We were able to get open layups on the back side, open 3s.”

            The Pelicans' Brandon Ingram scored 25 points, his fourth straight game with at least that many. Trey Murphy added 17 points and CJ McCollum 12 for New Orleans. 

            Cleveland went in front for good in the first quarter and opened up a 22-point, first-half lead.

            “Just a lack of toughness tonight to be honest,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""That game is not an example of who we are and who we have been.

            “Our margin for error is small,” Green added. “We can’t allow teams to get out to leads like that.”

            The Cavs led by as many as 25 in the second half and the lead hovered around 20 until the latter stages of the fourth quarter, when most of the starters had gone to the bench for good.

            “We love the group that we have,"" Bickerstaff said. ""We are confident in giving it time and letting guys grow together. We are not in a rush. We have guys that are developing, learning how to win and learning how to play together. There is no reason to skip steps and do something desperate when we are not.” 

            Mitchell had 21 points in the first half, highlighted by an off-balance scoop off the glass while being fouled from behind by McCollum.

            Mitchell's driving floater gave Cleveland a 73-55 lead late in the second quarter before Ingram's free throw made it 73-56 at halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807177,UN draft resolution: Any peace must keep Ukraine intact,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s supporters have circulated a proposed resolution for adoption by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor that would underscore the need for peace ensuring Ukraine’s “sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity.”

            The draft, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, is entitled “Principles underlying a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine.” 

            The proposed resolution is broader and less detailed than the 10-point peace plan that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced at the November summit of the Group of 20 major economies. This was a deliberate decision by Ukraine and its backers to try to gain maximum support when it is put to a vote, U.N. diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions have been private.











            General Assembly spokesperson Paulina Kubiak said Friday that a reactivated emergency session of the General Assembly on Ukraine will start on the afternoon of Feb. 22. Dozens of speeches are expected to continue through most of Feb. 23 and the vote is expected late that day. 

            Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister said last month that Zelenskyy wants to come to the U.N. for the anniversary, but diplomats said expectations of a major new Russian offensive may keep him at home. 

            The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed because of Russia’s veto power. Unlike the council, there are no vetoes in the assembly, but while its five previous resolutions on Ukraine are important as a reflection of world opinion, they are not legally binding.

            The Security Council will hold a ministerial meeting on Feb. 24, the anniversary of the invasion. Russian and Ukrainian diplomats will be at the same table, as they have been at dozens of meetings since the invasion — but there will be no outcome. 

            The Ukrainian-backed draft resolution for the anniversary was circulated Thursday night to all U.N. member nations except Russia and its ally Belarus, and negotiations on the text started Friday afternoon, the diplomats said.

            It underscores the need to reach “a comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine “as soon as possible” in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter. 

            The Charter states that all U.N. member nations “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” and must settle disputes peacefully.

            The draft calls on U.N. member states and international organizations “to redouble support for diplomatic efforts” to achieve peace on those terms.

            The proposed resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s previous demand that Russia “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces” from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. And it reaffirms that no territory acquired by the threat or use of force will be considered legal.

            The draft demands that all prisoners of war, detainees and internees be treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions and calls for the “complete exchange” of prisoners of war, the release of people unlawfully detained, “and the return of all internees and of civilians forcibly transferred and deported, including children.”

            The proposed resolution urges all countries “to cooperate in the spirit of solidarity to address the global impact of the war on food security, energy, finance, the environment, and nuclear security and safety.”

            It would deplore “the dire human rights and humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine, including the continuous attacks against critical infrastructure across Ukraine with devastating consequences for civilians.” And it would call for full adherence to international humanitarian law on the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure.

            Zelenskyy’s 10-point plan is far more specific, including establishing a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes, building a European-Atlantic security architecture with guarantees for Ukraine, restoring Ukraine’s damaged power infrastructure and ensuring safety around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia.

            The resolution adopted by the General Assembly on Oct. 12 condemning Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions and demanding its immediate reversal got the highest vote of the five resolutions – 143-5 with 35 abstentions.

            The first resolution adopted by the assembly on March 2, 2022, days after the invasion, demanded an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its troops and protection for all civilians and received a strong vote – 141-5 with 35 abstentions. Three weeks later, on March 24, the assembly voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on a resolution blaming Russia for Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival.

            But the assembly voted by a far smaller margin April 7 to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s Geneva-based Human Rights Council over allegations Russian soldiers in Ukraine engaged in rights violations that the United States and Ukraine have called war crimes. That vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions.

            And its last resolution adopted Nov. 14 calling for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including by paying reparations for widespread damage to the country and for Ukrainians killed and injured during the war was approved by a similar vote — 94-14 with 73 abstentions.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s supporters have circulated a proposed resolution for adoption by the 193-member U.N.

Russian and Ukrainian diplomats will be at the same table, as they have been at dozens of meetings since the invasion — but there will be no outcome.The Ukrainian-backed draft resolution for the anniversary was circulated Thursday night to all U.N. member nations except Russia and its ally Belarus, and negotiations on the text started Friday afternoon, the diplomats said.It underscores the need to reach “a comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine “as soon as possible” in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter.The Charter states that all U.N. member nations “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” and must settle disputes peacefully.The draft calls on U.N. member states and international organizations “to redouble support for diplomatic efforts” to achieve peace on those terms.The proposed resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s previous demand that Russia “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces” from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. And it reaffirms that no territory acquired by the threat or use of force will be considered legal.The draft demands that all prisoners of war, detainees and internees be treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions and calls for the “complete exchange” of prisoners of war, the release of people unlawfully detained, “and the return of all internees and of civilians forcibly transferred and deported, including children.”The proposed resolution urges all countries “to cooperate in the spirit of solidarity to address the global impact of the war on food security, energy, finance, the environment, and nuclear security and safety.”It would deplore “the dire human rights and humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine, including the continuous attacks against critical infrastructure across Ukraine with devastating consequences for civilians.” And it would call for full adherence to international humanitarian law on the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure.Zelenskyy’s 10-point plan is far more specific, including establishing a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes, building a European-Atlantic security architecture with guarantees for Ukraine, restoring Ukraine’s damaged power infrastructure and ensuring safety around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia.The resolution adopted by the General Assembly on Oct. 12 condemning Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions and demanding its immediate reversal got the highest vote of the five resolutions – 143-5 with 35 abstentions.The first resolution adopted by the assembly on March 2, 2022, days after the invasion, demanded an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its troops and protection for all civilians and received a strong vote – 141-5 with 35 abstentions. Three weeks later, on March 24, the assembly voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on a resolution blaming Russia for Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival.But the assembly voted by a far smaller margin April 7 to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s Geneva-based Human Rights Council over allegations Russian soldiers in Ukraine engaged in rights violations that the United States and Ukraine have called war crimes. That vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions.And its last resolution adopted Nov. 14 calling for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including by paying reparations for widespread damage to the country and for Ukrainians killed and injured during the war was approved by a similar vote — 94-14 with 73 abstentions.",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807178,Pence subpoena could set up fight over executive privilege,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The subpoena to former Vice President Mike Pence is a milestone moment in an ongoing Justice Department special counsel investigation. But it doesn't guarantee he's going to be testifying before a grand jury anytime soon.

            Pence is the latest official in former President Donald Trump's administration to be subpoenaed as part of the investigation into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, but the push for Pence's testimony is unique because he's the highest-ranking official known to have been summoned. 

            The subpoena, the most aggressive step to date taken by special counsel Jack Smith, sets the stage for a potential dispute over executive privilege, creating a dynamic that could test — or at least delay — the Justice Department's ability to get from Pence the testimony it believes it needs.











            Representatives for Pence have not said publicly whether he intends to comply with the subpoena or will instead look to try to limit his grand jury appearance or avoid it altogether. Trump, for his part, has not said whether he plans to assert executive privilege to prevent Pence's cooperation. But some legal experts say he faces significant hurdles in succeeding if he tried to do so.

            “This will be fairly straightforward because the Department of Justice will be able to make a very compelling showing for the testimony,"" said W. Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration.

            Spokespeople for Pence and Smith declined to comment on the subpoena, which a person familiar with the matter said followed back-and-forth negotiations between the two sides. A lawyer for the former vice president did not return emails seeking comment. Pence has been represented by veteran attorney Emmet Flood, who over decades in Washington has navigated other high-profile political figures through executive privilege disputes.

            Pence’s interest to investigators is obvious. Despite having only a ceremonial role in overseeing the election, Pence was hectored for weeks by Trump to help him stay in power, with the president falsely insisting that Pence could simply reject the results and send them back to the battleground states he contested. 

            Some of the Trump loyalists who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Pence was presiding over the counting of electoral votes chanted "" “Hang Mike Pence!” as the vice president was steered to safety.

            Since then, Pence, who is considering launching a 2024 presidential bid against Trump, has distanced himself from the former president, saying last year that “President Trump is wrong” and that “I had no right to overturn the election.”

            Despite that criticism, Pence opted against testifying voluntarily before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and was never subpoenaed to appear. Whether he views cooperation with the grand jury differently is unclear, as is whether he and his lawyers will try to avoid being forced to discuss private conversations with Trump.

            In the event he does ultimately testify, a subpoena might give him a degree of political cover, helping him avoid further alienating Trump supporters he may need for his own election bid by allowing him to say that he was compelled to cooperate rather than did so voluntarily. 

            If he does not wish to comply, he may look for Trump to intervene by invoking executive privilege, a doctrine meant to protect the confidentiality of the Oval Office decision-making process. Such an action could result in closed-door arguments before the D.C. court's chief federal judge, Beryl Howell.

            Even then, though, the prospects for success is uncertain at best, in part because the privilege is not absolute and courts have held it can be overcome if the evidence being sought is deemed necessary for a criminal trial or a grand jury proceeding.

            The Supreme Court made that clear in a 1974 decision that forced President Richard Nixon to turn over damning Oval Office recordings, saying using the principle to “withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the court.”

            Trump has also been unsuccessful in asserting executive privilege in instances where the current Biden administration disagrees. For instance, the Biden White House repeatedly rejected Trump efforts to use executive privilege to prevent the National Archives and Records Administration from producing presidential records about Jan. 6 to the House committee. The Supreme Court in January 2022 also rebuffed Trump's efforts to withhold the documents.

            Other Trump administration officials have already testified before the grand jury, including former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his top deputy as well as Pence's own chief of staff, Marc Short. 

            Former Trump administration national security adviser Robert O'Brien has also been subpoenaed by the special counsel as part of the Jan. 6 investigation and a separate probe into the presence of classified documents at Trump's Florida estate, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss the action. 

            “It's a little uncomfortable that that evidence is being sought from his vice president. But the law has not generally differentiated among people in a White House,"" Eggleston said.

            Other potential complicating factors include the fact that the episodes investigators presumably want to question Pence about — such as Trump's efforts to influence counting of the votes — don't concern conventional presidential duties likes the ones typically thought to be shielded by executive privilege, said Daniel Farber, a presidential powers expert and Berkeley Law professor. 

            He also wrote in detail about many of those episodes in a book published last year, “So Help Me God."" That includes descriptions of a Trump pressure campaign aimed at getting Pence to reject the election results, as well as numerous conversations ahead of Jan. 6, when Pence says he told Trump that he did not believe he had the power to do what Trump wanted.

            “I think there are arguments that Pence can make or the Trump could make,” Farber said. “And of course, you can never 100% predict what the courts will do.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807179,"Gilgeous-Alexander has 44, Thunder top Trail Blazers 138-129","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander matched his career high with 44 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 138-129 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. 

            Gilgeous-Alexander was 13 of 16 from the floor and hit 18 of 19 free-throw attempts. He is the first player in Thunder history to score 40-plus points on 80% shooting. He also had seven assists. 

            ""Shot a lot of free throws tonight for sure. That helps,"" he said. “I just played in my comfort zone tonight. I tried to put pressure on the defense a lot.""











            Josh Giddey added 19 points for the Thunder, who had lost three of their previous five games. 

            Damian Lillard led the Trail Blazers with 38 points, and Jerami Grant added 23. 

            It was back-and-forth for much of the game, but Portland went up 112-103 in the fourth quarter on Anfernee Simons' 3-pointer. 

            But the Thunder took over, boosted by a 16-2 run. 

            Oklahoma City closed within 112-111 on Isaiah Joe's 3-pointer and then went ahead on Giddey's jumper with 7:31 left. Lillard answered with a basket that gave Portland back a slim lead. 

            Gilgeous-Alexander's dunk gave Oklahoma City a 119-114 lead with 5:22 to go. Lu Dort's 3-pointer made it 129-121 with 2:45 left to all but seal it for the Thunder. Dort finished with 18 points off the bench. 

            “From halftime on we were saying internally that we were going to have to get stops if we wanted to get the game -- otherwise it was going to be a scoring fest, first to 140-type thing,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""It took us a while to get there ... but once we got going, we got into nice defensive rhythm, we were really active, really helping each other, really engaged.”

            The Trail Blazers started Cam Reddish, who they acquired in a trade before the deadline with the Knicks. Reddish scored 11 points starting in place of Josh Hart, who was sent to New York in the deal.

            ""We just couldn’t stop a nosebleed, man. It was really bad,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “But it started you know at the start, really. And they’re a tough team to guard. They really are.” 

            Grant was hit in the face midway through the first quarter and fell to the court. He stayed down for several moments before heading to the locker room. He returned in the second quarter. 

            There was drama Friday night surrounding another Portland move at the trade deadline: Guard Gary Payton II, sent to the Warriors in a four-team trade, had reportedly flunked his physical — putting the trade in jeopardy. 

            Blazers general manager Joe Cronin spoke to the media before the game and said he had only just seen the news, first reported by The Athletic, and could not comment. 

            Oklahoma City was also active before Thursday's trade deadline, acquiring Justin Jackson and draft picks from the Boston Celtics in exchange for forward/center Mike Muscala. Jackson was waived on Friday. 

            The Thunder also acquired Dario Saric, a 2029 second-round draft pick and cash considerations from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for forward Darius Bazley. Saric was not yet with the team. 

            Lillard had 20 points in the opening quarter and the Blazers had a slim 35-33 lead. 

            The Thunder pulled ahead late in the first half and led 72-68 at the break. Gilgeous-Alexander led all players with 24 points. 

            Shaedon Sharpe's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 105-103 lead heading into the fourth quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807180,Schools become flashpoint for Republicans eyeing White House,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump has called for parents to elect and fire school principals. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. And Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who is expected to announce her White House candidacy this coming week, is among the Republicans taking aim at critical race theory.

            In the opening stages of the 2024 GOP presidential race, the “parents' rights” movement and lessons for schoolchildren are emerging as flashpoints.

            The focus on issues related to racism, sexuality and education is a way for potential White House hopefuls to distinguish themselves in a crowded field, suggesting new and deeper ways for government to shape what happens in local classrooms.











            But the effort has prompted criticism from LGBTQ advocacy groups, teachers’ unions, some parents and student activists and those worried about efforts to avoid lessons about systemic racism. Democrats have cast the efforts as race-baiting and improperly injecting politics into schools. 

            “What we’re seeing now, at least in this period, is much more focus on so-called ‘culture war’ issues,” said Jeffrey Henig, a professor of political science and education at Columbia University’s Teachers’ College.

            Nowhere is the drive more visible than in Florida, where DeSantis has made an aggressive push against what he calls “woke” policies.

            He gained national attention last year for signing the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill into law, barring instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for young elementary schoolers, as well as material deemed not age-appropriate, which critics have argued is vague and could stifle classroom discussions. He also signed the “Stop WOKE” act in 2022, a law that restricted teaching that members of one race are inherently racist or should feel guilt about past actions by other people of the same race, among other things. 

            DeSantis has also extended his political influence to local school board races, endorsing candidates last year in what had been nonpartisan contests and flipping at least three boards from a liberal majority to a conservative majority. 

            More recently, he blocked high schools from teaching a new Advanced Placement course on African American studies, contending it was a violation of a state law and historically inaccurate. Beyond K-12 schools, he appointed six conservative trustees to the board of a small liberal arts college and he has announced plans to restrict state colleges from having programs on diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory.

            
                Critical race theory, a way of thinking about America's history through the lens of racism, has been a top target. The theory, which DeSantis has called “pernicious,” was developed by scholars in the 1970s and 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.

            As DeSantis emerges as the most formidable potential challenger to Trump, who has staked out his own positions on the same issues and recently released a nearly 5-minute video outlining what his campaign called a “Plan to Save American Education and Give Power Back to Parents.”

            Declaring that “public schools have been taken over by the radical left maniacs,” and warning about “pink-haired communists teaching our kids,” Trump pledged, if elected president again, that he would cut federal money for any school or program promoting “critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on to our children.”

            Trump said he planned to create a national credentialing organization that would certify teachers “who embrace patriotic values, support our way of life and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children” and would set up favorable treatment for states and school districts that adopt reforms such as allowing parents to directly elect school principals. 

            “If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should have the right and be able to vote or to fire them and to select someone else that will do the job properly,” Trump said at a campaign appearance in South Carolina. 

            Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is considering a presidential campaign, is using a group he formed to rally conservatives against transgender-affirming policies in schools. The group’s plans to run ads, hold rallies and canvass in early voting state Iowa comes as a federal appeals court is set to consider a case involving an Iowa school district’s policy to support transgender students. 

            In the U.S., public education is run by states and largely paid for by state and local taxpayers. The federal government does not, for instance, certify teachers or regulate how schools hire staff. And Washington also doesn't control curriculum standards like those DeSantis has backed in Florida. But Congress or the Department of Education can incentivize certain education practices by tying them to federal money.

            So it's not unheard of for presidential candidates to talk about education.

            
                George H.W. Bush declared he wanted to be known as the “education president” and started a push for national standards and goals. His son, George W. Bush, centered his message in the 2000 campaign in part on education reform and during the first year of his administration, signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, which ignited a national debate over the proper use of standardized testing in schools. 

            The more recent divisive shift to social issues in schools is an outgrowth of Glenn Youngkin's successful bid in 2021 to become the first Republican in more than a decade to be elected as Virginia's governor. Youngkin, himself a potential presidential candidate in 2024, campaigned on parental rights. He appealed to parents frustrated over school closures during the pandemic and said he would ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools. 

            Once in office, his administration began the process of rewriting the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements. 

            Kristin Davison, a strategist for Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign, said Youngkin focused on education after the pandemic thrust parents into the classroom, leading to frustrations with remote learning to the curriculum itself. 

            “Voters want their leaders to understand the issues that they’re talking about at their kitchen table,” she said. “Right now, families are sitting at their kitchen table looking at report cards, looking at homework assignments, frustrated at curriculum.” 

            The debate over education still carried weight during last year's elections, potentially giving Republican presidential candidates a reason to stay focused on the issue. Half of voters in 2022 said their local K-8 schools were teaching too much about gender identity issues, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate. Only about one-quarter said schools teach too little on the subject.

            About 4 in 10 voters said too little is taught on racism in the U.S., while about one-third said schools were teaching too much on related issues. Roughly one-quarter of voters said the focus on each is “about right.”

            There was broad agreement among Republicans — about 8 in 10 of whom said gender identity is taught too much in schools. A smaller majority, 56%, said that about racism.

            Among Democrats, about two-thirds said there's too little taught about racism. But there was less consensus around teaching gender identity. About 4 in 10 said too little is taught, about 2 in 10 said too much is taught and about 4 in 10 said schools handle it about right.

            Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster and strategist who worked on President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign, said the GOP messages about protecting children seem to be aimed at trying to win over suburban women, who have drifted away from Trump and the GOP, particularly after the Supreme Court ended constitutional protections for abortion last year.

            “I think it’s getting extra energy because of its appeal or its presumed appeal to women voters,” she said.NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump has called for parents to elect and fire school principals. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. And Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who is expected to announce her White House candidacy this coming week, is among the Republicans taking aim at critical race theory.In the opening stages of the 2024 GOP presidential race, the “parents' rights” movement and lessons for schoolchildren are emerging as flashpoints.The focus on issues related to racism, sexuality and education is a way for potential White House hopefuls to distinguish themselves in a crowded field, suggesting new and deeper ways for government to shape what happens in local classrooms.But the effort has prompted criticism from LGBTQ advocacy groups, teachers’ unions, some parents and student activists and those worried about efforts to avoid lessons about systemic racism. Democrats have cast the efforts as race-baiting and improperly injecting politics into schools.“What we’re seeing now, at least in this period, is much more focus on so-called ‘culture war’ issues,” said Jeffrey Henig, a professor of political science and education at Columbia University’s Teachers’ College.Nowhere is the drive more visible than in Florida, where DeSantis has made an aggressive push against what he calls “woke” policies.He gained national attention last year for signing the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill into law, barring instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for young elementary schoolers, as well as material deemed not age-appropriate, which critics have argued is vague and could stifle classroom discussions. He also signed the “Stop WOKE” act in 2022, a law that restricted teaching that members of one race are inherently racist or should feel guilt about past actions by other people of the same race, among other things.DeSantis has also extended his political influence to local school board races, endorsing candidates last year in what had been nonpartisan contests and flipping at least three boards from a liberal majority to a conservative majority.More recently, he blocked high schools from teaching a new Advanced Placement course on African American studies, contending it was a violation of a state law and historically inaccurate. Beyond K-12 schools, he appointed six conservative trustees to the board of a small liberal arts college and he has announced plans to restrict state colleges from having programs on diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory.Critical race theory, a way of thinking about America's history through the lens of racism, has been a top target. The theory, which DeSantis has called “pernicious,” was developed by scholars in the 1970s and 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.As DeSantis emerges as the most formidable potential challenger to Trump, who has staked out his own positions on the same issues and recently released a nearly 5-minute video outlining what his campaign called a “Plan to Save American Education and Give Power Back to Parents.”Declaring that “public schools have been taken over by the radical left maniacs,” and warning about “pink-haired communists teaching our kids,” Trump pledged, if elected president again, that he would cut federal money for any school or program promoting “critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on to our children.”Trump said he planned to create a national credentialing organization that would certify teachers “who embrace patriotic values, support our way of life and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children” and would set up favorable treatment for states and school districts that adopt reforms such as allowing parents to directly elect school principals.“If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should have the right and be able to vote or to fire them and to select someone else that will do the job properly,” Trump said at a campaign appearance in South Carolina.Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is considering a presidential campaign, is using a group he formed to rally conservatives against transgender-affirming policies in schools. The group’s plans to run ads, hold rallies and canvass in early voting state Iowa comes as a federal appeals court is set to consider a case involving an Iowa school district’s policy to support transgender students.In the U.S., public education is run by states and largely paid for by state and local taxpayers. The federal government does not, for instance, certify teachers or regulate how schools hire staff. And Washington also doesn't control curriculum standards like those DeSantis has backed in Florida. But Congress or the Department of Education can incentivize certain education practices by tying them to federal money.So it's not unheard of for presidential candidates to talk about education.George H.W. Bush declared he wanted to be known as the “education president” and started a push for national standards and goals. His son, George W. Bush, centered his message in the 2000 campaign in part on education reform and during the first year of his administration, signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, which ignited a national debate over the proper use of standardized testing in schools.The more recent divisive shift to social issues in schools is an outgrowth of Glenn Youngkin's successful bid in 2021 to become the first Republican in more than a decade to be elected as Virginia's governor. Youngkin, himself a potential presidential candidate in 2024, campaigned on parental rights. He appealed to parents frustrated over school closures during the pandemic and said he would ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools.Once in office, his administration began the process of rewriting the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements.Kristin Davison, a strategist for Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign, said Youngkin focused on education after the pandemic thrust parents into the classroom, leading to frustrations with remote learning to the curriculum itself.“Voters want their leaders to understand the issues that they’re talking about at their kitchen table,” she said. “Right now, families are sitting at their kitchen table looking at report cards, looking at homework assignments, frustrated at curriculum.”The debate over education still carried weight during last year's elections, potentially giving Republican presidential candidates a reason to stay focused on the issue. Half of voters in 2022 said their local K-8 schools were teaching too much about gender identity issues, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate. Only about one-quarter said schools teach too little on the subject.About 4 in 10 voters said too little is taught on racism in the U.S., while about one-third said schools were teaching too much on related issues. Roughly one-quarter of voters said the focus on each is “about right.”There was broad agreement among Republicans — about 8 in 10 of whom said gender identity is taught too much in schools. A smaller majority, 56%, said that about racism.Among Democrats, about two-thirds said there's too little taught about racism. But there was less consensus around teaching gender identity.

The founder of the Fo Guang Shan association received tributes from across the political spectrum, with even Chinese figures saying they wanted to pay their respects.MAC announced Friday (Feb. 10) it had approved a list of 120 Chinese nationals to travel to Taiwan for a Feb. 13 memorial in Kaohsiung City, the seat of Master Hsing Yun’s group. However, 12 serving officials from Chinese communist, religious and propaganda groups were refused entry. As a result, China decided to scrap the whole trip, sending the delegation to a Fo Guang Shan temple in the province of Jiangsu instead.In a statement, MAC said Saturday that China was playing politics with the issue and trying to blame Taiwan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807204,Bucks beat Clippers 119-106 for 10th straight win,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 35 points and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 119-106 on Friday night for their first 10-game winning streak since 2019-20.

            Brook Lopez had 22 points and 15 rebounds, and Jrue Holiday added 19 points for the Bucks, who have won 12 of 13. They completed a back-to-back sweep in LA, having beaten the Lakers a night earlier.

            “There's a point in the season where things get repetitive and winning has been,” Holiday said.











            Paul George led six Clippers in double figures with 19 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. They were without Kawhi Leonard, who sat out due to injury management.

            
                Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 10 rebounds against the Lakers. He picked up where he left off, scoring the Bucks’ first eight points as they raced to a 14-2 lead to open the game.

            “You have a 7-footer that shoots a 3-point shot (Lopez) and if you put a forward on Giannis, he’s going to attack the basket, get to the free-throw line, finish at the rim,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “They put you in a tough predicament. That’s why they’re a good team and they won a championship a few years ago.”

He was the leading vote-getter in the Eastern Conference for the All-Star Game on Feb. 19. He'll be making his seventh straight start and was voted a captain for the third time.

            “We're all playing confidently, playing together and clicking,” Lopez said. 

            The Clippers rallied before losing 106-105 at Milwaukee last week. They did it again in the third when neither team led by more than five for much of the period. Antetokounmpo eventually took over, stretching Milwaukee’s lead to 76-68 with three straight baskets and he assisted on a basket by MarJon Beauchamp.

            The Bucks dominated the fourth, extending their lead from five points to double-digits. 

            Antetokounmpo scored seven of the Bucks' first 10 points in the second. When he went to the bench, Lopez scored 14 points to send the Bucks into halftime leading 54-51.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807205,"Malkin reaches 1,200 points as Penguins beat Ducks 6-3","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Evgeni Malkin and the Pittsburgh Penguins began their West Coast road trip with a milestone night.

            Malkin had two assists to become the third player in franchise history to reach 1,200 career points as the Penguins set a franchise road record with 59 shots on goal in a 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Friday night.

            Pierre-Olivier Joseph had two goals and an assist to tie a career high with three points. Kasperi Kapanen and Bryan Rust each had a goal and an assist while Jeff Carter and Jake Guentzel also scored.











            “I thought it was a pretty dominant performance,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “We had the puck a lot and generated a numerous amount of scoring chances.""

            Malkin reached his milestone with the primary assist on Rust's goal at 10:04 of the third period, which put Pittsburgh up 5-1. He joined Mario Lemieux (1,723) and Sidney Crosby (1,472) as the only Penguins players to reach that mark. 

            “I don’t want to say it’s just numbers, but it’s huge,” Malkin said. “It’s a big number and I’m trying to keep going.”

            Malkin also is the fourth active player in the league to reach 1,200 points, behind Crosby, Washington's Alexander Ovechkin (1,464) and Chicago's Patrick Kane (1,214). It was Malkin's seventh multi-point game in his last 11. He has 19 points (seven goals, 12 assists) during that span.

            “He’s such a dominant player. The way he protects pucks, his vision, his offensive instincts. And when he’s playing that way it poses a huge challenge for our opponents from a matchup standpoint,” Sullivan said.

            Casey DeSmith made 28 saves for the Penguins, who had 10 players record at least a point.

            Mason McTavish had a goal and an assist while Trevor Zegras and John Klingberg also scored for the Ducks, who had a five-game point streak snapped. John Gibson made a franchise-record 53 saves.

            “We played a hesitant game,” Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said. “And for a good part of that game, I thought we stood in awe of some of their players.”

            Joseph came into the game with two goals this season and three goals in 66 career games before finding the back of the net twice. The third-year defenseman put Pittsburgh on the board nine minutes into the first with a snap shot from the point that went in off the near post.

            Joseph then extended the lead to 4-1 at 14:55 of the second period when he took a pass from Evgeni Malkin and beat Gibson on his blocker side.

            “I think it was opportunities created by our forwards in front of me where I had the chance to put it in,” said Joseph, who became the fifth Penguins defenseman age 23 or younger to record a multi-goal game in the past 30 years. 

            Anaheim trailed 3-1 after the first period after it was outshot 25-8 in the first 20 minutes. The huge disparity in shots was due to the Ducks racking up 5:39 with the man advantage in the first period.

            “I think it was a little self-inflicted, the whole game, but obviously when it’s self-inflicted and you’re chasing from behind to start the game, it’s always tough,” Klingberg said.

            QUICK GOAL

            Zegras tied it at 1 at 15:26 of the first when he scored two seconds into Anaheim's power play.

            Adam Henrique won the faceoff in the offensive zone and chipped it to Zegras, who beat DeSmith with a backhand goal. Zegras has 19 goals this season, including four on the power play.

            STREAKING

            Crosby extended his points streak to nine games with an assist on Guentzel's goal. Crosby has three goals and 11 assists during his run.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Evgeni Malkin and the Pittsburgh Penguins began their West Coast road trip with a milestone night.Malkin had two assists to become the third player in franchise history to reach 1,200 career points as the Penguins set a franchise road record with 59 shots on goal in a 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Friday night.Pierre-Olivier Joseph had two goals and an assist to tie a career high with three points. Kasperi Kapanen and Bryan Rust each had a goal and an assist while Jeff Carter and Jake Guentzel also scored.“I thought it was a pretty dominant performance,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “We had the puck a lot and generated a numerous amount of scoring chances.""Malkin reached his milestone with the primary assist on Rust's goal at 10:04 of the third period, which put Pittsburgh up 5-1. He joined Mario Lemieux (1,723) and Sidney Crosby (1,472) as the only Penguins players to reach that mark.“I don’t want to say it’s just numbers, but it’s huge,” Malkin said. “It’s a big number and I’m trying to keep going.”Malkin also is the fourth active player in the league to reach 1,200 points, behind Crosby, Washington's Alexander Ovechkin (1,464) and Chicago's Patrick Kane (1,214). It was Malkin's seventh multi-point game in his last 11. He has 19 points (seven goals, 12 assists) during that span.“He’s such a dominant player. The way he protects pucks, his vision, his offensive instincts. And when he’s playing that way it poses a huge challenge for our opponents from a matchup standpoint,” Sullivan said.Casey DeSmith made 28 saves for the Penguins, who had 10 players record at least a point.Mason McTavish had a goal and an assist while Trevor Zegras and John Klingberg also scored for the Ducks, who had a five-game point streak snapped.

Earlier, police conducted ""several raids"" at his home in Anthisnes, the town hall and a safe deposit box at a bank in the nearby city of Liege.Italian finance police, acting on behalf of Belgian prosecutors, also arrested Andrea Cozzolino at a clinic in Naples on Friday.The two Members of the European Parliament are accused of accepting bribes, a charge they both deny.The arrests come after the European Parliament voted to waive the immunity of Tarabella and Cozzolino last week.Before the vote, a parliamentary report compiled on Tarabella alleged that he ""may have been involved in acts of corruption connected with the interference by one or more states aimed at influencing debates and decisions taken by the European Parliament.""Both men have also been expelled from the center-left Socialists and Democrats group.In December 2022, police raided a number of homes, offices and hotels in Brussels and Italy and found roughly €1.5 million ($1.6 million) in cash.Four people were charged with corruption, money laundering and membership in a criminal organization after the arrests: Greek  then-Parliamentary Vice President Eva Kaili; her partner, Italian Francesco Giorgi; Italian former European Parliament legislator Pier Antonio Panzeri; and Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the former head of an NGO.In January, Panzeri struck a deal with prosecutors to share information in exchange for a lighter sentence.Belgian media reported that he admitted to giving Tarabella ""between €120,000 and €140,000 ($128,000 and $150,000)"" for handling matters linked to Qatar.Tarabella's lawyer confirmed that the member of the European Parliament had visited Qatar twice.The attorney however added that he had been fully transparent about trips to construction sites and work camps, and was focused on addressing human rights issues and freedom of expression.Qatar has denied any involvement in the scandal.zc/ar (dpa, Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/02/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807219,India rout Australia by innings inside 3 days of first test,"NAGPUR, India (AP) — India defeated Australia by an innings and 132 runs inside three days of the first test on Saturday.

            Ravichandran Ashwin took 5-37 in 12 overs as Australia was dismissed before tea in its second innings for 91, its lowest total in India.

            Steve Smith top-scored with an unbeaten 25. Only one other batter made more than 10.











            India started the day on 321-7 and was all out for 400.

            Ravindra Jadeja moved from 66 to 70 and was bowled by offspinner Todd Murphy. Murphy also claimed Mohammed Shami, who hit 37 off 47 balls. Murphy finished with 7-124 in his maiden test, the sixth best figures on debut for an Australian.

            Axar Patel advanced from 52 overnight to a career-best 84, including 10 boundaries and a six, when he was last man out.

            Trailing by 223 runs, Australia made another bad start as Ashwin and Shami took the new ball.

            Usman Khawaja was caught at slip on 5 trying to hit Ashwin for an expansive cover drive, and David Warner survived a dropped catch at slip but was trapped by Ashwin for 10 soon after.

            In between them, Jadeja got Marnus Labuschagne lbw and the wickets kept on falling around Smith. Jadeja did bowl Smith off a no ball, which extended the match for another seven deliveries.

            The innings ended in 32.3 overs. Jadeja picked up 2-27 and Patel 1-6.

            Ashwin secured his 31st five-wicket haul, and Jadeja was named man of the match for taking seven wickets and hitting a half-century.

            ""It feels amazing to come back after five months and score runs, take wickets, and give your 100%,"" Jadeja said. “I bat at a crucial position and try not to change many things. While bowling, I was trying to keep it at the stumps so that the batsmen make mistakes.”

            Australia captain Pat Cummins praised Murphy but rued their failure to score far more than 177 in the first innings after opting to bat.

            “Playing the spinners was always going to be hard work,"" Cummins said. ""The wicket spun (in the first innings) but wasn’t unplayable. We should have scored 100 more runs to put a bit more pressure on their first innings. Todd Murphy was fantastic (with the ball).”

            The second of four tests begins next Friday in New Delhi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807229,"In Kenya, an electric transport plan for clean air, climate","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — On the packed streets of Nairobi, Cyrus Kariuki is one of a growing number of bikers zooming through traffic on an electric motorbike, reaping the benefits of cheaper transport, cleaner air and limiting planet-warming emissions in the process.

            “Each month one doesn’t have to be burdened by oil change, engine checks and other costly maintenance costs,” Kariuki said. 

            Electric motorcycles are gaining traction in Kenya as private sector-led firms rush to set up charging points and battery-swapping stations to speed up the growth of cleaner transport and put the east African nation on a path toward fresher air and lower emissions. 











            But startups say more public support and better government schemes can help further propel the industry.

            Ampersand, an African-based electric mobility company, began its Kenyan operations in May 2022. The business currently operates seven battery-swapping stations spread across the country's capital and has so far attracted 60 customers. Ian Mbote, the startup's automotive engineer and expansion lead, says uptake has been relatively slow. 

            “We need friendly policies, taxes, regulations and incentives that would boost the entry into the market,"" said Mbote, adding that favorable government tariffs in Rwanda accelerated its electric transport growth. Ampersand plan to sell 500 more electric motorbikes by the end of the year.

            Companies say the savings of switching to electric and using a battery-swap system, rather than charging for several hours, are key selling point for customers.

            “Our batteries cost $1.48 to swap a full battery which gives one mobility of about 90 to 110 kilometers (56 to 68 miles) as compared to the $1.44 of fuel that only guarantees a 30 to 40 kilometer ride (19 to 25 miles) on a motorcycle,” Mbote said.

            Kim Chepkoit, the founder of electric motorbike-making company Ecobodaa Mobility, added that ""electricity costs are going to be more predictable and cushioned from the fluctuation of the fuel prices.”

            Ecobodaa's flagship product is a motorcycle with two batteries, making it capable of covering 160 kilometers (100 miles) on one battery charge. The motorcycle costs 185,000 shillings ($1,400) without the battery, about the same as a conventional motorbike.

            Other cleaner transport initiatives in the country include the Sustainable Energy for Africa program which runs a hub for 30 solar-powered charging stations for electric vehicles and battery-swapping in Kenya’s western region. 

            Electric mobility has a promising future in the continent but “requires infrastructural, societal and political systemic changes that neither happen overnight nor will be immune to hesitance,” said Carol Mungo, a research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute.

            The move to electric transport “will require African governments to rethink how they deliver current services such as reliable and affordable electricity” and at the same time put in place adequate measures to address electric waste and disposal, Mungo added.

            Some financial incentives are on the way. 

            Earlier in February the African Development Bank announced that it will provide $1 million in grants for technical assistance in Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and South Africa. 

            The African continent records a million premature deaths annually from air pollution, according to a soon-to-be-released study by the U.N. environment agency, Stockholm Environment Institute and the African Union obtained by The Associated Press. 

            Studies by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition say a reduction of short-lived climate pollutants can cut the amount of warming by as “much as 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit), while avoiding 2.4 million premature deaths globally from annual outdoor air pollution.”

            But Mungo warned that cleaning up transport is just one step of many toward better air quality.

            “There are so many emission factors in cities,” she said. “E-mobility, however, looks broadly beyond the transport sector to infrastructure development and urban planning, which in the end can solve complex pollution issues on in Africa.”

It added the penalty has yet to be announced, and Sony is seeking to shorten the duration.Sony China’s last Weibo post was made on Jan. 4. Its page now shows the note, “The user is being banned from posting for violating relevant laws and regulations.”On Jan. 7, the Communist Youth League of China wrote on Weibo, “Severe punishment! Sony China’s account, accused of insulting a martyr, has been banned. On Oct. 12, 2022, Sony China shared a Weibo post containing an image with a composition highly akin to the scene of the sacrifice of martyr Qiu Shaoyun (邱少雲). The day the post was published was the 70th anniversary of Qiu Shaoyun’s sacrifice.” It added that it will “never tolerate the malicious twisting, vilifying, denying of martyrs.”The martyr in question is hailed as a national hero in China. The Chinese Communist Party claims that while hiding in bushes by an American military base during the Korean War, an incendiary munition landed near Qiu, who remained in position and endured the pain of being engulfed in flames until his death, so that he would not reveal the location of his troops.Qiu’s image is often presented as a man lying on his belly on the grassy ground, his body enveloped in red and yellow flames.The image that Sony posted showed a dog looking at the camera in the midst of orange maple leaves. “We believe that this purposeful design must not be a coincidence,” the Communist Youth League wrote.The league went on to name other offenses, such as in 2019, when Sony announced a product with the slogan, “never concede” on Dec. 13, memorial day for the Nanjing Massacre. In a 2021 “incident,” Sony scheduled a product announcement for July 7 at 10 p.m., which was the date and time when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred in 1937.Liberty Times reported that Sony’s promotional image for New Year’s wishes had also been deleted for the text, “2023, more brilliant with ‘ni.’”The word “ni” (尼) references Sony’s name and is pronounced similarly to the Chinese word, “you.” However, it was also seen as a reference to Winnie the Pooh.China lists more of Sony's ""offenses"" over the years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807241,Hilltop coal-mining town a tactical prize in Ukraine war,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — In a small coal-mining town on Ukraine’s eastern front line, a fight for strategic superiority is being waged in a battlefield steeped with symbolism as the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion nears. 

            The town of Vuhledar — meaning “gift of coal” — has emerged as a critical hot spot in the fight for Donetsk province that would give both sides, the Ukrainian forces who hold the urban center, and the Russians positioned in the suburbs, a tactical upper hand in the greater battle for the Donbas region. 

            Located on an elevated plane that is one of the few high-terrain spots in the area, its capture would be an important step for Russia to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines. Securing Vuhledar would give Ukraine a potential launching pad for future counter-offensives south. 











            Then there is the symbolic weight: Vuhledar is close to the administrative border of Donetsk province, and winning it would play into Russia’s greater aim of controlling the region as a whole. 

            “The center of gravity of the Russian military effort is in Donetsk, and Vuhledar is basically the southern flank of that,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relation’s Berlin office. 

            The grinding fight to win the area has cost Russia manpower and weapons, as Ukrainians continue to hold up defensive lines. Russia sends battalion-sized scout groups to probe Ukrainian lines and shoot artillery toward their positions with an eye to pushing north toward the critical N15 highway, a key supply route. 

            In remarks this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russian troops were advancing “with success” in Vuhledar. Meanwhile, a British defense intelligence briefing said Russia's aim was to capture unoccupied areas of Ukrainian-held Donetsk but it was unlikely to build up the forces required to change the outcome of the war. 

            Vuhledar’s pre-war population of 14,000 has dwindled to about 300. The majority of the town’s residents worked in the coal mine and nearby factories before the war. 

            Olha Kyseliova, who was recently evacuated, worked in a brick factory before the fighting upended her life.

            Russian forces ramped up attacks beginning on Jan. 24, residents said. That day, a missile tore through Kyseliova's nine-story building. She was sheltering in the basement with her three children and emerged to find a gaping hole through the roof of her third-floor apartment. 

            That was the moment she decided she had to leave her hometown. “I cried the entire way out, I didn’t want to leave,” she said. 

            Three Ukrainian brigades are positioned in Vuhledar and on the outskirts of the town. The Associated Press spoke to five commanders in units from all three, who provided only their first names in keeping with Ukraine's military policy. Russia’s 155 Marine infantry troops are positioned just four kilometers (two miles) away in Vuhledar’s suburbs. 

            For both sides, the town is tactically important. 

            “It’s one of the main logistics points of the Donbas region, and also one of the main points of elevation,” said Maksym, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian marine infantry battalion. “By capturing Vuhledar, Russians can easily occupy the entire Donetsk region.” 

            Seizing Vuhledar would enable Russia to push forward and threaten Ukrainian supply lines feeding into the fierce Marinka front line to the north, said Gressel of the European Council on Foreign Relations. For Ukraine, Vuhledar would be a launching pad for future counter-offensives toward Mariupol and Berdiansk. 

            From their perch in the town, Ukrainian forces can see into Russian lines and have so far been able to repel Russian attempts to encircle Vuhledar. Columns of Russian tanks and armored vehicles transporting infantrymen continuously assault and attempt to break Ukrainian defenses. Aviation, rockets and artillery target the town. 

            “But with our fighters and anti-tank equipment their attempts have not been successful,” said Maksym, the Ukrainian deputy commander. “The situation is strained, but controlled.”

            Similar to other front lines along the east, the Russians are losing scores of infantrymen in an attempt to tire and weaken Ukrainian defensive lines. Serhii, the commander of a Ukrainian intelligence unit, said he saw Russian soldiers sent straight through fields mined by the Ukrainians following Russia’s capture of the village of Pavlivka, south of Vuhledar, in November. 

            “They de-mine our fields by using their own people,” he said.

            Ukrainian commanders said some of their units are suffering from dire ammunition shortages. 

            That view was not shared across brigades, suggesting some are better supplied than others. Taras, the commander of a mortar unit, said his forces were suffering very serious shortages. Faced with orders to target an enemy position, he said, “I have just two or three rounds of ammunition to do it. It’s nothing.” 

            Two commanders of a brigade inside Vuhledar reported the Russians hurled gas-laden projectiles that caused severe disorientation for hours, and burning of the throat and skin. Higher-ranking commanders did not comment on the type of gas used and said an investigation was ongoing. 

            “They are probing and testing us across the eastern front line, including in Vuhledar,” said Oleksandr, a commander who was recently rotated out of the town. “They are trying to find our points of weakness.” 

            For now, Russia’s activities around Vuhledar are not “operationally significant,” said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst with the U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War. More combat power is required to execute breakthroughs that would achieve the stated aim of the Russian invasion — the capture of the entire Donetsk province. 

            Even in the event of victory in Vuhledar, Russia would still need a lot of combat power to push north. Three months after capturing the village of Pavlivka in November, Russian forces have yet to make breakthroughs in Vuhledar, which is only four kilometers — a six-minute drive — away. 

            “It’s not operationally significant because Russians will still have to fight for more territory to make a meaningful disruption of Ukrainian ground lines of communication to western Donetsk,” Stepanenko said. Vuhledar is just ""one settlement on their way, where they are already suffering significant losses and where they already seem to have suffered losses in the area before.” 

            Meanwhile, the last of Vuhledar’s residents said they are staying put. 

            Oleksandra Havrylko, police press officer for the Donetsk region, pleads with those who remain to leave the devastated area. Most spend their days hiding in basements, coming out when there are lulls in fighting to charge phones and gather supplies in the town’s points of refuge, called “invincibility centers”.

            All but one of the town's children have been evacuated. The father of a 15-year-old, the last remaining minor in the town, refuses to part with his son or leave the area, she said. 

            “There are people in the city who don’t want to be evacuated, we tried many times,” she said. Most have never ventured far from their hometown.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807242,Nicaraguan bishop who refused exile gets 26 years in prison,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Roman Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez, an outspoken critic of Nicaragua’s government, was sentenced to 26 years in prison and stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship Friday, the latest move by President Daniel Ortega against the Catholic church and his opponents.A day after he refused to get on a flight to the United States with 222 other prisoners, all opponents of Ortega, a judge sentenced Álvarez for undermining the government, spreading false information, obstruction of functions and disobedience, according to a government statement published in official outlets.The sentence handed down by Octavio Ernesto Rothschuh, chief magistrate of the Managua appeals court, is the longest given to any of Ortega's opponents over the last couple years.Álvarez was arrested in August along with several other priests and lay people. When Ortega ordered the mass release of political leaders, priests, students and activists widely considered political prisoners and had some of them put on a flight to Washington Thursday, Alvarez refused to board without being able to consult with other bishops, Ortega said.Nicaragua's president called Álvarez's refusal “an absurd thing."" Álvarez, who had been held under house arrest, was then taken to the nearby Modelo prison.Álvarez had been one of the most outspoken religious figures still in Nicaragua as Ortega intensified his repression of the opposition.Nicaragua’s Episcopal Conference did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sentence. Reached by the AP, Managua vicar Mons. Carlos Avilés said he hadn't heard anything official. “Maybe tomorrow.”The church is essentially the last independent institution trusted by a large portion of Nicaraguans and that makes it a threat to Ortega's increasingly authoritarian rule.Andrew Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said Álvarez's sentence “constitutes the most severe repression against the Catholic Church in Latin America since the assassination of Guatemalan Bishop Juan José Gerardi in 1998.”“Since first becoming the ruling party in 1979 the Sandinistas have repressed the Catholic Church like few other regimes in Latin America,” Chesnut said. “Pope Francis has refrained from criticizing President Ortega for fear of inflaming the situation, but many believe that now is the time for him to speak out prophetically in defense of the most persecuted Church in Latin America.”Monsignor Silvio Báez, the former outspoken Managua auxiliary bishop who was recalled to the Vatican in 2019, said on Twitter “the Nicaraguan dictatorship’s hatred toward Mons. Rolando Álvarez is irrational and out of control.”Álvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua, has been a key religious voice in discussions of Nicaragua’s future since 2018, when a wave of protests against Ortega’s government led to a sweeping crackdown on opponents.When the protests first erupted, Ortega asked the church to serve as mediator in peace talks.On April 20, 2018, hundreds of student protesters sought refuge at Managua’s cathedral. When police and Sandinista Youth descended, the students retreated inside, leaving only after clergy negotiated their safe passage.“We hope there would be a series of electoral reforms, structural changes to the electoral authority — free, just and transparent elections, international observation without conditions,” Álvarez said a month after the protests broke out. “Effectively the democratization of the country.”By that summer, the Church was under attack by Ortega's supporters.A pro-government mob shoved, punched and scratched at Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes and other Catholic leaders as they tried to enter the Basilica San Sebastian in Diriamba on July 9, 2018.For nearly 15 hours overnight on July 13-14, 2018, armed government backers fired on a church in Managua while 155 student protesters who had been dislodged from a nearby university lay under the pews. A student who was shot in the head at a barricade outside died on the rectory floor.More recently, Ortega has accused the Church of being in on an alleged foreign-backed plot to depose him.Last summer, the government seized several radio stations owned by the diocese. At the time, it appeared Ortega’s administration wanted to silence critical voices ahead of municipal elections.The Holy See has been largely silent on the situation in Nicaragua, believing that any public denunciation will only inflame tensions further between the government and the local church.The Vatican’s last comment came in August when Pope Francis expressed concern about the raid of Álvarez's residence and called for dialogue.Earlier this week, judges sentenced five other Catholic priests to prison. They were all aboard Thursday's flight.Before the sentence was announced Friday, Emily Mendrala, a deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said “we see yesterday’s event as a positive step that could put the (bilateral) relationship on a more constructive trajectory.” But she added that “we still have concerns with the human rights situation and the situation with democracy in Nicaragua.”The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone Friday with Nicaragua Foreign Minister Denis Moncada about the prisoners’ release and “the importance of constructive dialogue between the United States to build a better future for the Nicaraguan people.” Presumably the conversation occurred before Álvarez’s sentence was announced.Vilma Núñez, director of the Nicaragua Center for Human Rights, which had been supporting prisoners in their cases, called the sentence “arbitrary and last minute,” noting that it included crimes that were not part of his original conviction.“The personal well-being and life of the Monsignor is in danger,” Núñez said.After expelling nearly all of his most vocal critics, Ortega found himself stuck with the bishop in a still heavily Catholic country.“The Catholic Church, I think, is one of the main institutions that the Ortega regime really, really fears,” Antonio Garrastazu, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the International Republican Institute in Washington, said before the the sentencing. “The Catholic Church are really the ones that can actually change the hearts and minds of the people.”Prior to the release of prisoners, sanctions and public criticism of Ortega had been building for months, but both United States and Nicaraguan officials say the decision to put 222 dissidents on a plane to Washington came suddenly.The majority had been sentenced in the past couple years to lengthy prison terms. The release came together in a couple of days and the prisoners had no idea what was happening until their buses turned into Managua’s international airport.“I think the pressure, the political pressure of the prisoners, the political prisoners became important to the Ortega regime, even for the people, the Sandinista people who were tired of abuses,” opposition leader Juan Sebastian Chamorro, who was among those released, said during a press conference Friday. “I think (Ortega) wanted to basically send the opposition outside of the country into exile.”In Ortega’s mind, they are terrorists. Funded by foreign governments, they worked to destabilize his government after huge street protests broke out in April 2018, he maintains.Ortega said Vice President Rosario Murillo, his wife, first came to him with the idea of expelling the prisoners.“Rosario says to me, ‘Why don’t we tell the ambassador to take all of these terrorists,’” Ortega recounted in a rambling speech Thursday night. In a matter of days, it was done.__AP reporters Gisela Salomon in Miami, Ciaran Giles in Madrid, Spain and Nicole Winfield in Rome and E.

The U.S. said the balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals, but Beijing insists it was a weather craft that had blown off course.The incident prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes trip to Beijing aimed at easing tensions.The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security said the six entities were being targeted for “their support to China's military modernization efforts, specifically the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aerospace programs including airships and balloons.”“The PLA is utilizing High Altitude Balloons (HAB) for intelligence and reconnaissance activities,” it said.Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said on Twitter his department “will not hesitate to continue to use"" such restrictions and other regulatory and enforcement tools ""to protect U.S. national security and sovereignty.”The six entities are Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., China Electronics Technology Group Corporation 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology Co., and Shanxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co.The research institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The other five entities could not be reached.On Friday, a U.S. military fighter jet shot down an unknown object flying off the remote northern coast of Alaska on orders from President Joe Biden. The object was downed because it reportedly posed a threat to the safety of civilian flights, instead of any knowledge that it was engaged in surveillance.But the twin incidents in such close succession reflect heightened concerns over China’s surveillance program and public pressure on Biden to take a tough stand against it.",2023/02/11,205,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807257,Micron Taiwan admits staff cuts amid global big tech's mass layoffs,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As big tech's mass layoffs sweep Silicon Valley, Micron Taiwan confirmed on Friday (Feb. 10) rumors of work force streamlining at its Taoyuan main office.The American chipmaker employs approximately 10,000 people in Taiwan, though cost-cutting plans have been implemented since late December to cope with an expected sales slump for 2023. The measures include slashing operational expenditure and suspending stock buybacks.A day earlier, the American chipmaker said it is cutting salaries of executives by as much as 20% and suspending bonuses, media reported.Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, PayPal, SAP, IBM, and Spotify are among the big tech companies reporting aggressive cost-cutting measures since late last year, including layoffs and executive pay cuts.In November, Micron Taiwan announced more hires locally, but the optimism quickly reversed after the company started making what are reportedly mass layoffs last week. Several people who claim to be Micron Taiwan employees posted on Dcard, Taiwan's largest online discussion forum, that they were given short notice of termination, while those being sacked were given a better-than-expected severance package.In response to the rumor, the company issued a statement saying work force streamlining will continue this year through layoffs or voluntary resignations, but it did not unveil the size of cuts in Taiwan.In Taiwan, the atmosphere among local semiconductor and tech companies is quite different. The recruitment plans of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and IBM Taiwan, for example, remain unchanged, TVBS reported.When asked about the recent layoff spree, Advantech founder KC Liu (劉克振) said Taiwanese tech companies are more capable of sustaining economic contraction when demand begins to fall, as their employee costs are lower than those of their American rivals — up to a 2.5 times difference.",2023/02/11,6998,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807275,Earthquake compounds Turkish leader's woes as election nears,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power 20 years ago riding a wave of public outrage toward the previous government's handling of a deadly earthquake. 

            Now, three months away from an election, Erdogan’s political future could hinge on how the public perceives his government's response to a similarly devastating natural disaster. 

            “It is going to be a big challenge for Erdogan, who has established a brand for himself as an autocratic figure but an efficient one that gets the job done,” said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkey expert at the Washington Institute and the author of several books on Erdogan. 











            The aftermath of a massive earthquake isn't the only parallel to the election of 2002. Back then, Turkey was in the midst of a financial crisis that was punishing its economy.

            Today, Turkey's economy is being hammered by skyrocketing inflation, and Erdogan has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the problem, which has left millions of poor and middle class people struggling to make ends meet. 

            Erdogan's political rivals have already begun criticizing his government's response to the earthquake, saying that over the course of two decades he failed to prepare the country for the inevitable. Experts point to lax enforcement of building codes as a major reason why this week's quakes were so deadly. But with less than 100 days before the election, Erdogan's rivals have yet to put forth a candidate to run against him.

            The memory of how Bulent Ecevit, the late prime minister, was undone by his poor handling of financial and natural disasters two decades ago must be on Erdogan's mind as he tries to contain the twin problems he faces today, analysts say.

            The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck on Feb. 6 was followed nine hours later by another powerful quake, killing more than 24,000 people in both Turkey and Syria. 

            The devastation spreads across a wide swath of Turkey, affecting 10 provinces in the country's southeast, and it has strained the ability of domestic and foreign crews to quickly execute rescue efforts. In the first few days after the quake, Turkish television and social media showed people waiting helplessly beside piles of debris in frigid conditions, or using their bare hands to claw through rubble. 

            “We’ll still have to see the outcome of the relief efforts, whether subzero temperatures continue, casualties increase, whether international assistance which is flowing could make a difference,” said Cagaptay.

            Erdogan, who toured the region this week, conceded shortcomings in the initial stages of the response but insisted that everything was now under control.

            “If the disaster response is strong, the ruling administration will be rewarded, likely in the polls — if it is poor, the opposite,” Timothy Ash, an analyst at BlueBay Asset Management in London, wrote in an email.

            Ecevit blamed the poor response after the 1999 quake that killed some 18,000 people on the vastness of the destruction. Similarly, Erdogan said the response to this week's quake — which he described as the “strongest in the history of this geography” — has been hampered by winter weather and the destruction of a key airport, making it difficult to quickly reach people trapped in the rubble. 

            “It is not possible to be prepared for such a disaster,” Erdogan said, promising that “we will not leave any of our citizens uncared for.”

            While the bumpy quake response so far hasn't been great for Erdogan's reputation, analysts say there is time for him to turn things around before the election set for May 14.

            “He has the levers of state at his command and Turkish politics was hardly a level playing field before the earthquake,” Hamish Kinnear, Middle East and North Africa analyst for risk-intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said in an email.

            Right after the quake, Erdogan declared a three-month state of emergency, giving him the power to “lavish public spending” in those areas, said Kinnear, who believes an Erdogan victory is still likely.

            Erdogan has promised to donate 10,000 Turkish lira ($530) to people affected by the quake and to subsidize their rent. On Friday he said an additional 100 billion lira ($5.3 billion) would be allocated for post-quake efforts.

            In the last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2018, Erdogan and his alliance for parliament overwhelmingly won in seven of the 10 provinces devastated by this week’s earthquakes. And in recent years he has pushed through changes that eliminated checks and balances between different branches of government, concentrating more power within the presidency.

            In Turkey, freedom of expression is limited and the government largely controls the media, which has meant television stations mostly show scenes of “miracle rescues,” while appearing to censor scenes of hardship.

            In the face of crushing inflation, Erdogan has increased the minimum wage, pensions and civil-servant salaries. While these steps may have been popular with voters, others have earned him severe criticism.

            For example, he has insisted on fighting inflation by repeatedly lowering interest rates to stimulate growth — a strategy that mainstream economists around the world have said only makes the problem worse. 

            For now, all eyes are on the earthquake response.

            In the hard-hit city of Adiyaman, Ahmet Aydin, a resident who lost six relatives as well as his home, his shop and his car in the earthquake, complained about the slow emergency response. But he said he would never stop supporting Erdogan — highlighting the Turkish leader's potentially lasting appeal.

            “We trust our president,” Aydin said. “He would never leave us alone, he would never leave us hungry or thirsty. May Allah protect him.”

            Erdogan's political rivals tell a different story.

            This week, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, blamed the devastation on Erdogan’s two-decade rule.

            “Let me be very clear; if there one person responsible for this process, it is Erdogan,” Kilicdaroglu said in a video address. “For 20 years, this government has not prepared the country for an earthquake.”

            He also accused the government of misspending taxes imposed in the wake of the 1999 quakes that were intended to prepare the country for future disasters.

            As the death toll continues to rise with each passing day, Erdogan says the country’s leaders should strive to be above the political fray.

            “This time is one of unity and standing together,” he said on Wednesday. “I cannot tolerate how in a time like this such filthy and negative campaigns are led for the sake of basic, political interests.”

            Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power 20 years ago riding a wave of public outrage toward the previous government's handling of a deadly earthquake.Now, three months away from an election, Erdogan’s political future could hinge on how the public perceives his government's response to a similarly devastating natural disaster.“It is going to be a big challenge for Erdogan, who has established a brand for himself as an autocratic figure but an efficient one that gets the job done,” said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkey expert at the Washington Institute and the author of several books on Erdogan.The aftermath of a massive earthquake isn't the only parallel to the election of 2002. Back then, Turkey was in the midst of a financial crisis that was punishing its economy.Today, Turkey's economy is being hammered by skyrocketing inflation, and Erdogan has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the problem, which has left millions of poor and middle class people struggling to make ends meet.Erdogan's political rivals have already begun criticizing his government's response to the earthquake, saying that over the course of two decades he failed to prepare the country for the inevitable. Experts point to lax enforcement of building codes as a major reason why this week's quakes were so deadly. But with less than 100 days before the election, Erdogan's rivals have yet to put forth a candidate to run against him.The memory of how Bulent Ecevit, the late prime minister, was undone by his poor handling of financial and natural disasters two decades ago must be on Erdogan's mind as he tries to contain the twin problems he faces today, analysts say.The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck on Feb. 6 was followed nine hours later by another powerful quake, killing more than 24,000 people in both Turkey and Syria.The devastation spreads across a wide swath of Turkey, affecting 10 provinces in the country's southeast, and it has strained the ability of domestic and foreign crews to quickly execute rescue efforts. In the first few days after the quake, Turkish television and social media showed people waiting helplessly beside piles of debris in frigid conditions, or using their bare hands to claw through rubble.“We’ll still have to see the outcome of the relief efforts, whether subzero temperatures continue, casualties increase, whether international assistance which is flowing could make a difference,” said Cagaptay.Erdogan, who toured the region this week, conceded shortcomings in the initial stages of the response but insisted that everything was now under control.“If the disaster response is strong, the ruling administration will be rewarded, likely in the polls — if it is poor, the opposite,” Timothy Ash, an analyst at BlueBay Asset Management in London, wrote in an email.Ecevit blamed the poor response after the 1999 quake that killed some 18,000 people on the vastness of the destruction. Similarly, Erdogan said the response to this week's quake — which he described as the “strongest in the history of this geography” — has been hampered by winter weather and the destruction of a key airport, making it difficult to quickly reach people trapped in the rubble.“It is not possible to be prepared for such a disaster,” Erdogan said, promising that “we will not leave any of our citizens uncared for.”While the bumpy quake response so far hasn't been great for Erdogan's reputation, analysts say there is time for him to turn things around before the election set for May 14.“He has the levers of state at his command and Turkish politics was hardly a level playing field before the earthquake,” Hamish Kinnear, Middle East and North Africa analyst for risk-intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said in an email.Right after the quake, Erdogan declared a three-month state of emergency, giving him the power to “lavish public spending” in those areas, said Kinnear, who believes an Erdogan victory is still likely.Erdogan has promised to donate 10,000 Turkish lira ($530) to people affected by the quake and to subsidize their rent.

They have also been supplying goods to humanitarian organizations for distribution to the survivors, who have to deal with the danger of aftershocks as well as with chilly winter weather.The response from the Taiwanese public was so massive the Turkish trade office had to call an end to the collection of goods four days earlier than originally planned, the Liberty Times reported. The office thanked the public for its assistance and generosity, and apologized for having to stop the action.Turkish representative Muhammed Burdibek said he had almost been moved to tears, but the inflow of donations was close to exceeding the office’s capacity to handle the supplies, per CNA. The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation was entrusted with accepting donations in the form of clothing, blankets, and other materials at a center in Taipei City’s Neihu District.Political leaders including President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) donated one month’s salary to the relief effort, while more than 100 Taiwanese rescue workers arrived in Turkey to assist with the search for survivors.",2023/02/11,1835,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807286,Kansas GOP picks election conspiracy promoter as new leader,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Republicans on Saturday narrowly picked an activist who has promoted unfounded election conspiracies and promised a shakeup to lead the Kansas GOP for the next two years, following weeks of infighting that mirrors the acrimony in the party across the U.S.

            Within 30 minutes of the change in the Kansas Republican Party's leadership, its state committee reviewed a resolution demanding that the U.S. House impeach President Joe Biden for “tyranny” over comments he and his aides made in the summer of 2021 decrying misinformation about coronavirus vaccines spreading within the GOP. The committee tabled the resolution until its next meeting. 

            The Kansas state committee elected Mike Brown, who has long been active in the GOP in the Kansas City area, as its new chair through the 2024 elections. The vote came three months after Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly narrowly won reelection and the only Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, won another term handily in her Kansas City-area district.











            The Kansas party's retiring chair, Mike Kuckelman, and its two other Republican National Committee members supported RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel when she won reelection last month. But Brown called on McDaniel to resign in December, and he said Saturday that the national GOP is seeing an internal “uprising” from members still upset over COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. 

            “The RNC needs to be paying very close attention to that,"" Brown said. ""It is the future of our party.” 

            Last year, Brown ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for Kansas secretary of state. Both he and his opponent, Helen Van Etten, a longtime Topeka activist and former RNC member, promised to revive the Kansas party. But Brown asked fellow Republicans whether they were happy with the results of the past two governor's races, won by Kelly, and Davids' election victories.

            The vote — with Brown prevailing 90-88 — occurred against the backdrop of the GOP's unexpectedly poor showing in the 2022 midterms, when it won fewer than expected U.S. House seats and failed to recapture a U.S. Senate majority. 

            In Kansas, the GOP holds a voter registration advantage, which means that Democrats win big races by attracting votes from moderate Republicans and independent voters, while Republicans generally prevail when the party is unified. 

            “We need to have more unity,” state Rep. Patrick Penn, a Wichita Republican, told fellow GOP committee members. “That's the crux of it.”

            Some Republicans framed the contest between Brown and Van Etten as a fight between an anti-establishment wing and the establishment.

            The infighting ahead of Saturday's vote was especially intense in Johnson County, in the Kansas City area, the state's most populous county and home for both Brown and retiring State Chair Mike Kuckelman. The county's affluent suburbs once were GOP strongholds, but since 2018, they've become conspicuously more Democratic — and have been crucial to Kelly's and Davids' victories. 

            The Johnson County GOP's new chair, a Brown ally concerned about the county's “purple creep,” told GOP state committee members that Kuckelman had been “absolutely abhorrent” in his treatment of Brown. Kuckelman fired back with several emails, including one accusing Brown of being soft in opposing abortion and supporting gun rights. 

            With the Republican National Committee, McDaniel overcame opposition from the ultra-Make America Great Again wing of the party despite having been picked for the job in 2016 by former President Donald Trump.

            
                In Michigan, two statewide GOP candidates who denied President Joe Biden's election victory in 2020 were seeking party offices ahead of a convention next weekend. In Nebraska last year, Republicans who support Trump fired the state chair during a tumultuous convention following a Trump-backed candidate's loss in the GOP primary for governor.

            Brown has promoted unfounded theories that Trump's supporters have used to bolster the former president's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. He is a construction contractor who served on the Johnson County Commission before losing his seat in 2020. 

            Brown lost the GOP primary for secretary of state to Republican incumbent Scott Schwab, who has vouched for the integrity of Kansas elections. 

            Van Etten, a retired audiologist, served on the RNC from 2008 to 2020. She also is a former member of the state board that oversees Kansas' higher education system. 

            She promised state committee members a “very aggressive” program of building local party organizations: “We're ready and willing to unite the party.""

            One supporter, conservative Kansas City-area economist, researcher and consultant Michael Austin, said: “We need experience. We need connections.""

            During the state committee meeting, Kuckelman defended current party leaders’ record, noting that the party has no debt.

            Kim Borchers, a longtime Topeka activist who serves on the RNC, defended McDaniel and pushed back pointedly on complaints against the party establishment. She had the state committee members with more than five years’ of experience stand.

            “Welcome to the establishment,” she said. “I call that commitment.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807325,Jadeja disciplined by ICC for violating code of conduct,"NAGPUR, India (AP) — Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was fined 25% of his match fees and given one demerit point Saturday for breaching the ICC’s code of conduct during the first test against Australia.

            The incident occurred on day one, when Jadeja was caught applying an ointment on the index finger of his bowling hand.

            As seen on the televised broadcast, the spinner took the ointment from teammate Mohammed Siraj and applied it to his finger without permission from the on-field umpires.











            Jadeja later admitted the offense in a post-day’s play hearing with match referee Andy Pycroft, who was satisfied that the applied cream was not used to alter the condition of the match ball.

            The one demerit point will stay on Jadeja’s disciplinary record for 24 months. Two or more demerit points across 24 months can lead to international suspensions.

            
                India won the first test on day three by beating Australia by an innings and 132 runs. Jadeja won the player of the match award for picking seven wickets and scoring a half-century.

            He had picked 5-47 during the first Australian innings when the incident took place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807326,Nearly 1 million French march in 4th day of pension protests,"PARIS (AP) — Police were out in force across France on Saturday as protesters held a sometimes restive fourth round of nationwide demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to reform the country's pension system. 

            Over 960,000 people marched in Paris, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Nantes and other cities, according to the Interior Ministry. Protesters hoped to keep up the pressure on the government to back down, and further action is planned for Feb. 16.

            In the French capital, authorities counted some 93,000 participants, the most to demonstrate in Paris against the pension changes since the protests started last month.











            The weekend demonstrations drew young people and others opposed to the pension proposals who weren’t able to attend the previous three days of action, all held on weekdays. 

            This time, though, rail worker strikes did not accompany the demonstrations, allowing trains and the Paris Metro to run Saturday. However, an unexpected strike by air traffic controllers meant that up to half of flights to and from Paris’ second largest airport, Orly, were canceled Saturday afternoon.

            In Paris, some workers and students who wanted to voice opposition attended the protests for the first time, owing to heavy weekday workloads. 

            “We often hear that we should be too young to care, but with rising inflation, soaring electricity prices, this reform will impact our families,” Elisa Haddad, 18. said. “It is my first demonstration because I couldn’t attend with uni. It is important that the voice of (France’s) parents and students is heard.” 

            French lawmakers began a rowdy debate earlier this week on the pension bill to raise the minimum retirement age for a full state pension from 62 to 64. It’s the flagship legislation of Macron’s second term.

            Saturday’s protests featured flashes of unrest. One car and several trash bins were set on fire on a central Parisian boulevard as police charged the crowd and dispersed protesters with tear gas. Paris police said officers they arrested eight people for infractions ranging from possession of a firearm to vandalism. 

            Some demonstrators walked as families through the French capital's Place de la Republique and carried emotional banners. “I don’t want my parents to die at work,” read one, held by a teenage boy.

            The protests are a crucial test both for Macron and his opponents. The government has insisted it’s determined to push through Macron’s election pledge to reform France’s generous pension system. Of the 38 member nations of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, France is among countries that spend the most years in retirement.

            The president has called the reforms “indispensable” for ensuring the long-term survival of the country’s pension system and noted that workers in neighboring countries retire years later.

            Despite opinion polls consistently showing growing opposition to the reform and his own popularity shrinking, Macron insisted that he’s living up to a key campaign pledge he made when he swept to power in 2017 and before his April 2022 reelection.

            His government is now facing a harsh political battle in parliament that could span weeks or months.

            Strong popular resentment will strengthen efforts by labor unions and left-wing legislators to try to block the bill.

            Unions issued a joint statement Saturday, calling the government “deaf” and demanding French officials scrap the bill. They threatened to cause a nationwide “shutdown” from March 7, if their demands were not met.

            During the previous day of protests four days ago, over 750,000 people marched in many French cities, significantly fewer than on the previous two protest days in January in which over a million people took to the streets.

""Why is it called the meat grinder? Because the Ukrainian army is sending more and more and more units.""""It is probably too early to say that we are close,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807347,Wagner owner says war in Ukraine could drag on for years,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.

            Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.

            The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.











            Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the “special military operation” will continue until its goals are fulfilled.

            The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.

            Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that Russia could launch a new broad offensive to try to turn the tide of the conflict as the war approaches the one-year mark. But Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Chernyak, told Kyiv Post that “Russian command does not have enough resources for large-scale offensive actions.”

            “The main goal of Russian troops remains to achieve at least some tactical success in eastern Ukraine,” he said.

            Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance.

            
                As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.

            On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure. High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas.

            Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was “difficult but controllable,” adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas. Head of Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom Petro Kotin said Saturday that more power will come into the country's energy system after two nuclear reactors have been repaired.

            Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.

            The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday. The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening.

            Russia's Defense Ministry said that Friday's strikes hit all the designated targets, halting the operation of Ukraine's defense factories and blocking the delivery of supplies of Western weapons and ammunition. The claim couldn't be independently verified.

            Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region. The grainy video showed a fast-moving object on the surface of the water approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast.

            The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified, but the Ukrainian military on Saturday confirmed the use of sea drones by Russian forces.

            Ukraine’s military chief Zaluzhnyi said in an online statement that he has expressed concern about the use of such drones in a phone conversation with the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, on Saturday, adding that it “poses a threat to civilian navigation in the Black Sea.”

            The attack marks the first combat use of a sea drone by Russia in the conflict. Igor Korotchenko, a retired colonel of the Russian armed forces who frequently comments on the conflict on Russian state TV, noted Saturday that such drones should be equipped with a more powerful load of explosives to inflict more significant damage.

            The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.

            In other developments, the governor of Russia's Kursk region along the border with Ukraine said that a group of construction workers was hit by Ukrainian shelling that killed one of them and wounded another.

            The governor of another Russian border region, Belgorod, reported the shelling of the town of Shebekino, saying it damaged two buildings but no one was hurt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807349,East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95,"BERLIN (AP) — Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died. He was 95.

            Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.

            Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification.











            “The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his,” the Left wrote on Twitter. “That will remain his political legacy.”

            During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

            A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 — days after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

            When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure. But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own. The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest.

            Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification. In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual ""united fatherland"" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin.

            Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support.

            The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl. Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

            Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS — the predecessor of today‘s opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.

            Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.

            In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden. It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine.

            Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans. His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.

            Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party.

            “Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist,” tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group. “Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed.”BERLIN (AP) — Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died. He was 95.Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification.“The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his,” the Left wrote on Twitter. “That will remain his political legacy.”During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807351,"Survivors still being found as quake death toll tops 28,000","LATAKIA, Syria (AP) — Ibrahim Zakaria lost track of time drifting into and out of consciousness while trapped for nearly five days in the rubble of his home following the massive earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria this week.

            The 23-year-old cellphone shop worker from the Syrian town of Jableh survived on dirty drips of water and eventually lost hope that he’d be saved.

            “I said I am dead and it will be impossible for me to live again,” Zakaria, who was rescued Friday night, told The Associated Press on Saturday from his bed at a hospital in the coastal city of Latakia where his 60-year-old mother, Duha Nurallah, was also recovering.











            Five days after two powerful earthquakes hours apart caused thousands of buildings to collapse, killing more than 28,000 people and leaving millions homeless, rescuers were still pulling unlikely survivors from the ruins — one of them just 7 months old.

            Although each rescue elicited hugs and shouts of “Allahu akbar!” — “God is great!” — from the weary men and women working tirelessly in the freezing temperatures to save lives, they were the exception in a region blanketed by grief, desperation and mounting frustration.

            More than a dozen survivors were rescued Saturday, including a family in Kahramanmaras, the Turkish city closest to the epicenter of Monday’s quake. Crews there helped 12-year-old Nehir Naz Narli to safety before going back for her parents.

            In Gaziantep province, which borders Syria, a family of five was rescued from a demolished building in the city of Nurdagi, and a man and his 3-year-old daughter were pulled from debris in the town of Islahiye, television network HaberTurk reported. A 7-year-old girl was also rescued in Hatay province.

            In Elbistan, a district in Kahramanmaras province, 20-year-old Melisa Ulku and another person were saved from the rubble 132 hours after the quake struck. Before she was brought to safety, police asked onlookers not to cheer or clap so as not to interfere with nearby rescue efforts.

            Turkish TV station NTV reported that a 44-year-old man in Iskenderun, in Hatay province, was rescued 138 hours into his ordeal. Crying rescuers called it a miracle, with one saying they weren't expecting to find anyone alive but as they were digging, they saw his eyes and he said his name. In the same province, NTV also reported that a baby boy named Hamza was found alive in Antakya 140 hours after the quake. Some details of his rescue, including how he survived so long, weren't immediately clear.

            Not every attempt ended happily. Zeynep Kahraman, who was brought out of the rubble after a spectacular rescue that took 50 hours, died at a hospital overnight. The ISAR German team who rescued her were shocked and saddened.

            “It is important that the family could say goodbye, that they could see each other one more time, that they could hug each other again,” a member of the rescue team told German TV news channel n-tv.

            The rescues came amid growing frustration over the Turkish government's response to the earthquake, which has killed 24,617 people and injured at least 80,000 people in Turkey alone.

            
                Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged earlier in the week that the initial response was hampered by the extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure that made it difficult to reach some points. He also said the worst-affected area was 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and was home to 13.5 million people in Turkey.

            That has meant rescue crews have had to pick and choose how and where to help.

            During a tour of quake-damaged cities Saturday, Erdogan said a disaster of this scope was rare and again referred to it as the “disaster of the century.”

            But the challenges facing aid efforts were of little comfort to those waiting for help.

            In Antakya, the capital of Hatay province, scattered rescue crews were still hard at work but many residents had left by Saturday. Among those who stayed were people with family still buried. Many of them had been camping in the streets for days and sleeping in cars.

            Acting on a tip, a rescue team from Hong Kong found three survivors under a building near the city's center on Saturday, said Gallant Wong, the group's spokesperson.

            But Bulent Cifcifli, a local man, said he has been waiting for days for crews to pull his mother's body from her collapsed home. He said rescuers were working to retrieve her body at one point, but they were called to another location because they suspected there were survivors.

            “Six days later, we don’t know how many are still under the rubble, and how many are dead or alive,” Cifcifli said, blaming a lack of heavy equipment.

            Yazi al-Ali, a Syrian refugee who came to Antakya from Reyhanli, has been living in a tent as she waits for crews to find her mother, two sisters, including one who was pregnant, and their families. At one point, she stood over the rubble of the home in Antakya's old city center where she believes her pregnant sister was buried and, in a cracking voice, shouted her sister's name, “Rajha!”

            “No one is answering to us, and no one comes to look,” she said. “They have stopped us from looking ourselves. I don’t know why.”

            
                Even though experts say trapped people can live for a week or more, the odds of finding additional survivors are quickly waning. Rescuers were shifting to thermal cameras to help identify life amid the rubble, a sign that any remaining survivors could be too weak to call for help.

            As aid continued to arrive Saturday, a 99-member group from the Indian Army’s medical assistance team began treating the injured in a temporary field hospital in the southern city of Iskenderun, where a main hospital was demolished.

            One man, Sukru Canbulat, was wheeled into the hospital, his left leg badly injured with deep bruising, contusions and lacerations.

            Wincing in pain, he said he was rescued from his collapsed apartment building in nearby Antakya within hours of the quake. But after receiving basic first aid, he was released without getting proper treatment.

            “I buried (everyone that I lost), then I came here,” Canbulat said, counting his dead relatives. “My daughter is dead, my sibling died, my aunt and her daughter died, and the wife of her son” who was 8½ months pregnant.

            A large makeshift graveyard was under construction in Antakya's outskirts on Saturday. Backhoes and bulldozers dug pits in the field as trucks and ambulances loaded with black body bags arrived continuously. Soldiers directing traffic on the busy adjacent road warned motorists not to take photos.

            The hundreds of graves, spaced no more than 3 feet (a meter) apart, were marked with simple wooden planks set vertically in the ground.

            A worker with Turkey’s Ministry of Religious Affairs who didn't wish to be identified because of orders not to share information with the media said that around 800 bodies were brought to the cemetery Friday, its first day of operation. By midday Saturday, he said, as many as 2,000 had been buried.

            The disaster compounded suffering in a region beset by Syria’s 12-year civil war, which has displaced millions of people within the country and left them dependent on aid. The fighting sent millions more to seek refuge in Turkey.

            The conflict has isolated many areas of Syria and complicated efforts to get aid in. The United Nations said the first earthquake-related aid convoy crossed from Turkey into northwestern Syria on Friday, the day after an aid shipment planned before the disaster arrived. The U.N. refugee agency estimated that as many as 5.3 million people have been left homeless in Syria alone.

            The death toll in Syria’s northwestern rebel-held region has reached 2,166, according to the rescue worker group the White Helmets. The overall death toll in Syria stood at 3,553 on Saturday, though the 1,387 deaths reported for government-held parts of the country hadn’t been updated in days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807354,Iran marks anniversary of Islamic Revolution amid protests,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran on Saturday celebrated the 44th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution amid nationwide anti-government protests and heightened tensions with the West.

            Thousands of Iranians marched through major streets and squares decorated with flags, balloons and placards with revolutionary and religious slogans. The military put on display its Emad and Sejjil ballistic missiles and cruise missiles as well as its Shahed-136 and Mohajer drones.

            
                Protesters began pouring into the streets in September after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman detained by the country’s morality police. Those demonstrations, initially focused on Iran’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, soon morphed into calls for a new revolution.











            In a speech at Azadi Square in the capital Tehran, President Ebrahim Raisi referred to the protests as a project by Iran's enemies aimed at stopping the nation from continuing its achievements. 

            Raisi called the celebration “epic” and a show of “national integrity” while praising post-revolution achievements in the country.

            The remarks prompted the crowd to chant “Death to the U.S.”

            Meanwhile, Telewebion, a web TV service affiliated with Iranian state TV, was briefly hacked during Raisi's speech, Iranian media reported. The khabaronline.ir news website said the interruption lasted 19 seconds .

            “Edalate Ali” or “The Justice of Ali,” hackers group in a 44-sencond video published on Twitter invited people to take part in nationwide protests next week and urged Iranians to withdraw their money from their banks.

            Chants including “Death to Khamenei"" and ""Death to the Islamic Republic” could be heard on the video and a masked person with a woman’s voice read the message. The group previously hacked into the notorious Evin prison and other government facilities.

            The anniversary comes after two years in which celebrations were largely limited to vehicles due to the pandemic that killed more than 140,000 people, in Iran according to official numbers — the highest national death toll in the Middle East.

            Processions in Tehran on Saturday started out from several points and converged at Azadi Square. TV showed crowds in many cities and towns and said hundreds of thousands of people participated.

            The celebration was a show of power to the protesters. State television refers to the demonstrations as a “foreign-backed riot” rather than homegrown frustration over the death of Amini. Anger also has spread over the collapse of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar and Tehran’s arming Russia with bomb-carrying drones in its war on Ukraine, which has also angered the West. Iran says it gave the drones to Russia before the war.

            The Iranian government has not offered an overall death toll or number of individuals it has arrested. However, activists outside of the country say at least 528 people have been killed and 19,600 people detained in the crackdown that followed.

            Last week, Iran’s state media said the supreme leader ordered an amnesty or reduction in prison sentences for “tens of thousands” of people detained in during the protests, acknowledging for the first time the scale of the crackdown.

            The decree by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, part of a yearly pardoning the supreme leader does before the anniversary, came as authorities have yet to say how many people they detained in the demonstrations.

            Referring to the amnesty, Raisi on Saturday urged those who were “deceived by the enemy” to “return to the nation"" and promised his administration would show mercy on them, too

            Crowds waved Iranian flags, chanted slogans and carried placards with traditional anti-West slogans like “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.” Some burned flags of the U.S. and Israel, a ritual in pro-government rallies.

            The Islamic Revolution began with widespread unrest in Iran over the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah, terminally and secretly ill with cancer, fled Iran in January 1979. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini then returned from exile and the government fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of mass demonstrations and confrontations between protesters and security forces.

            Later in April, Iranians voted to become an Islamic Republic, a Shiite theocracy with Khomeini as the country’s first supreme leader, with final say on all matters of state.

            Months later, when the U.S. allowed the shah into the country for cancer treatment in New York, anger boiled over in Tehran leading to the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by militant students. The subsequent hostage crisis kindled decades of enmity.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran on Saturday celebrated the 44th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution amid nationwide anti-government protests and heightened tensions with the West.Thousands of Iranians marched through major streets and squares decorated with flags, balloons and placards with revolutionary and religious slogans.

However, activists outside of the country say at least 528 people have been killed and 19,600 people detained in the crackdown that followed.Last week, Iran’s state media said the supreme leader ordered an amnesty or reduction in prison sentences for “tens of thousands” of people detained in during the protests, acknowledging for the first time the scale of the crackdown.The decree by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, part of a yearly pardoning the supreme leader does before the anniversary, came as authorities have yet to say how many people they detained in the demonstrations.Referring to the amnesty, Raisi on Saturday urged those who were “deceived by the enemy” to “return to the nation"" and promised his administration would show mercy on them, tooCrowds waved Iranian flags, chanted slogans and carried placards with traditional anti-West slogans like “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.” Some burned flags of the U.S. and Israel, a ritual in pro-government rallies.The Islamic Revolution began with widespread unrest in Iran over the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah, terminally and secretly ill with cancer, fled Iran in January 1979. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini then returned from exile and the government fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of mass demonstrations and confrontations between protesters and security forces.Later in April, Iranians voted to become an Islamic Republic, a Shiite theocracy with Khomeini as the country’s first supreme leader, with final say on all matters of state.Months later, when the U.S. allowed the shah into the country for cancer treatment in New York, anger boiled over in Tehran leading to the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by militant students. The subsequent hostage crisis kindled decades of enmity.",2023/02/11,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807355,Mallorca's Hells Angels trial awaits a verdict in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — The trial of 49 alleged members of the Hells Angels bikers gang in the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca, most of them charged with offenses linked to organized crime, has been adjourned to await a verdict, after three weeks of sessions in Madrid's High Court.

            Among the most prominent defendants is German national Frank Hanebuth, who is charged with links to organized crime, money laundering and firearms possession. Prosecutors are seeking a 12-year prison sentence for him, as they consider him a key individual in the scheme that moved his group from Hannover to Mallorca after pressure in Germany increased.

            Hanebuth was the only defendant who used his right to a final statement before the trial was adjourned Friday evening, and he used it to insist that his organization was democratic.











            “We are not a criminal organization. We are the only biker club in the world that is based on a democratic structure. That means one person, one vote,"" he said.

            He denied that there was a president of the group at national or international level, claiming that each chapter is independent. 

            His lawyer had previously requested the court during the closing arguments to acquit Hanebuth. 

            Prosecutors believe the bikers engaged in organized crime and charged them with offenses including drug trafficking, money laundering, prostitution and extortion.

            Thirty-five of the 49 defendants took plea deals on the first day of the trial, reducing their sentences to fines. The highest sentence request among those who did not take the deal is for the group's alleged treasurer, Abdelghani Youssafi; prosecutors asked for him to be sentenced to 28 1/2 years. 

            The prosecutor’s final indictment reduced some of the sentence requests, noting that the trial has had significantly slow progress since the police operation that initiated it happened almost 10 years ago.MADRID (AP) — The trial of 49 alleged members of the Hells Angels bikers gang in the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca, most of them charged with offenses linked to organized crime, has been adjourned to await a verdict, after three weeks of sessions in Madrid's High Court.Among the most prominent defendants is German national Frank Hanebuth, who is charged with links to organized crime, money laundering and firearms possession.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807394,"Finnish president wants Finland, Sweden in NATO by summer","HELSINKI (AP) — The Finnish president said in an interview published Saturday that he trusts that Finland and Sweden will be admitted into NATO by July, and hinted that he wants the United States to put pressure on Turkey to approve their membership bids. 

            If the issue drags on, the entire process of admitting new members into the military alliance will become questionable, President Sauli Niinistö said in an interview with the Finnish news agency STT. 

            “If it doesn’t happen by the Vilnius meeting, why should it happen afterwards?” Niinistö said. 











            Lithuania is set to host a NATO summit in the Baltic nation's capital on July 11-12.

            NATO requires unanimous approval from its existing members to admit new ones. Turkey and Hungary are the only nations in the 30-member military alliance that haven’t formally endorsed Sweden and Finland’s accession. 

            While Hungary has pledged to do so in February, Turkey hasn’t indicated willingness to ratify the two countries’ accession any time soon. Niinistö stressed that the final Turkish decision is up to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

            “I think that under no circumstances will he allow himself to be influenced by any public pressure,” Niinistö said. ” But if something opens up during the bilateral talks between Turkey and the United States, it might have an impact.”

            Turkey has been holding off approving Sweden and Finland’s membership into NATO as it has been infuriated, among other things, by a recent series of demonstrations in Stockholm by activists who have burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy and hanged an effigy of Erdogan. 

            In January, Ankara indefinitely postponed a key meeting in Brussels that would have discussed the two Nordic countries’ entry into NATO.

            Niinistö said that Finland and Sweden heard many encouraging statements from NATO last spring — the Nordic duo had stated their intention to join NATO in May — about smooth and painless progress of membership. 

            He said that did not happen, adding that the delay isn't only a headache for the two applicant countries. 

            “I can see that this has already become a problem for NATO. Clearly, NATO countries have also been surprised,” Niinistö said.HELSINKI (AP) — The Finnish president said in an interview published Saturday that he trusts that Finland and Sweden will be admitted into NATO by July, and hinted that he wants the United States to put pressure on Turkey to approve their membership bids.If the issue drags on, the entire process of admitting new members into the military alliance will become questionable, President Sauli Niinistö said in an interview with the Finnish news agency STT.“If it doesn’t happen by the Vilnius meeting, why should it happen afterwards?” Niinistö said.Lithuania is set to host a NATO summit in the Baltic nation's capital on July 11-12.NATO requires unanimous approval from its existing members to admit new ones.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807399,Panel scolds Wisconsin justice for remarks in Trump case,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judicial oversight commission has dismissed a complaint against a liberal-leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court justice who accused an attorney for former President Donald Trump of making racist contentions and trying to protect his “king” in a case challenging the 2020 election results in the battleground state.

            Judicial complaints are confidential under Wisconsin law but Justice Jill Karofsky released documents to The Associated Press on Saturday that show a retired attorney in Maryland filed one against her with the Wisconsin Judicial Commission two years ago. The commission decided in November 2022 not to discipline her but warned her to remain neutral and avoid making sarcastic remarks from the bench. 

            Karofsky's attorney remained defiant, telling the commission in a letter Tuesday that Karofsky was trying to save the U.S. government and accusing the panel of allowing itself to become a political weapon. 











            “The Judicial Code (sic) requires judges to act with impartiality towards the parties, but it does not require a judge to turn a blind-eye to dangerous, bad-faith conduct by a lawyer or litigant,” Karofsky said in an email to the AP, quoting a passage from one of her attorney's responses to the commission. “It is beyond reason to read the Code to require judges to be mouse-like quiet when parties are arguing in favor of a slow-motion coup.”

            Trump filed suit in Wisconsin in December 2020 after a recount confirmed Democrat Joe Biden had won the state by about 21,000 votes. The filing was one of scores of lawsuits Trump filed across multiple states in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the election results and remain in office.

            The Wisconsin lawsuit asked the state Supreme Court to toss out about 171,000 absentee ballots cast in Dane and Milwaukee counties. The conservative-leaning court ultimately rejected the lawsuit by a 4-3 vote, with swing Justice Brian Hagedorn casting the deciding vote to uphold Biden's victory in the battleground state. 

            Maryland attorney Fletcher Thompson filed a complaint against Karofsky in January 2021 accusing her of being hostile toward Trump attorney Jim Troupis. He noted that during oral arguments Karofsky told Troupis that the lawsuit “smacks of racism” because it sought to toss out absentee ballots in Wisconsin's two most diverse counties. 

            Thompson added that Karofsky later told Troupis that he wanted the court to overturn the election results “so that your king can stay in power” and said that suggesting the election was marred by fraud was “nothing short of shameful.""

            Thompson accused Karofsky of being discourteous and inappropriately launching personal attacks against Troupis. He said her remarks revealed a political and racial bias. He noted that Trump endorsed Karofsky's opponent, Daniel Kelly, during their race in spring 2020. 

            Karofsky attorney Stacie Rosenzweig admonished the judicial commission in her Feb. 7 letter for letting partisan actors “hijack the (judicial) disciplinary system, in an attempt to silence a justice who rightfully tried to stop frivolous and dangerous arguments that undermined our democracy.”

            “We believe the Commission risks setting a dangerous precedent,” Rosenzweig wrote. “By allowing the Commission to be weaponized in this fashion, the Commission became a pawn of those determined to undermine an independent judiciary.”

            Thompson said in a telephone interview on Saturday that he wasn't aware the commission had decided not to discipline Karfosky. He said he wished the commission had taken action against her, but he wasn't disappointed with the outcome since he didn't expect the commission would even investigate when he filed his complaint. 

            But he said he was stunned that Rosenzweig accused the panel of being a political pawn. He said he's just a retired attorney who watched the oral arguments on YouTube and he has no ties to Trump or Trump's campaign.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807407,"Fundraisers for Syria, Turkey earthquake try to deliver aid","NEW YORK (AP) — Humanitarian groups working in southern Turkey and northwest Syria warn that Monday's earthquake will have a “long tail” — a wide range of needs that will require donations for months, or even years, after the rescue and recovery missions end.

            
                Among the worst in recent history, the 7.8 magnitude earthquake has killed at least 23,200 in the region and left tens of thousands more homeless, with thousands taking refuge in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centers. Humanitarian access to northern Syria is complicated by the civil war, while sending funds can be blocked or slowed by U.S. sanctions, despite an exemption for relief efforts. The political environment in Turkey also poses challenges.

            The first shipment of earthquake-related aid crossed from Turkey into Syria's rebel-held enclave on Friday, a painful delay caused by damage and debris but also a U.N. policy that allows only for the use of a single crossing.











            However, some aid groups were already in place because of the country's 12-year civil war. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had 500 staff, two of whom were among those killed, stationed in northern Syria, where they’ve helped meet medical needs amid the conflict.

            “We were able to do a massive distribution of food and blankets to more than 500 families,” from one of their warehouses in the immediate aftermath of the quake, said Avril Benoît, executive director for MSF USA. Her organization keeps emergency supplies on hand in the case of major disasters.

            “There’s a long tail to an emergency like this, both for the injured from the earthquake, but also for chronic disease management, making sure they have access to their medications,” Benoît said.

            People will die without access to medications to control chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes, she said, adding that the earthquake will also take a mental toll.

            The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said they had 5,200 volunteers mobilized on both sides of the border, with the Turkish operation being more robust and better-equipped because of its longstanding program to support Syrian refugees.

            The IFRC's Syrian chapter works in areas controlled by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. and European countries. In the past year, little humanitarian aid has arrived from Damascus to the opposition-held north, which has suffered an outbreak of cholera and COVID-19 amid desperate living conditions for many. 

            The Syrian government said Friday that it would allow aid to reach all parts of the country, including the northern enclave, portions of which are controlled by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an insurgent group with ties to al-Qaida, as well as groups backed by Turkey and U.S.-backed Kurdish groups.

            The Syrian American Medical Society, which also provides significant medical services in northern Syria, has called for the opening of additional border crossings and has commissioned a legal analysis that argues the United Nations has the authority to use other crossings.

            “We think that the U.N. does not really need a Security Council resolution to proceed with this lifesaving medical relief,” said Dr. Basel Termanini, the medical society’s board chair. 

            Both MSF and SAMS said their supplies in the region are much depleted and need new shipments to continue to help.

            However, delivering supplies is difficult. There are major obstacles to moving machinery to places in Syria where it’s needed to remove rubble. Fuel shortages also constrain the supply of electricity, said Xavier Castellanos, undersecretary general for operations coordination of the IFRC.

            He called the situation in the region “the great storm,” with all the conditions reducing the amount of support to below the level that it should be.

            Castellanos, speaking from Geneva on Thursday, said the IFRC has received “soft” pledges from governments and a very small number of pledges from companies so far. The group will look to individual giving to make up for the shortfall because those funds can be used wherever they are needed most.

            The group has launched an appeal of 200 million Swiss Francs ($217 million) for responses in both countries and the national chapters of the IFRC are also collecting donations. He estimated the IFRC has received 7 million Swiss Francs ($7.6 million) so far in the early response to their appeals. 

            As of Thursday, MSF had $5.1 million come in from online donations along with a 10 million euros ($10.7 million) donation from the IKEA Foundation. SAMS had raised almost $2 million between a Facebook fundraiser and another on GiveSmart as of Friday. 

            The humanitarian organization Direct Relief immediately granted $100,000 to both SAMS and AKUT, a Turkish search and rescue team, and announced Friday that it was increasing its commitment to $3 million because of the strong support coming from donors from more than 70 countries. The Santa Barbara, California-based organization has shipped 42 pallets of supplies that it says will arrive by Sunday.

            Thomas Tighe, who leads Direct Relief, said his team has opened discussions with health care companies to source the medications and supplies that are mostly likely to be needed based on the limited information available and in coordination with other groups.

            “If you rush in too fast with the wrong quantities or the wrong material, you clog up the already compromised distribution channels, which then compounds the problem,” Tighe said.

            Amazon has pledged $600,000 to humanitarian organizations, including AKUT and Red Crescent of Türkiye, in addition to supplying emergency supplies for cold weather, the company said in an online post. The founder of yogurt giant Chobani, Hamdi Ulukaya, a native of Turkey, pledged $1 million to the Turkish Philanthropy Funds and promised to match another $1 million in donations. 

            The IFRC already is planning its recovery efforts over 12 months, with reoccurring assessments to define the scope. Trauma response and sanitation issues are among the top priorities. 

            Some Syrians in the affected area have already been displaced many times by the war as well as separated from their families with little support. Many now have lost whatever shelter they had acquired. 

            “Over 12 years, you can imagine the loss of hope that one would have,” said Benoît, of MSF, which also provides psychological first aid and will train people to provide it if there are not enough counselors. 

            “It’s essentially to help the person in a culturally appropriate way, whatever is resonant for them,” she said. “To get through the day. To to be able to function, to be able to feed their children.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807413,Bickering bogs down Capitol riot trial of Proud Boys leaders,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Capitol riot trial for Proud Boys leaders promised to be a historic showcase for some of the most compelling evidence of an alleged plot by far-right extremists to halt the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.

            One month into the trial, there have been plenty of fireworks, but mostly when the jury wasn’t in the courtroom.

            Lawyers representing the five Proud Boys charged with seditious conspiracy have repeatedly sparred with U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly during breaks in testimony. At least 10 times, those lawyers have argued in vain for him to declare a mistrial. 











            The judge regularly admonishes lawyers for interrupting him and has threatened to hold them in contempt if it continues. Two defense lawyers at one point floated the idea of withdrawing from the case if Kelly did not rule in their favor on evidentiary matters.

            The barrage of bickering has bogged down the proceedings in the federal courthouse, where the Capitol can be seen in the distance from some windows. One recent day in court, defense lawyer Norm Pattis compared the trial to visiting “Gilligan’s Island,"" the title and setting of the 1960s-era sitcom about a shipwrecked boat's crew and passengers.

            “It was supposed to be a three-hour tour, and people were stranded together for an infinite period while they worked out their interpersonal difficulties,” Pattis quipped. 

            The tension in the courtroom reflects the high stakes for the Justice Department and the defendants. It's one of the most serious cases to emerge from the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio is perhaps the highest profile person to be charged so far in the assault.

            The Proud Boys face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of seditious conspiracy. Acquittals on the rarely used charge — which strikes at the heart of what prosecutors say happened that day — would be a setback in the government's Jan. 6 investigation, which continues to grow two years later. 

            Tarrio and four lieutenants are accused of participating in a weekslong plot to keep Democrat Joe Biden out of the White House after he defeated then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Prosecutors say it culminated with Proud Boys mounting a coordinated assault on the Capitol alongside hundreds of other Trump supporters.

            Defense lawyers say there's no evidence that the Proud Boys plotted to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6. The lawyers claim prosecutors are mischaracterizing bellicose online banter as a violent plot. They tried unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Washington, arguing that there was no way their clients could get a fair trial in front of a District of Columbia jury. 

            The Proud Boys trial is on a pace to last several weeks longer than last year's landmark trial for Oath Keepers group leaders and members, who were charged in a separate Jan. 6 case. 

            In November, a jury convicted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and another leader of seditious conspiracy after three days of jury selection, 26 days of testimony and two days of closing arguments. A separate trial involving members of the Oath Keepers — who face a slew of charges, but not seditious conspiracy — also got underway this month. 

            Jury selection for the Proud Boys case lasted 12 days. After the trial's opening statements on Jan. 12, jurors have heard 16 days of testimony through Friday. Prosecutors are expected to rest their case in late February or early March before the defense team begins presenting testimony.

            A dozen of the first 14 prosecution witnesses in the Proud Boys trial have been FBI agents and other law enforcement officials. Jurors also have heard testimony from a former Proud Boys member who cut a plea deal with prosecutors and a British documentary filmmaker who was embedded with the Proud Boys on Jan. 6.

            Jurors are often kept waiting in the wings while defense lawyers challenge the admissibility of evidence. In one such exchange, Pattis urged Kelly to reconsider a ruling allowing prosecutors to introduce posts from the social media platform Parler.

            “We’re offering you a lifeline here because we think you erred,” Pattis told the judge.

            “Well, I’m offering you the lifeline of obeying my order,” Kelly responded.

            Kelly has frequently scolded defense lawyers for interrupting and talking over him, warning that he could find them in contempt. At one point, lawyer Nicholas Smith interrupted the judge while the judge was chastising him for an earlier interruption.

            One of Tarrio’s lawyers asked for a mistrial after a witness said that Tarrio had burned a Black Lives Matter banner at a protest in Washington during a December 2020 demonstration by Trump supporters. 

            
                Tarrio was arrested two days before the Jan. 6 riot, charged with vandalizing the banner and ordered to leave the city. Kelly ruled that prosecutors could discuss the vandalism, but not specific details about the banner. Prosecutors allege Tarrio remained in command of the Proud Boys on the ground on Jan. 6 even though he wasn't there. 

            Carmen Hernandez, a lawyer for Proud Boys chapter leader Zachary Rehl, has repeatedly moved for mistrials, including when she accused a prosecutor of using inflammatory and misleading allegations in his opening statement. Hernandez asked for a mistrial after jurors saw violent videos of Proud Boys street fighting at rallies before Jan. 6.

            “It wouldn’t be a day in this trial without a mistrial motion,” said Kelly, who denied her request.

            At least one juror may have sent a signal about the sluggish pace of the trial.

            J. Daniel Hull, one of Biggs’ lawyers, told the judge on Jan. 19 that he saw a juror nodding off that morning. In response, the judge told lawyers that “focusing their presentations might help that issue.”

            The rancor started before the jury was even sworn in. 

            A day before the trial started, Hernandez said she felt compelled to withdraw from the case if the judge allowed prosecutors to show a particular video as evidence. Smith, who represents Proud Boys chapter leader Ethan Nordean, followed up with a similar comment about withdrawing if the judge didn't rule in his favor on an evidentiary matter.

            Pattis, a Connecticut-based lawyer who represents Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs, was briefly sidelined from the case after a judge in his home state suspended his license to practice law for six months. The decision stemmed from Pattis’ handling of confidential documents during his representation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in a civil lawsuit. Kelly allowed Pattis to rejoin the trial after opening statements once an appeals court postponed his suspension.

            The judge didn't bring jurors into court on Feb. 6 so the lawyers could argue about the relevance of messages that Proud Boys posted on the Telegram platform. Pattis warned that the Telegram evidence alone could add two weeks to the trial “if we're not careful.”

            “I jokingly told my office I hope to be home by Easter today at the rate things are going,"" Pattis added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807414,Plane being towed at LA airport collides with shuttle bus,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — An airline jet being towed on a taxiway collided with a shuttle bus at Los Angeles International Airport late Friday, injuring five people. 

            The Federal Aviation Administration said Saturday that it is investigating the incident involving an American Airlines Airbus A321 jet. There were no passengers on board.

            The airport said on Twitter that the jet was being towed from a gate to a parking area when it “made contact” with a shuttle bus that was transporting passengers between terminals. 











            The Los Angeles Fire Department said four people were taken to hospitals after the “low-speed collision,"" which occurred around 10 p.m. The driver of the tug pulling the plane was in moderate condition and the driver and two passengers on the bus were in fair condition, the department said. 

            The only person on the plane, a worker, was treated but declined to be taken to a hospital, according to the fire department.

            There was no interruption to airport operations, the airport said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807415,"Russian spacecraft leaks coolant, station crew reported safe","MOSCOW (AP) — An uncrewed Russian supply ship docked at the International Space Station has leaked coolant, the Russian space corporation and NASA reported Saturday, saying the incident doesn’t pose any danger to the station’s crew.

            Roscosmos said the hatch between the station and the Progress MS-21 had been locked so the incident didn’t affect the orbiting outpost.

            “The temperature and pressure on board the station are within norms and there is no danger to health and safety of the crew,” it said in a statement.











            The initial statement from Roscosmos left it unclear whether the entire cargo ship or just some of its systems lost pressure, but Sergei Krikalev, head of Roscosmos’ crewed programs, later clarified that there was depressurization of the craft’s coolant loop.

            NASA said its specialists are assisting their Russian counterparts in the troubleshooting of the coolant leak.

            “Officials are monitoring all International Space Station systems and are not tracking any other issues,” NASA said. “The crew, which was informed of the cooling loop leak, is in no danger and continuing with normal space station operations.”

            The depressurization of the cargo craft’s coolant loop follows a similar incident in December with the Soyuz crew capsule, which Russian space officials said had been caused by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space.

            Roscosmos has launched a probe into a possible cause of the cooling loop leak, and Krikalev said that experts will closely look at materials and technologies used in spacecraft manufacturing as part of the probe.

            “We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that it wouldn't affect similar components that will be used in the future,” Krikalev said. “This is the most important task.”

            Roscosmos noted that before the leak the cargo ship had already been loaded with waste prior to its scheduled disposal. The craft is set to be undocked from the station and deorbit to burn in the atmosphere on Feb. 18.

            The announcement came shortly after a new Russian cargo ship docked smoothly at the station on Saturday. The Progress MS-22 delivered almost three tons of food, water and fuel along with scientific equipment for the crew.

            Roscosmos said that the incident didn’t affect the docking of the new cargo ship and “will have no impact on the future station program.”

            Russian Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to use the Soyuz crew capsule to return to Earth in March, but Russian space officials decided that higher temperatures resulting from the coolant leak could make it dangerous to use.

            They decided to launch a new Soyuz capsule on Feb. 20 so the crew have a lifeboat in the event of an emergency. But since it will travel in automatic mode to expedite the launch, a replacement crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall when another capsule is ready. It means that Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay several extra months at the station, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year.

            NASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.

            Besides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina; and Japan’s Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October.MOSCOW (AP) — An uncrewed Russian supply ship docked at the International Space Station has leaked coolant, the Russian space corporation and NASA reported Saturday, saying the incident doesn’t pose any danger to the station’s crew.Roscosmos said the hatch between the station and the Progress MS-21 had been locked so the incident didn’t affect the orbiting outpost.“The temperature and pressure on board the station are within norms and there is no danger to health and safety of the crew,” it said in a statement.The initial statement from Roscosmos left it unclear whether the entire cargo ship or just some of its systems lost pressure, but Sergei Krikalev, head of Roscosmos’ crewed programs, later clarified that there was depressurization of the craft’s coolant loop.NASA said its specialists are assisting their Russian counterparts in the troubleshooting of the coolant leak.“Officials are monitoring all International Space Station systems and are not tracking any other issues,” NASA said. “The crew, which was informed of the cooling loop leak, is in no danger and continuing with normal space station operations.”The depressurization of the cargo craft’s coolant loop follows a similar incident in December with the Soyuz crew capsule, which Russian space officials said had been caused by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space.Roscosmos has launched a probe into a possible cause of the cooling loop leak, and Krikalev said that experts will closely look at materials and technologies used in spacecraft manufacturing as part of the probe.“We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that it wouldn't affect similar components that will be used in the future,” Krikalev said. “This is the most important task.”Roscosmos noted that before the leak the cargo ship had already been loaded with waste prior to its scheduled disposal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807417,Drake delivers hits at 'Homecoming' Super Bowl week concert,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Drake could have offered Super Bowl week concertgoers just a few songs, but the rapper-singer instead delivered a healthy dose of his hits. 

            The multi-Grammy winner had many jostling for position to watch him perform at “h.wood Homecoming” at the Scottsdale Hangar One on Friday night. As some concertgoers crowded the stage, others like Alex Rodriguez and Jaleel White chilled in the VIP area while stars such as Michael Strahan watched Drake’s 45-minute performance from the second level of the luxury private jet complex.

            Other star entertainers and athletes who attended Drake’s show included Serena Williams, Cher, H.E.R., Lil Baby, Christina Aguilera, Meek Mill, Machine Gun Kelly, Tyga, Davante Adams, Odell Beckham Jr., Kyler Murray, Sauce Gardner and George Kittle. 











            Before Drake's appearance, attendees mingled for a few hours at the invite-only event. Once he arrived, many flocked toward the stage and pulled out their phones to capture his set. 

            “Tonight, they asked me to do three songs in like 20 minutes right? I could either do the 20 minutes or just run through all the old stuff,” he told the audience, who urged him to play his older hits. “OK, you asked for it.”

            Drake went on to perform several jams including “Best I Ever Had,” “Headlines,” “Controlla” and “HYGR.” He asked the crowd to recite the lyrics of 21 Savage’s verses on “Rich Flex,” a song from tandems collaborative album “Her Loss.” 

            The rap star kept asked attendees, “Do you want more?” The majority of the crowd urged him to do so.

            “If you’re playing shy or rich as (expletive) or own some tech company or some football team, we don’t give a (expletive) right now,” he said. “We just need you to turn up if you know this song. I need your help.”

            As confetti fell, Drake performed “Knife Talk” featuring 21 Savage and Project Pat.

            At the end, Drake paid homage to Lil Wayne before closing out his set by playing “I Will Always Love You,” the Dolly Parton song that Whitney Houston made famous. He sang every word along with many in the crowd.

            The “Homecoming” concert show was a part of a night filled with other concerts across the Phoenix area before the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. 

            Shaquille O'Neal held his carnival-style “Shaq's Funhouse” with Snoop Dogg headlining the concert, and Travis Scott and Robin Thicke performed at the “Rolling Stone Live” Super Bowl party.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807418,"In Pakistan, angry mob lynches man accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Hundreds of Muslims descended on a police station in Pakistan’s eastern Punjab province Saturday, snatched a blasphemy suspect from his cell and took him outside and lynched him, police said.

            Senior police officer Babar Sarfaraz Alpa said a man identified only as Waris had been in police custody for desecrating pages of a copy of Islam's holy book, the Quran. He said Waris pasted images of himself, his wife and a knife on several pages of the book, displayed them and threw them about in the rural district of Nankana.

            Alpa said an enraged mob of hundreds stormed the Warburton police station where some protesters used a wooden ladder to climb a wall and opened the main gate for the angry mob. 











            Alpa said the group ransacked the entire police station and took Waris from his cell.

            “By the time police reinforcement could reach the scene the mob lynched the man and were about to burn his body. But police with the help of saner people in the area foiled their attempt,"" he said.

            Charges of blasphemy carry the death penalty under Pakistani law.

            International and Pakistani rights groups say accusations of blasphemy have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores. Pakistan’s government has long been under pressure to change the country’s blasphemy laws, something the Islamists strongly resist.

            Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif condemned the incident and asked the Punjab police chief to take action against officers who failed to protect the suspect while in custody.

            Alpa said Waris was arrested in 2019 on a previous blasphemy charge and was in prison until mid-2022. 

            He said Waris again desecrated the Quran on Saturday morning and people who saw it grabbed him and started beating him. However, police rescued Waris and took him into custody. 

            Alpa said the lynching of Waris would be investigated.

            Usman Anwar, the Punjab police chief, suspended the police station chief and the area deputy superintendent for negligence in duty and failing to prevent the attack on the police station as well as the killing of the suspect.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807434,Minnesota Buddhist temple opens up sacred dance troupe,"HAMPTON, Minn. (AP) — The Buddhist community anchored by an ornate temple complex here in the Minnesota farmland is trying a new way to ensure its faith and ancestral culture stay vibrant for future generations -- an open call for the sacred dance troupe. 

            Founded by refugees fleeing the Khmer Rouge regime, which sought to eradicate most religious institutions, Watt Munisotaram and its troupe hope that teaching young children sacred dance will strengthen their ties to both Buddhism and Cambodian traditions. 

            “The connection is stronger when I dance,” said Sabrina Sok, 22, a Wattanak Dance Troupe leader. “The thing that stays in my head is this dance form almost disappeared with the Khmer Rouge.” 











            During their 1975-79 regime, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million in Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands fled, first to neighboring Thailand and later the United States, where Southeast Asians are one of the largest refugee communities.

            They carried this sacred dance tradition with them. On a frigid early February evening, Sok rehearsed for the upcoming Cambodian New Year holiday with fellow troupe leader Garrett Sour and his sister Gabriella, whose parents were among those refugees. 

            Practice used to be held at the temple, whose golden spires outshine the red barn roofs and silos in the snow-covered fields about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of the Twin Cities. But it was recently moved to a Minneapolis studio to make it easier for families to participate. 

            While recruitment was by word of mouth, this winter’s enrollment — open to anybody eager to learn the dance form — brought in the highest number ever after being posted on the temple’s Facebook page. 

            Clothed in traditional thick silk shirts and pants from Cambodia, the three dancers sinuously stretched and bent every part of their bodies, from joint-defying toe curls on up. Each movement helps tell ancient stories about gods, the cycle of life and other spiritual tales that intertwine elements of Buddhism, Hinduism and Animism. 

            “We’re never ourselves, we’re just physical embodiments of higher spirits,” said Garrett Sour, 20, as he meticulously coached the poses, urging a smaller step here, a deeper calf tilt there. “Dance was seen not as entertainment but a medium between heaven and earth.” 

            The marketing student at a Twin Cities university started dancing when he was six and has learned Khmer to better delve into the sacred storytelling. He will be one of the teachers for the incoming dancers – about 20, which nearly doubles the troupe, and most of them younger than teens. 

            “For me, to see the kids perform these traditional dances is verification they cherish and take seriously our tradition and our religion,” said Garrett’s mother, Sophia Sour, who has long been a volunteer at Watt Munisotaram. 

            In the temple’s ornate higher room, where the ten monks in residence chant and meditate daily surrounded by sacred books and large Cambodian-made paintings of Buddha’s life, the Venerable Vicheth Chum also highlighted the importance of what he called “blessed dance.” 

            “Very important to have, and to keep our ancestral tradition even when moved to (Minnesota),” said Chum, who came to the United States more than 20 years ago from Cambodia. “Buddhist teaching is practice for peace and happiness, no matter the nation.” 

            Monks at Watt Munisotaram – which roughly means the place to enjoy learning from wise men – practice Theravada, one of the oldest forms of Buddhism rooted in Southeast Asian cultures. 

            During the Khmer Rouge regime, and the communist Vietnamese rule that followed it, religious institutions were targeted by violence and repression, but Cambodian refugees kept traditions alive, said John Marston, an expert in Cambodian Buddhism at the Mexican university Colegio de Mexico. 

            Dance in particular, which dates back nearly 1,000 years and was linked to the royal court as well as temples, has become “a marker of Cambodian identity” in the U.S. diaspora, he added. 

            That’s why the dance troupe was started at Watt Munisotaram, which has grown into a 40-acre complex with golden Buddha statues, a stupa with relics and a meditation pond that lay frozen under knee-high snow on that early February weekend. 

            Dozens of faithful in equally bright white outfits met then to celebrate Magha Puja, a holiday marking the gathering of 1,250 of Buddha’s first disciples and the establishment of his rules for the new community. 

            Chum and seven other monks in elaborately folded, bright orange robes led a candlelit procession multiple times past an altar with several golden Buddha statues, glittery decorations and a profusion of flowers including lotus blossoms – most artificial, though in more clement weather some are grown locally or shipped from Florida. 

            Several children marched along, carrying the U.S. flag and Cambodia’s state and Buddhist flags, before everyone sat in neat rows on the carpeted floor for two hours of chanting in Khmer. 

            Chum said the monks worry about young people’s growing disenchantment with religion but believe that life’s inevitable struggles will eventually bring most back to the temple for guidance from Buddha’s teachings. 

            “It’s like learning a map and then taking action,” he said. 

            Garrett Sour, who grew up going frequently with his family to the temple, said he’s still figuring out how Buddhism applies to his life culturally and religiously. 

            But he’s fully embraced sacred dancing, and is eager to share what he learned from his teachers – including an aunt who danced in refugee camps before moving to Minnesota – with children, so the tradition can continue through generations. 

            The troupe’s main goal “is to preserve dances that were already there,” he said, adding that each summer they perform in a special ceremony honoring the spirits of previous dancers with altars replete with dancing ornaments and offerings. 

            Watching the recent rehearsal, Garrett’s mother beamed with pride. 

            “The world is using them to educate the other communities, I keep on reminding them,” Sophia Sour said. 

            She hopes to take Garrett and Gabriella to Cambodia to learn even more about the roots of their spirituality, whose fundamental values she listed as respect for the elders and good deeds. 

            “If you do good, good will come to you,” she said. “I’m not sure if that’s religion, or just life.”

            Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc. The AP is solely responsible for this content.HAMPTON, Minn. (AP) — The Buddhist community anchored by an ornate temple complex here in the Minnesota farmland is trying a new way to ensure its faith and ancestral culture stay vibrant for future generations -- an open call for the sacred dance troupe.Founded by refugees fleeing the Khmer Rouge regime, which sought to eradicate most religious institutions, Watt Munisotaram and its troupe hope that teaching young children sacred dance will strengthen their ties to both Buddhism and Cambodian traditions.“The connection is stronger when I dance,” said Sabrina Sok, 22, a Wattanak Dance Troupe leader. “The thing that stays in my head is this dance form almost disappeared with the Khmer Rouge.”During their 1975-79 regime, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million in Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands fled, first to neighboring Thailand and later the United States, where Southeast Asians are one of the largest refugee communities.They carried this sacred dance tradition with them. On a frigid early February evening, Sok rehearsed for the upcoming Cambodian New Year holiday with fellow troupe leader Garrett Sour and his sister Gabriella, whose parents were among those refugees.Practice used to be held at the temple, whose golden spires outshine the red barn roofs and silos in the snow-covered fields about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of the Twin Cities. But it was recently moved to a Minneapolis studio to make it easier for families to participate.While recruitment was by word of mouth, this winter’s enrollment — open to anybody eager to learn the dance form — brought in the highest number ever after being posted on the temple’s Facebook page.Clothed in traditional thick silk shirts and pants from Cambodia, the three dancers sinuously stretched and bent every part of their bodies, from joint-defying toe curls on up. Each movement helps tell ancient stories about gods, the cycle of life and other spiritual tales that intertwine elements of Buddhism, Hinduism and Animism.“We’re never ourselves, we’re just physical embodiments of higher spirits,” said Garrett Sour, 20, as he meticulously coached the poses, urging a smaller step here, a deeper calf tilt there. “Dance was seen not as entertainment but a medium between heaven and earth.”The marketing student at a Twin Cities university started dancing when he was six and has learned Khmer to better delve into the sacred storytelling. He will be one of the teachers for the incoming dancers – about 20, which nearly doubles the troupe, and most of them younger than teens.“For me, to see the kids perform these traditional dances is verification they cherish and take seriously our tradition and our religion,” said Garrett’s mother, Sophia Sour, who has long been a volunteer at Watt Munisotaram.In the temple’s ornate higher room, where the ten monks in residence chant and meditate daily surrounded by sacred books and large Cambodian-made paintings of Buddha’s life, the Venerable Vicheth Chum also highlighted the importance of what he called “blessed dance.”“Very important to have, and to keep our ancestral tradition even when moved to (Minnesota),” said Chum, who came to the United States more than 20 years ago from Cambodia. “Buddhist teaching is practice for peace and happiness, no matter the nation.”Monks at Watt Munisotaram – which roughly means the place to enjoy learning from wise men – practice Theravada, one of the oldest forms of Buddhism rooted in Southeast Asian cultures.During the Khmer Rouge regime, and the communist Vietnamese rule that followed it, religious institutions were targeted by violence and repression, but Cambodian refugees kept traditions alive, said John Marston, an expert in Cambodian Buddhism at the Mexican university Colegio de Mexico.Dance in particular, which dates back nearly 1,000 years and was linked to the royal court as well as temples, has become “a marker of Cambodian identity” in the U.S. diaspora, he added.That’s why the dance troupe was started at Watt Munisotaram, which has grown into a 40-acre complex with golden Buddha statues, a stupa with relics and a meditation pond that lay frozen under knee-high snow on that early February weekend.Dozens of faithful in equally bright white outfits met then to celebrate Magha Puja, a holiday marking the gathering of 1,250 of Buddha’s first disciples and the establishment of his rules for the new community.Chum and seven other monks in elaborately folded, bright orange robes led a candlelit procession multiple times past an altar with several golden Buddha statues, glittery decorations and a profusion of flowers including lotus blossoms – most artificial, though in more clement weather some are grown locally or shipped from Florida.Several children marched along, carrying the U.S. flag and Cambodia’s state and Buddhist flags, before everyone sat in neat rows on the carpeted floor for two hours of chanting in Khmer.Chum said the monks worry about young people’s growing disenchantment with religion but believe that life’s inevitable struggles will eventually bring most back to the temple for guidance from Buddha’s teachings.“It’s like learning a map and then taking action,” he said.Garrett Sour, who grew up going frequently with his family to the temple, said he’s still figuring out how Buddhism applies to his life culturally and religiously.But he’s fully embraced sacred dancing, and is eager to share what he learned from his teachers – including an aunt who danced in refugee camps before moving to Minnesota – with children, so the tradition can continue through generations.The troupe’s main goal “is to preserve dances that were already there,” he said, adding that each summer they perform in a special ceremony honoring the spirits of previous dancers with altars replete with dancing ornaments and offerings.Watching the recent rehearsal, Garrett’s mother beamed with pride.“The world is using them to educate the other communities, I keep on reminding them,” Sophia Sour said.She hopes to take Garrett and Gabriella to Cambodia to learn even more about the roots of their spirituality, whose fundamental values she listed as respect for the elders and good deeds.“If you do good, good will come to you,” she said. “I’m not sure if that’s religion, or just life.”—Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807436,Paging Russell Westbrook: Paul George says come to Clippers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — If Paul George has his way, Russell Westbrook would end up as the point guard the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t get at the trade deadline.

            The Los Angeles Lakers sent Westbrook to Utah as part of a three-way deal earlier this week. There’s been talk the Jazz would buy out his contract, but it’s also possible he could stay with them for the rest of the season.

            George wouldn't mind seeing him in a Clippers jersey.











            “I’ve talked to him just to kind of see where his head is and to see if there is anything I can do,” George said Friday night after the Clippers lost to Milwaukee with Kawhi Leonard on the bench.

            George and Westbrook were former running mates in Oklahoma City, and George believes the nine-time All-Star still has plenty left at age 34 despite his rocky tenure with the Lakers.

            “I’m a big believer and a fan of what Russ’ work is, having one of my best seasons in my career alongside of him. I’ve seen what he can do night in and night out,” George said. “I really think he can improve the team. He’s such a big talent. He rebounds, he finds guys, he makes the game easy for everyone. I think he will come in, he will mesh and he’ll figure out how we play and he’ll adjust to it.”

            George said the Clippers can still make a postseason run without a point guard, but having Westbrook in the traditional role of starting the offense would make things easier. John Wall didn't work out and the team sent him back to Houston this week.

            “We have enough shooting to surround Russ where Russ can be Russ. I think the floor would be open for him, spacing would be there for him,” George said. “I know that's my game, spacing the floor, being a shooter on the perimeter and then just running with him in transition. I think that's where we can complement him.”

            Westbrook, the 2017 NBA MVP, never meshed with LeBron James and oft-injured Anthony Davis on the Lakers. He averaged 17.4 points, 7.2 assists, 6.9 rebounds and 3.7 turnovers during his 130-game tenure. Westbrook, who played at UCLA, was frequently mentioned in trade talk.

            “If it makes sense and obviously it goes with our team, we’re all for it,” George said. “Hopefully, Russell sees this and we figure something out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807437,"3 weeks, dozens of witnesses: Takeaways from Murdaugh trial","Three weeks into disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial, prosecutors have called dozens of witnesses offering wide-ranging — and sometimes disjointed — testimony.

            Jurors have heard from the investigators who found the bodies of Murdaugh's wife and son, and technicians who found gunshot residue, cracked open cellphones to get videos and tested dozens of ammunition casings.

            They've heard from betrayed law firm employees, heartbroken friends of Murdaugh and his family, and a man whose insurance settlement was stolen after his mother, the Murdaughs' housekeeper, died in a fall at their home.











            But witnesses have been called in disorganized groups and tantalizing scraps of evidence have been introduced but not explained. The defense hopes to start its case in middle of next week and had planned a week of testimony but is rethinking that because of the trial’s length.

            Here are some key takeaways from the trial so far.

            FINANCIAL CRIMES

            Murdaugh, 54, is charged with murder in the deaths of 52-year-old Maggie, shot several times with a rifle, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, shot twice with a shotgun at kennels near their Colleton County home on June 7, 2021. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

            The disbarred lawyer also faces about 100 other charges ranging from stealing money from clients to running a drug and money laundering ring.

            Much of the week’s testimony focused on whether Murdaugh stole money from his family’s law firm and clients. Prosecutors contend Murdaugh thought he was about to get caught stealing and killed his wife and son to buy time to cover up the money trail.

            The office manager from the family law firm said Murdaugh stole millions in fees and client settlements. A law school buddy said Murdaugh took advantage of his trust and left him to pay $192,000 to keep his client trust fund balanced. The son of the Murdaughs' housekeeper and nanny who died in a fall testified Murdaugh promised to get them a hefty insurance settlement for the death but kept more than $4 million collected for himself.

            The defense objected to each witness, saying there was no evidence linking the killings to financial misdeeds.

            “This is piling on. This is more trying to prejudice the jury into believing somehow someone who steals a bunch of money in any way whatever would commit a murder,"" Murdaugh lawyer Dick Harpootlian said.

            DISJOINTED CASE

            Prosecutors have called 47 witnesses in 12 days of testimony, but at times there has been little rhythm to the order.

            This week, the caretaker of Murdaugh's mother testified about a blue jacket Murdaugh might have held when he visited but then other witnesses testified about financial crimes before the state forensic scientist who tested the jacket for blood and gunshot residue took the stand.

            Long, tedious testimony has focused on cellphone data between Paul Murdaugh's friends.

            Some intriguing evidence has been introduced but never explained to jurors, who do not have notebooks to keep track of testimony. 

            A crime scene technician put into evidence a receipt with a $1,021.10 item from Gucci circled, but it hasn't been brought up since. An FBI technician gave the times Murdaugh's SUV was shifted into and out of park the night of the killings without interpretation.

            THE ACCUSED

            A courtroom camera is trained on Alex Murdaugh every moment he is in court. Several cameras wait for him as he gets in and out of a prison van each day.

            At the beginning of the trial, Murdaugh cried and rocked in his chair several times as crime scene photos of his wife and son were shown and described. Prosecutors and defense have said the aftermath of the shooting was gruesome. Agents testified Paul Murdaugh's brain was detached from his skull with a close range shotgun blast.

            Murdaugh has adamantly denied killing his wife and son. His lawyers said he was visiting his ailing mother the night of the murders and police wrongly focused on him from the start.

            Murdaugh cried Thursday as the defense showed video of a family birthday party weeks before the killings.

            But during the financial crimes testimony, Murdaugh has been much more stoic, listening and occasionally speaking to his lawyers.

            TECHNOLOGICAL WIZARDRY

            Within weeks of the killings, state agents wanted data from the SUV Alex Murdaugh drove to visit his mother the night of the killings and from Paul Murdaugh's cellphone.

            But both devices were encrypted and impossible to crack in 2021.

            Advancements in hacking allowed agents to get into Paul Murdaugh's iPhone data last year and they found one of the key pieces of evidence so far — a video he took of a dog at the family's kennels about five minutes before investigators said the killings took place. Several witnesses have said all three Murdaughs can be heard in the video taken near where the bodies were found.

            Alex Murdaugh told police both right after the bodies were found and again a few days later he was never at the kennels.

            A FBI agent testified he worked for a year to crack the encrypted data from the computer entertainment and information console on the SUV the family law firm provided Murdaugh.

            Along with other information, he extracted the times the vehicle was shifted into and out of park, although he couldn't tell if the vehicle was in motion or someone had their foot on the brake. The agent said he also could tell when the windows were raised or lowered, but never said if that happened during Murdaugh's 20-minute ride to his mother's home the night of the killings.

            Maggie Murdaugh’s cellphone was recovered from the side of a road the day after the killings.Three weeks into disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial, prosecutors have called dozens of witnesses offering wide-ranging — and sometimes disjointed — testimony.Jurors have heard from the investigators who found the bodies of Murdaugh's wife and son, and technicians who found gunshot residue, cracked open cellphones to get videos and tested dozens of ammunition casings.They've heard from betrayed law firm employees, heartbroken friends of Murdaugh and his family, and a man whose insurance settlement was stolen after his mother, the Murdaughs' housekeeper, died in a fall at their home.But witnesses have been called in disorganized groups and tantalizing scraps of evidence have been introduced but not explained.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807445,Notre Dame windows undergo restoration in Cologne,"Matthias Deml, an art historian and spokesman for the Cologne Cathedral Builders Works, remembers the evening of April 15, 2019, well. ""I sat in front of the TV, shocked and stunned,"" he says. Meter-high flames burst from the roof of the world-famous Notre Dame Gothic cathedral in Paris.The fire destroyed the wooden roof truss made of 1,300 oak beams, dubbed ""la foret,"" the forest. The heat melted the roof that was made of 250 tons of lead. The wooden crossing tower collapsed. It was not until a day later that the fire department was able to extinguish the fire. To this day, no one knows what started it — perhaps it was a short circuit, perhaps a discarded cigarette butt. Whatever the reason, the world was shocked.Four years later, Deml's colleagues Katrin Wittstadt and Elodie Schneider are working on a window by Jacques Le Chevallier, a 20th-century stained glass artist. ""The biggest problem is contamination from a thick layer of lead dust,"" says Wittstadt, the scientific director of the glass workshop at Cologne Cathedral's Builders' Works and head of the restoration of four Notre Dame windows.Dirt, smoke and water used by the firefighters caused great damage to the interior of the church. Fortunately, many precious relics and treasures were salvaged, and numerous works of art were merely soiled. The flames spared the Gothic cathedral's world-famous rose windows, but some 19th and 20th-century windows were damaged, including the four Le Chevallier clerestory windows in the nave of the church. Unlike many other of the cathedral's windows, these multi-colored stained-glass windows are non-figurative.For the most part, the 300 individual panes remained undamaged. Only individual bits need to be replaced or repainted. ""This pane is shattered into many small pieces, and our job is to complete it with a matching colored glass,"" the restorer says, pointing out an area of cracked glass.  A radio plays softly in the corner of the glass workshop.Cleaning and repair work could have taken place on site in Paris, but the damage to the church vault was so great that the windows had to be removed. In November, a truck brought them to Cologne for the restoration work, which should be done by spring. The experts first documented the damage before cleaning the windows in a decontamination chamber, gluing cracks, replacing broken pieces and repainting. The final step: soldering the lead mesh and cementing the exterior.France long debated whether or not to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral as it was, or according to contemporary designs. Renovation and restoration is estimated to take five years. Time is short because the church is scheduled to reopen next year on April 15, the fifth anniversary of the fire. Repairs are likely to continue even afterwards. The total budget for the reconstruction is about € 830 million ($ 895 million), in the form of funds pledged and donated.French President Emmanuel Macron made the reconstruction of Notre Dame, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991, a top priority early on. For many people in France, Notre Dame has great emotional significance. The cathedral has seen many an historical event including the coronation of Emperor Napoleon in 1804 and the funeral of President Charles de Gaulle. The bells of Notre Dame would ring out on important occasions, like the liberation from the Nazis in 1944. The 1956 film ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" based on a novel by Victor Hugo also boosted the cathedral's fame.The 130-meter-long (427 feet) medieval Catholic church was built on the Seine island of Ile de la Cite, in the heart of Paris. Construction began in the twelfth century, and today its two 69-meter-high main towers soar over the rooftops of Paris. The view is magnificent. Up until the devastating fire in April 2019, up to 14 million people visited Notre Dame every year; it was the most visited sight in France, even ahead of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.If there is such a thing as a cathedral friendship, then it is would be between Notre Dame de Paris and Cologne Cathedral. Today, both are landmarks in their own cities. ""Our cathedral is very strongly influenced by the French Gothic style,"" says Matthias Deml. The Builders' Works are connected. The cathedral builders, organized in the Association of European Cathedral Builders, meet regularly for conferences.""It is a great honor that we are allowed to work on Notre Dame,"" says Deml.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/11,,

            “Time has come for this revolution to bring out the corrupt money and turn them into higher salaries and pensions,” Berisha said.











            Protest participants hurled smoke bombs at the main entrance of the government building, where hundreds of police officers formed a line to protect the building.

            Rama's critics accused him of corruption and hold him responsible him for the exodus of young Albanians who have left to pursue jobs in Western European countries. Rama says his Cabinet has kept inflation low compared to elsewhere in Europe, and has subsidized electricity for families and small businesses.

            The opposition also accuses Rama of corrupting Charles McGonigal, a former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official, who is accused in the United States of hiding from the FBI key details of a 2017 trip he took to Albania with a former Albanian intelligence official who is alleged to have given him at least $225,000. 

            McGonigal met with Albania’s prime minister and urged caution in awarding oil field drilling licenses in the country to Russian front companies.

            Rama has acknowledged meeting with McGonigal but denied allegations of giving him money or preferential treatment. 

            Not all opposition Democrats were present at the protest as Berisha's party has been plagued by infighting after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2021 barred Berisha and his close relatives from entering the U.S. for “corrupt acts that undermined democracy” during his 2005-2013 tenure as prime minister.

            Berisha called for another protest at the parliament on Monday.TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Thousands of supporters of Albania's political opposition took part in an anti-government protest Saturday, calling for the prime minister's resignation for alleged corruption and mishandling of the small Balkan nation's economy.Sali Berisha, a former president and prime minister of Albania who leads the center-right Democratic Party, and former President Ilir Meta, who leads the left-wing Freedom Party, were among the protesters who gathered in front of the main government building with banners and shouted for Prime Minister Edi Rama of the ruling center-left Socialist Party to resign.“Time has come for this revolution to bring out the corrupt money and turn them into higher salaries and pensions,” Berisha said.Protest participants hurled smoke bombs at the main entrance of the government building, where hundreds of police officers formed a line to protect the building.Rama's critics accused him of corruption and hold him responsible him for the exodus of young Albanians who have left to pursue jobs in Western European countries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807447,João Félix scores 1st Chelsea goal in 1-1 draw with West Ham,"LONDON (AP) — João Félix’s second match for Chelsea went better than his first.

            The Portugal forward scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw at West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday on his return from a three-game suspension following a sending-off on his debut a month ago.

            Félix guided home a volley off a cross from another new signing, Enzo Fernandez, in the 16th minute only for Emerson Palmieri — a former Chelsea player — to equalize in the 28th.











            It was a third straight draw for Chelsea’s expensively assembled team, which is languishing in midtable in what increasingly appears a forlorn bid to qualify for the Champions League.

            In an action-packed finale, West Ham had a goal by Tomas Soucek disallowed for an offside in the buildup and Chelsea had appeals for a penalty waved away after Soucek appeared to handle the ball when blocking Conor Gallagher’s shot.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807448,Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl matchup could come down to trenches,"PHOENIX (AP) — The all-star cast of players in the trenches should decide the Super Bowl champion.

            Sure, Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts will make their share of plays. But Sunday’s game will come down to which team controls the line of scrimmage.

            The Philadelphia Eagles (16-3) reached this point mainly because of a dominant offensive line that allowed Hurts to thrive. He developed into an AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year finalist playing behind a line that features All-Pro center Jason Kelce and All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson.











            Kelce, Johnson, left tackle Jordan Mailata, Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson and right guard Isaac Seumalo have excelled in the playoffs, helping the Eagles rack up 416 yards rushing in two lopsided wins. The Eagles outscored the Giants and 49ers by a combined margin of 69-14.

            A defensive line featuring four players with at least 10 sacks roughed up opposing quarterbacks throughout the season. Haason Reddick was a game-wrecker against San Francisco, knocking Brock Purdy out of the game.

            The Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) know what it’s like to face a fearsome pass rush in the Super Bowl. Behind a banged-up offensive line, Mahomes looked ordinary in a 31-9 loss to the Buccaneers in the big game two years ago.

            They’re healthy this time around and have a pair of second-team All-Pros: left guard Joe Thuney and center Creed Humphrey.

            On the opposite side, All-Pro defensive tackle Chris Jones was a nightmare for opponents this season. Jones had 15 1/2 sacks. If Philly’s O-line can’t slow him down, it could be a rough day for Hurts.

            WHEN THE CHIEFS HAVE THE BALL:

            Mahomes, the two-time AP NFL MVP, is a magician, even with an ankle injury that should feel better now than it did two weeks ago against Cincinnati. He’ll look often for All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, who had 110 catches in the regular season and 21 in two playoff games. 

            Wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling had a big game against the Bengals, catching six passes for 116 yards and a TD. JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney are ready to go after being injured in that game. 

            The Chiefs had the league’s 20th-ranked run offense mostly because Mahomes led the NFL in passing. Rookie seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco had 830 yards rushing in the regular season and 95 against Jacksonville but only 26 in the AFC title game. Running back Jerick McKinnon is more of a pass-catching threat. He had 56 receptions. 

            Protecting Mahomes will be critical to Kansas City’s success. The Eagles are five sacks away from breaking the NFL record for a season. Reddick, Brandon Graham, Josh Sweat and Javon Hargrave each had at least 10 sacks. 

            Cornerbacks James Bradberry and Darius Slay are among the top duos in the league so they’ll make it difficult for Mahomes to connect often with his receivers. Travis Kelce vs. Philly’s linebackers and safeties is a mismatch that the Chiefs will look to exploit.

            WHEN THE EAGLES HAVE THE BALL:

            The Eagles can beat teams on the ground or in the air. Hurts could run for 100 yards or throw for 300. This offense has plenty of versatility with Hurts leading the way. Miles Sanders had 1,268 yards rushing in the regular season. Kenny Gainwell leads the team with 160 yards rushing in the playoffs. Boston Scott is another option in a stacked backfield. 

            Hurts only has 275 yards passing in the playoffs but the Eagles haven’t had to throw. They’ve had success running, built big leads and kept it on the ground to chew the clock.

            If they air it out, wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith are among the top tandems in the NFL and tight end Dallas Goedert is underrated. The Chiefs allowed a league-high 33 passing TDs this season so it could be a big day for Hurts and his receivers.

            Everything starts for the Eagles on the O-line. They’ve protected Hurts, paved the way for running backs and imposed their will on defenses throughout the season.

            Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo is a two-time Super Bowl champion who has a history of shutting down top offenses in the Super Bowl. Just ask Tom Brady. Spagnuolo is known for bringing the heat to knock QBs off rhythm. Considering Hurts has a major drop-off in production when blitzed, expect Spagnuolo to dial it up. 

            If Hurts has time, Kansas City’s four rookie defensive backs will be in for a long day.

            SPECIAL TEAMS:

            Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker is perfect in two Super Bowls, making four extra points and four field goals. Punter Tommy Townsend had an All-Pro season with a net of 45.6 yards.

            The Chiefs’ return teams were both in the top seven.

            Eagles kicker Jake Elliott made all three of his field goals and two of three extra points in his only Super Bowl five years ago. 

            Punter Arryn Siposs may return for the first time since an ankle injury sidelined him in December. Veteran Brett Kern has been filling in and would make his first Super Bowl appearance of a 15-year career. 

            The Eagles have had some issues with their coverage units at times this season.

            COACHING: 

            Chiefs coach Andy Reid is facing his former team. He won more games than any coach in Eagles history over a 14-year period. Reid is second behind Bill Belichick (31) with 21 playoff wins. He’s 1-2 in the Super Bowl, including a loss with the Eagles. 

            Sirianni is 25-12 in two seasons as a head coach, including 2-1 in the playoffs. Like Reid, he’s an excellent game planner. Sirianni is also aggressive and doesn’t lack any confidence.

            INTANGIBLES: 

            Reid vs. his former team. Sirianni vs. a coach who fired him. No extra motivation needed for a Super Bowl. Both teams have loud, loyal fan bases who have flooded Phoenix for the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807449,Doctor says 57 killed in week of fighting in Somaliland city,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — At least 57 people have been confirmed dead in days of clashes between antigovernment fighters and Somaliland security forces in the disputed city of Las-Anod after local leaders said they wanted to rejoin the federal government of Somalia, a doctor reported Saturday.

            Abdimajid Hussein Sugulle, the director-general of a public hospital in Las-Anod, told The Associated Press that more than 400 people also were wounded in nearly a week of fighting.

            Authorities in Somaliland, a region that separated from Somalia three decades ago and seeks recognition as an independent country, announced a unilateral cease-fire on Friday night. But residents said skirmishes continued in and around the eastern city.











            Somaliland and the Somali state of Puntland have disputed Las-Anod for years, but the city has been under Somaliland control.

            The Somaliland government accused clan militants of targeting its army facilities. In return, traditional elders accused Somaliland forces of invading the city and said the only way to restore peace was for the troops to leave.

            The United Nations has said the fighting has displaced more than 80,000 people. Water and electricity have been cut off amid shelling.

            “Indiscriminate shelling of civilians is unacceptable and must stop,” the U.N. and international partners said in a statement earlier in the week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807457,Migrants seeking US sponsors find questionable offers online,"Pedro Yudel Bruzon was looking for someone in the U.S. to support his effort to seek asylum when he landed on a Facebook page filled with posts demanding up to $10,000 for a financial sponsor.

            It's part of an underground market that's emerged since the Biden administration announced it would accept 30,000 immigrants each month arriving by air from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti. Applicants for the humanitarian parole program need someone in the U.S., often a friend or relative, to promise to provide financial support for at least two years.

            Bruzon, who lives in Cuba, doesn't know anyone who can do that, so he searched online. But he also doesn't have the money to pay for a sponsor and isn't sure the offers — or those making them — are real. He worries about being exploited or falling prey to a scam.











            “They call it humanitarian parole, but it has nothing to do with being humanitarian,” said Bruzon, who said he struggles to feed himself and his mother with what he makes as a 33-year-old Havana security guard. “Everyone wants money, even people in the same family.”

            It’s unclear how many people in the United States may have charged migrants to sponsor them, but Facebook groups with names like “Sponsors U.S.” carry dozens of posts offering and seeking financial supporters.

            Several immigration attorneys said they could find no specific law prohibiting people from charging money to sponsor beneficiaries.

            “As long as everything is accurate on the form and there are no fraudulent statements it may be legal,” said lawyer Taylor Levy, who long worked along the border around El Paso, Texas. “But what worries me are the risks in terms of being trafficked and exploited. If lying is involved, it could be fraud.”

            Also, she noted, it “seems counterintuitive” to pay someone to promise to provide financial support.

            Attorney Leon Fresco, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, said charging to be a sponsor is a “gray area” and the U.S. should send a forceful message against the practice.

            Kennji Kizuka, an attorney and director of asylum policy for the International Rescue Committee, which resettles newcomers in the United States, said this type of thing happens with every new U.S. program benefitting migrants.

            “It looks like some are just going to take people’s money and the people are going to get nothing in return,” Kizuka said.

            Levy said such exploitation surrounding a similar U.S. program for Ukrainians prompted the government to publish an online guide about how to spot and protect against human-trafficking schemes.

            One common scheme with immigration programs is known as notario fraud and involves people who call themselves “notarios públicos” charging large sums. In Latin America, the term refers to attorneys with special credentials, leading lead migrants to believe they are lawyers who can provide legal advice. In the U.S., notaries public are merely empowered to witness the signing of legal documents and issue oaths.

            In another scheme, someone poses as a U.S. official asking for money. The U.S. government notes: “We do not accept Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, or gift cards as payment for immigration fees.”

            U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services warns about potential scams with the humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans that was rolled out last month and notes online that the program is free.

            “Fulfilling our humanitarian mission while upholding the integrity of the immigration system is a top priority for USCIS,” the agency said in response to questions about the potential for exploitation. It says the agency “carefully vets every prospective supporter through a series of fraud- and security-based screening measures.”

            “Additionally, USCIS thoroughly reviews each reported case of fraud or misconduct and may refer those cases to federal law enforcement for additional investigation,” the statement said.

            The agency did not address whether any application has been rejected because of concerns that potential sponsors might be requesting money.

            The Department of Homeland Security says 1,700 humanitarian parole applications were accepted as of Jan. 25 from Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, plus an undisclosed number of Venezuelans. A Texas-led lawsuit seeks to stop the program, which could allow 360,000 people a year to enter the U.S. legally.

            One Facebook post advertising paid sponsorships led to a person who identified himself as an American citizen living in Pensacola, Florida. Told he was communicating with a journalist, the person refused to talk on the phone and would only text.

            The person told The Associated Press he had sponsored a Cuban uncle and aunt for $10,000 each. He refused to provide contact information for those relatives, then stopped responding to questions.

            Another would-be sponsor said via Facebook messenger that they charge $2,000 per person, which includes a sponsorship fee, document processing and an airline ticket. Requests for more information were answered with a phone number from the Dominican Republic that rang unanswered.

            A man who posted seeking a sponsor told the AP that he was disturbed by some offers.

            “It’s very easy to trick a desperate person and there are an abundance of them here,” the man, who identified himself as Pedro Manuel Carmenate, of Havana, said. “You just have to tell the people what they want to hear.”

            Of course, not all sponsors charge a fee. A new initiative called Welcome.US aims to match Americans to migrants without supporters. Also, nonprofit organizations are trying to spread accurate information about the program.

            Sarah Ivory, executive director of the nonprofit USAHello that provides online information in multiple languages, said the proliferation of offers for paid sponsorship is “deeply troubling and frustratingly predictable,” reflected in hundreds of queries to the group.

            “Many report that they barely have the money to feed themselves, much less pay to get a passport or arrange a sponsor,” Ivory said.

            Such desperation is reflected on social media.

            “I’m looking for a sponsor for two people please, my husband is in a wheelchair,” reads a post from someone who says she lives in Havana. “I will give my house with everything inside and I’ll pay $4,000 for each” person sponsored.Pedro Yudel Bruzon was looking for someone in the U.S. to support his effort to seek asylum when he landed on a Facebook page filled with posts demanding up to $10,000 for a financial sponsor.It's part of an underground market that's emerged since the Biden administration announced it would accept 30,000 immigrants each month arriving by air from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807483,Chiefs brain trust remains big reason for Super Bowl success,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs have two assistants on their coaching staff that have been head coaches in the NFL, and another one that has been interviewed — and passed over — for top jobs too many times to count.

            That's some pretty good brainpower helping out Chiefs coach Andy Reid when they play the Philadelphia Eagles, led by Nick Sirianni and their talented but undeniably young coaching staff, in the Super Bowl on Sunday.

            “I will tell you, I've been fortunate to have great coaches,"" said Reid, whose staffs over the years have included Ravens coach John Harbaugh, Commanders coach Ron Rivera, Jaguars coach Doug Pederson and Bills coach Sean McDermott. 











            And plenty of other coaches — Todd Bowles, Pat Shurmur, Leslie Frazier — that also have been NFL head coaches.

            “Assistants work their tails off,” Reid said, “and normally if you have good coaches and good players, that's a combination for success. Mentors, I've had a bunch of them. I was lucky to have great coaches and then all the way through college.”

            Perhaps that is why Reid invests himself so much in helping his own assistants climb the coaching ladder.

            And why, when they fall as all coaches eventually do, they often return to his side.

            That was the case with Matt Nagy and Steve Spagnuolo.

            Nagy got his start in the NFL as Reid's coaching intern during his days in Philadelphia, then followed Big Red to Kansas City in 2013. He began there as the quarterbacks coach, rose to offensive coordinator when Pederson departed for his own head coaching job, then took the top job with the Bears a couple of years later.

            Nagy went to the playoffs twice in four years before he was fired. Now, he's back in KC as the quarterbacks coach.

            “Listen, I think he's a great coach,” Reid said. “I think he knows people, handles people well. He's a good teacher. The players respond to his approach. And he had a relationship with Pat Mahomes, and so it was just a natural fit for him to come back here. 

            ""It was just a matter of, (if) he wanted to sit out a year or get back into it as an assistant coach, and so he did. He wanted to jump back in and go. And we're sure glad to get him.”

            Spagnuolo likewise got his NFL start with Reid in Philadelphia before a coaching odyssey that took him to the head job with the Rams and an interim stint coaching the Giants. But the defensive guru was passed over for the full-time job in New York, he landed back with Reid, who in 2019 needed someone to revamp his defense.

            With his unconventional, blitzing and aggressive approach, Spagnuolo has done precisely that in Kansas City.

            “Steve's very creative. Very smart. A tribute to Springfield College, right?"" said Reid, referring to the small Division III school where Spagnuolo played wide receiver. “He's been in the league and had a great tutor in Jim Johnson when he was young, and he's been able to build off that scheme and been very innovative with it.”

            Then there's Eric Bieniemy, the would-be head coach, who helps Reid orchestrate the Chiefs' high-flying offense.

            During his five seasons as offensive coordinator, the Chiefs have never finished worse than fifth in total offense. They've been to every AFC title game played during that stretch, won three conference championships and have a chance to bring home a second Lombardi Trophy, all while Mahomes celebrates winning his second MVP award.

            Bieniemy is still in the running for the job in Indianapolis, a search that has been put on hold until after the Super Bowl.

            ""I knew what a great coach Eric was and thought he would get an opportunity. I’ve continued to think that,"" said Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt, who next to Reid is perhaps Bieniemy's biggest champion. ""At this point, he’s maybe been through too many hiring cycles and it’s almost become a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy that he’s not getting the opportunity.”

            Some critics say the Chiefs offense has been so successful because of Reid, one of the league's brilliant minds, and that Bieniemy needs to go elsewhere and escape his shadow. 

            To that extent, his name has been linked to offensive coordinator openings with the Commanders and Ravens.

            “I know he’s still interested and he would do a fantastic job (as a head coach),"" Hunt said. “And I’m glad he’s going to have the stage that he’ll have on Sunday to once again show what a tremendous offensive coordinator he is.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807484,Sudan military finishes review of Russian Red Sea base deal,"CAIRO (AP) — Sudan’s ruling military concluded a review of an agreement with Russia to build a navy base on the Red Sea in the African country, two Sudanese officials said Saturday.

            They said the deal was awaiting the formation of a civilian government and a legislative body to be ratified before it takes effect. The officials said Moscow met Sudan’s most recent demands, including providing more weapons and equipment.

            “They cleared all our concerns. The deal has become OK from the military side,” one official said.











            The officials did not provide further details and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. A spokesman for the Sudanese military declined to comment.

            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Thursday the deal still needs ratification by Sudan’s yet-to-be-formed legislative body.

            Sudan has been without a parliament since a popular uprising forced the military overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. The country has been mired in political chaos since an October 2021 military coup derailed its short-lived transition to democracy.

            The deal, which surfaced in December 2021, is part of Moscow’s efforts to restore a regular naval presence in various parts of the globe. It was reached during al-Bashir's reign.

            The agreement allows Russia to set up a naval base with up to 300 Russian troops, and to simultaneously keep up to four navy ships, including nuclear-powered ones, in the strategic Port Sudan on the Red Sea.

            The base would ensure the Russian navy’s presence in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and spare its ships the need for long voyages to reach the area, according to Viktor Bondarev, the former Russian air force chief.

            In exchange, Russia is to provide Sudan with weapons and military equipment. The agreement is to last for 25 years, with automatic extensions for 10-year periods if neither side objects.

            In June 2021, Sudan’s Chief of General Staff, Gen. Mohammed Othman al-Hussein, told a local television station that Khartoum would review the agreement.

            In February last year Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, held talks with senior Russian officials in Moscow.

            Upon his return from the weeklong trip, Dagalo said his country didn’t have objections to Russia or any other country establishing a base on its territory as it poses no threat to Sudan’s national security.

            “If any country wants to open a base and it is in our interests and doesn’t threaten our national security, we have no problem in dealing with anyone, Russian or otherwise,” he said.CAIRO (AP) — Sudan’s ruling military concluded a review of an agreement with Russia to build a navy base on the Red Sea in the African country, two Sudanese officials said Saturday.They said the deal was awaiting the formation of a civilian government and a legislative body to be ratified before it takes effect.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807486,Mexico welcomes Cuban president amid hard times,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged Saturday that the island faces “tremendously difficult challenges,” as he arrived for a visit in Mexico. 

            The Cuban leader blamed the problems on the “blows of nature” and U.S. economic sanctions. 

            “I once again thank our brother nation for its solidarity with the Cuban people, who have faced tremendously difficult challenges in the last few years and months, due to a combination of the blows of nature and the effects of the toughened blockade,” Díaz-Canel said at a welcoming ceremony in the Gulf coast city of Campeche. 











            Díaz-Canel mentioned plans to export crushed stone ballast to Mexico for a train project, and said the two countries “will analyze new goals in areas of common interest.” He also mentioned the Cuban doctors that have been sent to Mexico, and said he would visit some of them during his visit. 

            In 2021, Cuba’s autocratic government faced historic protests amid a severe economic crisis, shortages and blackouts. According to nongovernmental groups, about 1,300 people were arrested following the protests. About 700 sentences have been handed down related to the protests, with some ranging up to 30 years in prison for sedition.

            And in 2022, a deadly fire destroyed at least half of a large oil storage facility in western Cuba and further weakened the island’s already fragile electricity system. Mexico sent firefighting assistance during that blaze.

            Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called Díaz-Canel a “distinguished and admired guest” while awarding him the “Order of the Aztec Eagle,” Mexico’s highest honor for foreigners, later Saturday at a ceremony in the Mayan ruin site of Edzna.

            The award — decided mainly by Mexico's president — has previously been given to leaders ranging from Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran. 

            “The U.S. government should lift, as soon as possible, the unjust and inhuman blockade of the Cuban people,” López Obrador said. “It's time for a new coexistence among all the countries of Latin America.”

            López Obrador has praised Cuba for sending doctors to Mexico, some of whom serve in dangerous or remote areas. But those doctors, and the salaries they are paid, have raised controversy in Mexico. Some said the jobs should go to Mexican doctors, while other suspected that much of their salaries would go to the Cuban government.

            As president, López Obrador has opposed U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba, and on Saturday he said U.S. policy “is completely worn out, anachronistic, it has no future or point, and it no longer benefits anyone.”

            López Obrador has gone out of his way to buy as much as he can from Cuba. But his purchase of everything from Cuban crushed stone ballast to the Abdala coronavirus vaccine have raised eyebrows. 

            Mexico bought 9 million doses of the Cuban-made Abdala vaccine in September 2022, with the doses arriving at year’s end, when Mexico’s vaccination efforts had already tailed off. 

            López Obrador’s administration is using the Cuban vaccine as a booster, even though it was designed for coronavirus variants circulating in 2020 or 2021, not current variants. Few Mexicans have shown up to get the Cuban booster shots.

            In the rush to build his pet project, a tourist train that will run in a rough loop around the Yucatan peninsula, López Obrador has said he will import boatloads of crushed stone ballast from Cuba at great cost.

            The ballast is needed to stabilize the ties of the train tracks. Local stone in the Yucatan is not the right kind, and much has been shipped to Yucatan ports from Mexico’s own Gulf coast.

            López Obrador has long been a fan of Cuba, and frequently plays Cuban “nueva trova” music at his daily news briefings.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged Saturday that the island faces “tremendously difficult challenges,” as he arrived for a visit in Mexico.The Cuban leader blamed the problems on the “blows of nature” and U.S. economic sanctions.“I once again thank our brother nation for its solidarity with the Cuban people, who have faced tremendously difficult challenges in the last few years and months, due to a combination of the blows of nature and the effects of the toughened blockade,” Díaz-Canel said at a welcoming ceremony in the Gulf coast city of Campeche.Díaz-Canel mentioned plans to export crushed stone ballast to Mexico for a train project, and said the two countries “will analyze new goals in areas of common interest.” He also mentioned the Cuban doctors that have been sent to Mexico, and said he would visit some of them during his visit.In 2021, Cuba’s autocratic government faced historic protests amid a severe economic crisis, shortages and blackouts. According to nongovernmental groups, about 1,300 people were arrested following the protests. About 700 sentences have been handed down related to the protests, with some ranging up to 30 years in prison for sedition.And in 2022, a deadly fire destroyed at least half of a large oil storage facility in western Cuba and further weakened the island’s already fragile electricity system. Mexico sent firefighting assistance during that blaze.Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called Díaz-Canel a “distinguished and admired guest” while awarding him the “Order of the Aztec Eagle,” Mexico’s highest honor for foreigners, later Saturday at a ceremony in the Mayan ruin site of Edzna.The award — decided mainly by Mexico's president — has previously been given to leaders ranging from Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran.“The U.S. government should lift, as soon as possible, the unjust and inhuman blockade of the Cuban people,” López Obrador said. “It's time for a new coexistence among all the countries of Latin America.”López Obrador has praised Cuba for sending doctors to Mexico, some of whom serve in dangerous or remote areas. But those doctors, and the salaries they are paid, have raised controversy in Mexico. Some said the jobs should go to Mexican doctors, while other suspected that much of their salaries would go to the Cuban government.As president, López Obrador has opposed U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba, and on Saturday he said U.S. policy “is completely worn out, anachronistic, it has no future or point, and it no longer benefits anyone.”López Obrador has gone out of his way to buy as much as he can from Cuba. But his purchase of everything from Cuban crushed stone ballast to the Abdala coronavirus vaccine have raised eyebrows.Mexico bought 9 million doses of the Cuban-made Abdala vaccine in September 2022, with the doses arriving at year’s end, when Mexico’s vaccination efforts had already tailed off.López Obrador’s administration is using the Cuban vaccine as a booster, even though it was designed for coronavirus variants circulating in 2020 or 2021, not current variants. Few Mexicans have shown up to get the Cuban booster shots.In the rush to build his pet project, a tourist train that will run in a rough loop around the Yucatan peninsula, López Obrador has said he will import boatloads of crushed stone ballast from Cuba at great cost.The ballast is needed to stabilize the ties of the train tracks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807488,Eagles coach Nick Sirianni uses lessons from Frank Reich,"PHOENIX (AP) — Nick Sirianni often credits Frank Reich for his development as a head coach. 

            The mentor also learned from the student.

            Before leading the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl in just his second season as a head coach, Sirianni spent three years as the offensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts under Reich from 2018-20. They also worked together as assistants for three years with the Chargers. 











            While Reich focuses on evaluating his new team in Carolina, Sirianni is preparing the Eagles (16-3) for the Super Bowl against the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) on Sunday.

            Reich hasn’t been surprised by Sirianni’s quick rise.

            “He’s got an incredible ability to connect with players and it’s just authentic, it’s genuine,” Reich told the AP Pro Football Podcast. “It’s easy for him because he cares. He’s just really good at that. He’s also an elite offensive mind. He’s a great game-planner. He’s got that coaching pedigree. We worked together for six years. It was a real highlight. I know he’s always complimentary because I’m like the older brother who mentored him, but trust me, this was a two-way street. We both benefited from it and I’ve learned a lot from that.”

            With the biggest game of his life approaching, Sirianni draws from the lessons he learned from his time working with Reich.

            “Frank would always say this to me: ‘No man suddenly becomes different than his cherished thoughts and habits.’ Meaning no one suddenly becomes different. You are who you’ve been the whole time,” Sirianni said. “This is a bigger game than this or this. They’ve all been big. I show a picture to the team every week of a mountain. There’s the top of the mountain, you can see it, but the guy’s vision is just on the steps right there (ahead). Your focus doesn’t change because the situation or the game around you or the opponent changes. You still focus on one step at a time. The higher you climb on the mountain ... it gets windier, the conditions get tougher, it gets a little steeper, it gets a little harder to breathe. So now what an unbelievable time to just focus on the next step and don’t look up.”

            Sirianni’s success in Philadelphia is largely due to the development of quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was a finalist for AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year. Hurts took a giant leap in his second season in Sirianni’s system.

            Reich didn’t have the opportunity to coach the same starting QB two seasons in a row in Indianapolis after Andrew Luck abruptly retired in 2019. He went from Luck to Jacoby Brissett to Philip Rivers to Carson Wentz to Matt Ryan. 

            The Panthers used three starting quarterbacks while going 7-10 in 2022. Reich knows finding a franchise quarterback is a top priority. He’s working with general manager Scott Fitterer and owner David Tepper to identify the right one.

            “It’s a big deal,” Reich said. “It’s just a question of having a plan and executing the plan. Looking forward to that process. That’ll be very enjoyable, studying the quarterbacks both in college and free agents, everybody that’s available. Every option is open. But the main thing, as we’ve talked about, it’s really looking for stability there. That’s really what you need for the consistency that we want to show.”

            Reich’s return to Carolina where he was the franchise’s first starting quarterback in 1995 allows him to expand “kNot Today,” a nonprofit that works to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation. Reich and his wife, Linda, formed the organization a year after he became the head coach with the Colts. 

            “This is a massive problem,” Reich said. “Fifty million people are estimated to be victims of modern slavery, over 10 million of those are children. Human trafficking and slavery is a $150 billion industry, which should make us all sick. ... Our response is to join together as a team, and everybody do our part. For ‘kNot Today,’ we’re about really trying to do three things. We want to push legislation that will protect children. We want to really focus on prevention education. That’s a really big deal. Last year in the state of Indianapolis, we helped do prevention education for many students. And then we want to help support law enforcement.”

            The Reichs are partnering with International Justice Mission to also help trafficking victims on an international level.

            “They’ve been leaders in this industry for a long time and we’re trying to play our part,” Reich said. “But each one of us have a part, parents, coaches, we all have a part in the process. This is all hands on deck. Let’s each play our part in protecting children from sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807491,"Philadelphia, Kansas City reveling in golden eras in sports","PHOENIX (AP) — Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt remembers the halcyon days of Philadelphia sports in the early 1980s when, during a span of consecutive seasons, the city's four professional sports teams all played for championships.

            The Flyers lost to the Islanders in the Stanley Cup Final. The 76ers fell to the Lakers in the NBA Finals. The Eagles were blown out by the Raiders in the Super Bowl. Only the Phillies — Schmidt and those fabulous Phillies — were successful, beating the Kansas City Royals in six games to win the World Series.

            Schmidt called 1980 a “year that I'll never forget,” not only for that championship but for the start of his long friendship with Royals third baseman George Brett, one that endures to this day but will be put to the test on Sunday.











            Schmidt is pulling for the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Brett, quite naturally, is all-in on the Chiefs.

            “He and I made a bet,” Schmidt said. “Just $20, but the bragging rights are worth millions.”

            There really is no loser in Philadelphia or Kansas City these days. 

            The Phillies are coming off another World Series appearance, and another defeat, this time to the Astros, while the Eagles are trying to avoid a similar fate Sunday night. The Sixers are soaring in the Eastern Conference with Joel Embiid and James Harden, Villanova is coming off a Final Four appearance and the Union played for the Major League Soccer title.

            Even Temple beat Houston a few weeks ago in men's basketball, the third win over a No. 1 team in program history.

            “I live in Atlanta,"" said hoops Hall of Famer Julius Erving, who was a big part of the Sixers' early 1980s success, “so when I turn the radio on, all I hear about is Atlanta sports. So it’s so nice to come back to Philadelphia and know that buzz is here.

            “The town is crazy,” Dr. J added. “Everybody’s feeling themselves.""

            They're feeling warm and fuzzy in Kansas City, too.

            The city straddling the Kansas-Missouri state line long ago shed its old cow-town image, turning into a hipster paradise on the plains. 

            And the dizzying amount of sports on tap in Kansas City, coupled with the success of Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs over the years, have only heightened the sense of civic pride that people are feeling these days.

            “I think the fanbase is unbelievable,” Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. ""I want to be in a place where I can play ball, show my personality and just win man, so yeah. This has been it.”

            The Chiefs are playing in their third Super Bowl in four years and trying to bring home a second Lombardi Trophy in that span. 

            And just across the parking lot, within the past decade, the long-suffering Royals won two American League pennants and a World Series — though they are now in the midst of a massive rebuilding effort.

            Not that they've become irrelevant. They're in the planning stages to replace the aging jewel of Kauffman Stadium with a new downtown stadium, which promises to be the centerpiece of a ballpark village and entertainment complex.

            There's another stadium under construction, too, for the Kansas City Current of the National Women’s Soccer League — the team lost the NWSL title game to the Portland Thorns in late October. Mahomes owns a stake in that club, along with pieces of the Royals and MLS club Sporting Kansas City.

            Next month, the NCAA Tournament is bringing a regional final to T-Mobile Center, and there's a chance Kansas will be there trying to defend its men's basketball national championship. Then in April, the NFL brings its draft circus to town with a sprawling setup centered on the historic Union Station downtown.

            “How can it be better?” asked Kathy Nelson, the chief executive of the Kansas City Sports Commission, who grew up with Brett and the Royals and now is helping to organize the draft and other events in the city.

            “I remember celebrating championships,” she said, “but I don't remember a time when we were this stacked.”

            Most cities have a golden era in sports. Some more than one. And they can sometimes last decades, such as the one in Boston, where over a nearly two-decade span its four pro teams won a combined 12 championships: six Lombardi Trophies for the Patriots, four World Series crowns for the Red Sox, and titles each for the Bruins and Celtics.

            Philadelphia and Kansas City are basking in the glow of one right now.

Some more than one. And they can sometimes last decades, such as the one in Boston, where over a nearly two-decade span its four pro teams won a combined 12 championships: six Lombardi Trophies for the Patriots, four World Series crowns for the Red Sox, and titles each for the Bruins and Celtics.Philadelphia and Kansas City are basking in the glow of one right now.___Gelston reported from Philadelphia.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/12,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807492,Reliever Jason Adam beats Rays in salary arbitration,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Reliever Jason Adam beat Tampa Bay in the first of four arbitration cases involving the Rays and will get $1.775 million instead of the team's offer of $1.55 million.

            Adam was 2-3 with a career-low 1.56 ERA and a career-best eight saves in 67 relief appearances last season, striking out 75 and walking 17 in 63 1/3 innings. The right-hander earned $1.15 million.

            Arbitrators Jasbir Parmar, Margaret Brogan and Stephen Raymond made the decision on Saturday, a day after hearing arguments.











            Tampa Bay also is awaiting decisions in the cases of relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1.175 million) and outfielder Harold Ramirez ($2.2 million vs. $1.9 million). Those decisions are being held for cases involving other players to be argued or settled next week.

            Players and teams have split six decisions.

            All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta, outfielder Kyle Tucker was beat by Houston and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle.

            Pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat Miami.

            A decision also is pending for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe.

            Ten players remain scheduled for hearings, which run through Feb. 17.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807495,Ireland beats France 32-19 in Six Nations thriller,"DUBLIN (AP) — Ireland ended France’s 14-match winning run with a 32-19 bonus-point victory over its biggest rival for the Six Nations title in a breathless game between the world’s top two teams that lived up to its billing on Saturday.

            A gripping first half featuring four tries — three of them to Ireland, including an amazing one-handed finish from James Lowe — gave way to an attritional second half that saw France hang on grimly until center Garry Ringrose went over for the match-clinching 73rd-minute try.

            France, the defending champion, lost for the first time since November 2021 against a team it had beaten in their last three meetings.











            The top-ranked Irish are now firm favorites for a first Six Nations title since 2019, having opened the tournament by collecting five points from hammering Wales 34-10.

            “It was a huge game, two great teams going at each other,"" Ireland coach Andy Farrell said. ""The fighting spirit was great but we also played some great stuff.

            “We could have come away with a few more points but we won’t be greedy because we got the bonus point.”

            Both teams scored stunning tries, with Damian Penaud getting France’s with an effort that began with the winger bursting out of his own 22, exchanging passes with flanker Anthony Jelonch, and then holding off two would-be tacklers to sprint over the line.

            Lowe’s was different — and might have been better. Short of room in the left corner, the winger took off in the air under a challenge from Penaud and managed to ground the ball one-handed near the flag with his body virtually horizontal over the touchline. Footage appeared to show one of his feet scraping the grass while out of touch but the try was given.

            Lock Tadhg Beirne and flyhalf Jonathan Sexton went off injured in the second half for Ireland, which has a two-week break before its third match, away to Italy.

            France, which won in Italy in Round 1, hosts Scotland next with its ambitions of back-to-back Grand Slams having been extinguished at Lansdowne Road, where more than 60,000 spectators witnessed a game of five-star quality and intensity, especially in an end-to-end first half that felt like a basketball game at times.

            “It is almost two years since we have lost, it is hard to take,"" France coach Fabien Galthie said. ""The series of wins are there, now it is necessary to learn how to take a defeat.

            “Defeat is not really a friend, but we will have to spend the day with her.""

            The Irish played like they had a point to prove, with France the only major nation they hadn't beaten since Farrell took over as coach after the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

            Either side of Lowe's try were scores by fullback Hugo Keenan — off a clever move from a ruck where prop Finlay Bealham was first receiver and deceived the French with an inside pass to Keenan — and prop Andrew Porter, who barged over in the 27th after a number of phases near the line.

            Porter's try came while France was playing with 14 men after Uini Atonio was yellow-carded for a dangerous tackle on Rob Herring, whose face was struck by the shoulder of the French prop as he came crashing in for the tackle.

            France didn't concede any more points without Atonio but that was only because of some impressive last-ditch defending, notably from Antoine Dupont, who managed to hold Mack Hansen away from the tryline despite being off-balance. Ireland scrumhalf Conor Murray was held up over the line by prop Cyril Baille and later dropped the ball as he attempted to ground it under pressure.

            Indeed, Thomas Ramos booted over a penalty to trim France's deficit to 19-16 before Atonio returned only for Sexton to kick his own with the last action of the half to re-establish Ireland's six-point lead.

            And that was the cushion Ireland had heading into the final 10 minutes, after Ramos' 62nd-minute dropped goal, before Ringrose shrugged off a French tackler in a rampaging run down the left flank and trundled over to kill off the hopes of France and its 6,000 travelling supporters.

            “We won a Triple Crown last year and we want to go better this year,” Sexton said. “That’s what we speak about, keeping the trajectory like this as opposed to in 2019 when we dipped.

            “To get better is to win the championship or a Grand Slam. How you do that is concentrate on the next two weeks and try and beat Italy away.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807499,Bayern Munich win over Frankfurt underlines duopoly,"The stakes were clear even before Bayern's Sarah Zadrazil set the tone with a crunching early tackle: the winner would continue on with their title challenge, the loser would have to admit defeat.Eintracht were lively, zipping around frenetically with quick, short passing and harrassing their opponents out of possession. When the pressure was intense, however, they fell short.""We're close in terms of potential,"" Laura Freigang told DW post-match. ""But when it really counts, we need to score goals and win the games. We don't always want to say that we did quite well.""Frankfurt did much better than quite well; they tackled the match with energy and enthusiasm. But Freigang's frustrations were valid.Led by a barking Niko Arnautis on the sidelines, who more than once traded barbs with the Bayern bench, Frankfurt were not outclassed. And yet they still struggled to take control of the match when it was within their grasp. Breaking apart the Bundesliga duopoly of Bayern and Wolfsburg remains a step too far.""What makes the difference at this level is actually winning games,"" Freigang added.""It doesn't have to be pretty, it just has to be effective. And that's the step forward that we need to take.""For Bayern it was a test of character as much as quality as they remained calm in the face of their hectic opposition. With their backs against the wall, they stuck true to their system and gradually asserted their dominance.“That was important for us, to play our own game,"" captain Lina Magull told DW. ""When you realize that the game is somehow hectic or chaotic, then you need to find a way to set the rhythm.""Bayern slowed the game down and looked to stretch their opponents as they grabbed control of the match. And after weathering that opening Eintracht onslaught, they took the lead when center-back Goddis Viggosdottir ghosted into the box to head home from a corner in the 25th minute.""It was important to score the goal from a set piece, because sometimes that helps when a game is going back and forth,"" Magull said.Magull and Zadrazil had golden chances to put Bayern further ahead in the first half, but the decisive goal finally arrived in the 79th minute. With Eintracht pushing forward, Lea Schüller made a clever, darting run behind the defense and finished one-on-one against Stina Johannes.Lara Prasnikar's strike from a Freigang backheel in the 82nd minute to make it 2-1 proved a mere consolation. The visitors just didn't have enough to break their way through. It was a similar story in the 0-0 draw between these two sides on the Bundesliga's opening matchday.Alexander Strauss has forged the league's best defense in Munich, built on the partnership of Viggosdottir and Tainara. Bayern have now conceded just four goals in 12 Bundesliga matches and that structural backbone allows the team to ride through waves of pressure when they're not at their best.""Our defense has been really important this season. Because sometimes we play risky up front and when we lose the ball we need it,"" Magull said.""Frankfurt are really strong on the counter attack, so it was really important to have good protection and a good defensive structure.""Bayern could and should have won by a larger margin. Klara Bühl stung Stina's hands from a freekick midway through the second half, before Carolin Simon saw an effort smack back off the post.They could have been forgiven a bit of rustiness after the team's restart to the season got off to a rocky start with an abandoned match against Turbine Potsdam last weekend. Yet the stuttered preparations didn't seem to phase them as they once again stamped their mark over their domestic rivals.Wolfsburg remain in the driving seat at the top of the Bundesliga, but this result means a title race is still on the cards. For Bayern, that is. Eintracht will have to wait another year to see if they can raise their game to the next level.Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/02/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807501,Protest outside UK asylum-seeker hotel ends in 15 arrests,"LONDON (AP) — An anti-migration protest outside a hotel housing asylum-seekers in northwest England turned violent and resulted in the arrests of 15 people, local police said Saturday.

            The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley, a village located 13.5 kilometers (8.4 miles) from the city of Liverpool.

            The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire. The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained “following violent disorder.”











            “A number of individuals who turned up at the Suites Hotel last night were intent on using a planned protest to carry out violent and despicable behavior,"" Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said. ""They turned up armed with hammers and fireworks to cause as much trouble as they could, and their actions could have resulted in members of the public and police officers being seriously injured, or worse,"" 

            Speculation on social media about a man accused of making inappropriate advances toward a teenage girl in a nearby town might have triggered the demonstration outside the hotel, Kennedy said. The man in his 20s was arrested elsewhere in England on Thursday “on suspicion of a public order offense” but later released on the advice of child protective services, she said. 

            George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the U.K. Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community.

            “The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety,” he said. “Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community.”

            Britain takes in fewer asylum-seekers than some other European countries, including France and Germany, but has seen a sharp increase in the number of people trying to reach the U.K. across the English Channel in dinghies and other small boats.

            More than 45,000 people reached Britain by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum. The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many migrants stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodation.

            
                The Channel crossings have become a hot political issue, with the Conservative government promising to “stop the boats.” Opponents accuse the government of demonizing desperate people fleeing war and poverty.

            In October, a man firebombed a processing center for new arrivals in the Channel port of Dover. Police said he was motivated by far-right ideology. He killed himself after the attack.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807503,Duke: Whitehead available to return at No. 8 Virginia,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Touted Duke freshman Dariq Whitehead is set to return for Saturday's game at No. 8 Virginia after missing four games with an injury.

            The school announced that Whitehead would be available about five hours before tipoff.

            The 6-foot-7, 220-pound wing had suffered a sprain in his lower left leg in a loss at Virginia Tech in an injury that looked potentially serious.











            He had been hurt when he jumped to knock a ball away from Hokies forward Justyn Mutts. He grabbed at the back of his lower leg near his ankle as he landed. He ended the night on crutches with ice wrapped around his leg.

            First-year coach Jon Scheyer said Whitehead had avoided a season-ending injury but he didn't have a clear timeline to return.

            Whitehead had averaged 8.4 points and 2.3 rebounds in his 16 appearances, starting his last five games. He arrived at Duke as the 247sports’ No. 2-ranked recruit as part of the nation’s top-ranked recruiting class.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807504,Brock Purdy doesn't mind competing with Trey Lance to start,"PHOENIX (AP) — Brock Purdy doesn’t mind competing for a starting job after going 7-1 and bringing the San Francisco 49ers within one game of the Super Bowl.

            Purdy and the 49ers fell way short in the NFC championship game after he injured his elbow. He eventually returned to close out the 31-7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles when backup Josh Johnson suffered a concussion but he couldn’t throw.

            Purdy told the AP the “internal brace” procedure that he’ll undergo on Feb. 22 to repair the tear in his ulnar collateral ligament requires a six-month recovery process. He’s expected to start throwing after three months. A reconstructive Tommy John surgery would’ve kept him out for the entire 2023 season.











            With Niners coach Kyle Shanahan already saying veteran Jimmy Garoppolo won’t return, 2021 first-round pick Trey Lance will likely enter the offseason as the starter. Lance is recovering from a broken ankle sustained in Week 2.

            “At the end of the day, both Trey and I, we want to win. We want to bring a Super Bowl back to San Francisco. We want to do whatever it takes,” Purdy told the AP Pro Football Podcast. “And, if that takes us competing and bring out the best during camp, so be it. Let’s do it. And so we’re both excited to get back after it this year. But first things first, we both have to get healthy.”

            Purdy’s goal is to be ready for training camp, but that’ll only be five months post-surgery. 

            “We’ll see what happens and how I feel post-surgery and how the process is going,” Purdy said. “But yeah, that’s the plan is to get back for camp and be ready for the whole season.”

            Purdy went from being the last pick in the 2022 NFL draft to finishing third in voting for AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.

            He threw for 1,374 yards with 13 touchdowns and only four interceptions in the regular season and his 108 passer rating in the regular season and playoffs was highest ever for a rookie with at least 200 passes.

            “Going all the way throughout the whole season with all the ups and downs, with people going down and then getting on a hot streak at the end and losing in the NFC championship, it was tough,” Purdy said. “But everything happens for a reason, man. And, we’re looking at the bright things and trusting that God is working through all of this.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807506,"Müller sets record, scores to keep Bayern top in Bundesliga","BERLIN (AP) — Thomas Müller set a Bayern Munich record for Bundesliga appearances and celebrated by scoring in a 3-0 win over Bochum to keep the defending champions on top on Saturday.

            It was Müller's 428th league appearance for Bayern, one more than club great Gerd Müller, and the most for any outfield player at the club. Only goalkeepers Oliver Kahn (429) and Sepp Meier (473) have played more Bundesliga games for Bayern.

            Müller capitalized on a botched backpass from Bochum defender Saidy Janko to break the deadlock in the 41st minute.











            Bayern substitute Kingsley Coman finished some fine combination play in the 64th and Serge Gnabry sealed it with a penalty in the 73rd after he was fouled by the luckless Janko.

            It kept Bayern one point clear of Union Berlin, which came from behind to beat Leipzig 2-1 again in the late game.

            Bayern next visits Paris Saint-Germain the Champions League. Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann was evidently thinking of Tuesday’s game when he took Müller off at halftime and gave some time off to João Cancelo, Jamal Musiala, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Leroy Sané.

            Nagelsmann said he took Müller off as a precaution because of a calf problem and he thinks the veteran will be fit for Paris.

            UNION'S INCREDIBLE RUN

            Union defeated Leipzig 2-1 for the fifth consecutive time in the Bundesliga and ended Leipzig’s 18-game unbeaten run across all competitions. Leipzig hadn’t lost at home in the league since its previous 2-1 loss on Union’s last visit.

            “It's a bit surreal,” Union captain Rani Khedira said of passing the club's preseason target of 40 points for Bundesliga survival.

            The visiting fans stayed silent for the first 15 minutes in protest against Leipzig, disliked by rivals as a marketing tool for Red Bull since its formation by the energy drinks manufacturer in 2009. The fans held banners saying “In Leipzig just Chemie and Lok,” referring to the city’s traditional clubs.

            Benjamin Henrichs let fly to put Leipzig ahead in the 24th, but the visitors improved in the second half and Janik Haberer equalized with a perfectly struck volley from the edge of the penalty area in the 61st.

            Leipzig defender Mohamed Simakan then conceded a penalty for attacking the ball with his arm. Robin Knoche scored what proved to be the winner from the spot in the 72nd.

            Yussuf Poulsen had an equalizer ruled out through VAR for offside and Union held on for a club-record fifth consecutive Bundesliga win, its sixth including the German Cup.

            DORTMUND KEEPS CHASE

            Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzić’s changes again paid off in a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen that stretched the team’s winning run to six games across all competitions this year. 

            “We've always said, there are players who start for us, players who finish games for us, and players who decide games for us,” Terzić said of substitute Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, who broke the deadlock in the 67th. “It's the 10th time in the Bundesliga that a player has scored for us from the bench. We also had it in the Champions League and cup.”

            Bremen goalkeeper Jiří Pavlenka kept the visitors at bay until Terzić brought Bynoe-Gittens on for Gio Reyna, who'd made his first start since Nov. 11. The English teenager scored a minute later, firing inside the top corner to beat Pavlenka. 

            Julian Brandt sealed the win with a brilliant finish in the 85th after good work from Raphaël Guerreiro to set him up.

            Dortmund forward Youssoufa Moukoko went off injured in the first half.

            Dortmund next hosts Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday.

            MATARAZZO’S UNFORTUNATE DEBUT

            Pellegrino Matarazzo’s debut as Hoffenheim coach ended with a 3-1 defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen. The New Jersey-born Matarazzo was appointed coach on Wednesday, two days after the club fired André Breitenreiter.

            Vincenzo Grifo scored two penalties for Freiburg to beat relegation-threatened Stuttgart 2-1 and Lee Jae-sung scored twice to help Mainz defeat Augsburg 3-1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807509,Some Super Bowl players claimed by more than one school,"PHOENIX (AP) — Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts played three seasons at Alabama and led the Crimson Tide to a national title game appearance as a freshman. He accounted for 53 total touchdowns and was a second-place Heisman finisher during his lone season with Oklahoma. 

            So which school now gets to claim this season’s NFL MVP runner-up and Super Bowl starter? 

            At a time in college football when the transfer portal is heating up, so is the claiming debate. For players who switched schools while playing college ball, it can be tricky to decide which school gets the honor of claiming that player as one of its own. For Hurts, both Alabama and Oklahoma seem to be doing so, with the Crimson Tide and Sooners showing love to the quarterback over the past couple of weeks. 











            Hurts appears to be OK with both teams, too. During an appearance on “The Dan Patrick Show” in 2021, he declined to choose between the two. He mentioned earlier this season that “he went to Alabama too” in response to a question about Oklahoma, while also responding “Boomer” to a reporter opening a question with “Boomer Sooner” on Thursday.

            It goes beyond Hurts. College teams never pass up the chance to shout out players, especially those in the Super Bowl, who have made contributions to their programs. Notre Dame posted quite the graphic for alum Ian Book that looks a bit like he led the Eagles to the Super Bowl. In reality, he’s the third-string quarterback who hasn’t stepped on the field this season.

            Penn State got some ribbing prior to last year’s Super Bowl with a graphic, now deleted, that read in a large font, “A Penn Stater Has Appeared In Every Super Bowl,” which was followed by “Except For Five Since 1967.” Internet trolls had a field day.

            The debate over claiming players who started for multiple schools will persist. While fans and media members seem to drive the debate, it’s not clear how most players feel about it. 

            At least 10 players who are set to play this Sunday transferred at some point to a different school. Eagles cornerback Zech McPhearson started his college career at Penn State but transferred to Texas Tech after three seasons with the Nittany Lions.

            McPhearson graduated from Penn State and said he has love for the university and coach James Franklin, but he also said there comes a time where “love should go both ways.” He said he doesn’t get any of the gear boxes that are sent to lettermen, joking that he has to swipe a T-shirt from Miles Sanders on occasion. McPhearson is rolling with Texas Tech when it comes to the claiming debate.

            “I’m a proud Penn State alumni. I graduated from there,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think Texas Tech owns most of the rights. I put my time in there and made an impact that helped the university win some games. I had a great time there. No shame on Penn State.""

            Philadelphia quarterback Gardner Minshew has an unusual perspective on the topic, as he attended four different colleges from 2015 to 2018. He said he has no problem with any of them claiming him, but he calls himself a Washington State Cougar because it was ""home"" for him.

            The majority of the transfer players at the Super Bowl appear to not have a preference, including Eagles running back Trey Sermon and offensive linemen Jack Driscoll and Landon Dickerson, as well as Chiefs safety Bryan Cook, quarterback Shane Buechele, and defensive end Mike Danna.

            “I don’t get (the debate),” Dickerson said. “I got a degree from Florida State. I got a degree from Alabama. If they’re trying to, you know, summarize this guy’s entire career into one college, you’re doing a disservice to him.” 

            Dickerson mentioned both schools shaped who he is today, noting he met his fiancee at Florida State and won a national title at Alabama.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLPHOENIX (AP) — Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts played three seasons at Alabama and led the Crimson Tide to a national title game appearance as a freshman. He accounted for 53 total touchdowns and was a second-place Heisman finisher during his lone season with Oklahoma.So which school now gets to claim this season’s NFL MVP runner-up and Super Bowl starter?At a time in college football when the transfer portal is heating up, so is the claiming debate. For players who switched schools while playing college ball, it can be tricky to decide which school gets the honor of claiming that player as one of its own. For Hurts, both Alabama and Oklahoma seem to be doing so, with the Crimson Tide and Sooners showing love to the quarterback over the past couple of weeks.Hurts appears to be OK with both teams, too. During an appearance on “The Dan Patrick Show” in 2021, he declined to choose between the two. He mentioned earlier this season that “he went to Alabama too” in response to a question about Oklahoma, while also responding “Boomer” to a reporter opening a question with “Boomer Sooner” on Thursday.It goes beyond Hurts. College teams never pass up the chance to shout out players, especially those in the Super Bowl, who have made contributions to their programs. Notre Dame posted quite the graphic for alum Ian Book that looks a bit like he led the Eagles to the Super Bowl. In reality, he’s the third-string quarterback who hasn’t stepped on the field this season.Penn State got some ribbing prior to last year’s Super Bowl with a graphic, now deleted, that read in a large font, “A Penn Stater Has Appeared In Every Super Bowl,” which was followed by “Except For Five Since 1967.” Internet trolls had a field day.The debate over claiming players who started for multiple schools will persist. While fans and media members seem to drive the debate, it’s not clear how most players feel about it.At least 10 players who are set to play this Sunday transferred at some point to a different school. Eagles cornerback Zech McPhearson started his college career at Penn State but transferred to Texas Tech after three seasons with the Nittany Lions.McPhearson graduated from Penn State and said he has love for the university and coach James Franklin, but he also said there comes a time where “love should go both ways.” He said he doesn’t get any of the gear boxes that are sent to lettermen, joking that he has to swipe a T-shirt from Miles Sanders on occasion. McPhearson is rolling with Texas Tech when it comes to the claiming debate.“I’m a proud Penn State alumni. I graduated from there,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think Texas Tech owns most of the rights. I put my time in there and made an impact that helped the university win some games. I had a great time there. No shame on Penn State.""Philadelphia quarterback Gardner Minshew has an unusual perspective on the topic, as he attended four different colleges from 2015 to 2018. He said he has no problem with any of them claiming him, but he calls himself a Washington State Cougar because it was ""home"" for him. Chiefs punter Tommy Townsend, similarly, doesn’t mind if Tennessee or Florida wants to call him their own, but said he has to stay true to the Gators.The majority of the transfer players at the Super Bowl appear to not have a preference, including Eagles running back Trey Sermon and offensive linemen Jack Driscoll and Landon Dickerson, as well as Chiefs safety Bryan Cook, quarterback Shane Buechele, and defensive end Mike Danna.“I don’t get (the debate),” Dickerson said. “I got a degree from Florida State.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807510,Wolverhampton stuns Southampton with 2-1 comeback win,"SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) — João Gomes scored in the 87th minute to help 10-man Wolverhampton complete a 2-1 comeback victory over last-placed Southampton in the English Premier League on Saturday.

            Gomes' clinical strike came 15 minutes after Jan Bednarek's own goal canceled out Carlos Alcaraz's first-half goal for Southampton.

            The manner of the loss — allowing two goals despite playing more than an hour with a man advantage — was sure to pile more pressure on Saints manager Nathan Jones.











            Gomes, a Brazilian midfielder who joined the club last month, scored after his first attempt was blocked. He calmly fired his rebound into the top right corner of the net at St. Mary’s Stadium.

            Bednarek blocked Adama Traoré's close-range shot but bundled the ball over his own goal-line as he turned to try to clear it in the 72nd minute.

            Alcaraz, a 20-year-old Argentine midfielder who joined the Saints last month, put the hosts ahead in the 24th on a second-effort shot that went in off the left post.

            Wolverhampton went down a man three minutes later when Mario Lemina picked up his second yellow card and was sent off after appearing to complain to referee Jarred Gillett about a non-call.

            Coming off a 3-0 win over Liverpool, Wolverhampton has won back-to-back league games for the first time this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807511,Arsenal stumbles again in 1-1 draw with Brentford in EPL,"LONDON (AP) — Arsenal’s grip on the English Premier League lead is suddenly looking shaky.

            The Gunners were held by Brentford to 1-1 at Emirates Stadium on Saturday, dropping points for the second game in a row and giving Manchester City renewed hope of overtaking them atop the table.

            The result means City can cut Arsenal’s lead to three points with a home win over Aston Villa on Sunday. With Arsenal then hosting City on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola’s team would go top on goal difference if it wins both matches — although the Gunners have played one game less. 











            Leandro Trossard’s first Arsenal goal gave the hosts the lead in the 66th minute when he steered in a cross from Bukayo Saka. But Ivan Toney equalized with a close-range header eight minutes later after the Gunners failed to clear a free kick.

            Coming off a 1-0 loss at Everton last weekend, Arsenal looked flat again for much of the game and was even fortunate not to be behind at the break as Brentford wasted two great chances.

            Toney's cross from the right evaded Arsenal defenders to give Rico Henry an opportunity to score into an open net, but the full back couldn’t make clean contact with the ball and it sailed wide.

            Toney then nearly scored in the 25th after Bryan Mbeumo teed him up inside the area, but the striker’s shot hit the corner of the goal frame.

            With Arsenal’s attack sputtering, Trossard came off the bench to provide a much-needed spark. The former Brighton forward, who joined Arsenal in the January transfer window, was on hand at the far post to slot the ball into an empty net after being picked out by Saka.

            But the lead didn’t last long.

            After Arsenal couldn’t clear an in swinging free kick into the area, Brentford kept the ball alive with three straight headers before Christian Norgaard squared the ball across the goalmouth, where Toney had an easy header into an empty net. The Brentford celebrations were put on hold for a lengthy VAR check for a possible offside before the goal was allowed to stand.

            Arteta, though, insisted the goal should have been disallowed because Ethan Pinnock was offside when he blocked Arsenal defender Gabriel from getting to the ball in the leadup. 

            “I just looked back and it is offside, yes,” Arteta said. “You cannot block if you are offside.”

            Oleksandr Zinchenko shot narrowly wide in the 80th as Arsenal looked for an immediate response but the hosts never came closer to a winner. 

            For Bentford, it's now 10 games unbeaten in the league after another big result against the traditional top teams. 

            Thomas Frank's team has beaten Manchester United, Man City and Liverpool this season, with draws against Chelsea, Tottenham and now Arsenal.

            “We have this secret sauce at the training ground that we give to the players every lunch. No, I wish it was that, that would be a good story,” Frank said. “It’s insane that it’s possible for us with the second lowest budget to be unbeaten and all 10 games well deserved wins or draws. It’s not like we’re crawling over the line. That’s maybe even more impressive.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807522,Fulham beats Forest 2-0 to end visitor's unbeaten run,"LONDON (AP) — Fulham ended Nottingham Forest’s five-game unbeaten run in the English Premier League with a deserved 2-0 win at Craven Cottage on Saturday.

            A goal in either half from Willian and substitute Manor Solomon earned Marco Silva’s team a first victory in four matches and lifted it up to seventh in the standings.

            Forest remained just six points above the relegation zone after a subdued performance.











            The visitor endured a cruel and record-breaking blow after only seven minutes, losing central defensive pair Willy Boly and Scott McKenna to injury — the earliest in league history that a team replaced two of the starting XI.

            Fulham did not need long to take advantage of Forest’s misfortune. 

            Bobby Decordova-Reid's cross was only half-cleared by Renan Lodi and the ball fell to Willian, who cut inside the Forest defender and blasted a shot into the top corner in the 20th minute for Fulham’s first league goal since Jan. 12.

            Forest, clearly rocked by its early bad luck, was clinging on. Decordova-Reid smacked the crossbar with a crisp, flying drive from 25 yards that had Navas beaten, then Andreas Pereira collected Willian’s ball inside and hit a curling shot with his left foot that went just wide.

            The second half brought little respite for Cooper’s side as Fulham’s confidence and control of the game started to build.

            Cooper sent on Jonjo Shelvey for his Forest debut in search of greater presence in midfield, but the direction of the tide would not turn. Instead, it was Fulham which struck the woodwork for a third time when Pereira’s 25-yard free kick bounced off the crossbar.

            Finally, Forest threatened as Emmanuel Dennis fired narrowly over in the 65th and, moments later, Serge Aurier's header was brilliantly beaten away at point-blank range by Bernd Leno.

            Forest kept up a vague, lingering threat almost until the end, but it was Fulham which had the last word when substitute Solomon, on for the excellent Willian, drilled past Keylor Navas two minutes from time for his first Fulham goal since joining from Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk in the offseason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807523,"Palestinian man, Israeli child die as bloodshed rises","JERUSALEM (AP) — An Israeli settler shot and killed a Palestinian in the northern West Bank on Saturday, Palestinian health officials said, while an 8-year-old child died of injuries suffered a day before in a car-ramming attack in Jerusalem.

            As night fell, warning sirens sounded in southern Israel when Palestinian militants fired a rocket from the Gaza Strip that was intercepted by Israeli aerial defenses, the Israeli military said. There was no immediate statement from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza. 

            Saturday's events were the latest escalation in months of surging violence in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. 











            In the northern West Bank, near Salfit, a farming village of olive groves, video footage showed Israeli settlers racing down the hills and tearing into the town. As Palestinians poured into the streets to see what was going on, an Israeli settler opened fire, killing a 27-year-old villager, said Ghassan Douglas, a Palestinian official who monitors Israeli settlements in the Nablus region. The settlers dispersed when the Israeli military arrived, he said.

            The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the villager who was killed as Methqal Rayan and said he was shot in the head. Video shared by the village council shows the settlers firing at least 10 gunshots toward the residents. 

            Douglas said that the northern West Bank has seen an intense wave of settler violence in recent days. On Friday, he said, just after the car-ramming attack in Jerusalem that killed three Israelis, settlers similarly streamed into the village and stole several sheep from a farmer. Settlers attacked and wounded Palestinians who tried to defend the farmer, he said. 

            Israeli police opened an investigation into the shooting of the Palestinian, the military said. It said Israeli security forces de-escalated the situation after the Palestinian was taken to the hospital.

            In Jerusalem, Asher Menahem Paley, 8, died a day after a Palestinain man rammed a car into a bus stop in an Israeli settlement in the eastern half of the contested capital, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem announced his death Saturday. His 6-year-old brother was killed in the car-ramming, along with a man in his 20s. 

            After the attack, Israel's new hard-line government vowed a harsh response. Almost immediately, Israeli police arrested and interrogated the relatives of the suspected assailant, 32-year-old Hussein Qaraqa from the gritty east Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya. 

            Qaraqa’s family said he was born in Jerusalem but has family in Bethlehem. His uncle, 63-year-old Adnan Qaraqa in Bethlehem, told The Associated Press that his nephew had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. 

            Qaraqa said Hussein's mental problems started in 2008, when he was arrested for the first of several minor offenses. He alleged that Israeli interrogators badly beat Hussein in detention, from which he emerged “irrevocably changed.” 

            A few years later, Hussein fell from a crane at a construction site, his uncle said, sustaining a severe injury that worsened his mental condition. Hussein bounced between psychiatric wards for years, Qaraqa added, and was released from a hospital just two days before plowing into the crowded bus stop on Friday. 

            The West Bank has been on edge since Israel stepped up raids in the territory last spring, following a series of deadly Palestinian attacks inside Israel.

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those territories since 2004, according to leading Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Last year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

            The pace of death has quickened this year. So far, 45 Palestinians have been killed, according to a count by The Associated Press. Palestinians have killed 10 people on the Israeli side during that time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807525,Conte's return ruined as Tottenham loses at Leicester 4-1,"LEICESTER, England (AP) — Manager Antonio Conte's return to the dugout was a miserable one as his Tottenham was humiliated at Leicester 4-1 in the English Premier League on Saturday.

            Nampalys Mendy’s first goal in more than six years inspired Leicester to the comeback win after Rodrigo Bentancur briefly gave Spurs the lead.

            James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Harvey Barnes also netted for the hosts and Leicester scored four for the second straight game.











            Conte returned after gallbladder surgery but his team failed to build on its impressive victory over Manchester City. The error-strewn performance left it a point adrift of the top four having played two games more. Tottenham visits AC Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday.

            For Leicester, its second revival of the season continues after last week’s 4-2 win at Aston Villa.

            Victory even came after a poor start where it gifted Tottenham a 14th-minute opener as Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen attempted to clear a corner but succeeded in only finding Bentancur who tapped in from close range.

            Spurs were on top but it took just 11 minutes for the Foxes to turn the game. They had barely threatened but levelled through an unlikely source.

            Mendy had not scored in his previous 108 Leicester appearances after joining in 2016 but when Bentancur’s header reached the midfielder on the edge of the box he unleashed an angled rocket which flew past Fraser Forster.

            Two minutes later, it got better for the hosts and captain for the day Maddison. Ben Davies’ loose pass was cleared by Wout Faes to Iheanacho, who turned and found the unmarked Maddison to sweep in his ninth goal of the season.

            Leicester was suddenly rampant and Forster kept out Iheanacho as the Spurs defense imploded.

            It was a game littered with errors and Spurs added another gaffe to the catalogue when the Foxes went 3-1 up in first-half injury time.

            Harry Souttar launched a clearance upfield and Iheanacho was given too much space to run at Eric Dier. He checked inside to the edge of the area, dummied and then found the bottom corner.

            Ragged Tottenham hardly improved after the break and Forster needed to save from Barnes.

            With 20 minutes remaining, the visitors needed VAR to rescue them when Barnes converted Iheanacho’s pass. But there was no stopping the winger adding a fourth and sealing victory 11 minutes later.

            The generous Tottenham defense first allowed Maddison to advance and slip Barnes in and he turned and beat Forster from 20 yards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807529,PSG lose again to Monaco on eve of Bayern Munich visit,"PARIS (AP) — A weakened Paris Saint-Germain lost a second straight game in all competitions to Monaco 3-1 in the French league on Saturday, three days before facing Bayern Munich.

            Monaco climbed to third place, seven points behind a rattled PSG, whose lead was cut to five points after second-placed Marseille beat Clermont 2-0.

            Undefeated in all competitions from August to December, PSG has become fragile. It lost to Lens and Rennes in the league last month and was knocked out by Marseille in the last 16 of the French Cup on Wednesday.











            “We have conceded a lot of goals since the restart of the season,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. “We must rediscover our balance, defensively.” 

            Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe were out injured but Neymar played.

            Bayern comes on Tuesday for the first leg in the Champions League round of 16.

            Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice for Monaco. His blocked shot rebounded for Aleksandr Golovin to beat PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the fourth minute.

            Ben Yedder doubled the lead in the 18th as Monaco pressed high up the pitch. Krepin Diatta dispossessed El Chadaille Bitshiabu and Ben Yedder buried an angled strike into the far corner.

            Teenage midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery pulled one back for PSG by tapping home a low cross from Juan Bernat in the 39th.

            But Ben Yedder restored Monaco’s two-goal lead moments before halftime with a curling shot off the post. He tied Reims striker Folarin Balogun as the top scorer in the league with 14.

            Donnarumma prevented PSG being in a bigger hole by halftime. He parried a close-range header from Ruben Aguilar and denied Golovin, who was clean through on goal. 

            Monaco managed the game in the second half and Donnarumma saved a low effort from substitute Takumi Minamino in stoppage time.

            The kickoff of the Clermont-Marseille game was delayed by 45 minutes because police used tear gas to stop fighting outside the stadium. As some players struggled to breathe, the referee Ruddy Buquet sent both teams back to the dressing room.

            Chile striker Alexis Sanchez gave Marseille the lead in the 44th by converting a penalty after Muhammed Cham raised his arm to deflect a free kick from Ruslan Malinovskyi. 

            Sanchez added a second goal in the 81st by heading in a rebound after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper Mory Diaw.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807533,France: Air traffic controllers join pension reform protest,"Hundreds of thousands of French protesters marched nationwide on Saturday, decrying plans to reform the pension system and push back retirement age by two years. Protests took place in Paris, as well as other cities such as Nice, Marseille, Toulouse and Nantes.In addition, air traffic controllers at Paris's second largest airport, Orly, walked off their jobs in solidarity. The strike caused the cancellation of up to half the flights scheduled to take off on Saturday.Protesters included many young people, including students who said they hadn't been able to join previous demonstrations due to their studies. Many of them held banners with slogans about their parents being affected by the planned reforms.""I don't want my parents to die at work,'' one banner held by a teenage boy read.Protests against the pension reform plans have recently intensified, as the government of President Emmanuel Macron gears up for inking the plans.Reforming the country's pension system was on Macron's platform both during the 2017 and 2022 elections.The president and his administration argue that the reforms are ""indispensable"" for the pension system's survival. He says the pension fund is experiencing a looming deficit that must be dealt with, as France's population gets older.Macron argues that the population would have to work a little more to keep the pension fund in balance. To achieve this, the new system raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.However, critics insist the government must find alternative ways to finance the pension fund. They also argue that increasing the years of work in some strenuous, manual labor professions would not be physically possible.Despite nationwide resistance, Macron is set on delivering his campaign promise and reforming the retirement system.Earlier this week, lawmakers began debating the new pension bill in parliament, where Macron's centrist party lost its absolute majority last year. They now have to rely on the opposition conservative Republicans to pass the bill.However, the bill faces reservations from many members of parliament, including from Macron's own faction, who fear it might instigate crippling strikes.Labor unions and left-wing lawmakers are working hard to block the bill.In a joint statement on Saturday, unions condemned the government as ""deaf,"" urging for the bill to be scrapped. They threatened to conduct a nationwide strike on March 7 that could ""bring France to a standstill"" should their demands go unanswered.Saturday's protest was the fourth large-scale demonstration against the pension reform this year.rmt/dj (AP, dpa)",2023/02/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807534,Poland's Duda sends new judicial reform law for court review,"Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro on Saturday praised President Andrzej Duda's decision to send a new law on judicial accountability for review in the Constitutional Court.Lawmakers at the powerful lower house of parliament, or Sejm, approved the bill earlier this week. The parliament is narrowly controlled by the ruling Law and Justice Party and its junior partners.The legal changes were crafted to unlock coronavirus recovery funds that have been held up by the EU. Brussels has repeatedly criticized Poland's right-wing government, insisting that Warsaw is  undermining the bloc's rule of law principles and judiciary independence.The EU Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, reacted on Twitter saying: ""I take note of the adoption by the Sejm of the new law on the judiciary.""In a televised address on Friday, President Duda said he needed to make sure the new law was in agreement with the Polish constitution before he approved it.Since taking power in 2015, Duda's Law and Justice Party has overhauled Poland's justice system and given the ruling party power over the courts and appointment of judges.The controversial judicial reform law was widely condemned by EU leaders and in 2021, the European Court of Justice ruled that Poland violated European law.The EU has called for Poland to make essential changes to its judicial reform law before it can receive €35 billion ($37 billion) of pandemic recovery funds.The upcoming judicial accountability law is aimed at doing that, though there's no response from the EU on whether the amendments meet its expectations. Some previous changes proposed by Poland did not go far enough for the EU.""It is good that [Duda] decided … to send the law to the Constitutional Court,"" rather than signing it, Justice Minister Ziobro said on Saturday.Ziobro's conservative United Poland party, which is a junior partner in coalition with the ruling Law and Justice, had requested an outright veto of the law.But Ziobro said that the decision to appeal for constitutional review was ""a better decision than signing the law, which wouldn't have solved anything.""""We wouldn't receive funds from the national recovery plan (KPO),"" he said, referring to an EU fund designed to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The law would ""worsen the disorganization, chaos and rebellion in the Polish judiciary,"" he claimed.The minister fired two regional court heads in 2021, which was eventually condemned in a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling.Ziobro said that officials are trying to force a ""change in government in Poland using the European Commission.""""It is clear from the statements of European Union politicians that further demands would be made,"" he said. ""A politics of concessions is bad politics. A politics of complying with blackmail leads to an escalation of the blackmail.""rm, sdi/dj (dpa, AP)",2023/02/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807536,New Hampshire students protest urinal ban in gender debate,"Dozens of students walked out of their New Hampshire school after the district banned urinals in a compromise to a proposal that would have blocked children from using facilities based on their gender identity.

            The school board decided a few days before the Friday walkout to prohibit students at Milford Middle School and Milford High School from using urinals or shared spaces in locker rooms.

            The ban in a town of about 15,000 people roughly 35 miles (56 kilometers) from Concord, New Hampshire's capital, was the culmination of a long debate about district rules about bathroom use and gender identity. District procedures say students can access the bathroom that “corresponds to their gender identity consistently asserted at school.”











            That procedure still applies. But a proposal that came before the school board called for no longer allowing students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity. Board member Noah Boudreault said he proposed new restrictions on bathroom use as part of a compromise.

            “I want to be clear, it was a compromise to both sides of this issue,” Boudreault said. “It was out into effect last week.”

            Under the new policy, the maximum occupancy for each bathroom and locker room will be capped at the number of stalls it contains. It also prevents students from using shared changing areas.

            The students demonstrated for about 45 minutes after the walkout. Some held signs, at least one of which said: “We want urinals.”

            Republicans across the country have been pushing anti-transgender legislation. While New Hampshire bans discrimination based on gender identity in housing, employment and public accommodations, state lawmakers are considering legislation that says public entities are capable of “differentiating between the male and female sexes in athletic competitions, criminal incarceration, or places of intimate privacy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807537,Six Nations: Scotland routs Wales 35-7 for back-to-back wins,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Scotland has opened with back-to-back wins for the first time in the Six Nations era.

            The boys in blue might even be ready for a title bid after enigmatic flyhalf Finn Russell inspired their biggest ever win against Wales, a five-try 35-7 result at Murrayfield on Saturday that backed up a 29-23 victory away to England last week.

            A trip to Paris to meet defending champion France in Round 3 will be the real test for the Scots, who overwhelmed Wales except for a period late in the first half when they were down to 14 men and conceded a try to Ken Owens off a rolling maul.











            George Turner was the Scotland player sin-binned — for a swinging arm in the face of George North — but the hooker had already made a difference by scoring the first try in the 30th minute.

            The Welsh were in striking distance at halftime, trailing just 13-7, but Russell put them away midway in the second half by setting up two tries for Kyle Steyn with a couple of pieces of brilliance.

            The flyhalf first produced a wonderful backhand offload as he was falling to the ground to allow Steyn to dive over unchallenged in the right corner in the 51st.

            Steyn was then picked out by a pinpoint cross-field kick from Russell in the 58th as they capitalized on Wales being a man light — fullback Liam Williams was sin-binned after persistent team offending — to grab a third try.

            That put the Scots 25-7 up and Blair Kinghorn clinched the attacking bonus point with a 71st-minute try created by Scotland’s biggest two attacking weapons: Russell and giant winger Duhan van der Merwe. Russell kicked to the left to Van der Merwe, who sprinted down the wing and passed inside for Kinghorn to scorch his way through a gap and over the tryline.

            Matt Fagerson grabbed the fifth try, from a double miss-out pass by the excellent Russell, in the 78th. Russell missed his last three goalkicks and finished with 10 points from the kicking tee but Scotland eclipsed its previous best win against Wales from 99 years ago.

            “I was just doing my job,” Russell said. “Making the boys look good.”

            Scotland last opened the tournament with two straight wins 27 years ago when it was the Five Nations. Gregor Townsend’s team is on 10 points, the same as Ireland after its 32-19 win over France earlier Saturday.

            “If we play to our best, we can beat any team,” Scotland captain Jamie Ritchie said. ""We’ve got more in us — we’re looking to improve when we go to Paris.”

            Wales coach Warren Gatland’s decision to drop three of his long-time star forwards — Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Taulupe Faletau — and inject some youth into the team after a 34-10 beating from Ireland in Round 1 didn’t pay off.

            His team selection for the Round 3 match at home to fierce rival England will be telling, with Wales fighting to avoid getting embroiled in a battle to avoid the wooden spoon for finishing last.

            A potential turning point came in the last action of the first half, when Wales built up a head of steam following Turner’s yellow card and was attempting to add a second try. Dan Biggar delivered a behind-the-back pass that winger Rio Dyer just had to catch low down to score. He dropped it, much to Gatland’s horror in the coaches box high up in the Murrayfield stands.

            It's proving to be a tough start to Gatland's second spell in charge of the Welsh, who have lost 11 of their last 14 matches. A Gatland-coached Wales lost to Scotland for the first time.

            “It’s early days with new coaching staff,” Owens said. ""We need to turn the corner against England and grind out a win. Find a win and build that momentum.

            “There are positives out there. People back home are going to say there isn’t but we believe in what we’re trying to achieve.”

            It was a seventh consecutive match without a win for Palace, which was without injured United States defender Chris Richards. Palace was seven points above the relegation zone.











            Sanchez was unable to hold a Michael Olise free kick and Tomkins pounced to nod home to level in the 69th minute.

            Brighton took the lead six minutes earlier when Solly March connected with Pervis Estupinan’s cross at the far post on an afternoon largely dominated by the visiting Seagulls.

            The Seagulls also had a first-half goal disallowed by VAR. Estupinan thought he broke the deadlock when he curled into the top corner after 32 minutes but it was ruled out due to an offside in the buildup.

            This was the first encounter between them this season after their September contest was called off due to train strikes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807542,Texas dad convicted of murder in fatal shootings by teen son,"DALLAS (AP) — A Texas man has been convicted of capital murder in the fatal shooting of three teenagers by the man’s then-14-year-old son.

            Richard Acosta, 34, was convicted Friday by a jury in Dallas of capital murder for the 2021 shooting deaths of Xavier Gonzalez, 14; Ivan Noyala, 16; and Rafael Garcia, 17, the day after Christmas. A 15-year-old newly hired cook was injured in the shooting and has recovered.

            Acosta testified that he did not know his son, Abel Acosta, had a gun or had shot anyone, only that the teenager got into his vehicle and told his father to drive away because someone was shooting.











            Abel Acosta disappeared shortly after the shooting and authorities say he remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous.

            Prosecutors argued that Richard Acosta sought to dispose of evidence and tried to move his family from Garland.

            Richard Acosta, who surrendered to police days after the shooting and was indicted nearly one year ago, said his son disappeared later the night of the shooting.

            “We are only halfway to justice,” according to a statement on social media by the Garland Police Department that said authorities would persist in their search. ""We will not stop until Abel Acosta is captured.”

            Richard Acosta testified that he does not know where his son is.

            Acosta, who faces life without parole because prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, was convicted under a Texas law that allows accomplices to be charged even if they did not commit the actual crime.DALLAS (AP) — A Texas man has been convicted of capital murder in the fatal shooting of three teenagers by the man’s then-14-year-old son.Richard Acosta, 34, was convicted Friday by a jury in Dallas of capital murder for the 2021 shooting deaths of Xavier Gonzalez, 14; Ivan Noyala, 16; and Rafael Garcia, 17, the day after Christmas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807543,Lookman leads Atalanta to win at Lazio in fight for top 4,"MILAN (AP) — When he’s not scoring, Ademola Lookman is setting them up.

            Lookman had a hand in both goals of Atalanta's 2-0 win over Lazio in Serie A scrap for the top four on Saturday.

            Atalanta moved into third place, above AC Milan and Roma on goal difference alone. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker at the end of the season.











            Roma was held at Lecce to 1-1 earlier, while Milan beat Torino 1-0 on Friday.

            Sixth-placed Lazio was two points behind the trio.

            Atalanta started aggressively at the Stadio Olimpico and took a deserved lead in the 23rd minute. Lookman was trying to cut inside and Lazio midfielder Adam Marušić tried to intercept but succeeded only in laying it off to Davide Zappacosta, who curled a stunning strike into the top right corner.

            Lookman almost got on the scoresheet moments earlier but his effort was fingertipped onto the crossbar by Lazio goalkeeper Ivan Provedel.

            The Nigeria forward set up the other goal in the 65th, racing down the left flank and into the area before rolling across the six-yard box, where Rasmus Winther Højlund came sliding in.

            Lookman had five goals in his previous four league matches.

            COSTLY DRAW

            Every point matters in Serie A in an increasingly tight battle for the Champions League qualifying spots and Roma could be left counting the cost of drawing at lowly Lecce.

            Lecce was looking to push on after ending a four-match winless run last week and it took a surprise lead when a corner was taken short and whipped in from the right for Federico Baschirotto to head into the far side of the net.

            It was later adjudged to have gone in off Roma defender Roger Ibañez and went down as an own goal.

            Roma leveled 10 minutes later after a corner was flicked on and came off the arm of Lecce forward Gabriel Strefezza. Paulo Dybala struck the resulting penalty into the bottom right corner.

            Home goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone preserved his side a point with fine saves as Lecce inched to 10 points above the relegation zone.

            DREAM DEBUT

            Emanuel Vignato had a debut to remember for Empoli as he netted a stoppage-time equalizer to snatch a 2-2 draw against relegation-threatened Spezia in an action-packed match.

            Vignato, who joined on loan from Bologna last month, went on with only five minutes remaining.

            Spezia raced into an two-goal lead after Empoli defender Fabiano Parisi was sent off in the 21st minute for clearing the ball off the line with his hand.

            Guglielmo Vicario parried Daniele Verde’s penalty and his follow-up but the referee ordered it to be retaken. On the third attempt, Verde beat the Empoli goalkeeper and he did so again six minutes later with a screamer into the top corner.

            The teams were down to 10 on 10 after the break when Spezia midfielder Salvatore Esposito was issued a second yellow card.

            Nicolò Cambiaghi pulled one back for Empoli in the 71st before Vignato’s late heroics.

            Spezia was five points above the bottom three while Empoli moved to within three points of the European places.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807545,1st infant in Kentucky surrendered anonymously at 'baby box',"BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky has seen its first infant anonymously dropped off at one of its “baby box” safe surrender locations.

            At a news conference Friday, Safe Haven Baby Boxes founder and CEO Monica Kelsey said the child was dropped off within the last seven days at a Bowling Green Fire Department location, declining to be more specific to protect anonymity. She said fire department staff was able to tend to the child in less than 90 seconds.

            The child is the 24th in the country to be surrendered at one of more than 130 baby boxes and drawers the organization has established across nine states.











            “This baby is healthy. This baby is beautiful. This baby is perfect,” said Kelsey, who added that officials are now looking to place the child in ""a forever home.""

            Gov. Andy Beshear signed a law in 2021 that allows the use of baby boxes for children less than 30 days old. The law requires the boxes to be located at police stations, fire stations or hospitals that are staffed 24 hours a day. It also requires equipping them with a notification system to alert the first responders on site that a child has been placed inside the box.

            Kentucky now has 16 baby box locations. The Bowling Green box had been operational for less than two months. Safe Haven Baby Boxes are installed in the exterior wall of a fire station or hospital. An exterior door automatically locks when a newborn is placed inside, and an interior door lets a medical staff member secure the baby from inside the building. 

            “This child was legally, safely, anonymously and lovingly placed inside of this Safe Haven Baby Box, and that speaks volumes about the parent,” Kelsey said.

            Republican state Rep. Nancy Tate, who sponsored the legislation, told WNKY-TV that it's her goal to have at least one box in every Kentucky county.

            “It makes my heart full to know how supportive this project is,” Tate said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807546,"Rice scores 24, leads No. 5 Texas past West Virginia 94-60","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Sir'Jabari Rice kept making shots, and the Texas guard wasn't shy about celebrating.

            “Talks a lot,” West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said of Rice. 

            Huggins' team could do nothing to prevent Rice from scoring or letting the Mountaineers know about it en route to his season-best 24 points in just 17 minutes as No. 5 Texas defeated West Virginia 94-60 Saturday.











            “I was just being competitive,"" said Rice, a guard who transferred from New Mexico State. 

            Thanks largely to him, Texas (20-5) remained in first place in the Big 12 at 9-3, while West Virginia (15-10, 4-8) lost for the sixth time in its last seven games against the Longhorns.

            Rice was nearly perfect: He converted 5 of 6 field-goal attempts, including 4 of 5 3-pointers and all 10 free throws. The Longhorns only missed one free throw in 25 attempts and hit 10 of 17 3-pointers.

            Marcus Carr added 16 for Texas, making 7 of 11 shots and contributing four assists and three steals. Timmy Allen had 14 points, nine rebounds and four assists — and passed the 2,000-point mark for his five-year career (2,013 points in 144 games).

            Emmitt Matthews Jr. led West Virginia with 13 points. The Mountaineers shot 35.2%, which is their second-worst accuracy of the season, and matched the most turnovers of the season with 20. 

            Texas scored 32 points off West Virginia's turnovers and had a 23-7 edge in fast-break points in 144 games.

            Matthews, who had a season-best 20 points against Iowa State on Wednesday, scored nine of West Virginia's first 12. But the Mountaineers failed to take advantage of that start. 

            They committed 13 turnovers in the half, matching their average per game, and Texas led 51-30 at the break. 

            The Longhorns went 16-for-16 at the free-throw line in the first half, matching the most they've ever made in a half without missing.

            Fouls calls and free throws were about even for the two teams, but Huggins said Texas was the most physical opponent the Mountaineers have faced this season.

            “I don’t think we were prepared for the physicality ... I think that bothered us,” Huggins said.

            Allen said the Longhorns always want to play that way.

            “That's our mindset,"" Allen said. “Be physical when we guard. Be physical on rebounds.”

            Interim coach Rodney Terry suggested the Longhorns lacked that toughness during a loss at Kansas on Monday.

            “You have to be willing to do the dirty work,” Terry said. “You have to be willing to have some grit.”

            BIG PICTURE

            West Virginia: The Mountaineers hit a wall after arriving in Austin with some momentum. They won five of their previous seven games after losing five straight in January. Their next opponent is No. 14 Baylor, which will be their third game in six days. They beat No. 11 Iowa State on Wednesday in Morgantown.

            Texas: The Longhorns have not lost two in a row this season, giving them their best record through 25 games since 2010-11, when they were 22-3. That team had three first-round NBA draft picks — and high hopes — but faded late in the season and lost to Arizona in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

            BIG MONDAY AGAIN

            The Longhorns seem to be monopolizing ESPN’s Big Monday telecasts. Their upcoming game at Texas Tech is the third week in a row they appear on that telecast. 

            So far, they are 1-1 after the quick Saturday-to-Monday turnaround, beating Baylor in Austin and losing at Kansas. 

            Terry said he doesn't mind having only one day between games, saying “it does prepare you for postseason play"" — only with the addition of travel between matchups.

            UP NEXT

            West Virginia: At No. 14 Baylor on Monday.

But the Mountaineers failed to take advantage of that start.They committed 13 turnovers in the half, matching their average per game, and Texas led 51-30 at the break.The Longhorns went 16-for-16 at the free-throw line in the first half, matching the most they've ever made in a half without missing.Fouls calls and free throws were about even for the two teams, but Huggins said Texas was the most physical opponent the Mountaineers have faced this season.“I don’t think we were prepared for the physicality ... I think that bothered us,” Huggins said.Allen said the Longhorns always want to play that way.“That's our mindset,"" Allen said. “Be physical when we guard. Be physical on rebounds.”Interim coach Rodney Terry suggested the Longhorns lacked that toughness during a loss at Kansas on Monday.“You have to be willing to do the dirty work,” Terry said. “You have to be willing to have some grit.”BIG PICTUREWest Virginia: The Mountaineers hit a wall after arriving in Austin with some momentum. They won five of their previous seven games after losing five straight in January. Their next opponent is No. 14 Baylor, which will be their third game in six days. They beat No. 11 Iowa State on Wednesday in Morgantown.Texas: The Longhorns have not lost two in a row this season, giving them their best record through 25 games since 2010-11, when they were 22-3. That team had three first-round NBA draft picks — and high hopes — but faded late in the season and lost to Arizona in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.BIG MONDAY AGAINThe Longhorns seem to be monopolizing ESPN’s Big Monday telecasts. Their upcoming game at Texas Tech is the third week in a row they appear on that telecast.So far, they are 1-1 after the quick Saturday-to-Monday turnaround, beating Baylor in Austin and losing at Kansas.Terry said he doesn't mind having only one day between games, saying “it does prepare you for postseason play"" — only with the addition of travel between matchups.UP NEXTWest Virginia: At No. 14 Baylor on Monday.Texas: At Texas Tech on Monday.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/12,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807547,"No. 10 Marquette beats Georgetown 89-75, takes Big East lead","WASHINGTON (AP) — Marquette needed to avoid a letdown in between Top 25 Big East matchups.

            Coach Shaka Smart’s team delivered with unselfish play from start to finish.

            Kam Jones, Oso Ighodaro and Tyler Kolek each scored 14 points to lead a balanced scoring attack and No. 10 Marquette beat Georgetown 89-75 Saturday.











            Olivier-Maxence Prosper had 11 points and Chase Ross added 10 as Marquette (20-6, 12-3 Big East) moved into first place in the conference. The Golden Eagles are a half-game ahead of No. 13 Xavier, which lost at Butler on Friday.

            Marquette hosts Xavier on Wednesday. 

            After having their five-game winning streak snapped at No. 21 UConn on Tuesday, the Golden Eagles shared the ball and shared the credit.

            “It’s just what we do,” Jones said.

            “We had a bunch of assists and a bunch of guys in double-figures,” he said. 

            Jay Heath scored 18 points to lead last-place Georgetown (6-20, 1-14), which has lost five straight after ending their league record 29-game conference losing streak on Jan. 24.

            Bryson Mozone had 11 points and Akok Akok had 10 for Georgetown, which has lost 12 straight games against Top 25 teams since winning the 2021 Big East Tournament.

            Marquette took a 45-33 lead into the halftime break on Ighodaro’s layup at the buzzer and stayed comfortably ahead the rest of the way.

            Marquette proved to be too much on the offensive end by knocking down 15 of their 31 3-point shots and assisting on 24 of 35 baskets. Kolek led the way with eight assists as the Golden Eagles went up by as many as 25 in the second half. 

            “Kolek is the head of the snake,” Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing said about Marquette’s star point guard. 

            “He does everything for them. He makes all the right plays that need to be made,"" he said.

            Eight different Golden Eagles hit at least one 3-pointer, with Jones going 4 of 9.

            “He took nine 3s today and I thought he passed up a couple,” Smart said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Marquette: Picked to finish ninth out of 11 teams in the Big East preseason coaches’ poll, Smart has the Golden Eagles flying in his second season. With five games remaining Marquette is in prime position to claim at least a share of their first regular-season title since 2013 when it split the crown with Georgetown and former member Louisville. 

            Georgetown: The Hoyas have lost 11 straight games at home to Top 25 teams. Georgetown’s last win against a ranked opponent came in an 83-80 victory over then-No. 25 Creighton on Jan. 15, 2020. 

            LESSON LEARNED

            Smart said his team got a chance to watch the end of Butler’s win over No. 13 Xavier on Friday while it finished up dinner in Washington. At first he was concerned that his players may pay too much attention with Xavier – Marquette’s next opponent - but then Butler gave him a great example to use ahead of facing a struggling Georgetown team. 

            “I thought that game was a very good example of you get to February in the Big East and you go on the road as ‘one of the top teams’ that ‘should win’ and it’s not guaranteed,” Smart said. 

            “That was a good message and lesson going into today.” 

            LINEUP CHANGES

            Georgetown starting center Qudus Wahab (personal reasons) was not with the team. Wahab, who played his first two seasons for Ewing at Georgetown before spending last season at Maryland, had started the first 25 games for the Hoyas, averaging 9.9 points and a team leading 7.1 rebounds. Without Wahab Ewing used his ninth different starting five of the season. 

            Ewing added later that Wahab is dealing with some ‘family issues’ and that he found out he would be without his center on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807548,"No. 22 NC State tops BC 92-62, Smith gets 1K career points","BOSTON (AP) — Terquavion Smith didn't realize he had reached 1,000 career points until North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts announced it in the locker room after the game. 

            His teammates were waiting and ready, drenching the sophomore guard with water after he scored 17 points to hit the milestone in the No. 22 Wolfpack's otherwise unremarkable 92-62 victory over Boston College on Saturday.

            “It was crazy for him,” said Jarkel Joiner, who scored 26 points to help N.C. State bounce back from a loss to No. 8 Virginia. “It was like he came out of a pool.”











            Smith bypassed a chance to go to the NBA after his first year and returned to Raleigh, where he is leading the Wolfpack and is second in the ACC in scoring with 18.5 points per game. He needed 17 points to reach 1,000 — and hit it exactly — in his 58th career game, 

            “He scores so much, he doesn’t even worry about how many points. I mean, as far as he knows, he might have had 1,000 six games ago,” Keatts said. “But you’re talking about a good kid, who has given everything he could to N.C. State.”

            Smith hit the milestone on a 3-pointer about one minute into the second half that gave the Wolfpack a 15-point lead. He didn't celebrate then — because he didn't know. 

            “Coach just told me after the game. He surprised me, myself,” said Smith, who accepted the congratulations of his teammates with a smile. “I got water all over me. It was very cold.”

            Joiner made 10 of 17 shots — including five of 11 from 3-point range — and added six rebounds to follow up a 2-for-14 shooting performance against Virginia. He went 1-for-6 from the floor the previous game, against Georgia Tech. 

            “We know what Jarkel is capable of,” Keatts said. “It was so good to see him bounce back.”

            D.J. Burns Jr. scored 18 points with 10 rebounds for the Wolfpack, who led nearly the entire game. 

            Quinten Post scored 20 points for Boston College (12-14, 6-9). 

            N.C. State led 10-9 after five minutes before using a 13-4 run to open it up. It was a six-point lead when Joiner hit back-to-back 3-pointers. N.C. State went into the halftime break up 44-32. 

            Casey Morsell and Joiner hit consecutive 3s early in the second to expand the lead to 21 points. Morsell was 5 of 8 from 3-point range, and the Wolfpack made 15 of 30 from beyond the arc in all. 

            BIG PICTURE

            N.C. State: The Wolfpack are off to their best start since 2006. They have won nine of their last 11 games to climb into The Associated Press Top 25 for the first time since 2019. They have three games against teams behind them in the ACC standings before facing No. 20 Clemson and then Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium. 

            Boston College: Fell to 2-5 against ranked teams this season, with victories over then-No. 21 Virginia Tech in December and then-No. 20 Clemson last month. The Eagles haven’t beaten three ranked teams in a season since 2010-11.

(AP) — Hakim Hart scored 15 of his season-high 23 points in the second half and Maryland pulled away from Penn State late to earn a 74-68 win Saturday and remain undefeated at home in Big Ten play.

            The Terrapins improved to 13-1 at home, with their lone loss coming Dec. 14 to No. 16 UCLA. For the first time in program history Maryland (17-8, 8-6) has won 10 straight conference home games. 

            Maryland threatened to run away with the game early, taking a 12-point lead, 21-9 after Don Carey hit a 3-pointer with 7:22 left, but Penn State rallied from deep. Myles Dread, Andrew Funk and Seth Lundy each hit from deep in the final five minutes of the half and the Nittany Lions tied the game at 26-26 with 1:39 left. Jahmir Young hit a 3 and his jumper with six seconds remaining sent Maryland into halftime with a 31-28 advantage. 











            Jalen Pickett hit a jumper and knocked down a 3 to start the second half to put Penn State in front 35-32 less than two minutes in and Dread's 3-pointer midway through the half tied the game at 47-47. But Hart took charge in the final eight minutes, turning a pair of three-point plays and scoring 10 of the Terrapins' final 24 points and feeding Ian Martinez for a dunk with 2:31 left that pushed the lead back to 12, 64-52.

            Maryland shot a blistering 63.6% in the second half (14 of 22), hit 2 of 5 from distance and was 13 of 16 from the line. Jahmir Young scored 13 of his 18 points in the second half. Julian Reese had 11 points for the game and blocked three shots and Donta Scott pulled down 10 rebounds to go with his nine points. 

            Freshman Kanye Clary came off the bench to lead Penn State (14-11, 5-9) with a career-high 17 points. Pickett had five assists to go with his 15 points. Funk scored 14 points and grabbed five boards. Lundy and Dread each added 11 points. 

            Maryland plays host to No. 1 Purdue Thursday. Penn State is host to Illinois Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807560,Cracks appearing in leader Arsenal's EPL title bid,"The first cracks are appearing in Arsenal's English Premier League title bid, right before the team's biggest match of the season.

            A 1-1 draw at home to Brentford on Saturday came a week after a lackluster 1-0 loss at Everton.

            Hardly the run of results the leader will have wanted heading into the big one on Wednesday, when second-placed Manchester City comes to Emirates Stadium.











            Six points separate the teams, though City can reduce that when the defending champion hosts Aston Villa on Sunday. Beat Arsenal, too, and City could even climb into first place — albeit having played a game more.

            Arsenal was flat against a Brentford team which — following the playbook of Everton — defended in numbers and hit on the break, leading to lots of sterile possession from Mikel Arteta's team.

            Leandro Trossard's first goal for Arsenal since his move from Brighton gave the hosts the lead in the 66th minute when he converted a cross from Bukayo Saka.

            Ivan Toney claimed Brentford's equalizer with a close-range header eight minutes later after Arsenal failed to clear a free kick.

            It is the first time this season that Arsenal has gone back-to-back games without a win, and this was the just the second time the team has dropped points at home.

            “Games are won in margins in this league,"" Arteta said, “and when you take the margins away it becomes really difficult. The team had a really strong performance again today but we didn’t get the three points.”

            NEWCASTLE HELD

            Newcastle has finally hit something of a sticky patch, too.

            The Saudi-owned team drew at relegation-threatened Bournemouth 1-1, a week after drawing West Ham 1-1 at home. In fact, Newcastle has had five draws in its last six league games.

            Newcastle is clinging on to fourth place but all of these draws will give hope to the chasing pack.

            TOTTENHAM'S BAD DAY

            Tottenham lost a game and one of its key players.

            As if getting thrashed by Leicester 4-1 wasn't bad enough, Tottenham saw star midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur go off in the second half with what looked like a serious leg injury ahead of a last-16 match against AC Milan in the Champions League next week.

            Bentancur gave Tottenham the lead but Leicester replied through goals from Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Harvey Barnes.

            Manager Antonio Conte was back in the dugout for Spurs after gallbladder surgery.

            FELIX'S FIRST GOAL

            João Félix’s second match for Chelsea went better than his first.

            The Portugal forward scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw at West Ham on his return from a three-game suspension following a sending-off on his debut a month ago.

            Félix guided home a volley off a cross from another new signing, Enzo Fernandez, in the 16th minute only for Emerson Palmieri — a former Chelsea player — to equalize in the 28th.

            It was a third straight draw for Chelsea’s expensively assembled team, which is languishing in ninth place.

            FACING THE SACK

            Southampton manager Nathan Jones' job is in the balance after Saints squandered a lead in a 2-1 home loss to Wolverhampton, which played more than an hour with 10 men and scored goals in the 72nd and 87th minutes.

            January signing Joao Gomes scored the winner to leave Southampton in last place and four points from safety.

            Under Jones, who replaced Ralph Hasenhuttl three months ago, Southampton has lost seven of its eight league games.

            As the fulltime whistle was greeted by a chorus of deafening boos, Jones headed straight down the tunnel.

            “I have never done that in my life before,” Jones said. “In terms of 390 games, I have never done that, but I am not sure if me going round clapping would have shown respect.”

            Asked if it was likely to be his last match in charge, Jones replied: “I have no idea.”

            Fulham beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 to climb to seventh place, and Brighton was held by Crystal Palace to 1-1.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsThe first cracks are appearing in Arsenal's English Premier League title bid, right before the team's biggest match of the season.A 1-1 draw at home to Brentford on Saturday came a week after a lackluster 1-0 loss at Everton.Hardly the run of results the leader will have wanted heading into the big one on Wednesday, when second-placed Manchester City comes to Emirates Stadium.Six points separate the teams, though City can reduce that when the defending champion hosts Aston Villa on Sunday. Beat Arsenal, too, and City could even climb into first place — albeit having played a game more.Arsenal was flat against a Brentford team which — following the playbook of Everton — defended in numbers and hit on the break, leading to lots of sterile possession from Mikel Arteta's team.Leandro Trossard's first goal for Arsenal since his move from Brighton gave the hosts the lead in the 66th minute when he converted a cross from Bukayo Saka.Ivan Toney claimed Brentford's equalizer with a close-range header eight minutes later after Arsenal failed to clear a free kick.It is the first time this season that Arsenal has gone back-to-back games without a win, and this was the just the second time the team has dropped points at home.“Games are won in margins in this league,"" Arteta said, “and when you take the margins away it becomes really difficult. The team had a really strong performance again today but we didn’t get the three points.”NEWCASTLE HELDNewcastle has finally hit something of a sticky patch, too.The Saudi-owned team drew at relegation-threatened Bournemouth 1-1, a week after drawing West Ham 1-1 at home. In fact, Newcastle has had five draws in its last six league games.Newcastle is clinging on to fourth place but all of these draws will give hope to the chasing pack.TOTTENHAM'S BAD DAYTottenham lost a game and one of its key players.As if getting thrashed by Leicester 4-1 wasn't bad enough, Tottenham saw star midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur go off in the second half with what looked like a serious leg injury ahead of a last-16 match against AC Milan in the Champions League next week.Bentancur gave Tottenham the lead but Leicester replied through goals from Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Harvey Barnes.Manager Antonio Conte was back in the dugout for Spurs after gallbladder surgery.FELIX'S FIRST GOALJoão Félix’s second match for Chelsea went better than his first.The Portugal forward scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw at West Ham on his return from a three-game suspension following a sending-off on his debut a month ago.Félix guided home a volley off a cross from another new signing, Enzo Fernandez, in the 16th minute only for Emerson Palmieri — a former Chelsea player — to equalize in the 28th.It was a third straight draw for Chelsea’s expensively assembled team, which is languishing in ninth place.FACING THE SACKSouthampton manager Nathan Jones' job is in the balance after Saints squandered a lead in a 2-1 home loss to Wolverhampton, which played more than an hour with 10 men and scored goals in the 72nd and 87th minutes.January signing Joao Gomes scored the winner to leave Southampton in last place and four points from safety.Under Jones, who replaced Ralph Hasenhuttl three months ago, Southampton has lost seven of its eight league games.As the fulltime whistle was greeted by a chorus of deafening boos, Jones headed straight down the tunnel.“I have never done that in my life before,” Jones said. “In terms of 390 games, I have never done that, but I am not sure if me going round clapping would have shown respect.”Asked if it was likely to be his last match in charge, Jones replied: “I have no idea.”Fulham beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 to climb to seventh place, and Brighton was held by Crystal Palace to 1-1.___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/12,,World

            Bridges scored 10 of his 12 points over a five-minute stretch when Georgia took back the lead for good. Hill, who finished with six assists, had a 3-pointer during the run and added four free throws late. 

            The Bulldogs (15-10, 5-7 SEC) snapped a three-game losing streak and dealt a damaging loss to a Wildcats (16-9, 7-5) team projected to be on the NCAA Tournament bubble. 











            Oscar Tshiebwe, who had 37 points and 24 rebounds in Kentucky's win over Georgia on Jan. 17, finished with 20 and 14 for his 14th double-double this season. Antonio Reeves had four 3-pointers and scored 20 points with Jacob Toppin adding 12.

            Tshiebwe had only six points on 1-of-4 shooting in the first half but scored eight straight early in second when the Wildcats erased a 10-point halftime deficit, taking a 52-48 lead with 12 minutes to go on Toppin's 3-pointer.

            Oquendo was only 5-of-15 shooting but made 10 of 12 at the line where the Bulldogs were 25 of 29 to Kentucky's 11-of-13. Kentucky finished with four players with four fouls.

            Oquendo scored nine of his 17 first-half points over the final six minutes with Georgia leading 42-32 at the break.

            IN AND OUT

            Georgia's leading scorer, Terry Roberts, returned after missing two games with a concussion. He finished with nine points.

            Kentucky was without guards CJ Fredrick (rib) and Sahvir Wheeler (right ankle) who have 27 starts between them. Fredrick missed the game after making eight straight starts. Wheeler was out for the second consecutive game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807562,"Newcastle held 1-1 by Bournemouth, continues stuttering form","BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) — Miguel Almiron’s 10th goal of the season and a late goalline clearance by Kieran Trippier ensured Newcastle manager Eddie Howe claimed a point on his Bournemouth return in a 1-1 draw in the English Premier League on Saturday.

            Marcos Senesi put the struggling Cherries ahead in the 30th minute and even though Almiron equalized in first-half stoppage time, Newcastle could not arrest its stuttering form and slumped to a fifth draw from its last six league games.

            It may have been worse had Trippier not cleared off the line from Dominic Solanke’s goalbound flick in second-half stoppage time.











            That ensured the visitors extended their unbeaten top-flight run to 17 matches but injuries to Joe Willock, Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin will be a major concern to Howe with the League Cup final only two weeks away.

            Howe made his first return to the south-coast club since he departed in 2020 but a knock in training denied Callum Wilson the chance to face his old team, too.

            Newcastle is in fourth place, two points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham.

(AP) — Jamarius Burton and Blake Hinson scored 19 points each, Nike Sibande added 10 points in a key stretch of the second half, and Pittsburgh defeated Florida State 83-75 on Saturday.

            Burton hit two jumpers and Sibande added two 3-pointers, giving the Panthers a 64-58 lead with 6:38 left. Sibande added a steal-and-layup and another layup to push the lead to 70-65, then Hinson put the Panthers in control when he hit a 3-pointer for a nine-point lead with 2:35 to go.

            Pittsburgh made eight consecutive free throws in the final two minutes before Greg Elliott broke the string by making 1 of 2 with 20 seconds remaining. Pittsburgh made 11 of 14 from the line in the second half, 19 of 23 overall.











            Sibande finished with 12 points and Greg Elliott hit four 3-pointers and scored 13 points. Federiko Federiko had 13 rebounds and three blocks for Pitt (18-7, 11-3 ACC).

            Jalen Warley scored 23 points, Caleb Mills 16, and Cameron Corhen 13 for Florida State (8-18, 6-9). The Seminoles shot 42% overall but made only 5 of 21 3-pointers. They made 20 of 24 free throws.

            Matthew Cleveland, FSU’s leading scorer at 14.4 ppg, scored six points on 2-for-8 shooting.

The Seminoles cut their deficit to two points when Warley's 3-pointer made it 33-31 with 3:09 remaining. It was the final field goal of the half for either team and Pitt went on to lead 37-33 at the break. 

            The Panthers added to what is becoming their best season since joining the ACC in 2013-14. They won their 11th conference game for the second time since joining the conference and remain in first place. Pittsburgh and Virginia, which defeated Duke 69-62 in overtime, are tied for first place. Clemson dropped out of first place after a 91-71 loss to North Carolina.

            The Panthers have won seven of their past eight ACC games, the only loss being 71-65 against visiting Florida State on Jan. 21. Pitt is 6-1 on the road in ACC games this season.

            Thompson was injured in the third period of Thursday's 5-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild and replaced by Adin Hill. Hill is 11-5-1 in Vegas with a .909 save percentage and 2.58 goals-against average.

            Thompson, who had an MRI on Friday, appeared in the All-Star Game and is 20-13-3 with a .914 save percentage, allowing 2.66 goals a game.

            Brossoit was 8-11-3 in Henderson with a .909 save percentage and 2.72 goals-against average.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807565,3-pointer at buzzer lifts Missouri over No. 6 Tennessee,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — D’Andre Gholston hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Missouri a stunning 86-85 victory over No. 6 Tennessee on Saturday night.

            With 4.2 seconds left in the game and the Volunteers (19-6, 8-4 Southeastern Conference) leading 85-83, Santiago Vescovi missed a free throw. His second attempt was waived off when Tobe Awaka committed a lane violation, setting up a final chance for the Tigers (19-6, 7-5).

            Gholston took the inbounds and dribbled up the court before taking an off-balance contested 3-pointer from about 30 feet that swished through the net at the buzzer for the win. He was mobbed by his teammates after hitting the shot.











            Tennessee came back from a 17-point deficit early in the second half and led the last 7:11 of the game.

            AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Rylan Griffen scored 16 points, Mark Sears added 15 and Alabama held off a big challenge from its in-state rival Auburn.

            The Crimson Tide (22-3, 12-0 Southeastern Conference) remained the only Power 5 team without a league loss. Sears and Griffen helped Alabama overcome an off shooting performance from star Brandon Miller, who had 13 points but missed all seven 3-point attempts.

            Wendell Green Jr. had 16 of his 24 points in the second half for Auburn (17-8, 7-5).

            STANFORD 88, NO. 4 ARIZONA 79

            STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Spencer Jones scored all 18 of his points in the second half for Stanford and played a key role in neutralizing Pac-12 leading scorer Azuolas Tubelis, as the Cardinal stunned Arizona.

            Stanford (11-14, 5-9 Pac-12) beat a ranked team for the first time this year and a top-five team for the second time in two seasons. Arizona (22-4, 11-4), hoping to stay a half-game behind UCLA for the conference lead, had a seven-game win snapped.

            Courtney Ramey scored a season- and game-high 26 points for Arizona. Tubelis was held to four points and did not have any rebounds.

            Stanford’s Michael O’Connell scored a team-high 22 points, helping the Cardinal outshoot the Wildcats 61% to 46% from the field.

            AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Sir’Jabri Rice scored 24 points in just 17 minutes in Texas' win over West Virginia. 

            Texas (20-5) remained in first place in the Big 12 at 9-3, while West Virginia (15-10, 4-8) lost for the sixth time in its last seven games against the Longhorns.

            Rice, a guard who transferred this season from New Mexico State, was nearly perfect. He converted 5 of 6 field-goal attempts, including 4 of 5 3-pointers and all 10 free throws.

            Emmitt Matthews led West Virginia with 13 points.

            EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. had 25 points and 12 rebounds, and UCLA won at Oregon for the first time since 2019.

            UCLA (21-4, 12-2 Pac-12) has won four straight after losing to Arizona and rival USC at the end of January. The Bruins sit atop the Pac-12 standings.

            Jermaine Couisnard had 19 points for the Ducks (15-11, 9-6), who won the previous three meetings in Eugene.

            CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Armaan Franklin scored 23 points, including a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left, to lift Virginia over Duke in overtime.

            Kihei Clark added 16 points and Ben Vander Plas scored 13 for the Cavaliers (19-4, 11-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who won despite a 9-for-22 performance from the free throw line.

            Duke (17-8, 8-6) appeared poised to win when Kyle Filipowski drove to the basket on the final play of regulation and two defenders contested his shot. Officials initially whistled a foul, but waved it off after a lengthy review — a decision the ACC later said was incorrect.

            The league issued a statement hours later, saying officials applied rules incorrectly and that Filipowski should have been sent to the line for two free throws. 

            Jeremy Roach led the Blue Devils with 16 points.

            NO. 9 KANSAS 78, OKLAHOMA 55

            NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Jalen Wilson scored 18 points, and Kansas rolled past Oklahoma.

            Wilson, who entered the day leading the Big 12 with nearly 21 points per game, bounced back from a two-point outing against Texas on Monday. 

            Dajuan Harris scored 16 points and Kevin McCullar added 13 for the Jayhawks (20-5, 8-4 Big 12).

            Jalen Hill scored 14 points and Otega Oweh added 11 for the Oklahoma (12-13, 2-10). Grant Sherfield, who leads the Sooners with nearly 17 points per game, was held to 10 on 4-for-14 shooting.

            Jay Heath scored 18 points to lead last-place Georgetown (6-20, 1-14), which has lost five straight after ending their league record 29-game conference losing streak on Jan. 24.

            LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) —De’Vion Harmon scored 20 points, including a crucial driving basket in the final minute, as Texas Tech upended Kansas State.

            The Red Raiders (13-12, 2-10 Big 12) held the Wildcats to two field goals in the game’s final four minutes.

            Kansas State (19-6, 7-5) edged as close as one point throughout the second half, but Tech answered with key baskets to maintain the lead. The Wildcats were led by Markquis Nowell’s 18 points. Desi Sills added 12 points.

            FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Adam Flagler scored 28 points, with 16 in a row for Baylor during the stretch when the Bears overcame a 10-point deficit in the second half and then held on to beat TCU.

            LJ Cryer had 23 points for the Bears (19-6, 8-4 Big 12), who on Jan. 4 at home against TCU blew a 17-point lead in an 88-87 loss. They have won nine of their last 10 games.

            Damion Baugh had 16 points and 10 assist for TCU (17-8, 6-6).

            PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Logan Johnson had 34 points, six rebounds and six assists as Saint Mary’s handled Portland on the road.

            Alex Ducas added 18 points and six rebounds for the Gaels (22-5, 11-1 West Coast Conference) and Aidan Mahaney contributed 10 points and five assists.

            Kristian Sjolund led the Pilots (13-15, 5-8) with 12 points, and Juan Gorosito and Tyler Robinson each added 10 points.

            NO. 16 GONZAGA 88, BYU 81

            SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Julian Strawther scored 26 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:10 remaining, and Gonzaga rallied to beat BYU.

            Drew Timme added 19 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Bulldogs (21-5, 10-2 West Coast Conference).

            After trailing 71-68 with 4:09 to play, Gonzaga made 3s on three straight possessions to climb past the Cougars. Strawther knocked down back-to-back 3s before finding Nasir Bolton for another one to put Gonzaga ahead 77-73 with 2:21 left. 

            Gonzaga had shot just 3 of 14 behind the arc before that late flurry, which sent the Zags to their seventh straight win over BYU.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807566,"Larkin, Berggren score 2 goals apiece, Wings down Canucks","DETROIT (AP) — Dylan Larkin and Jonatan Berggren scored two goals apiece and the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Vancouver Canucks 5-2 on Saturday.

            Larkin added an assist for a three-point game, while the rookie Berggren had notched his first game with multiple goals.

            “He’s a crafty guy and he finds ways to score,” Larkin said of Berggren.











            Filip Hronek also scored for the Red Wings, who took a 2-0 lead in the first three minutes. Ben Chiarot and Moritz Seider recorded two assists apiece while Ville Husso made 32 saves.

            Anthony Beauvillier and Elias Pettersson scored for the Canucks. Spencer Martin stopped 20 shots.

            The teams were playing the first game of a home-and-home set, with the rematch in Vancouver on Monday.

            “We’ve got these guys again on Monday and we’re going to be on the road,” Larkin said. “We’ve been decent on the road and we need to keep that going. We have to get to the trade deadline and keep ourselves in (the playoff race).”

            Larkin scored his first goal of the game from the left circle, beating Martin on the stick side. Berggren made it 2-0 when he tipped in a Chiarot shot.

            Beauvillier notched his second goal since being acquired from the New York Islanders on a power play. He scored in the slot off a J.T. Miller pass at 2:02 of the second period.

            “Not the start we wanted but still, this team’s come back from two (goals) more than once this year, so we weren't out of it,” Vancouver forward Dakota Joshua said. “But at the end of the day, you can’t start like that and we weren’t able to climb out of it today.”

            Larkin scored his team-leading 18th goal on a power play at 13:16 of the period. He converted a side-to-side feed from Robby Fabbri before Martin could recover.

            “They (Vancouver) clearly won the second period,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “Getting that goal to go into the third up two goals was huge.”

            Vancouver was awarded a penalty shot at 1:38 of the third when Ethan Bear was pulled down on a breakaway. Bear crashed into the boards and had to be assisted off the ice. Quinn Hughes replaced him but lost control of the puck as he tried to skate across the crease.

            Less than a minute later, Hronek gave Detroit a 4-1 advantage with a shot that whistled past Martin's left shoulder. Berggren converted another power-play opportunity midway through the period.

            “For me personally, it is always good when you score. Your confidence gets higher and higher,"" he said. “But I think the most important thing is that we get two points.”

            Pettersson scored his 25th goal on a rebound of a Beauvillier shot. Vancouver wound up 1-2-1 on its four-game road swing after the All-Star break.

            “There a lot of what ifs but the bottom line is four (games) in six (days). A lot of teams go through this,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “You’ve got to be really mentally focused and we weren’t at the start.”

            Vancouver gets a chance to avenge the loss in the first game of a three-game homestand.

            “We’ll be very inviting on Monday to see them again,” Joshua said. “After this performance, we owe them a good one.”

            NOTES

            Red Wings second-year forward Lucas Raymond missed the first game of his career with a lower-body injury suffered in practice on Friday. He had played in 132 consecutive games. ...

            Jones came off the bench after missing two games to travel home to the Dominican Republic following his father’s death on Feb. 3. The forward, who also grabbed seven rebounds, said his dad taught him the game of basketball.











            “He never played professional,” Jones said. “He was good, though. He had bounce.”

            Jones spoke quietly about his recent ordeal and displayed a pair of tattoos on his forearm dedicated to his dad — including a new one with the dates of his birth and death.

            “When he's in pain, we feel it. We felt the loss,” center Joel Soriano said of his teammate.

            Soriano had 10 points and 13 rebounds for the Red Storm (15-11, 5-10 Big East), who had lost three straight and five of six. It was his 20th double-double this season — he began the day second in the nation in that category.

            Posh Alexander added 10 points and a season-high nine assists. Dylan Addae-Wusu scored 13 for St. John's, which built a big early lead before a split crowd at Madison Square Garden and stayed in front nearly the entire way.

            Providence tied the score early in the second half but was never able to surge back ahead. A poor free-throw shooting team all season, St. John's attempted only one foul shot in the first half but finished 15 for 18 at the line (83%).

            Bryce Hopkins matched a career best with 29 points for the Friars (18-7, 10-4), who had won four of five. The only loss during that stretch was in overtime at then-No. 16 Xavier.

            “I thought we faced a very desperate team today. You could feel the energy that was in the building coming in,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “This is the first time I've felt all year that my team just didn't have it.”

            Hopkins also grabbed nine rebounds, but Providence shot just 33% from the field. Devin Carter had 12 points and seven boards for the Friars, who are in a crowded race with three other teams atop the Big East standings.

            “I'm very encouraged still where we're at,” Cooley said. “I thought we competed today physically. I didn't think we competed today emotionally and/or mentally. So I'm very disappointed in our group on that.”

            St. John’s jumped out to a 25-9 lead after 9 1/2 minutes behind Alexander and Jones, but the Friars closed the first half with a strong push and trailed 37-35 at the break.

            They tied it 39-all early in the second half before consecutive baskets from Soriano, a 3-point play from Storr and three buckets by Jones put the Red Storm in front by six.

            BIG PICTURE

            Providence: Coming off a trip to the Sweet 16 last year, the revamped Friars are 13-0 on their own court but 5-7 away from home. They have dropped four of their past five road games.

            St. John’s: It was the second-best win of a disappointing Big East season for the Red Storm, behind an 11-point victory on Jan. 15 at then-No. 6 UConn. 

            UNAVAILABLE

            Red Storm junior guard Andre Curbelo was on the bench but not in uniform. Before the game, St. John’s said Curbelo wouldn't play and that it was a coach’s decision. Coach Mike Anderson would not elaborate postgame or say whether Curbelo will play Tuesday against DePaul. Curbelo, an Illinois transfer, is averaging 9.6 points and a team-best 4.5 assists per game.

            COACH’S CORNER

            Johnnies Day festivities included a recorded message shown on the large video board from Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca, who celebrated his 98th birthday last month. ... Longtime Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was in the stands and got booed when he was shown on the video board. Krzyzewski's grandson plays at Division III New York University. Anderson said he appreciated Coach K visiting the Red Storm in their locker room before the game. St. John's athletic director Mike Cragg worked with Krzyzewski at Duke.

            UP NEXT

            Providence: Will host No. 23 Creighton on Tuesday night in a pivotal Big East matchup. Senior point guard Jared Bynum was out injured when the Friars lost 73-67 at Creighton on Jan. 14, ending their nine-game winning streak. Hopkins had 20 points and 10 rebounds in that one.

            St. John's: Plays at DePaul (9-16, 3-11) on Tuesday night. The Red Storm won the first meeting this season 86-67 at Carnesecca Arena on campus. The skidding Blue Demons have dropped six straight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807573,"No. 9 Kansas gets win No. 20, easily topping Oklahoma","NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Even an elite scorer like Jalen Wilson needs a confidence boost sometimes.

            He got one on Saturday, scoring 18 points to help No. 9 Kansas roll past Oklahoma 78-55. 

            Wilson, who entered the day leading the Big 12 with nearly 21 points per game, bounced back from a two-point outing against Texas on Monday. He started off slowly against Oklahoma but scored 10 points in the final 4:14 of the first half to put the Jayhawks in control.











            “He needed to see the ball go in the basket,” Kansas coach Bill Self said. “For a guy that's averaging 20, you wouldn't think he needed to see the ball go in the basket, but he did. I can tell.”

            During that run, Wilson made 4 of 5 field goals, and Kansas pushed a 21-20 lead to 35-22. His final bucket of the half was a contested 3-pointer with three seconds left.

            Wilson also had five rebounds, five assists and five steals. Teammates Dajuan Harris scored 16 points on 7 of 11 field goals and Kevin McCullar added 13 for the Jayhawks (20-5, 8-4 Big 12).

            Harris provided needed scoring support for Wilson, especially with Oklahoma limiting Kansas' freshman sharpshooter, Gradey Dick, to five shots — none of them 3s. Harris has posted three of his four highest-scoring games this season in his past three contests. 

            Self said the unselfish guard helps his team when he looks for his shot.

            “For us to be good, he’s got to score. ... He sees the game differently,"" Self said. ""He sees the game that, sometimes his numbers don’t really equate to winning when I’m trying to convince him, ‘Your numbers do equate to winning.’”

            Jalen Hill scored 14 points and Otega Oweh added 11 for Oklahoma (12-13, 2-10). 

            Grant Sherfield, who leads the Sooners with nearly 17 points per game, was held to 10 points and missed 10 shots. He scored 25 in the previous meeting, when Kansas squeaked out a 79-75 win.

            “That was our emphasis, not to let him beat us,"" Self said. 

            Oklahoma was in a solid position a month ago but has since lost seven of eight — including four straight since beating No. 2 Alabama 93-69 on Jan. 28. On Saturday, it hurt itself with sloppy play.

            “The storyline of the game is the decision-making and the barrage of turnovers,"" Oklahoma coach Porter Moser said. “Twenty-four turnovers and five assists. Say no more.”

            “I thought we came out playing the right way,” Moser said of a 10-4 lead eight minutes into the game. “We jumped out to a lead. I thought our defense was really good in the beginning.”

            It didn't last. Kansas took its first lead on a layup by McCullar with just under seven minutes remaining before halftime. 

            Wilson didn't score until he made a jumper with about four minutes left in the first half, and he was just getting started. He knocked down two 3-pointers in the final minute, and the Jayhawks led by at least five points the rest of the way.

            Despite Saturday's blowout and Monday's 88-80 win over No. 5 Texas, Self still sees a lot of work ahead for the Jayhawks.

            “I don’t think the team can be good until they actually know who they are, and I think we’re still figuring out who we are and what our identity is,"" he said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas: The Jayhawks needed the win to stay within range of Texas in the Big 12 race. They did it with defense, holding the Sooners to 36% shooting. Self said defense has to be the key. 

            ""We’re not good enough offensively to carry the load against other teams who are playing well,” he said.

            Oklahoma: The Sooners are falling apart. It was Oklahoma's fourth consecutive double-digit loss. The schedule gets no easier, with five ranked opponents in the final six regular-season games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807574,Flames get hot in 2nd period for 7-2 win over Sabres,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Calgary Flames scored four times in just over five minutes in their 7-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday. 

            Dillon Dube had a goal and three assists for Calgary and Tyler Toffoli had two goals and an assist. Jakob Pelletier, Mikael Backlund, Nazem Kadri and Dennis Gilbert also scored, while Jacob Markstrom made 21 saves.

            Tage Thompson and Casey Mittelstadt scored for the Sabres, and goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 33 saves.











            After falling behind 2-0, the Flames took control with a dominant second-period surge that saw them score four times between 2:17 and 7:39. 

            “It just felt like everything kind of kept coming in waves and we did a really good job,” Toffoli said. “We could tell that they were getting frustrated and we just capitalized on our opportunities.”

            Pelletier, the 26th overall pick in the 2019 draft, began Calgary’s comeback with his first career goal. Backlund evened the score 20 seconds later from the right circle on a poor moment by Luukkonen. 

            Gilbert, a Buffalo native, scored his first goal of the season and the second of his career 4:04 into the second by collecting a drop pass and beating Luukkonen with a low slap shot.

            “We maybe started a little bit slower than we would’ve liked, but we had a good response in between periods,” Gilbert said. “We had a good second and third.”

            Luukkonen made one of his best saves of the season on a two-man rush 7:09 into the second, robbing Dube. But the Flames quickly struck again, making it 4-2 20 seconds later on Kadri’s shot through traffic for his 20th goal of the season. 

            Calgary outshot Buffalo 34-8 through two periods.

            “We never found a rhythm even though we had some good energy in the first, and then we died,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We looked fatigued. We looked like we hadn’t played in a while.” 

            Toffoli made it 5-2 1:57 into the third on a tap-in and scored his second of the game to make it 6-2 with 6:55 remaining. Dube scored with 2:49 left in the game for the final margin. 

            Thompson opened the scoring on the power play 7:56 into the game on his 35th goal of the season. He has a career-high 69 points through 51 games.

            ANDERSSON OUT AGAIN

            Calgary defenseman Rasmus Andersson was held out after he was struck by a vehicle while riding a scooter in Detroit on Wednesday. Andersson has been considered day to day and isn’t expected to miss a significant amount of time. Andersson is one of Calgary’s top defensemen and has 34 points on the season.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Calgary Flames scored four times in just over five minutes in their 7-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday.Dillon Dube had a goal and three assists for Calgary and Tyler Toffoli had two goals and an assist. Jakob Pelletier, Mikael Backlund, Nazem Kadri and Dennis Gilbert also scored, while Jacob Markstrom made 21 saves.Tage Thompson and Casey Mittelstadt scored for the Sabres, and goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 33 saves.After falling behind 2-0, the Flames took control with a dominant second-period surge that saw them score four times between 2:17 and 7:39.“It just felt like everything kind of kept coming in waves and we did a really good job,” Toffoli said. “We could tell that they were getting frustrated and we just capitalized on our opportunities.”Pelletier, the 26th overall pick in the 2019 draft, began Calgary’s comeback with his first career goal. Backlund evened the score 20 seconds later from the right circle on a poor moment by Luukkonen.Gilbert, a Buffalo native, scored his first goal of the season and the second of his career 4:04 into the second by collecting a drop pass and beating Luukkonen with a low slap shot.“We maybe started a little bit slower than we would’ve liked, but we had a good response in between periods,” Gilbert said. “We had a good second and third.”Luukkonen made one of his best saves of the season on a two-man rush 7:09 into the second, robbing Dube. But the Flames quickly struck again, making it 4-2 20 seconds later on Kadri’s shot through traffic for his 20th goal of the season.Calgary outshot Buffalo 34-8 through two periods.“We never found a rhythm even though we had some good energy in the first, and then we died,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We looked fatigued. We looked like we hadn’t played in a while.”Toffoli made it 5-2 1:57 into the third on a tap-in and scored his second of the game to make it 6-2 with 6:55 remaining. Dube scored with 2:49 left in the game for the final margin.Thompson opened the scoring on the power play 7:56 into the game on his 35th goal of the season. He has a career-high 69 points through 51 games.ANDERSSON OUT AGAINCalgary defenseman Rasmus Andersson was held out after he was struck by a vehicle while riding a scooter in Detroit on Wednesday. Andersson has been considered day to day and isn’t expected to miss a significant amount of time. Andersson is one of Calgary’s top defensemen and has 34 points on the season.UP NEXTFlames: Travel to Ottawa to play the Senators on Monday.Sabres: Begin a three-game trip against the Los Angeles Kings on Monday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/12,,World

(AP) — Maddy Siegrist scored a career-high 50 points to become the Big East Conference's career regular-season scoring leader and No. 15 Villanova defeated Seton Hall 99-65 on Saturday.

            With 1,550 conference regular-season points, Siegrist surpassed former Boston College standout Sarah Behn's (1989-93) 1,546 points. Siegrist also broke the previous single-game Villanova program record of 44 points, set by Shelly Pennefather.

            Siegrist, who posted the first 50-point game in Division I women's action this season, shot a smoldering 76.9%, making 20 of 26 shot attempts. She grabbed 10 rebounds and did not commit a foul or turnover.











            Maddie Burke scored 12 points for Villanova (22-4, 13-2 Big East), which shot 38 for 59 (64.4%).

            Sidney Cooks scored 21 for Seton Hall (15-10, 8-7) and Lauren Park-Lane added 20. 

            Cooks' basket 6:17 before halftime knotted the score at 25. Siegrist countered with a layup 4:53 before intermission and Villanova went on a 17-3 run for a 42-28 advantage at the break. Siegrist scored eight and Burke scored seven during the run.

            Siegrist scored 22 by halftime and picked up where she left after the break with a layup and a 3-pointer off a Seton Hall turnover to give the Wildcats their first 20-point lead of the contest at 49-28. She scored 15 in the third.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807577,"Cirelli scores twice, Lightning defeat Stars 3-1","DALLAS (AP) — Anthony Cirelli scored twice, including the winner with 43 seconds to play, to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 3-1 victory over the Dallas Stars on Saturday.

            Victor Hedman took the puck behind the net and attempted a wrap-around, putting the puck in front for Cirelli to tap it past Dallas goalie Scott Wedgewood. Cirelli also assisted on Brandon Hagel's empty-netter as time expired.

            “I couldn't really reach around,” Hedman said of his 500th career assist. “I was kind of off balance. I knew we had guys in front.”











            One of those guys was Cirelli, who had scored just three goals in his first 23 games this season. 

            “I wanted to be around the goalie,” he said. “I didn't see (the puck), he put it on my stick. I was just kind of lucky.""

            In the Lightning’s last two games — both wins — Cirelli has two goals and two assists. Hagel has three goals and two assists in that span.

            Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy had 28 saves, allowing only Jamie Benn’s 21st goal this season in the second period. Wedgewood also made 28 saves.

            After being outshot 24-16 in the first two periods, the Lightning took over in the final 20 minutes and having a 16-5 shot advantage. 

            “We turned the puck over for two periods,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.

            So what happened in the third period?

            “When you put the puck behind the goal line and now you have to make them work to get it out, that kind of shifted the field position of the game that they had in the first two periods,"" he said. 

            Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said the last five minutes of the third were an issue. 

            “We didn’t give Wedgie enough help. Our execution in the last five minutes was poor,"" he said. ""You can’t sit in a shell. They pushed in the third; that’s what a real good team like that does. ”

            Each team scored once in the second period, when Dallas outshot the Lightning 12-10. More important may have been Wedgewood making two stops on Steven Stamkos, who came into the day with 20 goals in 23 games against the Stars.

            Cooper knew his team was up against the Stars, who are the points leaders in the Western Conference. Tampa Bay's win came on the heels of a victory over Colorado and a 7-1 loss to Florida.

            “We played two of the best teams in this conference,"" Cooper said of his team, which is 5-1-1 in the last seven games. ""A big bounce-back after the Florida game.”

            ABOUT NO. 500

            Hedman was modest in assessing his 500th assist.

            “The last 14 years we’ve had a lot of guys to put pucks in the net. It came in a big game like this, late in the game,"" he said. ""Those are the moments you live for.”

            INJURIES

            Lightning: LW Nicholas Paul (upper-body) was scratched for the second straight game, so Tampa Bay played with 11 forwards and seven defensemen.

            UP NEXT

            Lightning: Play the second of four road games at Columbus on Tuesday.

            Ole Miss hit 6 of 14 shots from behind the 3-point arc in the first half but went 0-9 over the final 20 minutes and missed opportunities to close out a win. With a two-point lead and 2:24 to play the Rebels worked for an open look and found Myles Burns with an open lane to the basket. He could not get his open look to fall and, after Chico Carter Jr. was whistled for an intentional foul, Burns missed both free throws. 

            Tye Fagan hit two free throws with 1:31 left to give Ole Miss a four-point lead, 59-55, Johnson drove the lane for a layup and added a free throw to get the Gamecocks within one, and after Fagan turned it over, Wright buried a wide-open 3-pointer to take the lead. Johnson added 3 of 4 from the line to put the game out of reach and Fagan added a layup with a second left for the final margin. 











            Hayden Brown scored 18 points to lead South Carolina (9-16, 2-10 Southeastern Conference). Wright hit 3 of 5 from distance and scored 17 points with five boards and four assists. Johnson contributed 13 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807582,"McDavid, Hyman help Oilers snap Senators' four-game streak","OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman had a goal and an assist each to lead the Edmonton Oilers past Ottawa 6-3 on Saturday and snap the Senators' four-game win streak. 

            Brett Kulak had a pair of assists in the third period as the Oilers broke a 3-3 tie on their way to victory. He made a cross-ice pass to Jesse Puljujarvi, who beat Ottawa goalie Anton Forsberg at 3:05 of the third period.

            Kulak then sent a pass in front that was chopped in by Derek Ryan 7:24 for the Oilers' second short-handed goal of the game.











            “I think we made two critical mistakes and both end up in our net,” Senators coach DJ Smith said. “We’ve got to be harder. We haven’t made those mistakes in the past four games when we’ve been winning. We’ve taken care of the puck, we played hard in front of our net and we just didn’t do that enough to win.”

            Forsberg was injured in the third period during a scramble that led to a power-play goal by Ryan Nugent Hopkins. Forsberg had to be taken off the ice on a stretcher with an apparent lower-body injury. 

            “It’s never a pleasant sight. He’s been gritty for us all year. No update but I hope it’s not as severe as it looked. I really hope and praying that it’s not too bad,” Senators captain Brady Tkachuk said of Forsberg, who had 31 saves. “Just the way he takes care of himself on the ice, off the ice, how great of a pro he is and how good of a person he is too, you never want to see that.""

            Hyman was lying on top of Forsberg at the time of the injury.

            “It’s awful. I mean, you hear him going down and you hear him in pain. But you can’t do anything. I literally couldn’t do anything. I’m stuck on him because there’s a guy who’s on top of me pushing me in,” Hyman said. “... I almost stopped playing there because I locked eyes with him and he was just in pain. Hope he gets better soon.""

            Ryan McLeod also scored for the Oilers, while Jack Campbell had 26 saves.

            Jake Sanderson, Claude Giroux and Erik Brannstrom scored for the Senators, who saw their four-game streak end.

            McDavid scored the only goal of the first period when he banked a shot from behind the goal line off Forsberg and in at 2:18.

            The teams combined for five goals in the second period including two at even strength, a power-play goal and a short-handed goal on the same penalty, as well as a penalty shot marker.

            NOTES

            Saturday’s game was the first of two regular-season meetings between the Senators and Oilers. The will meet again at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta, on March 14. ... With his first-period goal, McDavid extended his career-high road point streak to 17 games. … Hyman reached the 300-point mark for his career with an assist on McDavid’s goal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807584,"Duchene's OT goal lifts Predators over Flyers, 2-1","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Matt Duchene scored 34 seconds into overtime, Juuse Saros made 23 saves and the Nashville Predators defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 on Saturday but lost top scorer Filip Forsberg in the first period after he took a hard late hit.

            Nino Niederreiter scored in regulation for the Predators, who entered play four points out of the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.

            Kevin Hayes scored for Philadelphia, which dropped to 2-10 past regulation this season. Carter Hart made 23 saves but couldn’t stop Nashville’s lone shot in the extra session.











            The teams finished with 83 combined hits in a contest that turned extremely physical after the first period.

            “We’re in a tight playoff race, and our mindset is we have to come in and battle and compete,” Predators coach John Hynes said. “Both teams have some physical players, and that’s how the game played out. There’s a certain intensity level and focus level that we need to be able to play with here coming down the stretch. And tonight was a typical example of how hard games are going to be.”

            Ryan Johansen set up the game winner with a drop pass to Duchene, whose wrist shot from the slot went off defenseman Cam York and under Hart’s left pad.

            “(Duchene) took over from there and got it done,” Johansen said.

            Hart said he should have made the save in spite of the deflection. “A goal you have to stop,” he said.

            The teams were slow to get going following a 12:30 p.m. start. But things heated up after Philadelphia defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen’s check of Forsberg. Forsberg, who tops the Predators with 19 goals and is tied for the team lead with 42 points, appeared to hit his head on the ice after absorbing the hard but clean contact. He did not return.

            “I thought it was a clean hit,” Ristolainen said. “Unfortunate result.”

            Hynes did not provide an update on Forsberg after the game.

            “That kind of started it all,” Johnansen said of the physical play. “Something our group didn’t like. Our team stuck together, played for each other, played hard and got a nice result.”

            Nashville’s Tanner Jeannot responded with a hard hit on Philadelphia’s Ivan Provorov at the outset of the second period, and Jeannot and the Flyers’ Nick Deslauriers then fought, with both players landing clean shots. The physical play continued throughout the period, with the Predators taking every opportunity to finish checks on Ristolainen and any other Flyers skater.

            After Juuso Parssinen sent Philadelphia’s Noah Cates headfirst into the boards at center ice, Flyers forward Joel Farabee responded by dropping the gloves with Parssinen in the second fight of the period. Later in the frame, Nashville’s Jeremy Lauzon delivered two hard hits on one shift, sending Scott Laughton to the bench limping after a check into the corner boards before an open-ice hit on Travis Konecny left the Flyers’ top scorer sprawling backward to the ice.

            Flyers coach John Tortorella has tried to establish a tough, hard-nosed identity in his first year at the helm. Philadelphia entered leading the NHL in hits, and the coach liked the way his team responded Saturday.

            “That’s what the team has developed into,” he said. “I think all that stuff helps the room, helps that team aspect of it and I think it’s grown as the year has gone on.”

            Niederreiter put Nashville ahead 1-0 1:43 into the frame with a backhanded deflection from close range after a setup by Duchene. Hayes answered just under nine minutes later using some nifty stick skills on a breakaway to set up a backhanded finish. Farabee sprang Hayes into a one-on-one situation, with Saros with an excellent pass from just beyond the blue line.

            Neither team could get the go-ahead goal in the third despite lots of chances.

            NOTES: Philadelphia fans broke out in 13 “E-A-G-L-E-S!” Philadelphia Eagles chants ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl. … The teams finished the regular-season series tied at 1-apiece after the Flyers defeated the Predators in Nashville on Oct. 22. … Philadelphia fell to 11-13-3 at home while Nashville improved to 11-11-3 on the road.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807585,Marina Mabrey heads to Chicago in four-team deal,"The Chicago Sky acquired Marina Mabrey as part of a four-team deal on Saturday with the New York Liberty, Dallas Wings and Phoenix Mercury.

            The Sky, who lost Candace Parker, Courtney Vandersloot, Azura Stevens in free agency, also received the Mercury's second-round draft pick next year. 

            “We cannot wait to welcome Marina into the Chicago Sky family,” Sky general manager and coach James Wade said. “Adding a player such as Marina who can play both guard positions, is a talented sharpshooter and gives her all every single game will all be vital for our team this year. We are looking forward to having her as a big addition to our roster.” 











            Mabrey averaged 12.8 points and 3.7 rebounds for the Wings since the team acquired her prior to the 2020 season. She had a career-best 13.6 points last season.

            The Wings, who gave up Mabrey, received Diamond DeShields from Phoenix as well as Chicago's first-round draft picks the next two seasons. Dallas also has the rights to swap first round picks with the Sky in 2025.

            “Diamond DeShields has established herself as one of the premier wing players in the WNBA,” Dallas Wings President and CEO Greg Bibb said. “Her size, athleticism, ability to get to the rim and defensive acumen will make us a better basketball team. She also brings a wealth of playoff experience and a WNBA championship with her to Dallas that will ultimately aid us in our continued pursuit of a championship of our own.”

            New York gave up 2021 WNBA Rookie of the Year Michaela Onyenwere to Phoenix and received the rights to Leonie Fiebich from Chicago as well the Sky's second-round pick next year. 

            “Michaela was integral in reinvigorating the Liberty team,” Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said. “Her contributions throughout the early parts of her career have been incredibly impressive. Mic brought unmatched energy and positivity, irrespective of her role, which speaks to her character and selflessness. She has a very bright future, and we wish her the absolute best in Phoenix, where she is poised to take on a larger role.”

            The Liberty also have the chance to swap first-round picks with the Mercury in 2025.

            Phoenix also received Chicago's third-round pick next year as well as the Sky's second round pick in 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807586,Australia begins T20 World Cup defense with powerful win,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Australia began its Women's T20 World Cup defense with a powerful 97-run win over New Zealand on Saturday to underline its status as the top team in the world.

            Australia posted 173-9 after being put in to bat at Boland Park in Paarl, with 55 from opener Alyssa Healey, 41 from captain Meg Lanning and 40 from Ellyse Perry.

            Australia bowled New Zealand out for 76 in 14 overs, its lowest total at the World Cup and third lowest in Twenty20s.











            The Aussie bowlers worked their way quickly through New Zealand's batting, starting with pace bowler Megan Schutt removing both openers for ducks in the first over.

            Spinner Ashleigh Gardner took over and ran through New Zealand's middle and lower order for career-best figures of 5-12 from three overs.

            “That (win) was set up by our batters, who gave us a bit of flexibility with the ball,” Gardner said. “We started off exactly the way we wanted to.”

            The dominant performance reminded everyone why the Aussies have won five of the seven past Women's T20 World Cups, including the last two, and are outright favorites to make it six titles in eight tournaments.

            England, the world's No. 2-ranked team, started its tournament earlier Saturday in sweltering hot Paarl with a strong batting display to beat West Indies by seven wickets.

            West Indies made 135-7 and England chased it down comfortably, with 40 not out from Nat Sciver-Brunt and 32 not out from captain Heather Knight.

            Their unbeaten 67-run stand ensured the English cruised to 138-3 in 14.3 overs.

            Australia goes to the top of Group 1 on net run rate ahead of Sri Lanka, which pulled off a big shock to beat host South Africa on opening night Friday.

            England leads Group 2, where the focus will be on Sunday when India plays Pakistan in another instalment of their fierce cricket rivalry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807589,"Matheson scores in OT for Canadiens, beat Isles 4-3","MONTREAL (AP) — Mike Matheson scored in overtime to lift the Montreal Canadiens over the New York Islanders 4-3 on Saturday.

            But it took several minutes for the home crowd to be able to celebrate. 

            After the Canadiens successfully killed Mike Hoffman’s slashing penalty, the winger found himself on a breakaway. New York netminder Semyon Varlamov stopped Hoffman’s initial shot but Matheson bagged the winner on the rebound.











            The goal was reviewed for an offside, leaving both teams waiting in the tunnels. After a lengthy video review, the officials indicated the play was onside and confirmed Matheson’s winner.

            “It took a long time, we were all kind of talking and trying to figure out what they could have been looking at,” Montreal's Kirby Dach said. “Hoff had full possession coming across the line or whatever the rule is and honestly with a play like that it could go either way.""

            Most Islanders had retreated to the locker room and were told to stand by as the referees reviewed the play.

            “I think a lot of us knew it was close,” Bo Horvat said. “We didn’t obviously get the final result or whatever, but you know, it’s unfortunate that they couldn’t call that one back. But I mean it’s kind of on us to not be scoring that on the power play.”

            Isles coach Lane Lambert described the moment as “extremely deflating — twice.”

            Nick Suzuki broke a nine-game scoring drought, while Justin Barron and Kirby Dach added third-period goals. Hoffman collected three assists and Samuel Montembeault made 27 saves. 

            Their final game wearing their “retro reverse” light blue uniforms was also the Canadiens' first win in the alternate garb, going 1-6-1 this season. Coach Martin St. Louis jokingly shared his relief that the Canadiens will not be wearing the jerseys again this season.

            “This is a historical franchise,” St. Louis said. “And you probably have some guys that wore those jerseys 50 years ago that were red and white looking down going: ‘What are you guys doing in blue?’ So we probably get what we deserve ... I don’t know what next year brings but I hope it’s not those jerseys.”

            Brock Nelson, Horvat and Matt Martin scored for the Islanders, and Noah Dobson collected two assists. Varlamov made 27 saves as New York suffered back-to-back losses.

            Montreal opened the scoring in the opening frame after Josh Anderson, double-teamed along the boards, found Rafael Harvey-Pinard. The winger then sent a pass across the crease for Suzuki to put the Habs up 1-0 with seven minutes left in the first. 

            The Islanders responded with five minutes left when Nelson redirected Dobson’s shot from the point. Nelson extended his career-high point streak to 10 games, the longest for New York since Josh Bailey’s 11-game streak in 2017.

            New York took the lead in the final seconds of the second period on the power play. Horvat scored from the corner of the boards, banking the puck off Montembeault and into the net. The former Vancouver Canucks captain collected his fourth point (three goals, one assist) in four games as an Islander.

            Barron scored his second NHL goal to level the score for Montreal at 4:02 of the final frame. New York regained the lead when Martin redirected Alexander Romanov’s wrist shot from the point.

            Montreal tied the game a second time, with 3:16 remaining, after Dach deflected Mike Matheson’s low wrist shot from the blue line to force overtime.

            MONTY’S MONTH

            Montembeault took home the Molson Cup, which is awarded to Montreal’s player of the month. The 26-year-old posted a 4-6-0 record along with a 3.14 goals against average, a .915 save percentage and stopped 323 total shots.

            ROMANOV HOMECOMING

            Saturday’s contest was Romanov’s first game back in Montreal. The Canadiens presented a tribute video in the first period and an emotional Romanov received an ovation from the crowd. The 22-year-old Russian was traded at the 2022 NHL Draft for the 13th overall selection in a three-team deal that saw Dach move from the Chicago Blackhawks to Montreal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807593,Harley-Davidson from 1908 becomes priciest bike at auction,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — A rare Harley-Davidson motorcycle built in 1908 has become the most expensive motorcycle ever sold at auction, according to data compiled by a website that tracks vintage motorcycle sales. 

            The Strap Tank Harley-Davidson was recorded on vintagent.com as being sold for $935,000 after auction fees last month at the Mecum Auction in Las Vegas, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday.

            The bike was named Strap Tank because its oil and fuel tanks are attached to the frame with nickel straps. The bike is believed to be one of only 12 such models in the world. 











            A 1907 Strap Tank sold for $715,000 after fees but didn’t go for as much as the record-setting 1908 Strap Tank because it was never restored.

            The record-breaking bike had many of its original parts, making it even more rare, said Greg Arnold, Motorcycle Division Manager at Mecum Auctions. 

            “We marketed the bike well and Harley is by far the most famous American motorcycle brand so we had a feeling it would do well in auction, but obviously you are surprised anytime you sell the most expensive bike ever,” he said.MILWAUKEE (AP) — A rare Harley-Davidson motorcycle built in 1908 has become the most expensive motorcycle ever sold at auction, according to data compiled by a website that tracks vintage motorcycle sales.The Strap Tank Harley-Davidson was recorded on vintagent.com as being sold for $935,000 after auction fees last month at the Mecum Auction in Las Vegas, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday.The bike was named Strap Tank because its oil and fuel tanks are attached to the frame with nickel straps.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807594,GM Pelinka: Don't blame Westbrook for all of Lakers' woes,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — General manager Rob Pelinka says Russell Westbrook doesn't deserve all the blame for the Lakers' struggles throughout his time in Los Angeles.

            Pelinka still has renewed optimism about the Lakers' future following a flurry of trades, including the deal that sent away Westbrook after less than two seasons.

            “I think all teams at times take risks, trade for a player, and our aspirations when we did the Westbrook trade was that it would lead to a championship-contending team,” Pelinka said.











            “We didn’t meet that goal, so you have to then look to pivot if something is not working, to correct it,” he added Saturday in his first extensive comments since adding six new players. “I think with this trade deadline, there was an opportunity there. And I think it’s really unfair to put the last year and a half (on) one player. The whole roster had to come together and fit, and part of sports sometimes is if things aren’t working, you have to fix them.”

            After returning to his hometown through a pricey trade in the summer of 2021, Westbrook played some of the worst basketball of his career while struggling to fit into a complementary role alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the big man whose constant injury problems made everything much worse. The trio played together for only 44 of a possible 138 games, going 22-22.

            Pelinka says he swapped out nearly half of the Lakers' roster at the deadline to improve their chances for a late playoff run, but also because the moves will make Los Angeles much more likely to be a contender next year and into the future. After losing six of nine, Los Angeles is 25-31 and in 13th place in the 15-team Western Conference heading into Saturday's game at Golden State.

            “I think we showed at the trade deadline a willingness to be very aggressive with our future assets to make the team better and to also plan for the future,” Pelinka said. “I’m glad we were able to put action to words.”

            Pelinka traded Westbrook, the 2017 NBA MVP, in a three-team deal that brought D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt to the Lakers. Los Angeles also acquired big man Mo Bamba and wing Davon Reed at the deadline after acquiring Rui Hachimura late last month.

            The Lakers swapped out six players in four trades to land at least five potential long-term contributors, all for the added cost of a protected first-round draft pick in 2027.

            “You could almost look at it as pre-agency,” Pelinka said. “We very intentionally planned these moves to provide optionality in July, and some of these players have team options or team-controlled years on their contract. It gives us the ability to see how these last 26 regular-season games go and how potential postseason games go, and then we can go into this offseason with a higher collection of data points and a real-time analysis of how the pieces fit to make decisions for the future.”

            Pelinka felt he needed to blow up the Lakers' supporting cast because the team's initial plan wasn't working for the second consecutive season: The Lakers got off to a 2-10 start under new coach Darvin Ham, and their flashes of standout play never lasted long enough to make any headway in the standings. Davis has missed 24 games due to injury, while James will miss his 13th against the Warriors.

            While praising Beasley as “one of the most elite snipers in the game” and Vanderbilt as “one of the most unique young defenders in our game,” Pelinka also was clearly thrilled to land Russell, who spent his first two NBA seasons with the Lakers before Magic Johnson and Pelinka traded him away in 2017.

            Russell can be a free agent this summer, but Pelinka made it clear the Lakers want to keep him.

            “We do see him as a player that’s not just a short-term rental,” Pelinka said. “We do think he’s a player that could really fit nicely with our core pieces, just bringing spacing and shooting and playmaking and high efficiency.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807596,Real Madrid beats Al-Hilal 5-3 to win 8th Club World Cup,"RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Vinícius Júnior scored twice and assisted Karim Benzema to lead Real Madrid to its record-extending eighth Club World Cup title by beating Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal 5-3 on Saturday.

            Federico Valverde added two more goals for the European champions in a final that turned into a shootout. Al-Hilal never led but showed it was no fluke that it upset Brazil's Flamengo to reach the decider in Morocco's capital.

            Vinícius has been the target of racist slurs in the Spanish league and even had his effigy hung from a bridge, but has not let that negatively impact his performances.











            The Brazil forward, who scored the only goal when Madrid beat Liverpool in last season’s Champions League final, leads Madrid with 16 across all competitions. 

            Vinícius opened the scoring in the 13th minute and curled home Madrid's fifth and final goal in the 69th.

            “Vinícius has been improving since last season just as the team has also grown. We won the Champions League and now the world title, and Vinícius has grown along the way,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""We are thrilled with what he is doing, above all because he keeps getting better. He is much more decisive now and is making the difference in every match.”

            Luciano Vietto scored twice and Moussa Marega once for the Asian champions, who fell behind early and never got closer than 2-1 by halftime.

            Madrid last won the Club World Cup in 2018. It has succeeded in five different decades.

            Benzema was a mild surprise in Madrid’s starting lineup a day after Ancelotti said it was touch-and-go if he could play at all. The Ballon d’Or holder missed Madrid’s last two games, including the 4-1 semifinal win against Egyptian club Al Ahly on Wednesday.

            The France striker cued the opener after exchanges with Valverde and played Vinícius clear to beat goalkeeper Abdullah Al-Mayouf.

            Valverde smashed a poor clearance between the legs of a defender, who deflected it slightly before it whizzed past Al-Mayouf in the 18th.

            After struggling in the opening period to even connect three passes, Al-Hilal found its stride after Marega caught Madrid's backline trying to spring an offside trap in the 26th. The former Porto striker streaked away unbothered, sized up Andriy Lunin and fired past Madrid’s backup goalie, who started for the injured Thibaut Courtois.

            The goal settled Al-Hilal and Madrid was stymied until Vinícius made an exquisite pass to serve up a goal by Benzema. Vinícius used the outside edge of his right boot to bend a short cross around a defender and meet Benzema’s darting move. Benzema did the rest by using one touch to blast it in in the 54th.

            Valverde added his second in the 58th.

            Vietto scored on either side of Vinícius’ second goal, netting in the 63rd and 79th as Madrid’s defense failed to track the Argentine in the box.

            A late miss by Marega denied providing Al-Hilal a chance to go for a last-gasp equalizer.

            “This was the game of their lives, and you could tell it on the field, so we had to take this game seriously,” Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos said after collecting his sixth club world title across Madrid and former club Bayern Munich.

            Al-Hilal’s squad included members of the Saudi Arabia team that stunned eventual champion Argentina at thes World Cup. Its star player against Madrid, however, was Vietto, a forward who played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, before joining the Saudi league.

            With another world title in the bag, Madrid can focus on defending its European and Spanish titles. It trails Barcelona by eight points in the domestic league and will meet Liverpool in the Champions League round of 16 this month. It will also meet Barcelona, which won their Spanish Super Cup final last month, in the semifinals of the Copa del Rey.

            Earlier in Tangier, Flamengo beat Egyptian club Al Ahly 4-2 in the third-place game. Pedro and Gabriel Barbosa scored twice for the South American champions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807611,No. 23 Creighton holds off No. 21 UConn for 8th win in row,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The season's second meeting between Creighton and UConn was billed as Round Two between big men Ryan Kalkbrenner and Adama Sanogo.

            It turned out the main attraction Saturday was Trey Alexander versus Jordan Hawkins.

            Alexander scored 17 points to lead No. 23 Creighton, Hawkins had what would have been a tying 3-pointer erased on video review in the final seconds, and the Bluejays held off the 21st-ranked Huskies 56-53.











            Creighton (17-8, 11-3) won its eighth straight to land a half-game behind Big East-leading Marquette. Connecticut (19-7, 8-7) lost for the first time in four games.

            Creighton was able to go to Alexander when it needed a basket, and he made a couple 3s just as the shot clock was about to expire. He was equally proud of his defense against Hawkins, the Big East's second-leading scorer behind Sanogo and a 40% 3-point shooter.

            Hawkins was held scoreless on four shots in the first half and finished with 11.

            “Somebody who has the kind of hype around his name that he does, you take the matchup kind of personal considering the fact they beat us at their house,"" Alexander said. “Coming into our building, we knew we were trying to impose our will early. I knew for us to do that we had to be able to stop him early because he likes to get going early.”

            Alexander was playing with four fouls when he re-entered the game with just over 3 minutes to play. He scored inside to put the Bluejays up 54-49, but Hawkins’ second-chance basket pulled the Huskies within three with a minute left.

            After Alexander missed the front end of a one-and-one, Hawkins rebounded Sanogo's miss and made a shot from the top of the key with 2.7 seconds left. 

            The basket originally was ruled a 3, which would have tied the game at 54, but officials changed it to a 2-pointer when the video review showed Hawkins’ right foot was on the line.

            Kalkbrenner was fouled after catching the long inbounds pass and made the free throws for the final margin.

            “If you wanted to capture Big East basketball in 40 minutes, that was it,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “It was hard for both teams to score. Did we miss some open shots? Did they miss some open shots? Yes. But open shots were really hard to come by.""

            Sanogo had gotten the better of Kalkbrenner in the teams' first meeting, scoring 26 points in the Huskies’ 69-60 win in Storrs on Jan. 7.

            Sanogo on Saturday finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds for his fifth double-double and he made a career-high three 3-pointers. Kalkbrenner was just 3 of 11 from the field and had 12 points and six rebounds.

            Fans expecting to see Sanogo and Kalkbrenner battle in the paint got a surprise in the first half. The 6-9, 240-pound Sanogo’s expanded offensive game allowed the Huskies to keep things close as he made 3 of 5 3s.

            Sanogo came into the season having attempted just one 3 in 52 career games. He showed up in Omaha 13 of 33 from distance this season. He opened the Huskies’ scoring with a 3 from above the key and ended the half with another from the same spot to cut Creighton’s lead to 31-29.

            “I'm mad at him a little bit right now,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “I thought he should have shot two or four more 3s in the second half. For us to win that game, I almost felt like at half he was going to have to make another 3 or two.”

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: The Huskies never established an offensive rhythm. They had 11 of their 18 offensive rebounds in the second half but their inability to finish at the rim led to season-worst 32.3% shooting for the game.

            Creighton: Despite being held 20 points under their season scoring average, the Bluejays are one of the hottest teams in the country and their six-game losing streak in December is a distant memory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807612,"Griffen, Sears lift No. 3 Alabama over rival Auburn 77-69","AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Rylan Griffen and Mark Sears were the only Alabama players hitting their 3-point shots, and it was just enough.

            Griffen scored 16 points, Sears added 15 and No. 3 Alabama held off a big challenge from its in-state rival, beating Auburn 77-69 on Saturday.

            The Crimson Tide (22-3, 12-0 Southeastern Conference) remained the only Power-5 team without a league loss, but it was iffy most of the way with Auburn putting the defensive clamps on star Brandon Miller.











            “I thought our guys showed some resilience to weather a bad shooting night from Brandon,” Tide coach Nate Oats said. “We had some other guys step up.”

            The Tigers (17-8, 7-5) missed nine straight shots in the final minutes. They have dropped five of their last six after being ranked most of the way.

            “Our team is playing good basketball right now,” Tigers coach Bruce Pearl said. “We’re playing well. We’re just not playing well enough to beat the best team in the country.”

            Sears and Griffen helped Alabama overcome an off shooting performance from star Miller, who had 13 points but missed all seven 3-point attempts. They were a combined 5 of 8 from 3-point range, and the rest of the team went just 1 of 13.

            Sears made 5 of 7 shots and had seven rebounds and three assists, and scored 10 points in the second half. Griffen scored 11 after halftime and made 3 of 5 3s. His dunk with 58 seconds left pushed Alabama's lead to six points.

            “Rylan was huge. We don’t win this game without Rylan,” Oats said. “And I really thought he did the best job defensively on Wendell (Green Jr.).”

             Jaden Bradley missed only one shot and had 12 points.

            Green had 16 of his 24 points in the second half for Auburn, going 7 of 19 from the floor. Jaylin Williams had 14 of his 16 points before the half and KD Johnson added 12.

            Miller's driving layup with 2:37 left gave Alabama a 71-66 lead, its biggest to that point. The Tigers went cold before Green's layup at the buzzer that kept Alabama from its 11th double-digit SEC win.

            “It was just tough down the stretch,” Williams said. “We needed stops. We stuck together but we couldn’t get stops and couldn't get rebounds.” 

            Alabama shot 59.2% (29 of 49) in the game but the nation's top rebounding team was edged on the boards, 36-34.

            The Tide have won four straight since a road loss to Oklahoma.

            “Every possession mattered to the very end,” Griffen said, “so learning from that Oklahoma game really helped us.”

            Auburn led by as many as eight points in the first half, shutting down the Tide's two top scorers most of the way. Miller didn't score for more than 11 minutes and Sears got his first points at the free throw line with 4:26 left.

            But it was 37-all by halftime with Miller missing his fourth straight 3-point attempt with a chance at the lead in the closing seconds. He scored six points below his average.

            “We did a good job of guarding him from 3,” Pearl said, “but they’ve got a lot of weapons.”

(AP) — Rylan Griffen and Mark Sears were the only Alabama players hitting their 3-point shots, and it was just enough.Griffen scored 16 points, Sears added 15 and No. 3 Alabama held off a big challenge from its in-state rival, beating Auburn 77-69 on Saturday.The Crimson Tide (22-3, 12-0 Southeastern Conference) remained the only Power-5 team without a league loss, but it was iffy most of the way with Auburn putting the defensive clamps on star Brandon Miller.“I thought our guys showed some resilience to weather a bad shooting night from Brandon,” Tide coach Nate Oats said. “We had some other guys step up.”The Tigers (17-8, 7-5) missed nine straight shots in the final minutes. They have dropped five of their last six after being ranked most of the way.“Our team is playing good basketball right now,” Tigers coach Bruce Pearl said. “We’re playing well. We’re just not playing well enough to beat the best team in the country.”Sears and Griffen helped Alabama overcome an off shooting performance from star Miller, who had 13 points but missed all seven 3-point attempts. They were a combined 5 of 8 from 3-point range, and the rest of the team went just 1 of 13.Sears made 5 of 7 shots and had seven rebounds and three assists, and scored 10 points in the second half. Griffen scored 11 after halftime and made 3 of 5 3s. His dunk with 58 seconds left pushed Alabama's lead to six points.“Rylan was huge. We don’t win this game without Rylan,” Oats said. “And I really thought he did the best job defensively on Wendell (Green Jr.).”Jaden Bradley missed only one shot and had 12 points.Green had 16 of his 24 points in the second half for Auburn, going 7 of 19 from the floor. Jaylin Williams had 14 of his 16 points before the half and KD Johnson added 12.Miller's driving layup with 2:37 left gave Alabama a 71-66 lead, its biggest to that point. The Tigers went cold before Green's layup at the buzzer that kept Alabama from its 11th double-digit SEC win.“It was just tough down the stretch,” Williams said. “We needed stops. We stuck together but we couldn’t get stops and couldn't get rebounds.”Alabama shot 59.2% (29 of 49) in the game but the nation's top rebounding team was edged on the boards, 36-34.The Tide have won four straight since a road loss to Oklahoma.“Every possession mattered to the very end,” Griffen said, “so learning from that Oklahoma game really helped us.”Auburn led by as many as eight points in the first half, shutting down the Tide's two top scorers most of the way. Miller didn't score for more than 11 minutes and Sears got his first points at the free throw line with 4:26 left.But it was 37-all by halftime with Miller missing his fourth straight 3-point attempt with a chance at the lead in the closing seconds. He scored six points below his average.“We did a good job of guarding him from 3,” Pearl said, “but they’ve got a lot of weapons.”BIG PICTUREAlabama: Has won 13 of its last 14. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807613,"Basile scores 33, Virginia Tech heats up to beat Notre Dame","SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Grant Basile scored 33 points, including 16 in a near six-minute stretch of the second half, and Virginia Tech defeated Notre Dame 93-87 on Saturday.

            The Hokies made 10 consecutive shots — seven of them by Basile — in building an 85-75 lead with 3:49 to go and finished it off by making eight of their last nine from the free-throw line. Basile, a 15.6 points-per-game scorer, has back-to-back 33-point games.

            After making 13 of their first 25 3-point tries, the Fighting Irish missed their last five in the final eight-plus minutes as Virginia Tech pulled away.











            Justyn Mutts scored 19 points for the Hokies (15-10, 5-9 ACC) and M.J. Collins and Sean Pedulla added 12 points each. Basile made 13 of 19 shots, 3 of 7 from 3-point distance.

            Nate Laszewski, who scored 20 points for Notre Dame (10-15, 2-12) in the first half, continued his hot shooting in the second half. He had 30 points and made six of his first eight 3-pointers to keep Notre Dame close and J.J. Starling tied the score at 59 when he hit a driving layup with 11:43 remaining.

            But Virginia Tech, which had led for most of the game except for one 12-minute stretch of the first half, surged ahead with an 11-4 run capped by a three-point play by Basile that began his stretch of 16 points in six minutes as the Hokies went on to build their double-digit lead.

            Laszewski finished with a career-high 33 points and eight rebounds. He made 12 of 17 shots, including 6 of 9 3-pointers. His previous high was 28 two seasons ago. Cormac Ryan made 5 of 9 3-pointers for Notre Dame and finished with 17 points. Ven-Allen Lubin added 11 points.

            Notre Dame visits Duke on Tuesday and Virginia Tech's next game is at Georgia Tech on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807614,"Hawkins, Illinois shut out No. 24 Rutgers for 10 mins in win","CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Coleman Hawkins scored 18 points and Illinois held No. 24 Rutgers scoreless for more than 10 minutes in the second half, rallying for a 69-60 win Saturday.

            The Illini (17-7, 8-5 Big Ten) trailed 47-41 with 14 1/2 minutes left before Hawkins' 3-pointer started a 19-0 run.

            Rutgers (16-9, 8-6) missed 15 straight shots during its drought.











            Hawkins hit four consecutive shots — including a 3 — and gave the Illini the lead for good at 48-47. The Illini have won three straight against ranked opponents.

            Illinois coach Brad Underwood said Hawkins “bides his time” with a patient approach reminiscent of former Illinois guard Ayo Dosunmu.

            Hawkins said it isn’t “anyone’s fault but mine” that he has frequently taken some time to work his way into games this season. He went 3 of 4 in the first half with three rebounds and three assists before keying the big run.

            “Today I tried to get involved, tried to get a few shots in and get to the offensive glass, whatever that is, to kind of impact the game early,” Hawkins said. “I think that energy carried over.”

            Matthew Mayer scored his first points and drew a foul at the 7:25 mark, hit the ensuing free throw and made a 3 a possession later to give Illinois a 60-47 cushion with 6:45 left. Oskar Palmquist finally hit a jumper to break the Rutgers slump.

            Illinois players combined for seven blocked shots to Rutgers' six.

            “They bothered us at the rim,” Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. “But you almost have to go through them, you've got to try to dunk the ball, even if you get a charge on something like that. You've got to finish with tremendous toughness around that basket.”

            Hawkins also had eight rebounds. Dain Dainja and Terrence Shannon Jr. each added 15 points for the Illini.

            Underwood praised Dainja for reshaping his body and diet since transferring to Illinois from Baylor and for carving out a key role this year.

            “It wasn't easy for him, but it's also a tribute to Dain that he didn't shy away from it and he accepted it,” Underwood said. “Then he was a battering ram for Kofi (Cockburn) in practice, but all that pays off.”

            Caleb McConnell and Clifford Omoruyi scored 14 points apiece to lead the Scarlet Knights.

            Rutgers led 34-30 at halftime after Paul Mulcahy hit consecutive jumpers and Illinois missed its last six shots.

            Underwood said forward RJ Melendez did not play due to a suspension stemming from his violation of team rules. 

            GOODE DEBUT

            Illinois sophomore guard Luke Goode made his season debut after missing four months with a foot fracture he sustained in a preseason scrimmage. He played five minutes and missed his only shot.

            “You have the build-up to playing the season, and boom, like that your season is taken away from you,” Hawkins said. “It’s tough on you mentally and physically. It was just good to see Luke back.”

            Goode played sparingly as a freshman but was expected to factor into the team as a capable shot-maker.

            BIG PICTURE

            Rutgers: An 0-2 mark on the road this week after losing starter Mawot Mag to a torn ACL doesn’t spell doom for the Scarlet Knights, who are solidly in the Big Ten mix behind No. 1 Purdue. Pikiell’s group could bolster its NCAA Tournament resume with a strong conference finish and a favorable schedule the rest of the way.

            Illinois: The Illini started slow after a bit of unexpected rest following the postponement of a home game against last-place Minnesota, but surged behind strong efforts from Hawkins and Dainja. The lockdown defense didn’t hurt, either.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807617,Gas pipeline to Vegas resumes operating after shutdown,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A pipeline facility in California that was forced to shut down deliveries of gasoline and diesel from the Los Angeles area east to areas including Las Vegas and Phoenix due to a leak, resumed operations on Saturday, according to the pipeline's operator.

            The source of the leak was isolated within its Watson Station in Long Beach, California, and the facility began to deliver fuel by Saturday afternoon, according to pipeline operator Kinder Morgan.

            The amount and cause of the leak were under investigation, said Kinder Morgan communications manager Katherine Hill. Clark County officials said they believed supplies would not be affected by the leak.











            “As the pipeline is expected to be fully operational by this evening, I again urge Las Vegas residents to refrain from panic buying fuel,” said Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, who had declared a state of emergency to help mitigate the impact of the leak.

            Kinder Morgan said the leak was discovered Thursday afternoon at a company station near Los Angeles and that its CALNEV and SFPP West pipelines were shut down while the Houston-based pipeline operator worked to resolve the issue. 

            The pipeline provides fuel storage facilities in southern Nevada with unleaded and diesel fuel, according to Clark County officials. Another pipeline operated by UNEV Pipeline LLC serves the Las Vegas area from northern Utah.

            The Kinder Morgan website says its 566-mile (911-kilometer) CALNEV pipeline transports gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Los Angeles refineries and marine terminals through parallel 14-inch (35.5-centimeter) and 8-inch (20-centimeter) diameter pipelines to Barstow, California, and the Las Vegas area.

            Hill said later that only the larger, 14-inch (35.5-centimeter) pipeline to Las Vegas had been shut down.

            Airports it serves include Nellis Air Force Base and Harry Reid International in Las Vegas and Edwards Air Force Base in California’s Mojave Desert, the company said.

            Bacot posted his 15th double-double of the season and 64th of his career as the Tar Heels (16-9, 8-6 ACC) snapped a three-game losing streak. RJ Davis added four 3-pointers and 17 points. North Carolina made a season-high tying 15 of 33 3-point attempts and shot 48% overall.

Leading scorer Hunter Tyson had an early 3-pointer to go over 1,000 career points but that was all he got, taking just two shots in 32 minutes against the defense of Leaky Black.











            Bacot restored a double-digit lead with the first basket of the second half and the Tar Heels, hitting eight of their first nine shots, built a 19-point bulge with the aid of four 3-pointers, two from Love.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807624,"Ukrainians, Junior Bruins celebrate unity arm-in-arm on ice","QUEBEC CITY (AP) — The decision to have players from both teams line up arm-in-arm at center ice for the playing of the Ukrainian and United States' national anthems was pre-planned in what stood as a symbol of unity and solidarity.

            What no one anticipated was the spontaneous celebration that erupted among the 11- and 12-year-olds following the Ukrainian Selects' 3-1 victory at the International Peewee Hockey tournament on Saturday.

            Rather than shuffle off the ice, members of the Boston Junior Bruins happily took part in a victory lap along with the Selects, which ended with the teams gathering again at center ice, where they posed for a picture with one player from each side holding up the ends of a large Ukrainian flag.











            “First of all, it’s a message that everybody can be friends and should be friends and live in peace and respect each other,” Ukraine forward Denys Lupandin said in an answer translated by coach Evgheniy Pysarenko. “It doesn’t matter from where you are.”

            The bonds that were made and the electric atmosphere of playing in front of some 18,000 fans in Quebec City’s Videotron Centre weren’t lost on Boston goalie James Boccuzzi.

            “This was definitely a life-changing moment for me,” Boccuzzi said. “I’ve never experienced anything like it.”

            The moments went far beyond fulfilling the message of peace that tournament organizers hoped to send across the world nearly a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. And it exceeded the vision Pysarenko and Sean Berube had in August, when they began the lengthy process of cobbling together a team of Ukrainian refugees.

            “The players reacted like that because they also want to show unity,” said Berube, who spent countless hours and some $20,000 of his own money crisscrossing Europe to gather the players in Romania. “What a day for hockey. What a day for sport.”

            The game didn’t lack for drama, either.

            With Boccuzzi keeping the swift-skating and play-making Ukrainians at bay on a number of close-in chances, Boston’s Kai Ochi opened the scoring 1:27 into the third period.

            The pro-Ukraine — but not anti-Boston — crowd finally got a chance to cheer and chant “Ole, Ole, Ole,” when Yehor Kosenko batted in a bouncing puck to tie the game with 4:48 remaining. Lupandin sneaked a shot in off a faceoff with 2:04 remaining and then sealed the win with an empty-net goal.

            Speaking in English, Lupandin said he and his teammates were nervous to open the game upon being welcomed by the large crowd.

            “The first moment it was so scary. I look and up and too many people look at me and my team, and first moment it was so hard, first period,” he said. “But second and third period, it was easily for me and maybe for my team. And thank you to the fans who come looking at us.”

            A large number of fans arrived three hours before puck drop. White T-shirts spelling out “UKRAINE” were draped over the backs of chairs in one section. In another, a blue-and-yellow version of the Canadian flag was attached to a railing.

            In Section 113, Roger Poirier carried a Ukrainian flag while handing out blue-and-white handkerchiefs. Poirier, who is from Quebec City, has become active in supporting Ukraine in part because he had business there, during which he also met his wife.

            Jessica Anthony wore a T-shirt with the Ukrainian flag on it and had on matching yellow sweatpants. Though an avid hockey fan, she acknowledged she doesn’t normally attend peewee games.

            “I want to express my solidarity with Ukraine,” Anthony said.

            The atmosphere was mostly foreign from what the Ukrainian Selects have known for much of the past year. Many of them have resettled with their families as refugees in countries neighboring Ukraine. At least five still live in Ukraine, where rocket-warning sirens in the middle of the night are the norm.

            “It’s an honor to participate in this event and everybody in solidarity with us and supporting our country,” Pysarenko said. “Everybody wants peace. These kids want peace mostly probably because you don’t know their stories, but I tell you they have the terrible times and terrible experiences.”

            One of those experiences included five players’ trip to the Romanian border to open training camp last month. Twice, they saw rockets fly above them.

            That’s something Bruins assistant coach Mike Cashman couldn’t even imagine. He hoped the Ukrainians can enjoy the new memories they’ve made at the tournament.

            “I just hope that these kids from Ukraine, they just experienced a thrill of a lifetime like our players did,” Cashman said. “You know, I don’t know what the future holds for them, unfortunately, but today they can remember today and be really excited about the future.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807633,Trudeau: US fighter shot down object over northern Canada,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that on his order a U.S. fighter jet shot down an “unidentified object” that was flying high over the Yukon, acting a day after the U.S. took similar action over Alaska. 

            North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected the object flying at a high altitude Friday evening over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace on Saturday. 

            Trudeau spoke with President Joe Biden, who also ordered the object to be shot down. Canadian and U.S. jets operating as part of NORAD were scrambled and it was a U.S. jet that shot down the object. 











            Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand told a news conference in Ottawa that the object, flying at around 40,000 feet, had been shot down at 3:41 p.m. EST, approximately 100 miles from the Canada-U.S. border in the central Yukon. A recovery operation was underway involving the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP.

            Hours later, in the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration said Saturday night it had closed some airspace in Montana to support Defense Department activities. NORAD later said the closure, which lasted a little more than an hour, came after it had detected “a radar anomaly” and sent fighter aircraft to investigate. The aircraft did not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits, NORAD said.

            F-22 fighter jets have now taken out three objects in the airspace above the U.S. and Canada over seven days, a stunning development that is raising questions on just what, exactly, is hovering overhead and who has sent them. 

            At least one of the objects downed was believed to be a spy balloon from China, but the other two had not yet been publicly identified.

            While Trudeau described the object Saturday as “unidentified,” Anand said it appeared to be “a small cylindrical object, smaller than the one that was downed off the coast of North Carolina."" A NORAD spokesman, Maj. Olivier Gallant, said the military had determined what it was but would not reveal details.

            Anand refused to speculate whether the object shot down over Canada came from China.

            “We are continuing to do the analysis on the object and we will make sure that analysis is thorough,” she said. “It would not be prudent for me to speculate on the origins of the object at this time.”

            Anand said to her knowledge this was the first time NORAD had downed an object in Canadian airspace.

            “The importance of this moment should not be underestimated,” she said. “We detected this object together and we defeated this object together.”

            She was asked why a U.S. jet, and not a Canadian plane, shot the object down.

            “As opposed to separating it out by country, I think what the important point is, these were NORAD capabilities, this was a NORAD mission and this was NORAD doing what it is supposed to do,” she said.

            Anand didn’t use the word “balloon” to describe the object. But later, Gen. Wayne Eyre, chief of the defense staff, said the instructions given to the planes was “who ever had the first, best shot to take out the balloon had the go-ahead.”

            Trudeau said Canadian forces would recover the wreckage for study. The Yukon is westernmost Canadian territory and the among the least populated part of Canada. 

            After the airspace closure over Montana, multiple members of Congress, including Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Jon Tester, said they were in touch with defense officials. Daines tweeted that he would “continue to demand answers on these invasions of US airspace.”

            Just about a day earlier, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said an object roughly the size of a small car was shot out of the skies above remote Alaska. Officials couldn’t say if it contained any surveillance equipment, where it came from or what purpose it had. 

            Kirby said it was shot down because it was flying at about 40,000 feet (13,000 meters) and posed a “reasonable threat” to the safety of civilian flights, not because of any knowledge that it was engaged in surveillance. 

            According to U.S. Northern Command, recovery operations continued Saturday on sea ice near Deadhorse, Alaska. 

            In a statement, the Northern Command said there were no new details on what the object was. It said the Alaska Command and the Alaska National Guard, along with the FBI and local law enforcement, were conducting search and recovery.

            “Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,” the statement said. 

            On Feb. 4, U.S. officials shot down a large white balloon off the coast of South Carolina. 

            The balloon was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for “several years,” the Pentagon has said. The U.S. has said Chinese balloons have flown over dozens of countries across five continents in recent years, and it learned more about the balloon program after closely monitoring the one shot down near South Carolina.

            China responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”

            The Navy continued survey and recovery activities on the ocean floor off South Carolina, and the Coast Guard was providing security. Additional debris was pulled out Friday, and additional operations will continue as weather permits, Northern Command said.VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that on his order a U.S. fighter jet shot down an “unidentified object” that was flying high over the Yukon, acting a day after the U.S. took similar action over Alaska.North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected the object flying at a high altitude Friday evening over Alaska, U.S. officials said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807637,Betis stays near top 4 in Spain; Valencia in drop zone,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Sergio Canales scored a superb goal and assisted for Real Betis’ winner to lead a 3-2 victory at Almeria on Saturday, keeping his team in the chase for a European berth in the Spanish league.

            The midfielder used his chest to cushion a floated pass by Rodri Sánchez and, while not letting the ball touch the turf, used his left boot to chip the ball over the on-rushing goalkeeper. That made it 2-1 for Betis in the 42nd minute.

            Almeria rallied to level before Canales put in a cross that Andrés Guardado headed home for the 70th-minute winner.











            Rodri opened the scoring in the sixth minute. Luis Suárez and Samu Costa scored for Almeria in the loss.

            Fifth-placed Betis, which had been struggling in previous games during an otherwise strong season, moved to within one point of fourth-placed Atletico Madrid.

            “These are three very important points to recover those we dropped last week and stay in the Europa League fight,” coach Manuel Pellegrini said.

            VALENCIA IN DROP

            Valencia was unable to escape the relegation zone after Athletic Bilbao won 2-1 at Mestalla Stadium amid a protest by the home fans against the club owners.

            Several hundred Valencia fans rallied outside the stadium against Singaporean businessman Peter Lim, who they blame for selling off Valencia's best players year after year. Several held up fans saying “Lim Go Home.”

            Samu Castillejos put Valencia in front, only for Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet to score for sixth-placed Bilbao.

            Valencia, which is under a caretaker coach since the firing of Gennaro Gattuso last month, was pushed into the bottom three after Cadiz escaped the drop zone on Friday with a win.

            “We know that we have a good squad but things are not going our way,” Valencia forward Hugo Duro said. “It is a bad run and we have to turn this around by ourselves.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807643,Union Berlin hot on Bayern's tail after RB Leipzig comeback,"At the start of the season and ever since, Urs Fischer has maintained that reaching 40 points and sealing Bundesliga survival was Union Berlin's aim. In achieving that mark while ending Leipzig’s 18-game unbeaten streak, the Irons showed their magical journey is in full flow. And even the Union Berlin coach can no longer entirely deny he's in a title race.“In terms of setting a new season goal I will speak not just to the players and staff but to the entire club and then we’ll communicate our new aim,” he said after another famous win on Saturday.DW then challenged the two coaches to confirm that Union is now a title contender.Fischer said: ""Based on the table, yes. But we are a very young Bundesliga club and we cannot forget where we come from. It is just a moment in time, a snapshot. We have to hit our limit in every game. In terms of mentality, solidarity and team spirit, we are a match for anyone. But we need more quality.""Rose seemed to suggest he didn't completely agree: ""I won’t get you into trouble, Urs. You do your job well. We both know it can all change with one result.""Fischer’s measured words were a stark contrast to the home side’s bombastic pre-match routine, featuring an elaborate light show and an unrelenting barrage of music drowning out the fans singing. It all indicated that this was to be an altogether different experience than the return fixture, which Union won 2-1 at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei in August.But the result stayed the same. Back then, a title tilt was not even a figment of the Irons' imagination. Now, it’s an undeniable reality. The club seems to have caught lightning in a bottle. Their unlikely title tilt appears to be following a script, featuring late wins and comebacks, while players like Janik Haberer and Kevin Behrens hit the form of their life. ""The madness continues,"" summarized Fischer.Playing the match with special kits using the self-proclaimed motto “on fire”, Leipzig made clear they’ve embraced their challenge for the Meisterschale, while Union have steadfastly remained modest about their championship chances.After an even start to the game, Benjamin Henrichs, playing as an inverted wing-back, cut onto his stronger right to smash in the long-range opener in the 24th minute. A moment of individual class and quality that left Union rattled, as they fluffed their lines during a freekick routine just minutes later.But one hallmark of their unlikely title tilt this season is they can never be written off. While Leipzig were missing their two most creative players in injured pair Christopher Nkunku and Dani Olmo, it had been Union who were sorely lacking a creative spark going forward. That was until Janik Haberer smashed in the sweetest of strikes right in front of the 4,500 travelling fans just past the hour mark.The Union magic has touched yet another player, another addition to the growing number of canny signings that Urs Fischer has teased the maximum level of talent out of. At his previous club Freiburg, Haberer had amassed 12 goals in 158 Bundesliga appearances. Since joining Union on a free transfer in the summer, he’s notched up 5 in 18.If it was Haberer's brilliance that earned Union parity, it was Mohamed Simakan's brainlessness that handed them the lead. As the ball bounced scruffily around the area, the French defender leant in to it with his arm, giving Robin Knoche the chance to fire home from the spot. Union had missed four of their five Bundesliga penalties this season but luck was simply on their side in Leipzig.That was ever more apparent when Yussuf Poulsen's equalizer was ruled out for an apparent offside, courtesy of a recent rule change. Last season the goal would have stood, this season it seems everything has changed in Union’s favour.Union clung on in the closing stages to seal another famous victory in an unforgettable season that sees them sit a point behind Bayern Munich, and six ahead of Saturday's opponents in fifth, with 20 games played. After beating their top four rivals, they are bonafide title challengers to the record champions and face Ajax in the Europa League in midweek. A set of circumstances nobody would dare to dream up just a few months ago. But the dream has turned into a reality.",2023/02/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807644,Turks blame government negligence for quake devastation,"Apathy settles in as night falls. The noise of construction machinery ebbs, while the desperate cries of rescuers echo more sporadically from the mountains of rubble. Wrapped in blankets, the survivors stare into the distance. Four days after the powerful earthquake that devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, hope is fading that their loved ones will be found alive under the tons of concrete and bent steel that cover the streets. The only light in the darkness comes from campfires and search team beacons.It's a haunting replay of a scene that many remember from another massive earthquake in 1999. I reported on that disaster too, covering the area around the Sea of Marmara in western Turkey. More than 17,000 people died in that disaster. This time, the death toll will be even greater, having already reached 25,000 by Saturday.The images emerging from this week's recovery efforts are similar to back then. Exhausted rescue workers using pickaxes, sledgehammers or even their bare hands for lack of heavy equipment. People travelling from all parts of the country to help, carrying food, blankets and tents.Still, many desperate people are still waiting for help days after the Kahramanmaras earthquake hit on February 6. An elderly man sits on a plastic chair in front of a completely collapsed building in Antakya, on Turkey's southernmost tip. His brother had purchased one of the ""luxury apartments” in the building last year. Now he presumably lies dead under the rubble of the shoddily built ""dream home.""""We build great houses, don't we?"" the man remarks bitterly.Such complaints are similar to those that followed the last earthquake disaster nearly 24 years ago. Why doesn't the state help us more quickly? Why are new buildings collapsing like houses of cards? Has compliance with building regulations — which were tightened after 1999 — not been enforced? Why, in an earthquake-prone region such as southeastern Turkey, have property developers been allowed to build at seemingly unlimited heights? Why didn't hospitals built by the state withstand the earthquake?Such questions aren't permitted from the media, which is almost completely controlled by the government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP). But angry voices can be heard everywhere. In the city of Adiyaman, the transport minister was reportedly forced to flee amid savage insults from citizens.Hasan Aksungur, chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers in the city of Adana, where eleven buildings have also collapsed, told DW that laws are not to blame. ""The question of whether to build three or ten stories high is about large sums of money. Then a blind eye gets turned,” he says. In the epicenter of Kahramanmaras, about 70 kilometers north of Gaziantep, the only building that remained standing belongs to the local Chamber of Engineers.Another oft-repeated refrain is that this was the quake of the century, one that would have overwhelmed any country on earth. Especially given its magnitude — 7.8 on the Richter scale — and an affected area that is half the size of Germany, including several cities that are home to millions of inhabitants. But people also want to know why Turkish geologists' warnings about growing tensions along tectonic plates were not taken seriously. Leading Turkish earthquake researchers have complained that they were never consulted by a single mayor in the region.Tens of thousands of rescue workers from across Turkey and abroad are now active in Adiyaman, Antakya and Kahramanmaras — all major cities that were all but destroyed in the earthquake. More remote locations, on the other hand, are still waiting for aid.Tuncay Sahin, a student from Berlin, comes from the village of Tokar near Adiyaman. His mother was buried in the rubble of her house on the night of the earthquake. Neighbors recovered her body with their bare hands. She was just one of six who died in that village alone.His father had been out on the day of the disaster. Two days later, Sahin made it back home from Berlin. Now he mourns at his mother's grave. ”We all knew there could be earthquakes here, but for it to hit us so badly is beyond comprehension,” he says.His parents built their two-story house in the 1990s. But a new building just a year old also collapsed. ""The state should have more control over building practices and materials in the villages,"" Sahin says.A few neighbors join in. ""From now on, we'll only build one story high here!” one shouts. ""Like our ancestors.”This article originally appeared in German.",2023/02/11,,

            ENGLAND

            Manchester City can reduce the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to three points by beating Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium. Arsenal again opened the door for City by drawing with Brentford 1-1 on Saturday. City is looking to bounce back from losing at Tottenham 1-0 last week and after a week when the club was accused by the Premier League of breaching financial regulations. In the other game, third-placed Manchester United visits Leeds as the teams meet for the second time in four days. They drew 2-2 on Wednesday.











            SPAIN

            Barcelona can build on its eight-point lead of the league over Real Madrid when it visits Villarreal. Barcelona will be without midfielder Sergio Busquets and winger Ousmane Dembélé due to injuries. In their place, Xavi Hernández could play Frenkie de Jong for Busquets and either Raphinha or Ansu Fati for Dembélé. Ansu is linked to reported interest from Manchester United before the English club visits Camp Nou next week in the Europa League. Marcos Alonso made Xavi’s squad two days after his father, former Barcelona player Marcos Alonso, passed away. Villarreal will be without injured striker Gerard Moreno, its best playmaker and pure goal scorer. Atletico Madrid is at Celta Vigo needing a win to secure its hold on fourth place and the last Champions League spot. Rayo Vallecano crosses the capital to play Getafe trying to continue its great run that has it challenging for European berths. Osasuna is at Valladolid.

            GERMANY

            With relegation rivals all losing this weekend, Hertha Berlin has a chance to make ground in its bid for Bundesliga survival with a win at home over Borussia Mönchengladbach. Hertha is second from bottom after losing all four games so far in 2023, conceding 13 times and scoring once. But the club’s new sporting director Benjamin Weber is keeping his faith in coach Sandro Schwarz. “I see every day how the coaching team works with the guys,” Weber said. “We have to remain calm in every respect, but it’s absolutely clear that we have to get points.” Eintracht Frankfurt visits Cologne in the late game, when the visitor will be hoping Randal Kolo Muani adds to his four-game scoring run.

            FRANCE

            Lyon looks to rescue a disappointing season when it hosts third-placed Lens in the league. Alexandre Lacazette will lead the line for Lyon, sitting in ninth place, eight points behind the last European spot. Lacazette scored and made an assist to help Lyon knock Lille out of the French Cup on Wednesday. Fifth-placed Rennes faces a tricky test at Toulouse, which has won its last three home games in all competitions. Rennes has lost ground in the race for Champions League spots because of inconsistent results and injuries to key players. However, Lovro Majer and Christopher Wooh are back in the Rennes squad. Struggling Montpellier fired coach Romain Pitau on Tuesday and appointed Michel der Zakarian to help the club avoid relegation. Der Zakarian is returning to his old haunts as he was the Montpellier coach from 2017-21. Montpellier will hope for the new manager bounce when it hosts Brest. Der Zakarian was available because he was dismissed by Brest last October.

            ITALY

            Runaway Serie A leader Napoli will be out for revenge against Cremonese when top meets bottom. Cremonese pulled off a big upset when it won at Napoli on penalties in the Italian Cup last month. However, it hasn’t won in the league and is rock bottom, 11 points from safety. Napoli can extend its lead to 16 points with second-placed Inter Milan not playing until Monday. Napoli forward Victor Osimhen has seven goals in his past five league matches to take his tally to 16 in 17 Serie A matches. Juventus hosts fierce rival Fiorentina, which is just two points below the Bianconeri in mid-table. Udinese and Bologna will be looking to move into the European qualifying spots when they face Sassuolo and Monza respectively.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807649,Trainer Bob Baffert's Newgate off Kentucky Derby trail,"ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) — One of trainer Bob Baffert’s promising 3-year-old colts is off the Kentucky Derby trail.

            Newgate will be out of training for at least two months after being diagnosed with a minor hock issue. The hock is an area on the back of a horse’s leg involving a series of joints and bones.

            “His prognosis to return is excellent,” Tom Ryan of SF Racing, part of the colt's ownership group, posted on social media. “We look forward to seeing him back this summer.”











            Newgate won the Robert B. Lewis Stakes by a neck at Santa Anita last week. He was second in the Sham Stakes on Jan. 8.

            Newgate had been ineligible to earn any Kentucky Derby qualifying points because Baffert has been suspended for two years by Churchill Downs Inc. The penalty, which ends after this year’s Derby, stems from Medina Spirit’s medication violation after the colt won the 2021 Derby and was later disqualified. Baffert is challenging the ban in federal court.

            The setback for Newgate is also a blow to jockey Frankie Dettori, who is retiring after this year's Breeders' Cup in November. He came to Santa Anita to ride this winter to boost his chances of having a mount in the Kentucky Derby on May 6. 

            Dettori finished sixth aboard China Visit in the 2000 derby, his only time riding in the race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807653,4 charged over taped beating of teen who later took own life,"BAYVILLE, N.J. (AP) — Four students have been charged and a school district superintendent has resigned after a recorded attack against a 14-year-old New Jersey student in the hallway of her school spread on social media in the days before her family says she took her own life.

            One juvenile was charged with aggravated assault, two were charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one was charged with harassment, prosecutors in Ocean County, New Jersey, said Saturday. 

            All four juveniles and their guardians were given copies of the complaints and they were released pending future court appearances, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said in an email Saturday.











            The family of Adriana O. Kuch found her body on Feb. 3, two days after her beating beside school lockers at Central Regional High School in Bayville, her father has said.

            The Central Regional School District announced Superintendent Triantafillos Parlapanides’ resignation Saturday, but did not immediately provide any additional information.

            The district said in a statement that it “is evaluating all current and past allegations of bullying.”

            In an interview with WNBC-TV, her father, Michael Kuch, said Adriana had been hit with a 20-ounce (0.56 liter) water bottle. She received care from the school nurse after the attack left her with bruises and wounds. 

            “I do know why it happened,"" he said. ""It happened because these two haven’t liked each other for a couple years, and she had been threatening my daughter online.”

            After students at the high school participated in a walkout on Wednesday, Parlapanides wrote in a letter to parents that the protest interfered with “the learning process” and future “rallies” will need prior approval from the administration.

            “I spoke with the student protestors in front of the school on Wednesday and offered to sit down and meet with them to discuss their concerns,” said the prosecutor, Billhimer, who was at the high school again on Friday to meet with protest organizers for more than two hours.

            Billhimer said he discussed ways to improve the district’s response to school “incidents” during a meeting on Saturday with Parlapanides.

            “I also shared some suggestions regarding staff changes as well as programming and services to respond to the needs of the students,” Billhimer wrote.

            Adriana was born in Toledo, Ohio, and moved to Bayville seven years ago, according to her obituary. She was described as an animal lover and a girl who helped children with special needs.BAYVILLE, N.J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807654,Fox's Super Bowl pregame planning is a year-long effort,"PHOENIX (AP) — Even while watching last year's Super Bowl, Bill Richards was planning how this year's pregame show would look.

            Richards is the lead producer for Fox's Super Bowl pregame show for the fifth time. The five hours leading up to Sunday's showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles is analysis, entertainment and pageantry all in one huge production.

            “It’s a cloud. I don’t say that to feel negative, but it’s something that’s with you for at least a year,” Richards said earlier this week. “You're always kind of like if you get something great for Week 7, do I save that for the Super Bowl?""











            Even though Fox and Richards have had a year to prepare, the final rundown still wasn’t finalized as of Saturday afternoon.

            Most of the features — especially the final two hours — are dictated by the teams, but Richards and his crew were able to get a couple done before the matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles was set two weeks ago. 

            Besides profiles on Arizona and Phoenix, which is hosting the Super Bowl for the fourth time, there will be a feature on the 50-year anniversary of the 1972 Miami Dolphins’ perfect season. Richards said he has been happy with that profile because it has the feel of bringing viewers into the locker room.

            There will also be features that run the gamut from funny to thought-provoking.

            “I think we do sports comedy as well, if not better than anybody,"" Richards said. ""So we’ll have a little bit of that. But this is our first Super Bowl with Tom Rinaldi (who was hired from ESPN in 2020) and I’m really excited about the stuff he’s gonna bring to it and kind of grab at a different type of emotion.”

            The first three hours will be a mix of entertainment, celebrity interviews and other features before the focus turns to beginning to break down the game over the final two hours.

            “It’s quite a challenge moving those chess pieces around, making sure to get the right stuff in and at the right time,” Richards said. “You really want things to flow. The attitude of the show is going to be different than at the end. If you’re going to get there early, it’s like showing up at a party, here’s the guys you want to hang out with. And then as you get closer and start focusing in, it’s a little more X’s and O’s and less music and fun.” 

            Besides figuring out where certain features air, Richards also has to divvy up time among the cast of 13 serving as either a host or analyst.

            Host Curt Menefee said he will get to the stadium 3 1/2 hours before show starts at 1 p.m. EST. Besides doing the pregame show, Menefee and the Fox NFL Sunday team of Howie Long, Jimmy Johnson, Michael Strahan and Rob Gronkowski will be on at halftime and anchor postgame coverage.

            “People keep asking how you do a pregame on Super Bowl Sunday, it’s all about pacing because it is a long day,” Menefee said. “It does go by fast once you’re in it and the excitement builds.”

            The pregame show is not only a Fox Sports production. It includes appearances from those who have shows on Fox as well as some involvement from Fox News and Fox Business.

            There's also another reason why Super Bowl pregame shows are long — they make money. A 30-second commercial during the first couple hours of the pregame went for $100,000. That rate increases to closer to $3 million before kickoff.

            Charissa Thompson — who hosts the Fox NFL Kickoff early show on Sundays during the season — will also handle some of the early hosting duties. Sean Payton remains a part of the coverage despite being hired by the Denver Broncos a couple weeks ago. 

            “If the pregame was six or seven hours, there would still be plenty of stuff to talk about and no shortage of entertainment,” Thompson said.

            Fox Sports CEO and Executive Producer Eric Shanks has been involved in all of the network’s Super Bowl broadcasts. While he still looks back fondly on Fox’s first one in New Orleans in 1997, he has seen the network continue to grow as it airs the Super Bowl for the 10th time.

            “I don’t think will replace the first one, because it was joining the other three networks in doing a Super Bowl. But I will say that this constantly gets bigger and more refined,” he said. “I think our storytelling has grown by leaps and bounds. And, quite honestly, our ability to make it a big event now with everything that we do.

            “That first one won’t be replaced, but there’s nothing like the next one.”

Richards said he has been happy with that profile because it has the feel of bringing viewers into the locker room.There will also be features that run the gamut from funny to thought-provoking.“I think we do sports comedy as well, if not better than anybody,"" Richards said. ""So we’ll have a little bit of that. But this is our first Super Bowl with Tom Rinaldi (who was hired from ESPN in 2020) and I’m really excited about the stuff he’s gonna bring to it and kind of grab at a different type of emotion.”The first three hours will be a mix of entertainment, celebrity interviews and other features before the focus turns to beginning to break down the game over the final two hours.“It’s quite a challenge moving those chess pieces around, making sure to get the right stuff in and at the right time,” Richards said. “You really want things to flow. The attitude of the show is going to be different than at the end. If you’re going to get there early, it’s like showing up at a party, here’s the guys you want to hang out with. And then as you get closer and start focusing in, it’s a little more X’s and O’s and less music and fun.”Besides figuring out where certain features air, Richards also has to divvy up time among the cast of 13 serving as either a host or analyst.Host Curt Menefee said he will get to the stadium 3 1/2 hours before show starts at 1 p.m. EST. Besides doing the pregame show, Menefee and the Fox NFL Sunday team of Howie Long, Jimmy Johnson, Michael Strahan and Rob Gronkowski will be on at halftime and anchor postgame coverage.“People keep asking how you do a pregame on Super Bowl Sunday, it’s all about pacing because it is a long day,” Menefee said. “It does go by fast once you’re in it and the excitement builds.”The pregame show is not only a Fox Sports production. It includes appearances from those who have shows on Fox as well as some involvement from Fox News and Fox Business.There's also another reason why Super Bowl pregame shows are long — they make money. A 30-second commercial during the first couple hours of the pregame went for $100,000. That rate increases to closer to $3 million before kickoff.Charissa Thompson — who hosts the Fox NFL Kickoff early show on Sundays during the season — will also handle some of the early hosting duties. Sean Payton remains a part of the coverage despite being hired by the Denver Broncos a couple weeks ago.“If the pregame was six or seven hours, there would still be plenty of stuff to talk about and no shortage of entertainment,” Thompson said.Fox Sports CEO and Executive Producer Eric Shanks has been involved in all of the network’s Super Bowl broadcasts. While he still looks back fondly on Fox’s first one in New Orleans in 1997, he has seen the network continue to grow as it airs the Super Bowl for the 10th time.“I don’t think will replace the first one, because it was joining the other three networks in doing a Super Bowl. But I will say that this constantly gets bigger and more refined,” he said. “I think our storytelling has grown by leaps and bounds. And, quite honestly, our ability to make it a big event now with everything that we do.“That first one won’t be replaced, but there’s nothing like the next one.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/12,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807658,"Harry Styles, Beyoncé and Wet Leg win at UK's Brit Awards","LONDON (AP) — It was Harry's night at the Brit Awards.

            Harry Styles won four prizes, including album of the year, at the U.K.'s leading music awards Saturday, while female-led indie rock band Wet Leg took trophies for group of the year and best new artist.

            Beyoncé added two Brits to her crowded shelf of awards — international artist of the year and international song of the year, for “Break My Soul.”











            Styles took the album of the year trophy for “Harry’s House,” less than a week after winning the same category at the Grammy Awards. He also won for pop/R&B act, song of the year for “As It Was,” and artist of the year. 

            Accepting the best-artist trophy, the global pop heartthrob thanked “my mum for signing me up for ‘X Factor,’” the talent show that brought him to fame with boyband One Direction.

            “I am very aware of my privilege up here tonight,” said Styles, who drew criticism for saying at the Grammys that “this doesn’t happen to people like me very often.” Some saw the comment as deaf to the struggles faced by artists from diverse backgrounds.

            Styles gave shoutouts to Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama, Mabel, Florence + The Machine and Becky Hill — performers who failed to make the Brits' all-male artist of the year shortlist.

            Two years ago the Brits replaced separate male and female performer categories with gender-neutral awards in a bid to become more inclusive. But the change drew some criticism this year when the Brits announced a best-artist shortlist with no female acts.

            The move to gender-neutral prizes was among changes made in response to longstanding criticism that the Brits failed to reflect the diversity of British music. In 2017, the academy of more than 1,000 music industry professionals that chooses Brits winners was expanded in an attempt to make it more gender-balanced and diverse.

            Some musicians said more needs to be done.

            “There is a lot of diversity in artists but there is not enough diversity in record labels,” said Sawayama, a nominee for newcomer of the year.

            Founded in 1977, the Brits have evolved from a rough-around-the-edges industry event to a slick showcase for U.K. talent that has boosted the careers of future megastars including Adele.

            This year’s breakthrough acts include Wet Leg, the punky band formed by Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers on England’s rural Isle of Wight.

            “This is so scary because being on the telly can feel like a real boys’ club thing,” Teasdale said, before thanking all the women involved in making the band’s self-titled debut album.

            The Brits include four awards for different genres that are chosen by public vote. As well as Styles pop/R’n’B trophy, the prize for alternative/rock went to the 1975, Manchester rapper Aitch won the grime/hip hop category and Becky Hill was named best dance act for the second year running.

            Ireland’s Fontaines DC was named international group of the year and David Guetta was declared producer of the year.

            Styles opened the show at London’s O2 Arena performing “As It Was,” while Wet Leg delivered hit song ”Chaise Longue” on a sylvan set accompanied by whimsical folk dancers. Other performers included Lewis Capaldi, Lizzo, Stormzy, Cat Burns and Sam Smith.LONDON (AP) — It was Harry's night at the Brit Awards.Harry Styles won four prizes, including album of the year, at the U.K.'s leading music awards Saturday, while female-led indie rock band Wet Leg took trophies for group of the year and best new artist.Beyoncé added two Brits to her crowded shelf of awards — international artist of the year and international song of the year, for “Break My Soul.”Styles took the album of the year trophy for “Harry’s House,” less than a week after winning the same category at the Grammy Awards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807659,Union: Fired EMTs didn't get enough info in Nichols response,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The head of a union representing most of the Memphis Fire Department said three employees who were fired after the death of Tyre Nichols weren’t given enough information as they responded to the call for medical help.

            Thomas Malone, president of the Memphis Fire Fighters Association, also wrote in a letter to city councilmembers that information was withheld from those first responders by people on the scene. 

            Nichols, who is Black, was beaten by Memphis police after he was pulled over Jan. 7 for an alleged traffic violation. However, police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis has said publicly released footage failed to show why Nichols was stopped at all. 











            The union leader came to the defense of the fire department as a whole, saying its more-than-1,600 employees “serve this city and its citizens with purpose and intent each and every day.”

            
                The Daily Memphian reported on and published a copy of the letter, which says “there is no way any member could be truly prepared for a situation that occurred on January 7, 2023.”

            “Our members were not given adequate information upon dispatch or upon arrival of the scene,” Malone wrote. “Quite frankly, there was information withheld by those already on the scene which caused our members to handle things differently than they should have.”

            
                Three fire department employees were fired after Nichols died. In all, 13 police officers have either been disciplined or are under investigation for their roles in Nichols’ death. Six were fired, and five of them are charged with murder. Two Shelby County sheriff’s deputies were also suspended. 

            Two of the former fire department employees, EMT Robert Long and advanced EMT JaMichael Sandridge, had their professional licenses suspended by a state medical board. Lt. Michelle Whitaker was the third employee let go. Her license was not considered for suspension, though state Emergency Medical Services board members commented that more actions could follow.

            Memphis city spokeswoman Arlenia Cole told the Daily Memphian that all three former fire department employees have appealed their firings.

            Fire Chief Gina Sweat has said the department received a call from police after someone was pepper-sprayed. When the workers arrived at 8:41 p.m., Nichols was handcuffed on the ground and slumped against a squad car, the statement said.

            Long and Sandridge, based on the nature of the call and information they were told by police, “failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr. Nichols,” the statement said. Whitaker remained in the vehicle with the driver during the response to Nichols’ beating, the department said.

            An ambulance was called, and it arrived at 8:55 p.m., the statement said. An emergency unit cared for Nichols and left for a hospital with him at 9:08 p.m., which was 27 minutes after Long, Sandridge and Whitaker arrived, officials said. Nichols died three days later.

            An investigation determined that all three violated multiple policies and protocols, the statement said.

            “They were reacting to what they saw, what they were told at the scene,” Sweat recently told city council members. “Obviously, they did not perform at the level that we expect, or that the citizens of Memphis deserve.”

            Before suspending the licenses of Long and Sandridge earlier this month, the state EMS board watched 19 minutes of surveillance video that showed the two first responders as they failed to care for Nichols, who couldn’t stay seated upright against the side of the vehicle, laying prone on the ground multiple times.

            EMS board member Sullivan Smith said it was “obvious to even a lay person” that Nichols “was in terrible distress and needed help.”MEMPHIS, Tenn.

(AP) — Kaylynne Truong scored 20 points to lead No. 23 Gonzaga to a 63-53 win over Portland to snap a first-place with the Pilots on a Saturday when the Bulldogs retired the jersey of Courtney Vandersloot.

            Truong, who went over 1,000 points for her career, made 4 of 8 3-point tries including one with four minutes left to give the Bulldogs (23-3, 13-1 West Coast Conference) an 11-point lead that Truong stretched to 13 with a pair of free throws.

            Brynna Maxwell kept her streak alive of making a 3-pointer in every game this season with two makes and 13 points. Yvonne Ejim and McKayla Williams added 11 points each. Gonzaga finished 7 of 21 from the arc, 6 of 13 in the second half.











            Alex Fowler and Maisie Burnham scored 13 points each for the Pilots (18-7, 12-2), who had a six-game win streak snapped.

            After a ragged first half that ended with Portland leading 19-18, Gonzaga outscored the Pilots 27-15 in the third quarter with a stretch that included seven straight makes. 

            Neither team reached 34% shooting in the first half when the teams combined to go 2 of 17 from the arc.

            Portland's only two WCC losses have come against Gonzaga, which has won six straight over the Pilots.

            Gonzaga is host to Pacific and Portland is home against Saint Mary’s, both games on Thursday.

            VANDERSLOOT HONORED Vandersloot was present with a sellout crowd at 6,000-seat McCarthey Athletic Center when her No. 21 jersey was retired before the game, the first Gonzaga women's player to be so honored.

            The point guard, who earned a number of All-American honors including a second-team pick on The Associated Press team, was a three-time player of the year in the WCC and set the NCAA single-season assists record with 367 as a senior when she led Gonzaga to the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. 

            She was the first Division I player, female or male, to reach career totals of both 2,000 points and 1,000 assists.

            Vandersloot recently signed a free-agent contract with the New York Liberty after having spent her entire WNBA career with the Chicago Sky, who drafted her with the third overall pick in 2011. She helped lead the Sky to their only championship in 2021.

            The design duo behind Proenza Schouler, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, took fashion show attendees on a showcase of their reality and the spirit of the everyday woman at the Chelsea Factory for New York Fashion Week. Named after their mother’s maiden names, the two designers honored the women in their lives both new and old with their latest collection. It was the growth of the wardrobe of the sophisticated intellectual woman they have been designing for over 20 years, they said. As they have grown, she has grown as well.

            “It was totally a reflection of the women in our lives,” McCollough said after the show. “It was the first season where we made the mood board just out of headshots of the women in our lives.”











            Models could have easily walked off the runway and onto the New York streets in their effortlessly cool looks. Hernandez said he wanted a break from “Instagram clothes” or the flashy dressing often seen across social media.

            Models entered the runway with barely there makeup looks from behind a transparent film background as the words of author Ottessa Moshfegh were narrated by Sevigny over the speakers with the musical composition by Arca.

            “It’s the beginning of something new for us,” Hernandez said.

            The layout of the show gave attendees an intimate close up look at the details of the clothes like the glittery over the knee boots and pops of color that peeked out from cutouts around the models' legs giving them freedom to move. Models snaked around the runway in carefully constructed blazers cinched at the waist with bolo tie-like belts, knitted sweaters paired with leather skirts and PVC pants to the velvet dresses dyed with ice. 

            The designers conceptualized a woman’s “external shell” and how it would look and feel on the Proenza Schouler woman. In one such dress, Hernandez and McCollough had molded a metal fabric dress to the model’s body. 

            TikTok stars, fashion influencers and even Ella Emhoff, the step-daughter of Vice President Kamala Harris, were in attendance. 

            Sienna Miller, Meghann Fahy of “White Lotus” fame and Natasha Lyonne stopped backstage to congratulate the designers after the show. But McCollough and Hernandez could not hide their excitement at the news that Marc Jacobs was in attendance. The pair had idolized Jacobs as fledgling designers and McCollough had previously interned for the designer.NEW YORK (AP) — Known for notoriously dressing the It Girl, it came as no surprise when actor and fashion muse Chloë Sevigny opened the show for Proenza Schouler Saturday to a room packed with her celeb peers.The design duo behind Proenza Schouler, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, took fashion show attendees on a showcase of their reality and the spirit of the everyday woman at the Chelsea Factory for New York Fashion Week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807677,ACC admits blown call cost Duke in OT loss at No. 8 Virginia,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Virginia coach Tony Bennett said he didn't know what happened on the final play of regulation in the eighth-ranked Cavaliers' 69-62 overtime victory against Duke.

            Blue Devils coach Jon Scheyer didn't, either — and he was left fuming.

            “I still would like an explanation exactly,” Scheyer said after the game. “I don’t have clarity on that.”











            Duke (17-8, 8-6 Atlantic Coast Conference) appeared poised to win when Kyle Filipowski drove to the basket on the final play of regulation Saturday and two defenders contested his shot. Officials initially whistled a foul, drawing thunderous disapproval from fans, but waved it off after a lengthy review — a decision the ACC later said was incorrect.

            On the play, which started with 1.2 seconds left, Filipowski drove from the left side and officials called a foul. Replays showed Reece Beekman appeared to get a clean block on the shot but also made enough body contact to knock Filipowski to the floor.

            “He made a big-time play attacking the basket, and there’s no doubt he’s knocking down those free throws in my mind,” Scheyer said.

            “They told me after the fact that the call was made after the buzzer and you can see the ball left his hands before point zero,” Scheyer said of the officials. “So I don’t know exactly what the rule is.”

            The league issued a statement hours later, saying officials applied rules incorrectly and that Filipowski should have been sent to the line for two free throws. 

            According to the league, officials had determined after a review that a foul by Virginia’s Ryan Dunn had been committed after time expired. But the NCAA rule book states that the ball being in flight made it a live play with players in those situations being considered “an airborne shooter,” which should have led to free throws, according to the statement.

            Instead, it was Armaan Franklin making the big shot, a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left in overtime to finish a 23-point performance. Franklin said he was initially out of position for the play, but adjusted and point guard Kihei Clark found him.

            “I saw them kind of like mashed up on the side with Kihei on the wing, and I just ran to the corner. His man didn't switch off. I just had an open corner look and I shoot a million of those a day,” he said.

            Clark added 16 points and five assists and Ben Vander Plas scored 13 for the Cavaliers (19-4, 11-3), who won despite a 9-for-22 performance from the free throw line. Vander Plas also was credited with drawing 11 of the 24 fouls whistled against Duke.

            Jeremy Roach led the Blue Devils with 16 points and Tyrese Proctor had 14. Filipowski, who averages 15.5 points, was scoreless.

            Trailing 58-53, Duke got a driving basket from Roach with 1:31 left and a 3-pointer by Jacob Grandison from in front of the Blue Devils' bench to tie it with 50 seconds left. Neither team scored again in regulation.

            Vander Plas drew a huge ovation when he made a pair of free throws to open the overtime scoring. At that point, Virginia had missed nine of 12 from the line. Clark's driving basket and another free throw gave the Cavaliers a 63-58 lead, and two baskets by Proctor were all the Blue Devils managed in the extra period.

            Duke, now 2-6 in league road games, became the 39th consecutive ACC opponent to fail to reach 70 points at John Paul Jones Arena.

            The Cavaliers used an 8-0 run to lead 54-51 with just under five minutes to play. Ryan Young hit a pair of free throws to pull Duke within a point, but after Virginia failed to score, the Blue Devils committed their third shot clock violation of the game with 3:29 left.

            Virginia used a 14-5 run spanning the halves to take a 35-30 lead, but Duke responded with a 19-9 run that featured eight points by Dariq Whitehead, who had missed the past four games with an ankle injury.

(AP) — Virginia coach Tony Bennett said he didn't know what happened on the final play of regulation in the eighth-ranked Cavaliers' 69-62 overtime victory against Duke.Blue Devils coach Jon Scheyer didn't, either — and he was left fuming.“I still would like an explanation exactly,” Scheyer said after the game. “I don’t have clarity on that.”Duke (17-8, 8-6 Atlantic Coast Conference) appeared poised to win when Kyle Filipowski drove to the basket on the final play of regulation Saturday and two defenders contested his shot. Officials initially whistled a foul, drawing thunderous disapproval from fans, but waved it off after a lengthy review — a decision the ACC later said was incorrect.On the play, which started with 1.2 seconds left, Filipowski drove from the left side and officials called a foul. Replays showed Reece Beekman appeared to get a clean block on the shot but also made enough body contact to knock Filipowski to the floor.“He made a big-time play attacking the basket, and there’s no doubt he’s knocking down those free throws in my mind,” Scheyer said.“They told me after the fact that the call was made after the buzzer and you can see the ball left his hands before point zero,” Scheyer said of the officials. “So I don’t know exactly what the rule is.”The league issued a statement hours later, saying officials applied rules incorrectly and that Filipowski should have been sent to the line for two free throws.According to the league, officials had determined after a review that a foul by Virginia’s Ryan Dunn had been committed after time expired. But the NCAA rule book states that the ball being in flight made it a live play with players in those situations being considered “an airborne shooter,” which should have led to free throws, according to the statement.Instead, it was Armaan Franklin making the big shot, a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left in overtime to finish a 23-point performance. Franklin said he was initially out of position for the play, but adjusted and point guard Kihei Clark found him.“I saw them kind of like mashed up on the side with Kihei on the wing, and I just ran to the corner. His man didn't switch off. I just had an open corner look and I shoot a million of those a day,” he said.Clark added 16 points and five assists and Ben Vander Plas scored 13 for the Cavaliers (19-4, 11-3), who won despite a 9-for-22 performance from the free throw line. Vander Plas also was credited with drawing 11 of the 24 fouls whistled against Duke.Jeremy Roach led the Blue Devils with 16 points and Tyrese Proctor had 14. Filipowski, who averages 15.5 points, was scoreless.Trailing 58-53, Duke got a driving basket from Roach with 1:31 left and a 3-pointer by Jacob Grandison from in front of the Blue Devils' bench to tie it with 50 seconds left. Neither team scored again in regulation.Vander Plas drew a huge ovation when he made a pair of free throws to open the overtime scoring. At that point, Virginia had missed nine of 12 from the line. Clark's driving basket and another free throw gave the Cavaliers a 63-58 lead, and two baskets by Proctor were all the Blue Devils managed in the extra period.Duke, now 2-6 in league road games, became the 39th consecutive ACC opponent to fail to reach 70 points at John Paul Jones Arena.The Cavaliers used an 8-0 run to lead 54-51 with just under five minutes to play. Ryan Young hit a pair of free throws to pull Duke within a point, but after Virginia failed to score, the Blue Devils committed their third shot clock violation of the game with 3:29 left.Virginia used a 14-5 run spanning the halves to take a 35-30 lead, but Duke responded with a 19-9 run that featured eight points by Dariq Whitehead, who had missed the past four games with an ankle injury.BIG PICTUREDuke: Roach scored 12 consecutive points for the Blue Devils after Dereck Lively opened their scoring with a pair of free throws.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807679,"Seiko makes 6 3-pointers, No. 25 SDSU beats UNLV 82-71","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Adam Seiko scored all 18 points on 3-pointers and Matt Bradley added 17 points for No. 25 San Diego, the Mountain West Conference front-runner that beat UNLV 82-71 Saturday for its third straight win and seventh in eight games. 

            The Aztecs (20-5, 11-2 MWC) buried the Runnin' Rebels in a blizzard of 3-pointers and slam dunks, including during a 14-0 run midway through the first half, to sweep the season series and top UNLV the fifth straight time. Keshad Johnson scored 11 of his 14 points in the game's first 6 1/2 minutes and Nathan Mensah had 11 points and 11 rebounds.

            “The ceiling's pretty high. Everybody knows we're the deepest team in this conference,” Bradley said. “When we get production from everybody, that's a first-place team you're looking at. I'm just happy for our guys and everybody that stepped up today, for sure.”











            SDSU has won 20 games in all six seasons under coach Brian Dutcher and for the 18th time since his predecessor and former boss, Steve Fisher, took over what had been a floundering program in 1999-2000.

            Elijah Harkless scored 24 for UNLV (16-9, 5-8) before fouling out with 2:05 to go. Keshon Gilbert added 19 for the Runnin' Rebels, who didn't get their first assist until two minutes into the second half.

            SDSU led by 23 points with 7:45 to play before the Rebels cut the gap. The Aztecs made 12 of 28 3-pointers overall and 7 of 19 in the first 20 minutes, when they dominated from the opening tip and led 43-23 at halftime.

            SDSU opened the game with alley-oop slam dunks by Mensah and Johnson, with Lamont Butler assisting on both, and then began raining 3s on the Runnin' Rebels. 

            Seiko and Micah Parrish opened the 14-0 run with 3-pointers before the Aztecs showed a strong inside game with three straight slam dunks by Butler, Mensah — who converted a 3-point play — and Bradley to take a 30-11 lead. Butler grabbed a loose ball and swooped in for his dunk and Bradley had a steal to set up his dunk. 

            “That was big,” Bradley said. “Three dunks in a row, steals, the gym was hyped, it was a really nice moment. We could have done a better job keeping our foot down and just keep going, but that moment was really special for sure.""

            Johnson's early points included a 3-pointer and a steal, after which he went coast-to-coast for a layup. Seiko had three 3-pointers in each half.

            The Aztecs had 21 turnovers, including 13 in the second half.

            “We're playing good basketball, obviously. But the key is playing 40 minutes,” Dutcher said. ""That’s what great teams do. So we’re very good. … We’re playing to a high standard. But the level of the climb is to do it for longer periods of time. We’ve proven we can do it but can we do it for a longer period of time.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807681,"Caps edge Bruins, 2-1, despite Ovechkin being held scoreless","BOSTON (AP) — Nicklas Backstrom and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and the Washington Capitals beat NHL-best Boston 2-1 on Saturday, sending the Bruins to just their second regulation loss at home this season. 

            The Bruins are 22-2-3 at home. Their other regulation loss at TD Garden came on Jan. 12, a 3-0 setback against Seattle. 

            Darcy Kuemper made 27 saves for the Capitals, who have won three of their last four games.











            “It's definitely ‘go-time’ for us. You could see that in our play,” Kuemper said. “It would have been disappointing to come into this building and not put in the effort we did. ... We played unbelievable. That's probably the hardest building to win in this year.”

            Nick Foligno scored for Boston and backup goalie Jeremy Swayman stopped 21 shots.

            “We had our chances,” Foligno said of Boston's late surge. “We were just too cute.”

            Washington star Alex Ovechkin was held without a point for a season-high matching third straight game, only the second time this season that’s happened. 

            With both teams coming off long layoffs between games (Washington 11 days and Boston 10) the Capitals had the better scoring chances in a sloppy first period that saw a handful of breakdowns, mostly by the Bruins, in their own defensive zone.

            “I really liked the start,” Washington coach Peter Laviolette said. “Coming off the break and not knowing what you're going to get, I thought we played a smart period. I thought we defended well.”

            Playing just his 11th game after recovering from offseason hip surgery, the 35-year-old Backstrom made it 1-0 when he collected a loose puck that Swayman couldn’t cover and flipped it into the net during a 5-on-3 power-play advantage 6:28 into the game.

            Swayman stopped a couple of close, high-percentage scoring chances over the next few minutes before Kuemper flashed his right pad to make a stop on David Krejci’s wrister on a break-in late in the period. 

            “The first period was our best,” Backstrom said. “We talked about it before (the game). We have to be good against these guys defensively. They're so powerful, they have a lot of good players, skilled players.”

            Midway into the second period, Kuemper robbed Brad Marchand’s close bid. Hathaway then came down the slot after collecting an errant clearing attempt at the blue line and beat Swayman with a wrister over the left shoulder before he was knocked to the ice by defenseman Connor Clifton. Hathaway pointed to the ceiling while he was laying on his back after the goal.

            Foligno retrieved a loose puck at the side of the net, flipping it past Kuemper, slicing Boston’s deficit in half late in the second.

            “I didn't think we had a bad game,” Marchand said. “We missed a couple of opportunities that if we capitalize it's a different game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4807697,"Russian spacecraft leaks coolant, station crew reported safe","MOSCOW (AP) — An uncrewed Russian supply ship docked at the International Space Station has leaked coolant, the Russian space corporation and NASA reported Saturday, saying the incident doesn’t pose any danger to the station’s crew.Roscosmos said the hatch between the station and the Progress MS-21 had been locked so the incident didn’t affect the orbiting outpost.“The temperature and pressure on board the station are within norms and there is no danger to health and safety of the crew,” it said in a statement.The initial statement from Roscosmos left it unclear whether the entire cargo ship or just some of its systems lost pressure, but Sergei Krikalev, head of Roscosmos’ crewed programs, later clarified that there was depressurization of the craft’s coolant loop.NASA said its specialists are assisting their Russian counterparts in the troubleshooting of the coolant leak.“Officials are monitoring all International Space Station systems and are not tracking any other issues,” NASA said. “The crew, which was informed of the cooling loop leak, is in no danger and continuing with normal space station operations.”The depressurization of the cargo craft’s coolant loop follows a similar incident in December with the Soyuz crew capsule, which Russian space officials said had been caused by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space.Roscosmos has launched a probe into a possible cause of the cooling loop leak, and Krikalev said that experts will closely look at materials and technologies used in spacecraft manufacturing as part of the probe.“We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that it wouldn't affect similar components that will be used in the future,” Krikalev said. “This is the most important task.”Roscosmos noted that before the leak the cargo ship had already been loaded with waste prior to its scheduled disposal. The craft is set to be undocked from the station and deorbit to burn in the atmosphere on Feb. 18.The announcement came shortly after a new Russian cargo ship docked smoothly at the station on Saturday. The Progress MS-22 delivered almost three tons of food, water and fuel along with scientific equipment for the crew.Roscosmos said that the incident didn’t affect the docking of the new cargo ship and “will have no impact on the future station program.”Russian Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to use the Soyuz crew capsule to return to Earth in March, but Russian space officials decided that higher temperatures resulting from the coolant leak could make it dangerous to use.They decided to launch a new Soyuz capsule on Feb. 20 so the crew have a lifeboat in the event of an emergency. But since it will travel in automatic mode to expedite the launch, a replacement crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall when another capsule is ready. It means that Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay several extra months at the station, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year.NASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.Besides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina; and Japan’s Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October.",2023/02/12,112,World
