https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810703,Sole executive power to enter conflict risks illegal Australia-China war over Taiwan: Expert,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Australian government executive branch's sole authority to declare war risks Australia getting drawn into a war with China over Taiwan without clear legal justification.That is according to Australian international law expert Ben Saul, a professor at the University of Sydney. Currently, the Australian executive can enter into armed conflicts without input from parliament, creating conditions that challenge United Nations conventions stating countries must justify going to war before the U.N. Security Council, according to Saul.“As we’ve seen with really controversial wars, like Iraq in 2003, the public is deeply concerned about the use of military force in situations that could be illegal under international law,” he told Australian magazine Crikey. He said that if the government were required to justify a decision to go to war, this would satisfy U.N. requirements under international law.“There’s lots of talk about potentially defending Taiwan, but neither Australia nor the U.S. has ever explained what would be the legal basis for doing so,” Saul said. He also said that both Australia and the U.S. say that Taiwan is not a state, and that under international law it cannot draw on the right of self-defense and collective self-defense.“So you would want to know Australia is on very solid legal grounds if it is to make a decision to go to war in a case like Taiwan,” Saul said.Saul made the comments as Australia conducts a parliamentary enquiry into its executive’s powers to unilaterally declare war. The Australian executive is made up of the prime minister and about 19 ministers, and its decisions are made behind closed doors.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong speaks about AUKUS in June 2022. (AP photo)The leader of a campaign to reform war powers and former diplomat Dr. Alison Broinowski said that America was not beyond “contriving circumstances” to justify going to war, referencing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which the U.N. said was illegal in 2004.Broinowski said that if Australia were to join the U.S. in a war against China to defend Taiwan, it would be breaking its commitment to an international rules-based order, and that requiring parliamentary oversight would increase protection against this happening.Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has been accused of prejudicing the outcome of a parliamentary enquiry into war powers reform after she said that she believes it is important for the security of Australia that the issue “remains a power and prerogative of the executive.”It is not clear if Australia would defend Taiwan militarily if China invaded, though the government did increase its security presence in East Asia last year through a security cooperation agreement with Japan in 2022, and by joining AUKUS in 2021.",2023/2/15,1512,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810720,Bucks edge Celtics 131-125 in OT for 11th straight win,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Jrue Holiday demonstrated just why he’s heading to the All-Star Game for the first time in a decade.

            Holiday matched a career high with 40 points and made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 25.2 seconds left in overtime as the Milwaukee Bucks edged the short-handed Boston Celtics 131-125 on Tuesday for their 11th consecutive victory. 

            The 32-year-old Holiday shot 8 of 12 from beyond the arc — including one from behind midcourt that beat the third-quarter buzzer — to set a career high for 3-pointers.











            “I don't really, I guess, care for how I'm playing as long as we're winning,” said Holiday, who also had seven assists. “For me, as long as we get the win, I'm OK. The only stat I look at is turnovers. That's kind of how I determine if I had a good or bad game. Tonight, what did I have, five turnovers? To me, that hurts my soul.""

            Holiday will join Bucks teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo at Sunday's All-Star Game at Salt Lake City. It's the first time Holiday has been selected since he was playing for Philadelphia in 2013, which marks the longest gap between All-Star appearances in league history.

            “I've said since the season started that he's an All-Star,” Antetokounmpo said. 

            Antetokounmpo added 36 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists as the Bucks (40-17) moved within a half-game of the Celtics (41-17) in the Eastern Conference standings.

            Boston was playing without both its All-Stars – Jayson Tatum (non-COVID illness) and Jaylen Brown (facial fracture) – as well as Marcus Smart (sprained right ankle) and Al Horford (swelling in right knee).

            The Celtics still nearly earned their fifth straight win.

            “We expected to win that game,” said Malcolm Brogdon, who scored 26 points. ""We went into that game like we were going to win, like we were supposed to win. We believe we are the best team on the floor every single night.”

            Boston's Sam Hauser, a Wisconsin native who had 40 friends and family members in the stands, made a game-tying 3-pointer with three seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Boston's Derrick White then scored the first five points of overtime.

            The Celtics still had a five-point lead with two minutes left, but the Bucks scored the final seven points of the game. The game-ending spurt started with Holiday's go-ahead 3-pointer.

            “On both ends of the court, he was phenomenal,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I think his ability to create some turnovers and create pressure helped flip it. We went down and he made a few big-time plays that just are very Jrue-like. Special performance by him.”

            Grant Williams lost the ball on Boston's next possession, Grayson Allen got the steal and a clear-path foul was called on the Celtics with 3.2 seconds left.

            Antetokounmpo made the ensuing two free throws and capped the scoring with a dunk at the buzzer.

            SCARY MOMENT

            Antetokounmpo landed awkwardly after an unsuccessful drive to the basket late in the fourth quarter and lay on the floor for a while before walking slowly back to the bench, but he never actually left the game.

            “They gave me a quick update just saying that they think he just banged knees with somebody,” Budenholzer said. “We'll check him in the morning, but I'd say the initial kind of report was positive.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810722,"Bitter cold, snow blast Southwest; Arizona highways closed","FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Bitter cold, rain and snow blew across much of the Southwest U.S. on Tuesday, closing stretches of interstate and state highways in northern Arizona where as much as a foot (30 centimeters) of snow was possible and even colder weather on the way.

            A winter storm warning remains in effect into Wednesday evening for much of northern Arizona and New Mexico, the National Weather Service said.

            A 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of northbound Interstate 17 from Lake Montezuma north to Flagstaff was closed Tuesday evening. A short stretch of I-40 near Winslow also was shut down as the powerful cold front continued to move east. 











            It’s likely to produce snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) per hour in parts of northern Arizona including Flagstaff, the weather service said late Tuesday.

            “The combination of heavy snow and blowing snow will reduce visibility on area roadways, leading to dangerous driving conditions,” the weather service in Flagstaff warned.

            Overnight lows below zero Fahrenheit (below -17 Celsius) were forecast in the Sierra along the California-Nevada line, with single digits in parts of Arizona, the National Weather Service said late Tuesday.

            “Winter storm impacts will focus across northeast New Mexico Wednesday afternoon and evening before the system exits Wednesday night, with near blizzard conditions possible,” the weather service in Albuquerque said late Tuesday.

            The service in Reno warned “it will be downright dangerous in exposed areas of the high Sierra” early Wednesday with wind chills of -20 to -30 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 to -34 Celsius).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810723,"Stutzle, Mandolese lead Senators past Isles in shootout, 3-2","NEW YORK (AP) — Tim Stutzle and Drake Batherson each scored in the shootout and the Ottawa Senators defeated the New York Islanders 3-2.

            Stutzle and Brady Tkachuk each recorded a goal and an assist in regulation. Kevin Mandolese finished with 46 saves and the Senators won their sixth game in seven outings.

            Mandolese denied Bo Horvat's and Kyle Palmieri’s attempts and collected his first career win in his NHL debut.











            “Right from the start we grinded and just stuck to our game the whole game,” Tkachuk said. “No matter what the situation is, if we play our game we are a tough game to maintain.”

            Ryan Pulock and Brock Nelson scored for New York. Ilya Sorokin made 32 saves and the New York Islanders fell for the third consecutive game.

            The Islanders squandered a power-play opportunity in overtime when the Senators were called for too many men on the ice.

            “You got to try and be creative,” Noah Dobson said of the four-on-three power play in overtime. “You can’t just be stagnant, it’s easy for the killers and the goalie. We tried to move around and it obviously didn’t work tonight.”

            Nelson fired a one-timer from the face-off circle to the goaltender’s left to knot the game 2-2 at 7:13 of the third period. Dobson and Mathew Barzal assisted on the game-tying power-play goal. Nelson extended his point streak to a career-high 11 games.

            Tkachuk broke a 1-1 tie with a power-play goal at 3:41 of the third period. Stutzle delivered a pass to the Senators captain near the top of the crease for the easy redirection past Sorokin. 

            Stutzle notched his 24th of the season and evened the game at 1-1. The 21-year-old German forward fired a wrist shot that deflected off Pulock’s stick and past Sorokin at 17:32 of the second period. The Senators took advantage of a neutral-zone turnover by Islanders defenseman Adam Pelech.

            “I think we dominated the first period and then they were a little bit faster than us,” Stutzle said. “As soon as we started playing fast again, I think we dominated the game.”

            Pulock gave the Islanders a 1-0 edge and opened the scoring when his shot whizzed past the blocker of Mandolese. Matt Martin fought off a check from Dylan Gambrell as he entered the offensive zone and set up Pulock for his third of the season.

            “It’s disheartening when you put in an effort and can’t break through and put up enough numbers on the scoreboard,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “At the same time, I thought there were some good things done tonight. We just have to move forward and get ready for the next game.”

            Sorokin protected the Islanders’ one-goal advantage until Stutzle’s equalizer with two impressive stops on Tkachuk during an Ottawa power-play midway through the second period.

            Islanders forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau did not dress and is day to day with an upper-body injury.

            LINEUP NOTES

            Mandolese made his NHL debut. Ottawa’s starting goalie Anton Forsberg tore his MCL in both knees against the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday and was carried off the ice on a stretcher. … Long Island native Shane Pinto played his first NHL game against the Islanders. The Senators selected Pinto in the second round of the 2019 NHL Draft after the 22-year-old played for two seasons at the University of North Dakota. … Islanders center Otto Koivula was recalled from the American Hockey League and made his season debut.

Matt Martin fought off a check from Dylan Gambrell as he entered the offensive zone and set up Pulock for his third of the season.“It’s disheartening when you put in an effort and can’t break through and put up enough numbers on the scoreboard,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “At the same time, I thought there were some good things done tonight. We just have to move forward and get ready for the next game.”Sorokin protected the Islanders’ one-goal advantage until Stutzle’s equalizer with two impressive stops on Tkachuk during an Ottawa power-play midway through the second period.Islanders forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau did not dress and is day to day with an upper-body injury.LINEUP NOTESMandolese made his NHL debut.

            Ryan O’Reilly, Jordan Kyrou, Ivan Barbashev and Nick Leddy also scored for the Blues, who won their second in a row following a five-game losing streak.

            Carter Verhaeghe and Eetu Luostarinen scored for Florida, which had won four of five.











            The Blues scored first when Schenn deflected a shot by Torey Krug that bounced off the back wall and kicked off the skate of goalie Spencer Knight.

            “You need some goals like that every once in a while,” Schenn said. “Not pretty by any means, but I'll take it.”

            Schenn converted on a wrist shot from inside the circle 25 seconds into the second period to make it 2-0.

            “We're just kind of playing for one another right now, playing hard,” Schenn said. “We go game by game now, trying to grab two points each night.”

            O’Reilly and Kyrou scored 20 seconds apart in the third period to push the lead to 5-1. Kyrou leads the team with 24 goals.

            Barbashev, the subject of trade speculation, also had two assists. 

            Binnington stopped 17 of 18 shots in the third and improved to 20-18-3 with his second successive win.

            “I thought we got contributions from a lot of guys,” St. Louis coach Craig Berube said. “We played a pretty solid game from the goaltender on out.”

            The Blues have scored six goals in each of their last two games since trading longtime sniper Vladimir Tarasenko and defenseman Niko Mikkola to the New York Rangers.

            “The past two games after the break, obviously, we're playing good hockey,” Schenn said.

            Knight made 22 saves for Florida, which fell to 11-6-2 since Jan. 3. The Panthers were coming off a 2-1 win over Minnesota on Monday.

            The Panthers came in averaging an NHL-best 36.1 shots per game.

            St. Louis has killed off the last 13 penalties against Florida.

            “We weren't at our best tonight,” Verhaeghe said. “It was a little frustrating.”

            BANGED UP

            The Blues lost Krug and winger Brandon Saad to upper-body injuries during the game. Krug played 7:58, and Saad 9:32.

            MILESTONE

            Leddy played in his 900th career game, becoming the 528th player in NHL history to reach that plateau. The defenseman's first game came with Chicago at Colorado on Oct. 7, 2010.

            “For me it was a special night,” Leddy said. “Just trying to create some offense when I can.”

            PANTHERS HONOR VICTIMS

            Panthers players wore T-shirts into the arena honoring victims of the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on the fifth anniversary of the tragedy. The shirts had the names of the 17 people who were killed. Many players have formed relationships with the families of those victims.

            “Anything we can do to support a cause like that is real good. We're a family here in South Florida,” Verhaeghe said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810726,CPA Australia: Hong Kong Budget - Bold steps needed for economic boost,"100 per cent increase in tobacco duty, consider a tax on non-recyclable plastic products   Offer a two-tiered e-consumption vouchers with a target disbursement period in the first half of 2023, with HK$2,000 as the base amount for all eligible Hong Kong residents, and an additional HK$6,000 for underprivileged groups (in total HK$8,000)   Maintain the HK$10,000 tax rebate on salaries tax and increase tax allowances    HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 15 February 2023 - One of the largest professional accounting bodies globally, CPA Australia, has released its recommendations for Budget 2023-24 to revitalise the economy and create a better future. With an estimated HK$126 billion fiscal deficit for the financial year 2022-23 and HK$820 billion of remaining fiscal reserves, CPA Australia believes Hong Kong needs bold action to attract talent, improve the environment and boost the economy.            ""Hong Kong's economy is expected to rebound this year along with the resumption of cross-border travel and easing of COVID-19 restrictions,"" Anthony Lau, Co-Chairperson of CPA Australia's Taxation Committee – Greater China said.   ""However, volatility, uncertainty and inflation pressures weigh on the recovery. We want the government to re-establish Hong Kong on the world stage, while improving public finances.""   Building sustainable public finances, promoting a green society   ""Following three years of the pandemic, building a healthy and liveable society for Hong Kong residents is a priority. We want measures that create a better living environment,"" Mr Lau said.   CPA Australia wants the tobacco duty increased to reduce smoking rates and alleviate the burden on public healthcare system. A 100 per cent increase in tobacco duty will generate around HK$8 billion in additional revenue in 2023-24. Further, the government should consider a tax on non-recyclable plastic products to reduce plastic consumption and waste.     ""Hong Kong's simple and low tax system is important to attracting companies and investment. We want the government to work with Mainland authorities to enhance the Hong Kong-Mainland of China Double Tax Arrangement (DTA) and help distinguish Hong Kong from regional competitors. This could include reducing the dividend withholding tax rate.""   ""We want the capital investment entrant scheme reintroduced and eligibility expanded to Chinese nationals. Alternatively, the government could introduce an immigration program that provides residency status to investors making investment in strategic industries.""   Encouraging SME transformation   Mr Janssen Chan, Co-Chairperson of CPA Australia's Taxation Committee – Greater China said e-consumption vouchers have helped many SMEs digitally transform in the past two years.   ""To build on that momentum, we suggest the government relaunch and increase funding to the Distance Business Program to help more businesses digitalise and expand their online presence.   ""Though we need to start moving away from an expansionary approach in the budget, a modified version of the e-consumption voucher scheme could be considered for Hong Kong residents, with a focus on supporting lower-income earners, if the government considers the economic conditions require it.   ""Government measures over the past two years have helped many SMEs stay afloat but uncertainty continues. We want measures like the Special 100 per cent SME Financing Guarantee Loan Scheme and the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme extended by one year.""   ""To address the manpower shortage issue, the government can assist is to improve the chances of younger generations being able to buy a home in Hong Kong by helping with a down payment.   ""Given SMEs are particularly struggling to attract and retain talent, the government may consider offering an additional tax deduction on salaries expenditure for companies hiring employees aged 60 or over, which is another pool of top talent.""      Reducing cost of living pressures, improving living standards, attracting talent    Theresa Chan, Deputy Chairperson of CPA Australia's Taxation Committee – Greater China said Hong Kong residents were facing higher costs, particularly hurting low-income earners.   ""To help ease cost pressures we want the HK$10,000 tax rebate on salaries tax maintained. Personal allowance, child allowance and married person's allowances should be increased. The government should also consider increasing the salaries tax allowances at least in line with inflation.""   We also recommend an energy bills subsidy to assist with rising prices.   ""To prepare for an ageing tsunami and to alleviate the burden on the public health system, we suggest increasing the cap on tax deductions for voluntary contributions to the MPF scheme to HK$100,000 and the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) to HK$12,000 respectively. For taxpayers who are not policyholders of the VHIS, we suggest introducing a tax deduction on unreimbursed medical and health check expenses from private healthcare providers up to HK$12,000.""   ""To attract talent to work and stay in Hong Kong, we suggest enhancing the Top Talent Pass Scheme by reducing the salaries tax rate for successful applicants by 50 per cent for the first two tax years, subject to a cap of HK$1.2 million of income.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810759,"Scheifele, Dubois score in shootout, Jets beat Kraken 3-2","WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Mark Scheifele and Pierre-Luc Dubois scored in the shootout to give the Winnipeg Jets a 3-2 come-from-behind victory over the Seattle Kraken on Tuesday night.

            The Jets were the only NHL team that hadn’t played in the shot contest. They’re now 8-1 past regulation.

            “I had a penalty shot at one point (this season) so I wasn’t as rusty,” Dubois said. “I don’t remember the last time I was in a shootout. But a win’s a win. We’re all happy in here and getting ready for a big road trip.”











            Blake Wheeler and Dubois scored for the Jets, who have won three in a row. David Rittich made 27 saves. 

            Scheifele and Wheeler rushed the net during overtime, but Wheeler’s shot missed.

            John Hayden and Jared McCann scored for the Kraken, who ended a five-game road trip going 1-3-1. Philipp Grubauer stopped 38 shots.

            “Tonight is a hard-fought road game for us,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “That’s a good team, a lot of respect for the ability and the way they play.

            “Disappointed not to get two (points), but that’s a real important road point for us.”

            Dubois had tied the game 2-2 at 9:39 of the third period when his shot went off Seattle defenseman Vince Dunn at the front of the net.

            There was no scoring in the first period, but the Kraken had the best opportunity with their second power play of the period. They went on a four-minute man advantage after Jets forward Morgan Barron received a double minor for high sticking.

            Seattle only managed three shots on goal during the lengthy power play, which actually starred Winnipeg forward Adam Lowry.

            Early in the power play, Jets defenseman Brenden Dillon had his stick break during a clearing attempt. Lowry handed him his stick and then went on the defensive with only his body.

            Lowry first blocked one Kraken blast with his skate. A second shot deflected off him and over the glass to draw a whistle and stoppage in play. Lowry then skated to the bench to cheers from the crowd of 14,237.

            “Yeah, I could have been a goalie,” Lowry said. “I played it when I was young for a bit (under age 13), and ultimately had to make the decision. I guess I made the right decision. … There were a few kick saves tonight.”

            Winnipeg got its first power play of the game two minutes into the second period, but two shots at the net couldn’t get past Grubauer.

            “(Grubauer) tonight, and the last few times he’s played, he’s been unbelievable,” Seattle forward Morgan Geekie said.

            “It’s great to see him have success, but unfortunately we couldn’t get it done for him tonight. I think we need to work on scoring some more goals when he’s in there.”

            MORRISSEY MAGIC

            Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey assisted on the Dubois goal, giving him 45 assists, which is a franchise record for assists in a single season by a defenseman in Atlanta Thrashers/Jets history. Toby Enstrom held the previous record.

            Morrissey also has 56 points this season, tying Dustin Byfuglien for the franchise’s all-time points by a defenseman.

            Morrissey is also riding a three-game point streak (three goals, two assists).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810760,Pitt wins sixth straight and is alone in first place in ACC,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Blake Hinson made six 3-pointers in scoring 21 points and Pittsburgh left Boston College behind in the second half to win 77-58 on Tuesday night and take a half-game lead in the ACC.

            The Panthers (19-7, 12-3) won their sixth straight game, set a program record for most ACC wins in a season, and gave themselves at least a 24-hour perch alone atop the conference standings. No. 7 Virginia (11-3) plays at last-place Louisville on Wednesday.

            Hinson was 6 of 11 on 3-pointers, Greg Elliott added four more and the Panthers finished 11 of 25 from the arc. Elliott scored 14 points, Nelly Cummings added 11 and Jamarius Burton and Federiko Federiko had 10 each. 











            Mason Madsen made four 3-pointers and scored 14 points for the Eagles (12-15, 6-10). Jaeden Zackery added 11 points. Quinten Post, averaging nearly 17 points per game, finished with seven and fouled out.

            Hinson's 3-pointer gave Pitt the first double-digit lead of the night and that bucket plus his four-point play were part of a 21-2 run that put the Panthers ahead by 24 with nine minutes left. Meanwhile, Boston College was missing 13 consecutive shots.

            Pitt trailed by seven before outscoring Boston College 23-7 over the final eight minutes of the first half to lead by nine, capped by Hinson's fourth 3-pointer. He had 14 first-half points.

            Boston College is at Florida State and Pitt is at Virginia Tech in Saturday games.

            Bryce Hopkins and Noah Locke each scored 20 for the Friars (19-7, 11-4 Big East), who ended an eight-game winning streak for the Bluejays that began with a Jan. 14 victory over Providence at home.

            With the win, the Friars tied Creighton (17-9, 11-4) for third place in the Big East standings. Both teams are a half-game behind Xavier and a game back of first-place Marquette in a crowded race for the regular-season title.











            Providence, the defending regular-season champion, improved to 14-0 at home this season and 9-1 in its past 10 games that went to overtime — including a pair of double-OT wins on its own court this season.

            Ryan Nembhard led Creighton with 21 points and 10 rebounds in a game that featured 20 lead changes and 17 ties.

            The win snapped a seven-game Big 12 conference losing streak for the Sooners (13-13, 3-10 Big 12) and prevented the Wildcats (19-7, 7-6) and first-year coach Jerome Tang from earning their 20th win of the year. 

            Sherfield leads Oklahoma in scoring and assists on the season, but coach Porter Moser felt he took them to a different level in this game.











            “I thought Grant had his best floor game since he’s worn a Sooner uniform,” said Moser. “The ball went where it needed to go. He had six assists and had a bunch of other (passes) that led to fouls. He was just so locked in. He had eight rebounds. Best overall communication game that he’s had.” 

            Tanner Groves scored 16 while freshman Milos Uzan added 13 for Oklahoma. Nae’quan Tomlin had 17 points — 13 of them in the first half — and 10 rebounds to pace Kansas State.

            Sherfield’s 3-pointer in the final 10 seconds of the opening half sent the teams into intermission tied at 36. 

            The Wildcats got the first basket of the second half, and then the Sooners scored 12 straight to move to a 48-38 lead early in the second half, spurred by threes from Sherfield, Groves and Uzan. Oklahoma shot 11-for-23 (47.8%) and went on to lead by as many as 16. Kansas State got no closer than eight the rest of the way.

            It was the Wildcats second straight conference loss and both were to teams at the bottom of the Big 12 standings. Coach Tang hopes this is a wake up call for his team, who he says is less than a lock for NCAA tournament play.

            ”(Oklahoma) kicked our butts and they deserve all the credit in the world for that. We did not play hard enough to deserve to win tonight,” said Tang. “We have to win at least two more games to get to the NCAA tournament. That was my message to them that we gotta figure this thing out.” 

            It was Oklahoma’s first conference win in a month, since a one-point win at home over West Virginia. With the loss, Kansas State fell into a fifth place tie with Oklahoma State in the Big 12 race.

            TIP-INS

            Kansas State - Tang was trying to become just the fourth Wildcats coach to win 20 games in his first season, joining Lon Krueger, Bob Huggins and Frank Martin. He is currently still tied for the winningest first year head coach this season with Sean Miller of Xavier and Dennis Gates of Missouri.

            Oklahoma - The Sooners shot 14% better from three than their season average. The Sooners avoided their eighth straight conference loss, which last occurred in the 2011-12 season.

The technology can be incorporated into outdoor PVC products – roofing membranes, tarpaulin, awnings and decking – and used to treat goods manufactured from PU and EVA foams, including shoe soles, furniture cushions and mattresses.   Dr Souvik Nandi, Vice President of Technology and Innovations at Microban International, added: “MicroGuard has been carefully developed using our extensive in-house expertise to meet the diverse needs of PU, EVA and PVC manufacturers. Available in both pellet and liquid formulations, MicroGuard has global registration to offer manufacturers confidence in treating their polymer products.”   The technology is available to brands and manufacturers globally, along with Microban’s support and expertise.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810779,"Essegian scores 23, Wisconsin holds off Michigan 64-59","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Freshman Connor Essegian scored a career-high 23 points, including 5 of 6 free throws in the final 45 seconds, and Wisconsin held off Michigan 64-59 on Tuesday night despite missing its last 15 shots.

            The game started with a minute of silence for the campus shooting Monday night at Michigan State that left three people dead and five others wounded, leading to the school postponing Wednesday's game against Minnesota. Michigan is scheduled to host the the Spartans on Saturday.

            Essegian's basket at the 10:45 was the last one for the Badgers, and his two free throws at 10:27 following a technical foul on Michigan coach Juwan Howard, capped a personal 6-0 run for a 54-42 lead.











            From there, Wisconsin made 10 of 12 free throws, just enough to pull out the win. Twice the Wolverines had free-throw opportunities to tie the game, once with 4:10 to play and again less than two minutes to go, but failed to do so. They also made just two of their last 11 field-goal attempts, including eight straight misses.

            Steven Crowl had 11 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for the Badgers (15-10, 7-8 Big Ten Conference), who were coming off an overtime loss to Nebraska after blowing a 17-point lead. Max Klesmit added 10 points. Leading scorer Chucky Hepburn, averaging 13.2 points, had just two on 1-of-9 shooting but had a critical steal with 16 seconds left and the lead at 61-57.

            Kobe Bufkin scored 21 points for the Wolverines (14-12, 8-7), who were coming off a 62-61 loss to No. 18 Indiana. Hunter Dickinson had 12 points and 12 rebounds.

            Wisconsin was ahead 39-38 five minutes into the second half when Michigan committed turnovers on five of six possessions. Crowl and Kamari McGee combined for nine points to stretch the Wolverines' lead to 48-40. After a Michigan layup, Essegian had his run for the big lead of the game.

            But the technical seemed to bring Michigan to life. Dug McDaniel capped a 10-0 run by making 1 of 2 free throws that cut the deficit to 55-54. 

            Will Tschetter, in his first collegiate start in place of Terrance Williams II, who was out with a deep knee bruise, missed two free throws with 1:17 to play when the Wolverines trailed 57-55.

            Michigan finished 6 of 10 from the foul line, all coming in the last seven minutes.

            The Wolverines made their last five shots of the first half, two of them 3-pointers, to erase a seven-point deficit, taking a 32-31 lead on Bufkin's 3-pointer five seconds before the break.

            The finish helped push Michigan to 50% shooting, including 4 of 8 from distance. The Badgers were 5 of 10 behind the arc but only shot 7 of 23 inside. They were 1 of 9 to close out the half after taking a 27-20 lead on Klesmit's 3-pointer at the 5:31 mark.

They also made just two of their last 11 field-goal attempts, including eight straight misses.Steven Crowl had 11 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for the Badgers (15-10, 7-8 Big Ten Conference), who were coming off an overtime loss to Nebraska after blowing a 17-point lead.

Leading scorer Chucky Hepburn, averaging 13.2 points, had just two on 1-of-9 shooting but had a critical steal with 16 seconds left and the lead at 61-57.Kobe Bufkin scored 21 points for the Wolverines (14-12, 8-7), who were coming off a 62-61 loss to No. 18 Indiana. Hunter Dickinson had 12 points and 12 rebounds.Wisconsin was ahead 39-38 five minutes into the second half when Michigan committed turnovers on five of six possessions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810781,Thom Browne channels ‘Little Prince’ in heartfelt NYFW show,"NEW YORK (AP) — The beloved novella “The Little Prince” tells us that we see clearly only with our hearts — that what is essential is invisible to the eye. Fair enough. But Thom Browne, in a fashion show channeling the famed 1943 tale, couldn't help but dazzle the eye, too.

            Those lucky enough to get a seat at a Browne runway show know what they’re getting into by now — which is, basically, anything but a typical runway show. Rather, Browne’s shows are elaborate, lengthy, fully realized theatrical productions, with backstories and narration and music, along with fashions featuring endlessly inventive craftsmanship.

            On Tuesday night at New York Fashion Week, Browne, who has just taken on the high-profile role of chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, welcomed guests to a large theater space on the far west side of Manhattan with a scene both fantastical and familiar.











            A small airplane, stuck in the sand (real sand). Planets and stars, twinkling from above. What was it this time ... oh, of course! Browne had brought his guests to the Sahara to recreate the plane crash from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s story.

            “We find ourselves in the desert,” the taped narration began. “A plane has crashed.” A model playing the pilot, dressed in a space-suit like ensemble with pouffy sleeves, wandered about, disoriented, soon to encounter another model with hair in blonde curls reminiscent of the prince — and dressed in one of Browne’s signature gray blazers with a four-stripe band on the arm.

            “Two lost travelers meet,” said the narrator, describing one, the pilot, who has traveled far and wide across Earth, and another, the prince, who has traveled farther, from his own planet. Then came a series of models representing distant planets. These characters had high white buns with elaborate headpieces, and endlessly long curled fingernails and toenails.

            Next came a procession of adults — who, in the words of the prince, need to be told what to do and only see what's in front of them. These models displayed a series of coats in sumptuous tweeds, all with exaggerated huge shoulders, with suits and ties underneath. They carried briefcases bearing clock faces — indeed, the heels of their chunky shoes, too, formed round clock faces, as did the stage itself. They walked to the methodical ticking of a clock’s second hand (you think models walk fast in fashion shows? Not in a Thom Browne show.)

            A subsequent group wore fanciful combinations of prints and plaids, with bustles at the back and tight patterned waistbands. And there was yet another group — seemingly representing children — in deconstructed suits, garments comprised of jackets and shirts taken apart and patched together, with shoulders hanging off waists or sleeves jutting out every which way. Elaborate gold concoctions that would befit a pope adorned their heads.

            An eclectic group of celebrities, from music figures Erykah Badu, Queen Latifah and Lil Nas X to TV host Whoopi Goldberg to actors Christine Baranski, Rebecca Hall and Jesse Williams, watched as the show took an emotional turn at the end, with the models coming back out in couples, hand in hand in a message of togetherness, accompanied by the song “You’ll Never Walk Alone” from the Broadway musical “Carousel.""

            Browne backed up his appeal to the emotions — on Valentine's Day — by turning his traditional post-show bow into a gesture of romance, bringing his partner, curator Andrew Bolton, a red heart-shaped box of chocolates at his seat between Anna Wintour and Goldberg.

            In Browne’s ever-stylish hands, to the strains of David Bowie's “Starman,” the gesture did not seem corny at all.NEW YORK (AP) — The beloved novella “The Little Prince” tells us that we see clearly only with our hearts — that what is essential is invisible to the eye.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810782,Pastrnak scores in OT as Bruins rally for 3-2 win over Stars,"DALLAS (AP) — David Pastrnak scored with 1:16 remaining in overtime, and the Boston Bruins rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night in a matchup of the top team in each conference.

            Pavel Zacha scored the tying goal in the third period for the NHL-leading Bruins in Jim Montgomery’s first game as a head coach in Dallas since the Stars fired him in 2019 for what he later admitted was a drinking problem.

            The Stars couldn't convert on 57 seconds of a 5-on-3 power play in the second period and a two minute 4-on-3 session in the extra period.











            “It was nice to win a game where we had to overcome so many struggles within the game,” Montgomery said after just the second win in six games in the closest thing to a slump for Boston this season. “Keep pushing, keep believing. There’s a lot of belief in that locker room.”

            Dallas finished 3-1-4 on an eight-game homestand that featured five games going to extra time, including four in a row. All five had identical 3-2 scores.

            The Western Conference-leading Stars have consecutive losses to East contenders. The first was a 3-1 defeat to three-time defending East champion Tampa Bay when the Lightning scored the go-ahead goal in the final minute.

            “We played some really good teams this week,” Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. “Tampa game, shoulda gotten a point, tonight got a point. You want to be greedy and get two in these games. The good thing is we got a point against the best team in the league.”

            
                Taylor Hall opened the scoring for Boston, and Jason Robertson had his team-leading 34th to give Dallas a 2-1 lead in the second period. Joe Pavelski had two assists for the Stars.

            Pastrnak, who assisted on Zacha's tying goal, scored his team-leading 39th on a pass from Charlie McAvoy with the teams playing 4-on-4 in overtime because play never stopped after Brad Marchand's interference penalty ended 2 1/2 minutes into the extra period.

            The one-timer from Pastrnak beat Jake Oettinger on his stick side to end an otherwise stellar night for the young Dallas goalie, who finished with several point-blank stops among 34 saves. 

            Boston's Linus Ullmark stopped 29 shots and the Bruins won despite a 50-12 deficit in faceoff wins.

            “It was a good hockey game,” Ullmark said. “Felt like like a bit towards the playoff atmosphere that we all want to play.”

            
                Roope Hintz's 23rd goal got Dallas even in the first period. Colin Miller didn't get an assist, but his two-line pass to Pavelski from behind his own net set up the play.

            STRUGGLING POWER PLAYS

            The failed 5-on-3 and missed chance with the man advantage in OT left the Stars at 3 of 37 on power plays over 12 games. The Bruins are in an 0-for-21 slide with the extra skater.

            “The one that hurts the most is the 5 on 3 during regulation time,” DeBoer said. “When it was almost two minutes it felt like, those are the ones that you've got to stick the puck in the net.” 

            STAYING CLOSE

            Not long after a high-sticking penalty on Zacha was rescinded on review, McAvoy was called for hooking and Connor Clifton for cross-checking about a minute apart in the second period.

            The Bruins survived 57 seconds of 5-on-3 without surrendering a great chance for Dallas, and the remaining minute of the power play was mostly drama-free as Boston stayed within 2-1.

            With the Stars struggling early, Oettinger had two remarkable saves to keep Dallas in it. The first was with the glove on a shot from the circle by Derek Forbort. Patrice Bergeron had an open net on a rebound, but Oettinger made a pad stop.

            BACK IN BIG D

            Montgomery had returned to Dallas as an assistant with St. Louis, where he spent the previous two seasons before Boston hired him. Montgomery went to rehab after the Stars fired him before resuming his coaching career.

            UP NEXT

            Bruins: At Nashville on Thursday. The Bruins have won three in a row against the Predators.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810783,Dick scores 26 as No. 5 Kansas beats Oklahoma State 87-76,"STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Kansas guard Gradey Dick was the main target of jeers from Oklahoma State's noisy fans Tuesday night.

            His outside shooting quieted the crowd. The freshman scored 17 of his season-high 26 points in the second half and the fifth-ranked Jayhawks rolled to an 87-76 victory over the Cowboys.

            Dick said Oklahoma State's fans gave him energy.











            “I love it,” he said. “I love it. I kind of like being, you know, the hated one going into (visiting arenas). And they were doing their little chants. But it definitely fuels the fire, for sure.""

            Dick made 10 of 17 field goal attempts, shooting 4 of 9 on 3-pointers. And his performance allowed Kansas to get away with a bit of an off night from the Big 12's leading scorer. Jalen Wilson had 14 points — nearly seven below his average coming in. 

            Wilson said Dick's production was exceptional, especially for a freshman.

            “He did great,” Wilson said. “You guys have seen all year, he has no conscience when it comes to shooting the ball and that’s what makes a great shooter. Every time he shoots the ball, we think it’s going in just like he thinks it’s going in.”

            Kansas shot 66% from the field in the second half to pull away from the Cowboys. Oklahoma State leads the Big 12 in field goal percentage defense, but the Cowboys couldn't figure out the Jayhawks.

            “We’ve got to defend better,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “We’re a better defensive team than we showed. We just didn’t have our fastball tonight and our curveball wasn’t good enough.”

            Kansas (21-5, 9-4 Big 12) has won three straight. The Jayhawks are tied with Texas and Baylor atop the conference standings. 

            Kalib Boone scored a career-high 27 points, John-Michael Wright had 18 and Bryce Thompson added 17 for Oklahoma State (16-10, 7-6).

            Oklahoma State had won five straight, including victories over ranked opponents TCU and Iowa State. The Cowboys were coming off a 64-56 win at then-No. 11 Iowa State.

            But the Cowboys were again without senior guard Avery Anderson III, who remained out after having surgery on his left wrist.

            Thompson lit up the Jayhawks early. The guard, who played at Kansas for a year before transferring to Oklahoma State, scored 14 points in the first 11 minutes to help the Cowboys take a 23-18 lead.

            Kansas hung tough, and Dick's 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer gave the Jayhawks a 39-37 lead at the break.

            “Obviously, it was a big play, kind of a breakdown in communication for us,"" Boynton said. ""I think we had a mix-up in our defensive calls there and that should never happen. A guy who shoots that well is obviously pretty close to the top of the scouting report.” 

            Dick scored eight points in the first two minutes of the second half to help Kansas take a 52-44 lead, and the Jayhawks led by at least five the rest of the way. 

            Now, Oklahoma State will try to regain its footing.

            “You can’t get too far down,"" Boynton said. ""There’s still a lot of games left, a lot to play for with solid position. We’ve just got to get back to work.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas: The Jayhawks completed back-to-back road wins in Oklahoma against teams that have some big victories on their home courts. The Jayhawks beat Oklahoma on Saturday. 

            Oklahoma State: While this loss won't hurt perception of the Cowboys, they have three more regular-season games against ranked opponents, so every opportunity is critical.

            Boone shot 10 of 15 and grabbed nine rebounds. He scored 25 points three games ago against TCU, then dropped to nine against Texas Tech and eight against Iowa State before Tuesday’s big performance.

            It was the first home game for the Suns since they completed a trade with Brooklyn for Durant, who is recovering from a right knee injury and hasn't played since Jan. 12. He was introduced during a timeout in the third quarter and received a standing ovation. Durant is expected back sometime after this weekend’s All-Star break.

            “I was watching him more than anything,"" Booker said. ""I don’t think people realize what it is until you’re in it. He deserves it, he’s a legend in this game. I’m glad he’s here.”











            Booker was 13 of 20 from the field and did not attempt a 3-pointer in 29 minutes. It was his highest-scoring game of the four he's played since returning from a left groin strain that sidelined him for 21 games.

            “I feel good. It’s been a long recovery road, something I found peace in and just enjoyed the whole process,"" Booker said.

            Chris Paul had a season-high 19 assists and scored 17 points for Phoenix, which has won 11 of its last 14. Josh Okogie scored 19 points and made a team-high three 3-pointers.

            “I think we did a really good job of finding the open man,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""Overall, it was a well-balanced game for us, complemented by how hard we played from start to finish.”

            De’Aaron Fox led the Kings with 35 points, following up his 36-point performance in a win over Dallas on Saturday.

            “We just had too many unforced errors and going up against a team like that you can’t do that,"" Fox said. ""They capitalized on just about every error that we made today.”

            Domantas Sabonis had 24 points and 15 rebounds — going 10 for 10 from the free-throw line — and Kevin Huerter scored 18 for Sacramento, which saw its lead over Phoenix in the Pacific Division shrink to one game.

            The Suns led by as many as 13 points in the third quarter, but the Kings closed within four at the end of the period. Sacramento kept it close in the fourth, but Okogie's 3 with 1:42 remaining turned out to be the Kings' final basket. Paul responded with a step-back jumper to put the Suns ahead by nine.

            DURANT UPDATE

            Before the game, Williams said Durant is participating in some drills as he prepares to return.

            “He’s in great shape and going game speed like he always does,” Williams said, adding that Durant needs to play in more 3-on-3 and similar competition levels before he can return.

            DIVISION DOMINANCE

            The Suns are 9-0 against Pacific Division opponents, the only NBA team without a loss in its division this season.

            INJURY REPORT

            Kings: Played without Malik Monk (right ankle sprain) and KZ Okpala (knee soreness).

            Suns: Besides Durant, Cameron Payne (right foot sprain) and Landry Shamet (right foot soreness) remain sidelined.

            HUERTER ADDED

            Huerter has been selected to participate in the 3-point contest this weekend in Salt Lake City. Coach Mike Brown said Huerter is valuable to the Kings for more than just his shooting.

            “He tries to find other ways to help us win,” Brown said. “The way he facilitates, plays the two-man game, he’s shown that he can shoot at a high level for many years.”

            MISSING BRIDGES

            The Suns gave up a lot to get Durant and Williams said replacing Mikal Bridges, a defensive stalwart at forward, is a challenge.

            “Josh (Okogie) and Torrey (Craig) have been taking up some of that role. It’s something we have to figure out, be open-minded about what these guys can do and not compare to what Mikal did, it’s not fair to anybody,” Williams said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810805,Ukraine aid support softens in the US: AP-NORC Poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Support among the American public for providing Ukraine weaponry and direct economic assistance has softened as the Russian invasion nears a grim one-year milestone, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 

            Forty-eight percent say they favor the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, with 29% opposed and 22% saying they’re neither in favor nor opposed. In May 2022, less than three months into the war, 60% of U.S. adults said they were in favor of sending Ukraine weapons. 

            Americans are about evenly divided on sending government funds directly to Ukraine, with 37% in favor and 38% opposed, with 23% saying neither. The signs of diminished support for Ukraine come as President Joe Biden is set to travel to Poland next week to mark the first anniversary of the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. 











            “I am sympathetic for Ukraine's situation and I feel badly for them, but I feel like we need to first take care of priorities here at home,” said Joe Hernandez, 44, of Rocklin, California.

            Hernandez, a Republican, added that it's difficult to support generous U.S. spending on military and economic assistance to Ukraine when many American communities don't have the resources to deal with the ramifications of migrants crossing into the U.S. at the southern border, a rise in drug overdoses caused by fentanyl and other lab-produced synthetic opioids, and a homelessness crisis in his state. 

            Biden has repeatedly stated that the United States will help Ukraine “as long as it takes” to repel the Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24 of last year. Privately, administration officials have warned Ukrainian officials that there is a limit to the patience of a narrowly divided Congress — and American public — for the costs of a war with no clear end. Congress approved about $113 billion in economic, humanitarian and military spending in 2022.

            The poll shows 19% of Americans have a great deal of confidence in Biden’s ability to handle the situation in Ukraine, while 37% say they have only some confidence and 43% have hardly any. 

            Views of Biden's handling of the war divide largely along partisan lines. Among Democrats, 40% say they have a great deal of confidence in Biden to handle the situation, 50% have some confidence and 9% have hardly any. Among Republicans, a large majority (76%) say they have hardly any confidence. Those numbers are largely unchanged since last May. 

            Janice Fortado, 78, of Ipswich, Massachusetts, said Biden deserves credit for his handling of the war. She agreed with Biden's hesitance early in the war about sending advanced and offensive weaponry out of concern that it would give Russian President Vladimir Putin a pretext to expand the war beyond Ukraine and spur a larger global conflict. 

            But as the war has dragged on — and Ukrainian forces have held up against a more formidable Russian military — some of that resistance has melted away. Biden has approved sending light multiple rocket launchers known as HIMARS, Patriot missile systems, Bradley fighting vehicles, Abrams tanks, and more. Biden, however, continues to balk at Ukraine's request for fighter jets.

            “As my opinion evolved, I came to wish we had offered more to Ukraine sooner,” said Fortado, a Democrat, who added that she hopes the U.S. and allies change their mind on the fighter jets. “We seem to have done a drip, drip, drip. I understand why it is they were hesitant, but we are now beyond that point.”

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., before winning the speakership, vowed that Republicans wouldn't write a “blank check” for Ukraine once they were in charge. And some of the most right-leaning Republicans lashed out at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky over his support of a $1.7 trillion spending bill passed in December that included about $47 billion for Ukraine.

            Alex Hoxeng, 37, of Midland, Texas, said he expected Republicans to take a tougher line on Ukraine spending. 

            “I think Biden isn't worried enough about inflation,” said Hoxeng, a Republican. “We should just stay out of it. Ukraine is halfway around the world and we have our own problems.”

            A majority of Americans, 63%, still favor imposing economic sanctions on Russia, the poll shows, though that too has decreased from the 71% who said that in May 2022. 

            And 59% say limiting damage to the U.S. economy is more important than effectively sanctioning Russia, even if that means sanctions are less effective. Almost a year ago, in March 2022, the situation was reversed: 55% said it was a bigger priority to sanction Russia effectively, even if it meant damage to the U.S. economy. 

            Shandi Carter, 51, of Big Spring, Texas, said she's become frustrated with the global ramifications the war has had on consumers, including volatile gas prices and increasing food costs. Carter, who tends to vote Republican, said she's been displeased with Biden's handling of the crisis but doesn't think Donald Trump would have done any better had he won the 2020 election.

            “I just wish it was over. I wish it had never started,” Carter said. “It didn't matter if there was a Democrat or Republican there. Putin was going to do what he wanted to do.”

            Overall, the poll shows that about a quarter of Americans, 26%, now say the U.S. should have a major role in the situation, down from as high as 40% in March 2022. Still, 49% say the U.S. should have a minor role, and just 24% say it should have no role. 

            Since last March, the percentage of Democrats saying the U.S. should have a major role has dipped slightly from 48% to 40%, while among Republicans it has dropped from 35% to 17%.

            Democrats also remain more likely than Republicans to favor imposing economic sanctions on Russia (75% to 60%), accepting refugees from Ukraine (73% to 42%), providing weapons to Ukraine (63% to 39%) and sending government funds to Ukraine (59% to 21%). Support has softened at least slightly among both Democrats and Republicans since last May.

            Tom Sadauskas, 68, a political independent from northern Virginia, said he doesn't believe an end to the war is near. That makes him worried about the direction of American support for a conflict that he believes could have reverberations far beyond Ukraine if Putin is successful.

            “I worry that as a country we get easily distracted,” said Sadauskas, who approves of Biden's handling of the war thus far. “It’s easy to say, 'It's a faraway country. That it really doesn’t matter.' But if Ukraine goes, what is our attitude going to be when Putin decides to move on and threaten one of our smaller neighboring NATO countries?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810807,FIFA reserves at $4BN after World Cup; more to come in 2026,"GENEVA (AP) — FIFA had reserves of almost $4 billion after a financially successful 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and booming hospitality and ticket sales at the 2026 tournament in North America are expected to add billions to the income of soccer's international governing body.

            FIFA detailed “exceptionally robust” finances in its 2022 annual report late Tuesday that saw the annual bonus of President Gianni Infantino rise by 620,000 Swiss francs ($673,000). His pre-tax base salary and bonus package totaled 3.6 million Swiss francs ($3.9 million) plus more FIFA-paid expenses and benefits.

            At the World Cup in November, FIFA announced record revenue of almost $7.6 billion for the four-year commercial cycle through 2022 that is mostly earned by the men’s World Cup.











            FIFA said its reserves stood at $3.97 billion at year’s end compared with $1.6 billion through 2021.

            “FIFA’s financial position remains exceptionally robust and sustainable with a substantial cash base and sufficient reserves,” soccer’s world body said in the report.

            The $11 billion income conservatively forecast in December for the next four years is fueled by using mostly NFL stadiums for an expanded 48-team World Cup in 2026 that will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

            Using home stadiums of the Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Rams and the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs plus other NFL venues has driven FIFA’s expected revenue of $3.1 billion in hospitality and ticket sales across the next four years.

            FIFA said it got a combined $929 million in Qatar from ticket sales for the 64 games and a hospitality program that was sold in 2011 — for a rights fee and profit share adding up to $243 million — to long-time World Cup partner MATCH.

            “Hospitality sales (will be) largely driven by the strategic model in operation, which has moved away from the rights fee model, under which FIFA’s hospitality services were outsourced,” FIFA said in the annual report. Operational costs of $638 million are foreseen for the 2026 hospitality program.

            The 2026 World Cup s expected to far exceed the tournament record attendance of nearly 3.6 million set at the United States-hosted 1994 edition, which included 52 games in a 24-team format.

            With 48 teams in North America in 2026, FIFA previously agreed an 80-game schedule but Infantino said in Qatar that decision will be reviewed. A format of 104 games is possible. 

            FIFA also forecast big increases in broadcast rights and sponsorships sales through 2026.

            Pointing to “North American time zones offering favorable coverage across the globe … plus an expanded match schedule,” FIFA forecast total broadcast revenue of $4.26 billion through 2026, rising by nearly $1 billion from the 2019-22 period. That new total is equal to one year of TV and sponsor money for Europe's Champions League.

            Marketing revenue is set to rise from $1.8 billion to almost $2.7 billion, though only a few deals such as Coca-Cola and Adidas currently extend beyond the Qatar tournament.

            FIFA said its $11 billion total revenue estimate did not include the Club World Cup that is set to re-launch in 2025 with a 32-team tournament. Infantino previously valued that event at $3 billion per edition.

            Spending is also set to rise sharply through 2026, with FIFA again conservatively budgeting for a $100 million profit over four years.

            FIFA’s projected costs are $3.84 billion for the 2026 World Cup and $435 million on the Women's World Cup that starts in July in Australia and New Zealand.

            Spending on the 2026 men's event includes a total of $896 million on prize money for the 48 teams plus payments to clubs for releasing their players to national-team duty. Clubs worldwide received a total of $209 million from the 2022 World Cup, calculated at a daily rate per player.

            FIFA also will pay $2.25 billion in development funds across its 211 member federations — which get at least $2 million per year — the six continental confederations and regional soccer bodies.

            A further $660 million is available in a Football Development Fund to nurture the game “in all its forms and at all levels,” the report said.

            Committing to spend tens of millions on communications such as websites and phone apps, FIFA said it had “lived up to its role as the main source of information for football lovers everywhere.”

            Spending of $367 million on governance and administration personnel is expected over the next four years. Some staff, in areas such as marketing and legal departments, are expected to work in North America rather than FIFA’s home city Zurich.

            FIFA said its CEO-like secretary general Fatma Samoura got a salary and bonus package of 1.9 million Swiss francs ($2.06 million) last year, including a bonus that doubled to 600,000 Swiss francs ($650,000).

            With so much cash at hand, FIFA makes short-term loans to Swiss public authorities through an online platform matching investors to borrowers. Those third-party loans amounted to $737 million on Dec. 31, FIFA said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810808,Haley calls for generational change in launching 2024 bid,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley launched her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday with a call for generational change in Washington and a rejection of what she derided as “identity politics” dividing the United States.

            Speaking from the historic coastal city of Charleston, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador struck themes intended to resonate with the Republican voters she will court as the first major GOP challenger to former President Donald Trump.

            She blasted President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats as too liberal and insisted there's not a problem with racism in the U.S. as they contend. But there were occasional notes that could appeal beyond the GOP base, including appeals for unity and criticism of corporate bailouts.











            Haley, who is 51, said that Republicans have repeatedly lost the popular vote in recent elections because they “failed to win the confidence of a majority of Americans.” The solution, she said, was to “put your trust in a new generation.”

            “America is not past its prime,” she told a crowd of several hundred people gathered near Charleston’s visitors center. “It’s just that our politicians are past theirs.”

            That was an obvious knock on Biden, who, at 80, is the oldest president in history, a fact that makes even some Democrats uneasy. But it was also a slight of Trump, who has launched a third White House bid and remains popular with wide swaths of Republican voters. Trump is 76 and has had an up-and-down relationship with Haley from the early days of the 2016 campaign through her time in his administration. 

            Haley said she would support a “mandatory mental competency test for politicians over 75 years old.”

            While Haley is the first major Republican to officially challenge Trump, she will hardly be the last. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are among those expected to launch campaigns in the coming months. Haley’s fellow South Carolinian Sen. Tim Scott is also weighing a White House bid.

            At a time when Biden is holding together a Western alliance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine and facing scrutiny for his handling of unidentified aerial objects, Haley leaned into the national security credentials she said she gained at the U.N. Among the speakers who introduced her was the mother of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea and died shortly after his release.

            In her remarks, Haley criticized Biden's presiding over the chaotic withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, North Korea's launch of missiles, heightened Russian aggression and an emboldened China. 

            “Today our enemies think that the American era has passed,"" she said. “They’re wrong.”

            As the presidential primary season comes into focus, the biggest question is whether anyone in the field will be able to push Trump from his position at the top of a party that he transformed with his first campaign in 2016. Though he enjoys enduring support with some Republican voters, he's been blamed by some party officials for the GOP’s lackluster performance in last year’s midterms.

            As in 2016, a crowded field could work to Trump’s advantage, allowing him to march to the nomination while his opponents divide support among themselves.

            In an interview with Fox News Digital, Trump said he was glad Haley is running.

            “I want her to follow her heart — even though she made a commitment that she would never run against who she called the greatest president of her lifetime,"" he said.

            Pence hasn't yet announced a campaign. But during a visit Wednesday to the early voting state of Iowa, he said she did a “great job” when she worked in the Trump administration. 

            “I wish her well,” Pence said. ""She may have more company soon in the race for president, and I promise folks here in Iowa and all of you I’ll keep you posted.”

            During a visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another possible presidential contender, said Haley's announcement was highly anticipated.

            “So we'll let her have her day,” Noem said.

            During her launch, Haley made clear that she would seek to distinguish herself in the GOP field in part by emphasizing her biography. She spoke of growing up in a small South Carolina town as the daughter of immigrants who experienced racist taunts. Still, she insisted that America was not a “racist country.”

            “This self loathing is a virus more dangerous than any pandemic,” she said.

            But the nation's complicated experience with race was hard to dismiss. As Haley spoke, a white racist who killed 10 Black people last year at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 

            And the very venue from which Haley spoke was just a few blocks from Mother Emanuel AME Church, where nine Black parishioners were murdered in 2015 by a self-avowed white supremacist who had been pictured holding Confederate flags. One of the survivors, Felicia Sanders, was in attendance Wednesday. Sanders’ son Tywanza was killed in the massacre.

            The Charleston shooting was a defining moment of Haley's governorship. For years, she resisted calls to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds, even portraying a rival’s push for its removal as a desperate stunt. But after the church shootings and with the support of other leading Republicans, Haley advocated for legislation to remove the flag. It came down less than a month after the murders.

            A campaign video that Haley released on Tuesday referred to the shooting, but made no reference to her work to remove the flag. 

            In unveiling her campaign in Charleston, Haley sought to show some strength in her home state, which holds a critical early primary that influences the GOP nomination. Ahead of Wednesday's event, Rep. Ralph Norman — whom Trump backed in the 2022 midterm elections — became the first House member from South Carolina to publicly endorse Haley. 

            Those in the crowd said they were excited by the prospect of a Haley presidency. Retiree Connie Campbell said she was all in for the former governor, who she said has “got so much to offer.”

            “She’s very experienced in politics and as a family person, a mother, a wife,” said Campbell, noting her admiration for the way Haley led South Carolina through tragedies including the Charleston shooting. “She had a lot to go through as our governor.”

            If elected, Haley would be the first woman as well as woman of color to assume the presidency, a historic fact that she embraced — to an extent. She said she rejects identity politics and also doesn't believe in “glass ceilings.” That phrase became popular in politics when Hillary Clinton conceded to Barack Obama after a bitter primary fight in 2008, noting that she wasn't yet able to “shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling.”

            Still, Haley wore white on stage in a nod to the suffragette movement and leaned into gender as she wrapped up her remarks.

            “As I set out on this new journey, I will simply say this – may the best woman win,” she said to roars of approval.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810811,"Stamkos scores in SO, Lightning rally for 4-3 win over Avs","DENVER (AP) — Turns out, the deflections weren't just reserved for his gifted goaltender. 

            Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos did his best Andrei Vasilevskiy impression after the game by swiftly turning aside a question about how nice it was to get another revenge win over Colorado, the team that dethroned Tampa Bay last season in the Stanley Cup final.

            “There are no revenge wins,” Stamkos quickly asserted. “It's a new season.”











            Stamkos had the lone score in the shootout and the Lightning rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat the banged-up Avalanche 4-3 on Tuesday night.

            The first to go, Stamkos sent a wrist shot past Alexandar Georgiev to set the tone for the shootout. Vasilevskiy took it from there by stopping all three shots. 

            Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli and Vladislav Namestnikov had goals for a Tampa Bay team that trailed 2-0 midway through the second period. Vasilevskiy finished with 43 saves.

            Artturi Lehkonen, Nathan MacKinnon and Denis Malgin had goals for the Avalanche. It was Malgin’s first goal in a Colorado uniform after being acquired in a deal with Toronto on Dec. 19.

            This was the second showdown of the season between the Stanley Cup finalists. Vasilevskiy led the Lightning to a 5-0 win five days ago in Tampa.

            This game had all the feel of a playoff contest, including some hard hits and a brief fight. Colorado beat the Lightning in six games last season to hoist the third Stanley Cup trophy in franchise history.

            “We know the quality of team that they are,"" Stamkos said. ""But it’s a different year. ... We want to win hockey games and get as many points as we can.”

            The Lightning became the eighth different NHL team to record a win in each of their first two or more regular season games against the club that knocked them off in the previous final, according to NHL Stats.

            “I know they’ve had some injuries, but they’re still a hell of a team,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. 

            Georgiev stopped 32 shots. 

            The final moments of the third period featured a flurry of near goals. J.T. Compher almost scored in front only to be stopped by the quick glove of Vasilevskiy. Kucherov was turned back by a sprawled-out Georgiev. 

            It was that sort of end-to-end action all evening.

            “Really good game from both teams,” Georgiev said. “Pretty fun for the fans, I guess.”

            Cirelli tied the game at 2-apiece just 26 seconds into the third period. Soon after Colorado took another lead on Malgin's goal, Namestnikov tied it again.

            The Avalanche had the crowd revved up when MacKinnon gave Colorado a 2-0 lead with his 17th goal of the season. 

            But a scoring chance by Compher quickly went the other way when he missed a shot wide and the puck traveled down the ice. Brayden Point quickly started a break and fed a pass to Kucherov for a tap-in goal to make it 2-1.

            Lehkonen broke a five-game goal drought by sending a shot past the glove of Vasilevskiy just 50 seconds into the game. 

            Colorado has been dealing with a lengthy list of injuries all season. It currently includes defensemen Cale Makar, Erik Johnson and Josh Manson, along with goaltender Pavel Francouz. They’ve been without captain Gabriel Landeskog all season after he underwent knee surgery in October.

            After the game, Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said that Johnson is going to “miss some time” with a lower-body injury. 

            “I don’t have a tight timeline on him, but he’s out indefinitely,” Bednar said. ""It will be weeks.”

            MAC'S MARK

            With a goal and an assist, MacKinnon reached the 60-point mark for the seventh time in his career. That trails Joe Sakic (17 times), Peter Stastny (10), Michel Goulet (9) and Anton Stastny (8) for the most in Avalanche/Nordiques franchise history. 

            UP NEXT

            Both teams play on the road Wednesday night. The Lightning will be at Arizona and the Avalanche at Minnesota.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDENVER (AP) — Turns out, the deflections weren't just reserved for his gifted goaltender.Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos did his best Andrei Vasilevskiy impression after the game by swiftly turning aside a question about how nice it was to get another revenge win over Colorado, the team that dethroned Tampa Bay last season in the Stanley Cup final.“There are no revenge wins,” Stamkos quickly asserted. “It's a new season.”Stamkos had the lone score in the shootout and the Lightning rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat the banged-up Avalanche 4-3 on Tuesday night.The first to go, Stamkos sent a wrist shot past Alexandar Georgiev to set the tone for the shootout. Vasilevskiy took it from there by stopping all three shots.Nikita Kucherov, Anthony Cirelli and Vladislav Namestnikov had goals for a Tampa Bay team that trailed 2-0 midway through the second period. Vasilevskiy finished with 43 saves.Artturi Lehkonen, Nathan MacKinnon and Denis Malgin had goals for the Avalanche. It was Malgin’s first goal in a Colorado uniform after being acquired in a deal with Toronto on Dec. 19.This was the second showdown of the season between the Stanley Cup finalists. Vasilevskiy led the Lightning to a 5-0 win five days ago in Tampa.This game had all the feel of a playoff contest, including some hard hits and a brief fight. Colorado beat the Lightning in six games last season to hoist the third Stanley Cup trophy in franchise history.“We know the quality of team that they are,"" Stamkos said.

  Creativity of Hong Kong Comics Artists Honored by the International Comics Industry Artists Return to Hong Kong to Share Their Eye-Opening Experiences in Early March   HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 15 February 2023 -  Hong Kong comic books tell stories! Comics sporting the 'Made in Hong Kong' label utilise distinctive drawing styles to delight readers around the world with genre-spanning tales set in boundless fantasy worlds. This year, 15 original comic books published as part of the Hong Kong Comics Support Programme (HKCSP) featured in the annual Angoulême International Comics Festival in France. Chief artists of 7 titles represented the HKSAR at the festival and helped showcase the creativity and imagination of the Hong Kong comics industry to global audiences at the Comics Festival.       The Angoulême International Comics Festival is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2023! 7 local artists joined the Festival in France with great support from overseas comics fans.     Since 2006, the  【Hong Kong Arts Centre】 has strived to organise programmes to promote Hong Kong's local comics culture and comics artists to audiences around the world. With the support from  【Create Hong Kong】(【CreateHK】), an initiative of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, more than 50 Hong Kong comics artists and members of the industry has participated in the world renowned Angoulême International Comics Festival, held annually in Angoulême, France and featured works, including Wai-chun LEE, Chi-ching LEE, Chi-tak LI, KONG KEE, SIU HAK, CHI HOI and LITTLE THUNDER. Such international exposure after the participation of the Festival afforded artists opportunities to showcase their creativity in partnership with iconic local brands such as Hong Kong Tramways, Hong Kong International Airport, and others. One member of the Hong Kong delegation in Angoulême, Chi-tak LI, later worked on a comic book project with the Louvre Museum and has a contract with an overseas publisher for a French edition of his featured comics.   When commenting on the importance of such international representation for Hong Kong artists, Rebecca IP, Executive Director of the  【Hong Kong Arts Centre】, said, 'We are proud to once again present comics from Hong Kong at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. By actively promoting artists and their creations, we hope to further develop the arts in Hong Kong.  【Hong Kong Arts Centre】acts as a bridge between the local and overseas art scenes, and promotes comics artists with strong potential on the international stage. One of our missions is to make more people aware of Hong Kong's unique creations and local styles. I am truly happy to know that comics artists from Hong Kong have received further project invitations following the exhibition, and that their creativity and hard work have gained recognition around the world.' The  【Hong Kong Arts Centre】plans to continue promoting Hong Kong comics overseas. Given comics have the potential to transcend barriers, they are a way to connect Hong Kong culture with the wider world.   The【Hong Kong Arts Centre (Comix Home Base)】and the【Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation】(HKCAF) partnered together again under the sponsorship of【Create Hong Kong】(CreateHK) to bring 15 original comic books published as part of the 1st HKCSP to readers outside the Asia-Pacific region in January. The 15 titles featured this year as part of the 50th annual Angoulême International Comics Festival in France. Together, the works showcase the impressive creativity of Hong Kong artists and the wide range of comics as an art form in Hong Kong.   Following its inception in 1974, the Angoulême International Comics Festival has become the most important comics festival in Europe. It is held annually during the last week of January in Angoulême, France. The【Hong Kong Arts Centre (Comix Home Base)】has since 2011, brought notable Hong Kong comics to the festival in a bid to foster collaboration between Hong Kong creators and overseas publishers and other industry players. These exchanges connect artists, industry representatives, and comic book fans eager to find new and exciting works. This year, with the sponsorship of  【CreateHK】, 【Hong Kong Arts Centre (Comix Home Base)】 was pleased to participate in the festival again. Besides showcasing 15 comic books published under 1st HKCSP in Asian Pavilion Manga City, the Centre also set up a booth in the International Rights & Licensing Market. It is hoped that the above comics can successfully draw interest for overseas licensing and publications, seeking opportunities to promote the Hong Kong comics industry to the global market. Through exporting Hong Kong comics to foster cultural exchange. This time participants from over 35 countries representing 115 companies across the comics industry gathered in Angoulême this year. As in previous years, there was keen interest in works coming from Hong Kong.   In addition to the above-mentioned 15 titles, 7 Hong Kong comics artists – Chi-kit KWONG, Chivas LEUNG, Linus LIU, Pen SO, Mimi SZETO, Man TSANG, and WAH KEE–who participated in the 1st HKCSP represented the HKSAR this year in Angoulême, France. Man TSANG, WAH KEE, Chi-kit KWONG, Chivas LEUNG, Linus LIU, and Pen SO demonstrated their superb hand-drawing techniques in Manga City, while Mimi SZETO showcased her digital drawing talents. The artists shared the unique style and characteristics of Hong Kong comics in live drawing demonstrations with on-site audience. Moreover, comics artists took part in various seminars, receptions, and overseas interviews as well. Commenting on his participation in the festival, artist Chi-kit KWONG shared, 'I am grateful to the【Hong Kong Arts Centre (Comix Home Base)】, 【CreateHK】 and 【HKCAF】for giving me this opportunity to join such an incredible event. It is inspiring to see that creating comics is not only a viable means to earn a living, it can also be an inspiration for so much more. If you work hard enough and fight for it, you might get featured in the comics hall of fame, and that opens doors to Europe and the wider world.'   The Angoulême International Comics Festival is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2023. The resumption of international travel has meant participants and industry professionals were able to gather in person to celebrate this important milestone. The Hong Kong representative comics artists demonstrated their comics drawing skills every day, creating eye-grabbing performances to a large group of visitors. The 15 official entries from Hong Kong attracted considerable attention from overseas media, who were eager to learn more about Hong Kong's unique comic culture. Global media outlets interviewed Hong Kong artists throughout the event, asking for their perspectives on what makes the Hong Kong comics scene so special.  Upon returning to Hong Kong in March, 7 participating Hong Kong comics artists will share their exchange experiences and overseas licensing at a press conference.   The 15 comic books featured in Angoulême this time were published under the support and professional guidance of 1st HKCSP, which was organised by the 【HKCAF】 and sponsored by 【CreateHK】. The HKCSP provided assistance to 15 Hong Kong comics entrepreneurs and their chief artists to launch their brand-new original comic books, aiming to cultivate Hong Kong comics artists and local comics start-ups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810831,Elon Musk hopes to have Twitter CEO toward the end of year,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk said Wednesday that he anticipates finding a CEO for Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.""

            Speaking via a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, Musk said making sure the platform can function remained the most important thing for him. 

            “I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it’s in a financial healthy place,” Musk said when asked about when he'd name a CEO. “I’m guessing probably toward the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company.” 











            It remains unclear how seriously Musk will take that timeline. His comment came only hours after he posted images of his shiba inu dog, Floki, on Twitter as the company's “CEO.” 

            ""So much better than that other guy!"" wrote Musk, who often posts memes. After making the posts, a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin, based around the image of a shiba inu meme, rose in value by around 5%. Musk previously has suggested Twitter accept Dogecoin in transactions. 

            Musk, 51, made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal, then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company Tesla. In recent months, however, more attention has been focused on the chaos surrounding his $44 billion purchase of the microblogging site Twitter. 

            Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military's use of Musk's satellite internet service Starlink as it defends itself against Russia's ongoing invasion has put Musk off and on at the center of the war. 

            Musk offered a wide-ranging 35-minute discussion that touched on the billionaire’s fears about artificial intelligence, the collapse of civilization and the possibility of space aliens. But questions about Twitter kept coming back up as Musk described both Tesla and SpaceX as able to function without his direct, day-to-day involvement. 

            “Twitter is still somewhat a startup in reverse,” he said. “There’s work required here to get Twitter to sort of a stable position and to really build the engine of software engineering.""

            Musk also sought to portray his takeover of San Francisco-based Twitter as a cultural correction. Since taking over the company, he's restored Donald Trump's access to the platform after the then-president lost access to the website after a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Musk also reinstated the accounts of several people who spread misinformation about the coronavirus, including that of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

            “I think that the general idea is just to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of essentially San Francisco and Berkeley, which are so somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world,"" Musk said. ""And, you know, Twitter was, I think, doing a little too much to impose a niche.”

            Musk's takeover at Twitter has seen mass firings and other cost-cutting measures. Musk, who is on the hook for about $1 billion in yearly interest payments for his purchase, has been trying to find way to maximize profits at the company. 

            However, some of Musk's decisions have conflicted with the reasons that journalists, governments and others rely on Twitter as an information-sharing platform. 

            Musk on Wednesday described the need for users to rely on Twitter for trusted information from verified accounts. However, a confused rollout to a paid verified account system saw some impersonate famous companies, leading to a further withdrawal of needed advertising cash to the site.

            “Twitter is certainly quite the rollercoaster,” Musk acknowledged.

            Forbes estimates Musk's wealth at just under $200 billion. The Forbes analysis ranks Musk as the second-wealthiest person on Earth, just behind French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault. 

            But Musk also has become a thought leader for some as well, albeit an oracle that is trying to get six hours of sleep a night despite the challenges at Twitter.

            Musk described his children as being “programmed by Reddit and YouTube.” However, he criticized the Chinese-made social media app TikTok. 

            “TikTok has a lot of very high usage (but) I often hear people say, ‘Well, I spent two hours on TikTok, but I regret those two hours,’” Musk said. ""We don’t want that to be the case with Twitter.”

            TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Musk warned that artificial intelligence should be regulated “very carefully,” describing it as akin to the promise of nuclear power but the danger of atomic bombs. He also cautioned against having a single civilization or “too much cooperation” on Earth, saying it could “collapse” a society that's like a “tiny candle in a vast darkness.”

            And when asked about the existence of aliens, Musk had a firm response.

            “The crazy thing is, I’ve seen no evidence of alien technology or alien life whatsoever. And I think I’d know because of SpaceX,” he said. “I don't think anybody knows more about space, you know, than me.”

            ___

            Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk said Wednesday that he anticipates finding a CEO for Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.""Speaking via a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, Musk said making sure the platform can function remained the most important thing for him.“I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it’s in a financial healthy place,” Musk said when asked about when he'd name a CEO. “I’m guessing probably toward the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company.”It remains unclear how seriously Musk will take that timeline. His comment came only hours after he posted images of his shiba inu dog, Floki, on Twitter as the company's “CEO.”""So much better than that other guy!"" wrote Musk, who often posts memes. After making the posts, a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin, based around the image of a shiba inu meme, rose in value by around 5%. Musk previously has suggested Twitter accept Dogecoin in transactions.Musk, 51, made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal, then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company Tesla. In recent months, however, more attention has been focused on the chaos surrounding his $44 billion purchase of the microblogging site Twitter.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military's use of Musk's satellite internet service Starlink as it defends itself against Russia's ongoing invasion has put Musk off and on at the center of the war.Musk offered a wide-ranging 35-minute discussion that touched on the billionaire’s fears about artificial intelligence, the collapse of civilization and the possibility of space aliens. But questions about Twitter kept coming back up as Musk described both Tesla and SpaceX as able to function without his direct, day-to-day involvement.“Twitter is still somewhat a startup in reverse,” he said. “There’s work required here to get Twitter to sort of a stable position and to really build the engine of software engineering.""Musk also sought to portray his takeover of San Francisco-based Twitter as a cultural correction. Since taking over the company, he's restored Donald Trump's access to the platform after the then-president lost access to the website after a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Musk also reinstated the accounts of several people who spread misinformation about the coronavirus, including that of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.“I think that the general idea is just to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of essentially San Francisco and Berkeley, which are so somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world,"" Musk said. ""And, you know, Twitter was, I think, doing a little too much to impose a niche.”Musk's takeover at Twitter has seen mass firings and other cost-cutting measures. Musk, who is on the hook for about $1 billion in yearly interest payments for his purchase, has been trying to find way to maximize profits at the company.However, some of Musk's decisions have conflicted with the reasons that journalists, governments and others rely on Twitter as an information-sharing platform.Musk on Wednesday described the need for users to rely on Twitter for trusted information from verified accounts. However, a confused rollout to a paid verified account system saw some impersonate famous companies, leading to a further withdrawal of needed advertising cash to the site.“Twitter is certainly quite the rollercoaster,” Musk acknowledged.Forbes estimates Musk's wealth at just under $200 billion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810832,Kuzma returns from injury and Wizards top Blazers 126-101,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Kyle Kuzma returned from an ankle sprain and scored 33 points, making six 3-pointers, to lead the Washington Wizards to a 126-101 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night. 

            Kristaps Porzingis added 28 points and 12 rebounds for the Wizards, who have won three of their last four games. 

             “We’re making strides. I think we did a good job,"" Kuzma said. “I think the biggest way — we talk about efficiency — is just the way we were playing, playing the right way, playing extra pass basketball, moving the ball around. That’s going to cause a lot of efficient nights because you’re getting quality shots.” 











            Afterward, Kuzma posted to Twitter: “Feels good to be back hoopin.”

            Damian Lillard had 39 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Blazers. Anfernee Simons added 17 points but sprained his right ankle late in the third quarter and had to be helped to the locker room. Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said X-rays were negative. 

            “Once I saw him stay down, I was definitely concerned. That makes things tougher for us,"" Lillard said. 

            The Blazers were already playing without Jerami Grant because of the concussion protocol and big man Jusuf Nurkic, out with a left calf strain. 

            The final margin was the Wizards' biggest lead of the second half. Cam Reddish made a 3-pointer that had the Blazers within 105-90 with 8:11 left. Shaedon Sharpe got Portland closer at 107-97 with 5:14 to go. 

            A series of calls against the Blazers, including a flagrant foul and a technical on Lillard, stalled Portland's momentum. It was the first flagrant foul of Lillard's career. 

            Both teams were playing the second of back-to-backs. 

            
                The Blazers hit 23 3-pointers in a 127-115 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without NBA career scoring leader LeBron James.
                The Wizards fell 135-126 at the Golden State Warriors. 
              

            The newest Blazers, Reddish and Matisse Thybulle, started together for the second straight game after both were acquired at last week's trade deadline. 

            Kuzma, who missed four games with a left ankle sprain, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Wizards a 31-24 lead at the end of the first quarter, but Lillard hit a 3-pointer from nearly half court at the buzzer. 

            Lillard crashed into some sideline seats chasing a ball midway through the second quarter and came up limping, but he walked off any discomfort. 

            Kuzma had 19 points and the Wizards led 59-52 at the break. They shot 60.5% from the floor in the opening half. 

            Bradley Beal's 3-pointer gave the Wizards a 72-60 lead in the third quarter. They led 97-80 going into the final quarter. Kuzma hit a three-quarter court 3 at the buzzer. 

             “I took some extra time (off from the injury) and I thought I thought that was really, really worth it for me to come out and play the type of game I did today,"" said Kuzma, who missed his first three shots but then made his next six. “Just feeling healthy. Felt good.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810833,"Leonard's 33 points lead Clippers over Warriors, 134-124","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Clippers have 22 games remaining to integrate their trade deadline acquisitions. They didn't waste any time.

            
                Kawhi Leonard scored 33 points, tying his career high with seven 3-pointers, and the Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors 134-124 on Tuesday night to snap a two-game skid.

            “The Clippers just outplayed us,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “They were great in the second half and they deserved it.”











            Norman Powell added 24 points and Paul George had 20 points and eight assists for the Clippers, who debuted newly acquired Eric Gordon, Bones Hyland and Mason Plumlee. They helped outscore the Warriors’ bench, 49-42. 

            “It’s going to be different for us,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We got to put this together as fast as we can.” 

            Gordon finished with seven points, Hyland had six and Plumlee scored eight in the teams’ last game before the All-Star break.

            “They did a good job of just being themselves and being aggressive,” Leonard said. 

            Leonard was 12 of 17 from the floor, 7 of 9 from 3-point range and made both of his free throws in 34 minutes. 

            “I kept shooting with confidence,” he said.

            
                Jordan Poole led seven Warriors in double figures with 28 points. Klay Thompson had 18 points playing the second game of a back-to-back for the first time this season. Kevon Looney had 11 points and 14 rebounds.

            The Warriors fell to 29-29 at the break. They hope to have Stephen Curry back not long after the season resumes, while newly acquired Gary Payton II could be out a month.

            “We have reinforcements coming and we have a lot to look forward to,” Kerr said. “We have lost so many games that we should have won. We know we’re right there.”

            Gordon's 3-pointer extended the Clippers' lead to 18 points early in the fourth. The Warriors cut it to 116-106 on Jonathan Kuminga's 3-pointer. He finished with 16 points off the bench.

            Leonard hit his seventh 3-pointer in the closing minutes before leaving the game with the Clippers ahead 128-114.

            The teams traded leads and were tied five times early in the third. The Clippers outscored the Warriors 19-7 over the final minutes to lead 105-93 going into the fourth. Leonard and George had just two points each while their supporting cast carried them. Plumlee had six points and Hyland had two during the run in which seven different players scored. 

            “With this offense, I feel like I can create in the lane and find teammates,” Hyland said. “I forgot Mason can push the ball, too.”

            The Warriors had four players in double figures at halftime when they led 65-61.

            TIP-INS

            Warriors: Thompson missed 11 games, all second games of back-to-backs, due to right Achilles tendon injury management. ... Andrew Wiggins was out for personal reasons and will rejoin the team after the All-Star break. Donte DiVincenzo started in his place and scored 10 points. ... Kerr got a technical late in the third for arguing a call. ... Andre Iguodala (right hip soreness) missed his 16th straight game. 

            Clippers: Hyland will run the point for the second unit. “Just watching him, the pop he has, running pick and rolls, getting downhill, attacking and making the right passes, making the right plays,” Lue said. 

            GREEN'S CRITIQUE

            
                Draymond Green was critical of the Warriors' defense, something that has concerned Kerr all season.

            “Defense is all about a will — a want to defend. Defense isn’t fun. You just got to want to do it if you want to win and we haven’t,” Green said. “I'm always going to try on that side, but I can be better. I'm not going to point the finger at anyone or point blame. If you’re a leader at something and you’re failing, it’s your fault.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810873,'Our own dynasty': Kansas City fetes latest Super Bowl win,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce promised thousands of fans celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl championship Wednesday that the team will be back for more. 

            During a boisterous victory rally at downtown's Union Station after a parade, Mahomes and Kelce joked about “experts” who predicted the just-concluded NFL season would be a rebuilding year for the Chiefs, who defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 on Sunday. 

            “We're back again, we're back again,” Mahomes, the NFL's regular season and Super Bowl MVP, told thousands of cheering fans clad in the Chiefs' red and gold team colors. 











            “When we started this season the AFC West said we were rebuilding,"" Mahomes said. ""I'll be honest with you, I don't know what rebuilding means. In our rebuilding year, we're world champs, we're world champs.”

            Kelce noted that some ""haters” predicted the Chiefs wouldn't even make the playoffs. 

            “In all reality, this was this best season of my life,” Kelce said. “I owe it to (the fans), I owe it to the guys on this stage, I owe it to everybody in Chiefs Kingdom and the organization we've been able to create.”

            Celebrating his second Super Bowl win with the Chiefs, coach Andy Reid told the crowd that “there's no place you'd rather be, and no greater place to be than right here, baby. ... Not very often are you able to say you're the greatest team in the world, you have the greatest players in the world, have the greatest organization in the world and, most of all, the greatest fans in the world.""

            The rally festivites wrapped up a day that began with some fans who slept overnight — and others arriving before sunrise —to get a prime spot downtown to celebrate the Chiefs' second Super Bowl championship in four NFL seasons. 

            Players, coaches, team officials, family members and others rode double-decker buses past legions of fans, sometimes standing up to 10 people deep, as the parade rolled down a main downtown street on the way to the Union Station rally. 

            Many players got off the buses to dance, sign autographs, take selfies and occasionally hand out beers to supporters along the route. Some lucky fans were able to touch the Lombardi Trophy, which denoted the Chiefs' win.

            Most schools, many businesses and some government offices in the Kansas City metro area were closed to allow fans to enjoy the festivities. Most were in good spirits while waiting in long lines for food trucks, merchandise trucks and, of course, portable toilets. Police did not immediately report any major problems during the event.

            After decades of championship drought, the city is gaining experience with victory parades. Four seasons ago, the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers for the team’s first Super Bowl championship in 50 years. That followed the Kansas City Royals winning the World Series in 2015, the city’s first baseball championship in 30 years. 

            Shellie Diehl, 46, of Kansas City, was seated about a block from Union Station, joined by her 8-year-old daughter, Skyler; 16-year-old daughter, Taylor; and a friend. Diehl said she came to the Chiefs parade in 2020 and decided to have mother-daughter time on Wednesday while celebrating Skyler's first parade.

            “The last one was so much fun, we decided we had to come to this one,” Diehl said. “We're big Chiefs fans, and we wanted to celebrate a great day with the community.”

            Some fans admitted that Kansas City might be getting a little spoiled.

            “Kind of getting used to it, but that's OK,” said Liz Barber, 50, of Shawnee, Kansas. “It is good.”

            “We had a 50-year-drought, so it’s about time we had our own dynasty,” said David Cordray, 38, of Kansas City.

            Some 25 Chiefs fans who arrived about 6 a.m. cooked up a breakfast feast, complete with corn on the cob, bacon and potatoes and all the trimmings — and they had steaks ready for later in the day. Dominic Zamora, 18, said the group of friends were continuing a tailgating tradition at Chiefs games. 

            “With Mahomes, there's more to come,” Zamora said. “It's going to be fun, and I'm excited to show up.""

            Manuel Palacio, 48, was dressed in a cow's suit in a tribute to Kansas City's “Cowtown” nickname. He said he was a longtime Buffalo Bills fan who converted to the Chiefs after losing a bet with a Chiefs fan.

            “I had to convert,” Palacio said. “It's like being an Oakland Raiders fan; at some point you have to cheer for the team who keeps winning,” he said, laughing.

            Officials began planning the parade weeks before the Chiefs defeated the Eagles  on a field goal with 8 seconds remaining in the game. Kansas City police said about 675 law enforcement officers from more than 20 agencies, along with fire departments and transportation officials, were deployed for Wednesday's event. 

            The City Council Transportation and Infrastructure Committee earmarked $750,000 for parade-related expenses, while Mayor Quinton Lucas estimated overtime costs for police and firefighters would total more than $1.5 million. The Kansas City Sports Commission was expected to contribute another $1 million in private donations for parade expenses and sponsorships, and the Jackson County Legislature voted to add $75,000.

            This story has been updated to correct that it's Kansas City’s second championship in four seasons, not in two years.KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce promised thousands of fans celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl championship Wednesday that the team will be back for more.During a boisterous victory rally at downtown's Union Station after a parade, Mahomes and Kelce joked about “experts” who predicted the just-concluded NFL season would be a rebuilding year for the Chiefs, who defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 on Sunday.“We're back again, we're back again,” Mahomes, the NFL's regular season and Super Bowl MVP, told thousands of cheering fans clad in the Chiefs' red and gold team colors.“When we started this season the AFC West said we were rebuilding,"" Mahomes said. ""I'll be honest with you, I don't know what rebuilding means. In our rebuilding year, we're world champs, we're world champs.”Kelce noted that some ""haters” predicted the Chiefs wouldn't even make the playoffs.“In all reality, this was this best season of my life,” Kelce said. “I owe it to (the fans), I owe it to the guys on this stage, I owe it to everybody in Chiefs Kingdom and the organization we've been able to create.”Celebrating his second Super Bowl win with the Chiefs, coach Andy Reid told the crowd that “there's no place you'd rather be, and no greater place to be than right here, baby. ... Not very often are you able to say you're the greatest team in the world, you have the greatest players in the world, have the greatest organization in the world and, most of all, the greatest fans in the world.""The rally festivites wrapped up a day that began with some fans who slept overnight — and others arriving before sunrise —to get a prime spot downtown to celebrate the Chiefs' second Super Bowl championship in four NFL seasons.Players, coaches, team officials, family members and others rode double-decker buses past legions of fans, sometimes standing up to 10 people deep, as the parade rolled down a main downtown street on the way to the Union Station rally.Many players got off the buses to dance, sign autographs, take selfies and occasionally hand out beers to supporters along the route. Some lucky fans were able to touch the Lombardi Trophy, which denoted the Chiefs' win.Most schools, many businesses and some government offices in the Kansas City metro area were closed to allow fans to enjoy the festivities. Most were in good spirits while waiting in long lines for food trucks, merchandise trucks and, of course, portable toilets. Police did not immediately report any major problems during the event.After decades of championship drought, the city is gaining experience with victory parades. Four seasons ago, the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers for the team’s first Super Bowl championship in 50 years. That followed the Kansas City Royals winning the World Series in 2015, the city’s first baseball championship in 30 years.Shellie Diehl, 46, of Kansas City, was seated about a block from Union Station, joined by her 8-year-old daughter, Skyler; 16-year-old daughter, Taylor; and a friend. Diehl said she came to the Chiefs parade in 2020 and decided to have mother-daughter time on Wednesday while celebrating Skyler's first parade.“The last one was so much fun, we decided we had to come to this one,” Diehl said. “We're big Chiefs fans, and we wanted to celebrate a great day with the community.”Some fans admitted that Kansas City might be getting a little spoiled.“Kind of getting used to it, but that's OK,” said Liz Barber, 50, of Shawnee, Kansas. “It is good.”“We had a 50-year-drought, so it’s about time we had our own dynasty,” said David Cordray, 38, of Kansas City.Some 25 Chiefs fans who arrived about 6 a.m. cooked up a breakfast feast, complete with corn on the cob, bacon and potatoes and all the trimmings — and they had steaks ready for later in the day.

            “I thought his confidence (was high). You could just see it from the drop of the puck,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""I think that’s contagious. I think it rubs off on the group in front of him.”

            The Penguins' top line of Sidney Crosby, Jake Guentzel and Rickard Rakell each had three points. Crosby had three assists, giving him 41 this season. 











            Guentzel scored twice, including an empty-netter. Rakell had the first Pittsburgh goal. 

            “I think we worked hard. It was nice to get rewarded. It wasn’t always pretty tonight, but it was nice to get the win,"" Rakell said.

            Timo Meier scored his 31st goal late in the third period for the Sharks. Aaron Dell made 24 saves in his third start for San Jose this season. He has yet to earn a win. 

            “He played great. He’s an NHL-caliber goaltender,"" Sharks captain Logan Couture said. ""There’s a reason he’s played, I don’t know how many games in this league. He’s got the skill to do it.”

            Erik Karlsson and Alexander Barabanov both had their four-game point streaks snapped.

            Pittsburgh took the lead early, with Rakell jumping on a juicy rebound 5:52 into the first period for his 19th goal of the season. 

            In the second, Crosby faked out the entire arena by going behind the net and throwing a no-look backhand pass to Guentzel, who had a wide-open net. It was Guentzel's 22nd goal of the season. 

            “Just got to be ready when you’re with him. He made a nice play to make everyone fake, and it’s pretty easy for (me),"" Guentzel said.

            Meier scored on a rush the full length of the ice and beat DeSmith through the legs with 4:03 to go.

            “He’s an elite player in this league. And he’s a very difficult guy to contain. He had some chances tonight,"" Sharks coach David Quinn said. ""That’s a big-time goal and a power forward goal.""

            Guentzel added an empty-net goal to seal it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810877,Upset Ohio town residents seek answers over train derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Residents of the Ohio village upended by a freight train derailment packed a school gym on Wednesday to seek answers about whether they were safe from toxic chemicals that spilled or were burned off.

            Hundreds of worried people gathered to hear state officials tell them — as they did earlier in the day — that testing so far has shown local air is safe to breathe and to promise that safety testing of the air and water would continue.

            But residents had many questions over health hazards and they demanded more transparency from the railroad operator, Norfolk Southern, which did not attend the gathering, citing safety concerns for its staff.











            “They just danced around the questions a lot,"" said Danielle Deal, who lives about three miles from the derailment site. “Norfolk needed to be here.”

            In a statement, Norfolk Southern said it was not attending Wednesday's open house gathering with local, state and federal officials because of a “growing physical threat to our employees and members of the community around this event.""

            Deal called that a “copout"" and noted the seriousness of the incident.

            Deal and her two children left home to stay with her mother, 13 miles away “and we could still see the mushroom cloud, plain as day,” she said.

            Wednesday's meeting came amid continuing concerns about the huge plumes of smoke, persisting odors, questions over potential threats to pets and wild animals, any potential impact on drinking water and what was happening with cleanup. 

            Even as school resumed and trains were rolling again, people were worried. 

            “Why are they being hush-hush?"" Kathy Dyke said of the railroad. “They’re not out here supporting, they’re not out here answering questions. For three days we didn’t even know what was on the train.""

            “I have three grandbabies,” she said. “Are they going to grow up here in five years and have cancer? So those are all factors that play on my mind.”

            In and around East Palestine, near the Pennsylvania state line, residents said they wanted assistance navigating the financial help the railroad offered hundreds of families who evacuated, and they want to know whether it will be held responsible for what happened.

            Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost advised Norfolk Southern on Wednesday that his office is considering legal action against the rail operator. 

            “The pollution, which continues to contaminate the area around East Palestine, created a nuisance, damage to natural resources and caused environmental harm,” Yost said in a letter to the company.

            The state's Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that the latest tests show water from five wells supplying the village's drinking water are free from contaminants. But the EPA also is recommending testing for private water wells because they are closer to the surface.

            The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimates the spill affected more than seven miles (11.2 kilometers) of streams and killed some 3,500 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows and darters.

            There hadn’t been any confirmed deaths of other wildlife, including livestock, state officials said. 

            Norfolk Southern announced Tuesday that it is creating a $1 million fund to help the community of some 4,700 people while continuing remediation work, including removing spilled contaminants from the ground and streams and monitoring air quality. 

            It also will expand how many residents can be reimbursed for their evacuation costs, covering the entire village and surrounding area.

            “We will be judged by our actions,"" Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw said in a statement. ""We are cleaning up the site in an environmentally responsible way, reimbursing residents affected by the derailment, and working with members of the community to identify what is needed to help East Palestine recover and thrive.”

            No one was injured when about 50 cars derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of East Palestine on Feb. 3. As fears grew about a potential explosion, officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast had the area evacuated and opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke billowing into the sky again. 

            A mechanical issue with a rail car axle is suspected to be the cause of the derailment, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it has video appearing to show a wheel bearing overheating just beforehand. The NTSB said it expects its preliminary report in about two weeks.

            
                Misinformation and exaggerations spread online, and state and federal officials have repeatedly offered assurances that air monitoring hasn't detected any remaining concerns. Even low levels of contaminants that aren’t considered hazardous can create lingering odors or symptoms such as headaches, Ohio’s health director said Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810878,It was 'haunting': Ballard recalls mission to Titanic site,"FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — The sheer size of the vessel and the shoes were what struck Robert Ballard when he descended to the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in 1986, the year after he and his crew from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution helped find the ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.

            “The first thing I saw coming out of the gloom at 30 feet was this wall, this giant wall of riveted steel that rose over 100 and some feet above us,” he said in an interview from Connecticut on Wednesday, the same day the WHOI released on 80 minutes of never before publicly seen underwater video of the expedition to the wreckage.

            “I never looked down at the Titanic. I looked up at the Titanic. Nothing was small,” he said.











            The crew of Alvin, the three-person submersible he was in, headed to the surface when it started taking water into its batteries, and as it rose Ballard saw the Titanic's portholes.

            “It was like people looking back at us. It was pretty haunting actually,” he said.

            There were no human flesh or bones left, but he saw shoes, including the footwear of what appeared to be a mother and a baby, that looked like tombstones marking the spot where some of the roughly 1,500 people who perished came to rest on the ocean floor.

            “After the Titanic sank, those that went into the water that didn’t have lifejackets died of hypothermia and their bodies came raining down,” he said.

            The liner sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City after hitting an iceberg in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912.

            The WHOI team, in partnership with the French oceanographic exploration organization Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, discovered the final resting place of the ship in 12,400 feet (3,780 meters) of water on Sept. 1, 1985, using a towed underwater camera.

            The newly released footage was from a return expedition the following year.

            There had been prior efforts to find the wreck. But the 1985 discovery and the 1986 trip were made possible by sophisticated underwater vehicles that could withstand the unforgiving conditions, said WHOI engineer Andy Bowen, who helped develop them.

            Ballard said he went through the gamut of emotions during the 1985 mission.

            He was concerned that the public would figure out that he was a Naval intelligence officer who was on a top secret Cold War mission funded by the Navy to study the wrecks of two nuclear submarines that had also gone down in the North Atlantic.

            The ship sank at about 2:20 a.m. The 1985 discovery using the underwater camera occurred at about 2 a.m.

            Ballard recalled one of the crew glancing at the clock and saying: “She sinks in 20 minutes.""

            “We actually stopped the operation and raised the vehicle to gather my thoughts and I said, ‘I’m going to go outside and just get myself back together' and everyone else followed,"" he said. “We had a small memorial service for all those that had died. But we were there, we were at this spot.""

            It was hallowed ground, like at the Gettysburg battlefield, he said.

            The video, much of it haunting and grainy interiors of the ship taken by the remotely-operated underwater exploration vehicle Jason Jr., is being released in conjunction with the 25th anniversary release on Feb. 10 of the remastered version of the Academy Award-winning movie, “Titanic."" 

            “More than a century after the loss of Titanic, the human stories embodied in the great ship continue to resonate,” James Cameron, the film's director, said in a statement. “Like many, I was transfixed when Alvin and Jason Jr. ventured down to and inside the wreck. By releasing this footage, WHOI is helping tell an important part of a story that spans generations and circles the globe.”

            The story of the Titanic fascinates people to this day for many reasons, Ballard said. It was at the time the world's largest ocean liner and was supposed to be virtually unsinkable.

            Associated Press writer Mark Pratt reported from Boston.FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — The sheer size of the vessel and the shoes were what struck Robert Ballard when he descended to the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in 1986, the year after he and his crew from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution helped find the ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.“The first thing I saw coming out of the gloom at 30 feet was this wall, this giant wall of riveted steel that rose over 100 and some feet above us,” he said in an interview from Connecticut on Wednesday, the same day the WHOI released on 80 minutes of never before publicly seen underwater video of the expedition to the wreckage.“I never looked down at the Titanic. I looked up at the Titanic. Nothing was small,” he said.The crew of Alvin, the three-person submersible he was in, headed to the surface when it started taking water into its batteries, and as it rose Ballard saw the Titanic's portholes.“It was like people looking back at us. It was pretty haunting actually,” he said.There were no human flesh or bones left, but he saw shoes, including the footwear of what appeared to be a mother and a baby, that looked like tombstones marking the spot where some of the roughly 1,500 people who perished came to rest on the ocean floor.“After the Titanic sank, those that went into the water that didn’t have lifejackets died of hypothermia and their bodies came raining down,” he said.The liner sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City after hitting an iceberg in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912.The WHOI team, in partnership with the French oceanographic exploration organization Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, discovered the final resting place of the ship in 12,400 feet (3,780 meters) of water on Sept. 1, 1985, using a towed underwater camera.The newly released footage was from a return expedition the following year.There had been prior efforts to find the wreck. But the 1985 discovery and the 1986 trip were made possible by sophisticated underwater vehicles that could withstand the unforgiving conditions, said WHOI engineer Andy Bowen, who helped develop them.“The water is near freezing temperatures and probably the biggest challenge is the remoteness of the location, and in particular the harsh environment with regard to the pressure our equipment is exposed to,” he said.Ballard said he went through the gamut of emotions during the 1985 mission.He was concerned that the public would figure out that he was a Naval intelligence officer who was on a top secret Cold War mission funded by the Navy to study the wrecks of two nuclear submarines that had also gone down in the North Atlantic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810879,Asian shares jump boosted by a strong reading on US retail,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares edged higher Thursday, cheered by a stronger than expected reading on U.S. retail sales that set off a rally on Wall Street. 

            In the latest data on the regional economy, Japan's trade deficit reached a record 3.497 trillion yen ($26.2 billion) in January. Imports for the world’s third largest economy jumped amid higher raw material and energy costs, and a weak yen. Exports rose 3.5%. 

            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.7% in morning trading to 27,705.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7% to 7,406.70. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.7% to 2,469.63. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 2.1% to 21,241.94, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.7% to 3,304.77. 











            “Asian equities were higher on Thursday after a positive day on Wall Street, where price action was driven by strong retail sales in the US, which signaled a hot economy at the start of the year,” Anderson Alves at ActivTrades said in a report.

            Japanese machinery orders for December returned to growth after contracting in the previous month.

            The total value of machinery orders received by 280 manufacturers in Japan, a key indicator for private sector investment, rose a seasonally adjusted 6.5% in December from the month before.

            On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% to 4,417.60 after swinging from early losses to gains through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 34,128.05, while the Nasdaq composite rose a more forceful 0.9% to 12,070.59.

            Sales at U.S. retailers jumped by more last month than expected, even as shoppers contended with higher interest rates on credit cards and other loans. The surprising strength offers hope that the most important part of the U.S. economy, consumer spending, will remain resilient despite worries about a possible recession. It’s the latest piece of data to show the economy remains stronger than feared. 

            At the same time, though, the strong demand could add more fuel to inflation, leading the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high. A report earlier this week showed prices are cooling less than expected. 

            “Will it lead to that traditional recession or a shallow recession, or will we power through it and have more strong growth with still-high rates?"" asked Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.""

            “It seems like both consumers and corporate America came into this in pretty good shape and so far are holding out OK,"" he said. 

            After Tuesday’s data on inflation was slightly hotter than expected, economists at Deutsche Bank raised their forecast for how high the Fed will take its key overnight interest rate. They now see it ultimately rising to 5.6%, up from their prior forecast of 5.1%. 

            The Fed has already pulled its overnight rate all the way to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero a year ago. 

            The Deutsche Bank economists said they still expect a recession, but that the near-term strength in the economy could push its timing into the last three months of the year, later than they earlier thought. 

            Many other traders have also been raising their forecasts for how high the Fed will ultimately take interest rates. They’ve also sharply reduced bets for the Fed to cut rates late this year. 

            Even still, stocks are hanging onto healthy gains for the year despite recent rockiness. The S&P 500 is up 8% as strong data build hope that the economy may be able to avoid a recession. Or, if one hits, perhaps it may be only a short and shallow one. 

            The next big milestone for the market will likely be the Fed's meeting in late March, when policy makers will give their latest forecasts for where interest rates will be at the end of the year, Hainlin said. That could lead to choppy trading in markets until then, as investors try to guess which way it will go.

            On Wall Street, shares of Airbnb jumped 13.4% Wednesday after reporting stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than analysts expected. On the losing end were stocks of energy producers, which fell 1.8% for the worst performance by far of the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500.

            One of the sharpest drops came from Devon Energy, which fell 10.5% after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected.

            This earnings reporting season has been muted, with many companies reporting pressure on their profits from higher costs and interest rates. 

            In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 43 cents to $79.02 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 47 cents to $78.59 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, rose 38 cents to $85.76 a barrel. 

            In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 133.76 Japanese yen from 134.16 yen. The euro cost $1.0707, up from $1.0690.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810880,Governments target medical debt with COVID relief funds,"Millions of Americans mired in medical debt face difficult financial decisions every day — pay the debt or pay for rent, utilities and groceries. Some may even skip necessary health care for fear of sinking deeper into debt.

            To address the problem, an increasing number of municipal, county and state governments are devising plans to spend federal coronavirus pandemic relief funds to eliminate residents' medical debt and ease those debt burdens.

            The City Council in the Boston suburb of Somerville last month unanimously passed a resolution to spend $200,000 of the city's $77 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding that could clear as much as $4.3 million in medical debt, said Willie Burnley Jr., one of the city councilors behind the effort. As many 5,000 of the city's 80,000 residents could benefit.











            Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, and Pittsburgh, New Orleans and Toledo, Ohio, are among more than a dozen communities that have set into motion or are considering similar plans. Democratic Connecticut governor Ned Lamont last week proposed spending $20 million in ARPA funds to eliminate as much as $2 billion in state residents' medical debts.

            Unlike credit card or loan debt, medical debt is not a choice, advocates said.

            “Medical debt is something that people can’t help and it’s not their fault,” Burnley said. “No one chooses to get hurt or to get sick.”

            Somerville resident Virginia Faust has health insurance, but she still fell several thousand dollars into debt in 2021 when a mental health emergency required a weeklong hospital stay. The debt affected her credit, and in a cruel irony, put additional stress on her mental health.

            “This would have a tangible effect on my life and relieve a lot of stress,"" Faust, 25, said of Burnley's plan. “It would mean I would be more likely to go to a doctor and get regular checkups.""

            In Toledo, a combined $1.6 million from the city and Lucas County will eliminate as much as $240 million in medical debt for as many as 41,000 residents, according to Ohio state Rep. Michele Grim, who drove the effort when she served as a Toledo city councilor.

            “It’s such a great return on investment,” she said. “I really couldn’t think of a better way to use dollars that were meant to aid in the economic recovery of our citizens.”

            The cities and states are teaming up with RIP Medical Debt, a New York-based nonprofit that since 2014 has used donations to buy huge bundles of debt from hospitals and other health care providers at pennies on the dollar and pay it off. A single donated dollar erases an average of $100 of debt.

            More than 40% of American adults have medical debt and about two-thirds of personal bankruptcies in the nation cite medical debt as a leading cause, said Allison Sesso, president and CEO of the nonprofit.

            The money is coming from the federal government’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, which included $360 billion for local, state, territorial and tribal governments to provide economic relief.

            “This is one of the most impactful and direct ways we can use this money and it would have incredible and quantifiable benefits,” Burnley said.

            Eligibility requirements can vary, but to be eligible in Somerville for the debt relief through RIP Medical Debt, individuals or families can have a household income of up to 400% of the federal poverty — that’s $111,000 annually for a family of four according to federal statistics — or have medical debts that exceed 5% of their annual income.

            There is no need to apply. RIP Medical Debt determines eligibility and the beneficiaries get a letter informing them that their debt has been acquired and canceled. Not everyone will benefit. People whose debt continues to be held by for-profit collection agencies may miss out.

            Unlike federal student loan debt relief, medical debt relief has more widespread and bipartisan support. According to a recent survey by Tulchin Research, more than 70% of Americans support medical debt relief, while only about half of Americans support student loan debt relief. The survey of 1,500 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

            Since it's founding, RIP Medical Debt has raised enough money to eliminate more than $8.5 billion of debt for nearly 5.5 million people. But that's barely a dent in the total number of people facing tough money choices.

            A 2021 study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association determined that Americans have $140 billion in unpaid health care bills at collection agencies alone, and that debt disproportionately affects the poor.

            Although it's a good cause, using ARPA funds to discharge medical debt does not address the underlying systemic problem, said Ray Kluender, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School and one of the study's co-authors.

            Medical debt is a “byproduct of the patchwork way we pay for health care,” he said.

            “While relieving debts after they have gone through the provider collections process won’t address the issues driving the accumulation of these unpaid bills in the first place, it may nevertheless help people who are struggling to pay back their bills,"" he said.Millions of Americans mired in medical debt face difficult financial decisions every day — pay the debt or pay for rent, utilities and groceries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810906,"Eddie Jones at Super Rugby season launch, already scouting","SYDNEY (AP) — Eddie Jones is already in Rugby World Cup selection mode.

            The launch Wednesday was for Australia’s five franchises in the Super Rugby Pacific competition, which kicks off next week.

            One of the main topics, though, was the global tournament in France starting in September. With just five test matches on Australia's schedule ahead of that, Jones will be using player form for their clubs in Super Rugby Pacific as a basis for selection in his first months back into the job as Wallabies head coach.











            Stephen Larkham, who won the World Cup in 1999 and was part of the squad that Jones guided to the final in 2003, is coaching the Canberra-based Brumbies for this Super Rugby Pacific season. He said Jones would be keeping the players “on edge” when it comes to World Cup selection.

            “It’s going to be a challenge for the guys who probably thought they were secured of a spot for the World Cup,” Larkham told Australian Associated Press at the SRP launch. ""Eddie is one of those coaches that really looks at a player’s performance with a fine-tooth comb and he does a lot of background checking on his players.

            “The players aren’t going to be cognizant of what Eddie is looking for, but at some stage he’ll definitely be giving them feedback.”

            Larkham's Brumbies will take on the New South Wales Waratahs on Feb. 24 in one of a series of first-round derbies, with the Christchurch-based Crusaders against the Hamilton-based Chiefs earlier that day. The Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika will meet at Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand on Feb. 25, kicking off a day that features the Highlanders against the Blues, the Queensland Reds hosting the Wellington-based Hurricanes and Melbourne Rebels traveling to Perth to play Western Force.

            Brumbies prop Allan Alaalatoa is a frontrunner for one of the 33 places in the Wallabies squad for the World Cup, and he thinks having Jones closely monitoring every game will be a motivation for Australian players.

            “I think you’ll see a lift across the board in a World Cup year,” Alaalatoa said. “With a new coach, there’s a lot of positions up for grabs.

            “There’s definitely nerves because you’re unsure, but there’s an excitement in having a coach who knows how to win.”

            Jones' first test at home in his second stint as Australia’s head coach will be against Argentina in Sydney on July 15, two weeks before the Wallabies host the New Zealand All Blacks in Melbourne.

            Australia’s opening test of the season will be against World Cup champion South Africa in Pretoria on July 8. 

            The 63-year-old Jones coached the Wallabies to the World Cup final in 2003, which they lost to England, before being fired in 2005.

            He’s back in charge until 2027 after replacing Dave Rennie, who led the Wallabies to wins in just five of 14 test matches in 2022.

            Rennie was contracted though until the end of the World Cup, which starts on Sept. 8, but Rugby Australia officials moved to sign Jones when he was fired as England head coach in December after a poor recent run in England — a 2022 record of six losses, one draw and five wins in 12 tests.

            Jones won the Six Nations three times with England and racked up 18 straight wins through his mostly successful tenure, which included multiple wins over the Wallabies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810907,Report: Saudi Binladin Group fined over 2015 crane collapse,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A criminal court has imposed a $5.3 million fine on the Saudi BinLadin Group and sentenced seven people to prison over the deadly collapse of a crane ahead of the 2015 hajj pilgrimage, a leading Saudi daily reported. 

            More than 100 people were killed in the incident. Buffetted by strong winds, the 1,350-ton crane collapsed onto the Grand Mosque that houses Islam’s holiest site, the cube-shaped Kaaba, bringing down slabs of concrete on worshippers below. Less than two weeks after the Sept. 11 crane collapse, a stampede and crush of pilgrims killed more than 2,400 people, according to an Associated Press count.

            The Okaz daily reported Tuesday that the company was fined 20 million Saudi riyals, or about $5.3 million, for negligence and violation of safety regulations. Three defendants were sentenced to six months in jail and fined 30,000 riyals ($8,000) and another four were sentenced to three months and fined 15,000 riyals (about $4,000). Okaz did not report their names or nationalities.











            The court ruled that the company is not required to pay blood money to the families of those killed, a traditional form of restitution in the conservative kingdom.

            The Saudi Binladin Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects. Al-Qaida’s late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.

            The verdict comes as Saudi Arabia prepares to host the first hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Millions of Muslims are expected to make the pilgrimage in late June, which in normal years is among the largest gatherings of people on earth.

            The twin disasters in 2015 were a source of embarrassment for the Saudi royal family, whose legitimacy partly derives from their role as the custodians of Islam's holiest sites.

            At the time, King Salman partly blamed the crane's collapse on the construction giant, saying its arm should not have been left up when it was not in use.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A criminal court has imposed a $5.3 million fine on the Saudi BinLadin Group and sentenced seven people to prison over the deadly collapse of a crane ahead of the 2015 hajj pilgrimage, a leading Saudi daily reported.More than 100 people were killed in the incident.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810925,"India, soon world's most populous nation, doesn't know how many people it has","NEW DELHI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - In two months, India is projected to become the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people. But for at least a year, and possibly longer, the country won't know how many people it has because it hasn't been able to count them.India's once in a decade census, due in 2021 and delayed due to the pandemic, has now got bogged down by technical and logistical hurdles and there are no signs the mammoth exercise is likely to begin soon.Experts say the delay in updating data like employment, housing, literacy levels, migration patterns and infant mortality, which are captured by the census, affects social and economic planning and policy making in the huge Asian economy.Calling census data ""indispensable"", Rachna Sharma, a fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said studies like the consumption expenditure survey and the periodic labour force survey are estimations based on information from the census.""In the absence of latest census data, the estimations are based on data that is one decade old and is likely to provide estimates that are far from reality,"" Sharma said.A senior official at the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation said census data from 2011, when the count was last conducted, was being used for projections and estimates required to assess government spending.A spokesman for the ministry said its role was limited to providing the best possible projections and could not comment on the census process. The Prime Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment.Two other government officials, one from the federal home (interior) ministry and another from the office of the Registrar General of India, said the delay was largely due to the government's decision to fine-tune the census process and make it foolproof with the help of technology.The home ministry official said the software that will be used to gather census data on a mobile phone app has to be synchronised with existing identity databases, including the national identity card, called Aadhaar, which was taking time.The office of the Registrar General of India, which is responsible for the census, did not respond to a request for comment.The main opposition Congress party and critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have accused the government of delaying the census to hide data on politically sensitive issues, such as unemployment, ahead of national elections due in 2024.""This government has often displayed its open rivalry with data,"" said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera. ""On important matters like employment, Covid deaths etc., we have seen how the Modi government has preferred to cloak critical data.”The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's national spokesperson, Gopal Krishna Agarwal, dismissed the criticism.""I want to know on what basis they are saying this. Which is the social parameter on which our performance in nine years is worse than their 65 years?"" he said, referring to the Congress party's years in power.TEACHERS' TRAVAILSThe United Nations has projected India's population could touch 1,425,775,850 on April 14, overtaking China on that day.The 2011 census had put India's population at 1.21 billion, meaning the country has added 210 million, or almost the number of people in Brazil, to its population in 12 years.India's census is conducted by about 330,000 government school teachers who first go door-to-door listing all houses across the country and then return to them with a second list of questions.They ask more than two dozen questions each time in 16 languages in the two phases that will be spread over 11 months, according to the plan made for 2021.The numbers will be tabulated and final data made public months later. The entire exercise was estimated to cost 87.5 billion rupees ($1.05 billion) in 2019.However, teachers have returned to school after the pandemic disruption and have to conduct nine state elections in 2023 and national elections in 2024 besides the census and this would again disrupt teaching. Payments have also become an issue.Arvind Mishra, a senior official at the All-India Primary Teachers Federation which counts 2.3 million members, said teachers are bound by law to help conduct elections and the census but government must increase the fees they receive.""They must roll out a systematic payment mechanism for the drill,"" said Mishra. ""Teachers deserve respect and they can't be running around demanding reimbursement for conducting the largest counting exercise on earth.""A former top official of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the government agency that runs the highly successful national identity programme Aadhaar, however sought to downplay the significance of the decennial census data saying the identity programme is a ""de facto, real-time"" census.According to UIDAI, 1.30 billion people were enrolled under Aadhaar on December 31, 2022, against a projected population then of 1.37 billion. The gap would mostly be children who are not enrolled and deaths that are not updated, the former UIDAI official said.Pronab Sen, a former chief statistician of India, said the sample registration system (SRS) which estimates birth and death rates shows the population growth rate with reasonable accuracy.Unlike Aadhaar, the SRS survey counts a representative sample of births and deaths and uses it to project the count for a larger region.""It's not exact,"" Sen said. ""The problem is that SRS and projections that we have are reasonably accurate if the country is taken as a whole. What it will not give you is the distribution of people in different geographies within the country.""",2023/2/15,242,World

NSO Music Director and Conductor, Jun Markl, noted that Ozone is the perfect musician to perform the composition's advanced techniques.Ozone and Markl met while teaching at the Tokyo University of the Arts. The duo later performed in Europe together, according to Ozone.Ozone is famously known for his jazz background and impromptu shows as well as his claim that he began learning to play classical music at 42.“There are so many excellent classical pianists who can play those pieces so perfectly, so I think it is good to have a black sheep,” Ozone joked.He promised he would change some notes and harmonies but would remain truthful to the music. “The positive side about this is if you do not like the performance, you will not see it again, as every time I play it's something new,” he said.At the promotion press event, someone's phone rang, which reminded him of a magical moment from years before. He recalled that during a performance of a rather dark piece, when some audience members were shedding tears, an audience member's phone rang. He tried to ignore the interruption, but he could feel the crowd’s anger and the person's embarrassment.He then played the ringtone’s melody on stage, making everyone laugh. “That was the concert! Even though a phone rang, everyone’s hearts became one,” said Ozone.After performing with Ozone on Saturday, NSO will collaborate with Grammy Award winner and mezzo-soprano, Kelly O’Connor, Canadian tenor, John Tessier, and Taiwanese bass, Julian Lo (羅俊穎) to perform Hector Berlioz’s “Roméo et Juliette” on Feb. 24.Taipei Philharmonic Chorus will also participate.

Hou has not yet declared his intentions, with critics saying he would be abandoning his voters by running for president so shortly after winning re-election for a second four-year term as mayor of New Taipei City just last November.Chu singled out Hou’s capability to function as a “hen,” a strong presidential candidate who could help “downstream” candidates win seats in the legislative elections scheduled for the same day as the presidential polls.The KMT still has to draw up a process to select a presidential candidate, a plan Gou said he was waiting for. In addition to Hou and Gou, Chu has also been frequently named by the media as a presidential contender.The eventual KMT candidate could likely face vice president and Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德) and former Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), now chairman of the Taiwan People’s Party, in the Jan. 2024 election.",2023/2/15,749,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810939,White supremacist gets life in prison for Buffalo massacre,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — A white supremacist who killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket was sentenced to life in prison without parole Wednesday after relatives of his victims confronted him with pain and rage caused by his racist attack.

            Anger briefly turned physical at Payton Gendron’s sentencing when a victim's family member rushed at him from the audience. The man was quickly restrained; prosecutors later said he wouldn’t be charged. The proceeding then resumed with an emotional outpouring from people who lost loved ones or were themselves wounded in the attack.

            Gendron, whose hatred was fueled by racist conspiracy theories he encountered online, cried during some of the testimony and apologized to victims and their families in a brief statement. 











            Their remarks ranged from sorrow to outrage, shouts to tears. Some vehemently condemned him; others quoted from the Bible or said they were praying for him. Several pointed out that he deliberately attacked a Black community a three-hour drive from his home in overwhelmingly white Conklin, New York.

            “You’ve been brainwashed,” Wayne Jones Sr., the only child of victim Celestine Chaney, said as sobs rose from the audience. “You don’t even know Black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.”

            “I hope you find it in your heart to apologize to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason,” Jones said.

            Gendron's victims at the Tops Friendly Market — the only supermarket and a neighborhood hub on Buffalo's largely Black East Side — included a church deacon, the grocery store’s guard, a man shopping for a birthday cake, a grandmother of nine and the mother of a former Buffalo fire commissioner. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86.

            
                Gendron pleaded guilty in November to crimes including murder and domestic terrorism motivated by hate, a charge that carried an automatic life sentence.

            “There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances,” Judge Susan Eagan said as she sentenced him. She called his rampage “a reckoning” for a nation “founded and built, in part, on white supremacy.” 

            Gendron, 19, is due in a federal court Thursday for a status update in a separate case that could carry a death sentence if prosecutors seek it. His attorney said in December that Gendron is prepared to plead guilty in federal court to avoid execution. New York state does not have the death penalty.

            The gunman wore bullet-resistant armor and a helmet equipped with a livestreaming camera as he carried out the May 14 attack with a semiautomatic rifle he purchased legally but then modified so he could load it with illegal high-capacity ammunition magazines.

            “Do I hate you? No. Do I want you to die? No. I want you to stay alive. I want you to think about this every day of your life,” Tamika Harper, a niece of victim Geraldine Talley, told Gendron. “Think about my family and the other nine families that you’ve destroyed forever.” 

            Gendron locked eyes with Harper as she gently spoke. Then he lowered his head and wept.

            Minutes later, Barbara Massey Mapps excoriated him for killing her 72-year-old sister, Katherine Massey, a neighborhood activist. As Mapps shouted and pointed at Gendron, a person in the audience took a few steps toward him before getting held back. 

            “You don’t know what we’re going through,” a man shouted as he was led away by court officers. For several minutes thereafter, family members hugged and calmed each other.

            Eagan then ordered Gendron back in after admonishing everyone to behave appropriately.

            In his short statement, Gendron acknowledged he “shot and killed people because they were Black.”

            “I believed what I read online and acted out of hate, and now I can’t take it back, but I wish I could, and I don’t want anyone to be inspired by me,” he told the victims and their relatives. His own parents didn't attend. 

            One woman in the audience stood up, screamed “we don’t need"" his remarks and stormed out of the courtroom.

            There were only three survivors among the 13 people he shot while specifically seeking out Black shoppers and workers.

            Deja Brown said her father, Andre Mackniel, was blindsided “at the hands of a selfish boy who’s obviously not educated on the history of African Americans."" 

            Mackniel's young son still calls for a father who was gunned down while shopping for a birthday cake for him, said his brother, Vyonne Elliott. 

            Christopher Braden, a Tops employee who was shot in the leg, said he was haunted by seeing the victims where they lay as he was carried out of the store.

            “The visions haunt me in my sleep and every day,” he said.

            In documents posted online, Gendron said he hoped the attack would help preserve white power in the U.S. He wrote that he picked the Tops grocery store because it is in a predominantly Black neighborhood. Prosecutor Justin Caldwell said Gendron hoped to start a race war, but instead the community came together. 

            Reacting from Washington, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called on federal leaders to acknowledge “the constant threat of violence” to Black communities and urged the media to stop spreading misinformation that feeds racist conspiracy theories. 

            The mass shooting in Buffalo, soon followed by another that killed 19 students and two teachers at a Texas elementary school, amplified calls for stronger gun controls.

            New York legislators quickly passed a law banning semiautomatic rifle sales to most people under age 21. The state also banned sales of some types of body armor.

            In June, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed a compromise gun violence bill intended to toughen background checks, keep firearms from more domestic violence offenders and help states make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people adjudged to be dangerous.

            Peltz reported from New York. AP National Writer Aaron Morrison contributed from New York.BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — A white supremacist who killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket was sentenced to life in prison without parole Wednesday after relatives of his victims confronted him with pain and rage caused by his racist attack.Anger briefly turned physical at Payton Gendron’s sentencing when a victim's family member rushed at him from the audience. The man was quickly restrained; prosecutors later said he wouldn’t be charged. The proceeding then resumed with an emotional outpouring from people who lost loved ones or were themselves wounded in the attack.Gendron, whose hatred was fueled by racist conspiracy theories he encountered online, cried during some of the testimony and apologized to victims and their families in a brief statement.Their remarks ranged from sorrow to outrage, shouts to tears. Some vehemently condemned him; others quoted from the Bible or said they were praying for him. Several pointed out that he deliberately attacked a Black community a three-hour drive from his home in overwhelmingly white Conklin, New York.“You’ve been brainwashed,” Wayne Jones Sr., the only child of victim Celestine Chaney, said as sobs rose from the audience. “You don’t even know Black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.”“I hope you find it in your heart to apologize to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason,” Jones said.Gendron's victims at the Tops Friendly Market — the only supermarket and a neighborhood hub on Buffalo's largely Black East Side — included a church deacon, the grocery store’s guard, a man shopping for a birthday cake, a grandmother of nine and the mother of a former Buffalo fire commissioner. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86.Gendron pleaded guilty in November to crimes including murder and domestic terrorism motivated by hate, a charge that carried an automatic life sentence.“There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances,” Judge Susan Eagan said as she sentenced him.

            Inflation eased to 10.1% in the 12 months through January from 10.5% a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The consumer prices index peaked at 11.1% in October.

            The Bank of England forecasts prices will fall rapidly in the second half of this year as energy costs begin to moderate and price increases triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drop out of inflation calculations.











            But the figures offer no immediate relief to consumers squeezed by inflation that remains at levels last seen in the early 1980s. The country has been gripped by a wave of strikes in recent weeks as public-sector workers ranging from train drivers to teachers, nurses to paramedics demand higher wages.

            “Another fall in inflation over January suggests that the tide is turning on price pressures,” said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist for the Confederation of British Industry. “But with inflation and pipeline cost pressures set to remain high this year, households and businesses are likely to feel the pain for a while yet.”

            While declines in the cost of transportation, clothing and restaurant meals helped push inflation lower last month, consumers are still struggling with rising food and energy prices.

            Food prices rose 16.8% in the year through January, easing slightly from the 16.9% figure reported a month earlier. Housing costs, which include gas and electricity, increased 11.8%.

            Britain's price spikes have been outpacing some other major economies. The U.S. saw annual inflation ease to 6.4% in January, while Europe's slowed to 8.5%.

JAKARTA, INDONESIA -  Media OutReach - 15 February 2023 - PT Gunung Raja Paksi Tbk (GRP), a member of Gunung Steel Group and one of the largest private steelmakers in Indonesia, announced the launch of its Net Zero Roadmap today, which outlines its action plan for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In line with  Indonesia's Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (ENDC) to reduce its emissions by approximately 31.9% unconditionally and a net zero target of 2060 or sooner, GRP has taken steps to bolster their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy and reduce primary sources of emissions from the use of grid electricity and fuel (natural gas and coal) combustion, via clean energy alternatives.   The steelmaker has set out a plan to engage stakeholders across the supply chain in minimising the environmental and social impact from steel. GRP has built its ESG strategy around five core pillars:         Responsible Procurement         Environmental and Social Compliance         Energy Transition and Low Carbon Solutions         Contributing to Responsible Environmental Management         Nurturing Talent      In accordance with these pillars, the Net Zero Roadmap outlines the GRP's decarbonisation goals, which builds upon the Energy Transition and Low Carbon Solutions pillar, whereas the new sports centre builds on the themes of Nurturing Talent.   To date, steel production accounts for  almost 8% of global carbon emissions and this figure is expected to rise, as the global appetite for steel consumption increases. Against this backdrop, government and industry leaders alike, are making commitments to reduce their carbon footprint and GRP is determined to support these national and global agendas.   Upon evaluating its emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG)Protocol and identifying its primary sources of emissions, GRP has identified 5 main pillars of emissions reduction measures and initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality:     Fuel Switching: transitioning from coal to cleaner sources of energy such as natural gas     Production improvements and resource efficiency improvements: Balancing between meeting current steel demand whilst decarbonising production processes     Green Power Sourcing: Sourcing green energy from the grid or producing it in-house     Carbon offsetting: Investing in carbon offset projects that benefit the environment     Collaboration and Partnership: Working with public and private sector stakeholders to implement solutions to reach Net Zero i.e. the Indonesian Iron & Steel Industry Association (IISIA) and participating in the Net Zero Hub by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce (KADIN).      GRP's Net Zero roadmap also includes its disclosure for 2021 GHG Inventory, which is currently at 0.86 Tonne CO2/ Tonne of Crude Steel production. As an electric arc furnace (EAF) operated mill, GRP has the advantage in decarbonising its manufacturing plant compared to other global steel players who run by Blast Furnace Operated mills. This inventory data serves as a baseline for GRP's decarbonisation journey.   ""In the past year, we are hearing more conversations from the industry around decarbonisation and transitioning to cleaner energy sources. As much as there is increasing attention towards ESG, we believe that action speaks louder than words. Mapping out these actionable steps is the right way forward in our ESG strategy. With our Net Zero Roadmap, we are determined to shift the business towards a carbon neutral one and collaborate with stakeholders within our supply chain to achieve this mission,"" said  Sheren Omega, Head of Sustainability at GRP.   In addition, GRP also announced the launch of its new sports centre, which focuses on one of the five core pillars – Nurturing Talents. The  World Steel Association showed that steel workers suffer long-term health effects such as cancers, respiratory diseases and stress related disorders as a result of prolonged exposure to hazards on the job. GRP believes that improving the mental and physical wellbeing of their employees is essential for them to excel at work. The new sport centre will provide employees an outlet to destress and recharge for work in light of building career longevity.   ""Our employees are crucial assets to the company. Some of them have been with us for decades and it is only right that we as a company safeguard their wellbeing and provide them with a healthy working environment. We believe that initiatives like this sports centre will go a long way in setting our employees up for success at work,"" said  Tony Taniwan, Executive Committee at GRP.   Embarking into a new year, GRP is determined to support construction projects for eco-friendly infrastructure such as the building of the New Capital City (IKN), Solar Panel and Electric Vehicle Plants. The company also seeks to actively engage the government and industry leaders in identifying solutions to help the industry transition to a cleaner future.   GRP is currently a full member of the  ResponsibleSteel™ and has certified products and operation sites which meets the pre-requisite 13 principles, and the 370 associate requirements, highlighted in the  ResponsibleSteel™ International Standard V2.0.

Korea: Unlikely that Kim's daughter groomed as successor,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Wednesday said that it’s still premature to determine whether the recently unveiled daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is being groomed as her father’s successor.

            Speculation about the status of Kim's daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 10, has further intensified since she recently took center stage at a massive military parade in Pyongyang and appeared in soon-to-be-released postal stamps — both events with her all-powerful father.

            During a parliamentary committee meeting in Seoul, Unification Minister Kwon Youngse, South Korea’s top official on North Korea, questioned a belief that she’s being primed as the North’s next leader. Kwon cited Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age – Kim turned 39 last month – and North Korea’s male-dominated power hierarchy. 











            “There are views that (her appearances) are aimed at talking about a hereditary power transition. But considering Kim Jong Un’s age and the fact that North Korea has a much more patriarchal nature than ours, there are also lots of questions about whether North Korea having a woman (prepared to) inherit power now is indeed right,” Kwon told lawmakers. 

            Kwon said the girl’s repeated appearances in recent months were more likely meant to shore up public support of Kim’s ruling family and prepare for a future hereditary power transfer. 

            South Korean media have speculated Kim Jong Un also has a son who is older than Kim Ju Ae and a third child, likely a daughter. But Kwon said only Kim Ju Ae is her father’s officially confirmed child. 

            North Korea disclosed Kim Ju Ae in November by announcing she watched an intercontinental ballistic missile test with her father. She's since made four other public appearances, including last week’s military parade. 

            State media have called her Kim’s “most beloved” or “respected” child and published a slew of photos and video showing her closeness with her father. She was seen touching Kim’s cheek at an observation stand for the military parade and sitting in the seat of honor at an earlier banquet while being flanked by her parents and generals, in what observers say had been unimaginable in North Korea because Kim is the subject of a personality cult that treats him like a god.

            Designs released by North Korea’s state-run Korea Stamp Corporation earlier this week also show Kim Ju Ae being featured in five of eight new stamps that are set to be circulated from Friday to celebrate the November flight test of the Hwasong-17 ICBM, an event she attended. The stamps carried previously publicised images showing the girl holding her father’s hand as they walked near the missile and posing for photos with her father in front of a wall of clapping soldiers days after the Hwasong-17 launch.

            After her first public appearance, the National Intelligence Service, South Korea’s main spy agency, told lawmakers that she was Kim’s second child, according to some of the legislators who attended a closed-door briefing. The spy service later said it believed that by taking his daughter to public events, Kim Jong Un aims to show the public his resolve to hand over power to one of his children in the future, though it assessed the younger Kim's appearances didn’t necessarily mean she would succeed her father. 

            The name of Ju Ae matched what retired NBA star Dennis Rodman named Kim’s baby daughter who he said he saw and held during his trip to Pyongyang in 2013. Rodman told the British newspaper the Guardian that Kim Jong Un was a “good dad” to his daughter and that “the Marshal Kim and I had a relaxing time by the sea with his family.”

            Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been successively ruled by male members of the Kim family. Outside studies show only a fraction of top North Korean officials are women, including Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, and Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. Before Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011, his father Kim Jong Il governed for 17 years, and before him, his father and state founder, Kim Il Sung, ruled for 46 years. 

            “It’s too soon to assume that (Kim Ju Ae) will be his heir because the son has always succeeded the throne in North Korea,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. “So, we don’t yet know if Kim Jong Un is willing to break tradition regarding the gender of his successor or if she will play a key role to support whoever Kim appoints.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810969,Qatar's emir watches as PSG stumbles in Champions League,"PARIS (AP) — Making a rare visit to the Parc des Princes, the emir of Qatar watched first hand as Paris Saint-Germain came up short on Europe's biggest stage once again. 

            Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was in the stands as Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and the rest of an expensively assembled team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, putting the club in danger of another early exit from the Champions League.

            More than a decade of hiring and firing and splashing the cash has so far failed to deliver a coveted Champions League trophy for PSG's Qatari owners.











            Amid reports that the oil and gas rich Gulf state is now planning a move for Manchester United, perhaps the emir's patience with PSG could be close to running out. 

            Despite all the superstar signings, a series of coaches have not managed to achieve PSG's owners' ultimate ambition. 

            When Christophe Galtier was hired last July he became the seventh coach since state-backed Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) took over the club in 2011.

            With its motto “Dream Bigger"" splashed on the team bus, the owners had a clear ambition to make PSG one of Europe's leading clubs.

            Yet PSG's defeat to Bayern on Tuesday in the first leg of the round-of-16 in the Champions League was its third straight loss and fifth in 11 games, with Messi, Mbappe and Neymar all struggling for form since returning from the World Cup.

            Since playmaker Javier Pastore became PSG’s first marquee signing for 42 million euros ($45 million) in 2011, the club's net expenditure has risen to more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).

            Despite this outlay, there's been more humiliating exits than finals in Europe.

            The only Champions League final PSG reached was in 2020's pandemic-shortened format, when it also lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich as Mbappe and Neymar — who cost a combined 402 million euros ($432 million) — were held scoreless.

            In 2017, PSG became the first team to be knocked out after winning the first leg 4-0 in the round of 16, losing 6-1 in the return leg at Barcelona. 

            In 2019, PSG became the first team to be eliminated after winning the away leg 2-0 in the round of 16, losing 3-1 at home to Manchester United.

            Against Real Madrid last year, PSG was leading 2-0 on aggregate before Karim Benzema's devastating 17-minute hat trick.

            The 2020 final loss to Bayern was also symbolic because the goal scorer was winger Kingsley Coman — who left PSG when he was 18. Coman scored the winning goal again on Tuesday. 

            PSG’s signing of stars such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar and Messi pushed homegrown forwards like Coman, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku — who all became France internationals — to leave for other clubs.

            PSG's academy had also previously failed to snap up other rising talents.

            World Cup winners Thierry Henry, Paul Pogba (Juventus) and N’Golo Kanté (Chelsea) were Parisian youths but didn't go through PSG's academy, while Mbappé was also missed and signed from Monaco.

            HIRE AND FIRE

            PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi sat alongside Galtier at the coach's unveiling and made a pledge: “We have a new era to start, a new atmosphere, new objectives.”

            Al-Khelaifi, however, was long seen as too close to PSG stars who were indulged while coaches had a hard time keeping their jobs.

            Since QSI took over, Carlo Ancelotti is the only coach not to be fired. He left for Real Madrid in 2013. 

            Ancelotti was hired only after Antoine Kombouaré was moved out in December 2011 with PSG three points clear at the top of the French league. PSG lost the title to modest Montpellier by three points.

            Galtier replaced Mauricio Pochettino, who had one year left on his contract and became the fourth coach in succession to be fired by PSG after Thomas Tuchel, Unai Emery and Laurent Blanc.

            Pochettino, who took over in January 2021 from Tuchel, paid the price for the Madrid defeat last season.

            Tuchel had been shown the door after reportedly claiming that managing PSG was like being a politician, such was the level of difficulty. Emery reportedly fell out with Neymar. 

            Pochettino and Blanc had signed new contracts before getting fired, exposing PSG’s impatience and apparent indifference to hefty compensation packages.

            Pochettino and his staff reportedly received around 10 million euros ($10.8 million). When Blanc was fired in 2016, PSG paid out 22 million euros ($23.7 million).

            Fans were also angered at how long-serving captain Thiago Silva and Cavani — PSG's all-time leading scorer with 200 goals — were encouraged to leave. 

            Considered too old for two-year contracts in Paris, Silva then won the Champions League with Tuchel at Chelsea and Cavani scored in the Europa League final for United in 2021.

            But the Madrid defeat last year finally prompted an introspective overhaul at PSG. 

            Sporting director Leonardo — whose strong contacts with AC Milan made it possible to sign Ibrahimovic, Silva and European Championship-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma — was fired during his second spell.

            Yet problems have resurfaced under the new regime. 

            PSG hadn’t lost three straight games since late 2011, and its five losses in 2023 are more than all of last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810971,Indian officials search BBC offices for second straight day,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s tax officials searched BBC offices in India for a second straight day on Wednesday questioning staff about the organization's business operations in the country, some staff members said.

            BBC management told editorial and other staff members to work from home after they were able to leave the office on Tuesday night, said staff who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to media.

            The searches came weeks after the BBC aired a documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the U.K.











            There was no overnight break in the search and investigators scanned the desktops of some employees who were earlier told not to use their phones and keep them aside, the staff members said.

            Indian income tax officials have not made any statements since the searches were launched in the BBC’s New Delhi and Mumbai offices on Tuesday morning.

            The Press Trust of India news agency said the officials were making copies of electronic and paper-based financial data from the organization.

            Rights groups and opposition politicians denounced the move by India's Income Tax Department as an attempt to intimidate the media.

            Britain's publicly funded national broadcaster said it was cooperating fully with authorities and hoped ""to have this situation resolved as soon as possible.” Late in the evening, the BBC said officials were still at the two offices.

            “Many staff have now left the building but some have been asked to remain and are continuing to cooperate with the ongoing inquiries,” it said, adding: “Our output and journalism continue as normal.”

            While there has been no British government statement so far, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday: “We are aware of the search of the BBC offices in Delhi by Indian tax authorities.""

            “We support the importance of a free press around the world. We continue to highlight the importance of freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief as human rights that contribute to strengthening democracies around the world. It has strengthened this democracy here in this country. It has strengthened India’s democracy,” Price told reporters in Washington.

            India's News Broadcasters and Digital Association criticized the income tax ""surveys"" at the BBC offices.

            While the association ""maintains that no institution is above the law, it condemns any attempt to muzzle and intimidate the media and interfere with the free functioning of journalists and media organizations,'' it said in a statement.

            Gaurav Bhatia, a spokesperson for Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said the BBC should have nothing to fear if it follows Indian laws. But he added that the broadcaster's history is “tainted” and “full of hatred” for India and called it corrupt, without offering any specifics.

            The documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” was broadcast in the U.K. last month, examining the prime minister's role in 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.

            Modi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him. Last year, the court dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim victim questioning Modi’s exoneration.

            The second portion of the two-part documentary examined “the track record of Narendra Modi’s government following his re-election in 2019,” according to the BBC website.

            The program drew an immediate backlash from India's government, which invoked emergency powers under its information technology laws to block it from being shown in the country. Local authorities scrambled to stop screenings organized at Indian universities, and social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube complied with government requests to remove links to the documentary.

            The BBC said at the time that the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a wide range of voices and opinions.

            “We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series — it declined to respond,” its statement said.

            India’s Foreign Ministry called the documentary a “propaganda piece designed to push a particularly discredited narrative” that lacked objectivity.

            Press freedom in India has been on a steady decline in recent years. The country fell eight places, to 150 out of 180 countries, in the 2022 Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Media watchdog groups accuse the Modi government of silencing criticism on social media under a sweeping internet law that puts digital platforms including Twitter and Facebook under direct government oversight.

            Some media outlets critical of the government have been subjected to tax searches. 

            Authorities searched the offices of the left-leaning website NewsClick and independent media portal Newslaundry on the same day in 2021. Tax officials also accused the Dainik Bhaskar newspaper of tax evasion in 2021 after it published reports of mass funeral pyres and floating corpses that challenged the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810972,"War in Ukraine at 1 year: Pain, resilience in global economy","An Egyptian widow is struggling to afford meat and eggs for her five children. An exasperated German laundry owner watches as his energy bill jumps fivefold. Nigerian bakeries have shut their doors, unable to afford the exorbitant price of flour.

            One year after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and caused widespread suffering, the global economy is still enduring the consequences — crunched supplies of grain, fertilizer and energy along with more inflation and economic uncertainty in a world that was already contending with too much of both.

            As dismal as the war's impact has been, there’s one consolation: It could have been worse. Companies and countries in the developed world have proved surprisingly resilient, so far avoiding the worst-case scenario of painful recession. 











            But in emerging economies, the pain has been more intense.

            In Egypt, where nearly a third of the population lives in poverty, Halima Rabie has struggled for years to feed her five school-age children. Now, the 47-year-old widow has cut back on even the most basic groceries as prices keep rising.

            “It’s become unbearable,” Rabie said, heading to her job as a cleaner at a state-run hospital in Cairo’s twin city of Giza. “Meat and eggs have become a luxury.”

            In the United States and other wealthy countries, a painful surge in consumer prices, fueled in part by the war’s effect on oil prices, has steadily eased. It's buoyed hopes that U.S. Federal Reserve inflation fighters will relent on interest rate increases that have threatened to tip the world’s biggest economy into recession and sent other currencies tumbling against the dollar.

            China also dropped draconian zero-COVID lockdowns late last year that hobbled growth in the second-largest economy. 

            Some good fortune has helped, too: A warmer-than-usual winter has helped lower natural gas prices and limit the damage from an energy crisis after Russia largely cut off gas to Europe. Still, oil and gas prices were high enough to cushion the impact on the energy-exporting Russian economy from the international sanctions imposed after President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

            The war “is a human catastrophe,’’ said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But its impact on the world economy is a passing shock.’’

            Still, in ways big and small, the war is causing pain. In Europe, for example, natural gas prices are still three times what they were before Russia started massing troops on Ukraine's border.

            Sven Paar, who runs a commercial laundry in Walduern, southwest Germany, is facing a gas bill this year of about 165,000 euros ($176,000) — up from 30,000 euros ($32,000) last year — to run 12 heavy-duty machines that can wash 8 tons of laundry a day.

            “We have passed the prices on, one to one, to our customers,” Paar said.

            So far, he has been able to keep his customers after showing them the energy bills that accompany the price increases.

            “Fingers crossed, it’s working so far,"" he said. “At the same time, the customers groan, and they have to pass the costs on to their own customers.”

            While he's kept his steady customers, they're offering less business. Restaurants with fewer customers need fewer tablecloths washed. Several hotels closed in February rather than pay heating costs during their slow season, meaning fewer hotel sheets to clean. 

            Punishingly high food prices are inflicting particular hardship on the poor. The war has disrupted wheat, barley and cooking oil from Ukraine and Russia, major global suppliers for Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where many struggle with food insecurity. Russia also was the top supplier of fertilizer.

            While a U.N.-brokered deal has allowed some food shipments from the Black Sea region, it's up for renewal next month. 

            In Egypt, the world’s No. 1 wheat importer, Rabie took a second job at a private clinic in July but still struggles to keep up with rising prices. She earns less than $170 a month. 

            Rabie said she cooks meat once a month and has resorted to cheaper byproducts to ensure her children get protein. But even those are becoming harder to find. 

            The government urged Egyptians to try chicken feet and wings as an alternative source of protein — a suggestion met with scorn on social media but that also led to a spike in demand.

            “Even the feet have become expensive,” Rabie said.

            In Nigeria, a top importer of Russian wheat, average food prices skyrocketed 37% last year. Bread prices have doubled in some places amid wheat shortages.

            “People have huge decisions to make,” said Alexander Verhes, who runs Life Flour Mill Limited in the southern Delta state. ""What food do they buy? Do they spend it on food? Schooling? Medication?”

            At least 40% of bakeries in the Nigerian capital of Abuja shut down after the price of flour jumped about 200%.

            “The ones still in the business are doing so at breaking point with no profits,” said Mansur Umar, chairman of the bakers’ association. “A lot of people have stopped eating bread. They have gone for alternatives because of the cost.’’

            In Spain, the government is spending 300 million euros ($320 million) to help farmers acquire fertilizer, the price of which has doubled since the war in Ukraine.

            “Fertilizer is vital because the land needs food,’’ said Jose Sanchez, a farmer in the village of Anchuelo, east of Madrid. “If the land does not have food, then the crops do not grow up.""

            It all means a slowing global economy. The International Monetary Fund dropped growth expectations this year and in 2022 that equates to about $1 trillion in lost production. Europe's economy, for example, “is still experiencing significant headwinds"" despite a drop in energy prices and is at risk of falling into recessio n, said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at banking giant Citi.

            The IMF says consumer prices jumped 7.3% in the wealthiest countries last year — above its January 2022 forecast of 3.9% — and 9.9% in poorer ones, up from 5.9% expected pre-invasion. 

            In the U.S., such inflation has forced businesses to be nimble.

            Stacy Elmore, co-founder of The Luxury Pergola in Noblesville, Indiana, said the cost of providing health insurance for eight workers has spiked 39% over the past year — to $10,000 a month. Amid a labor shortage, she also had to raise hourly wages for her top installer from $24 to $30 an hour. 

            Inflation-whipped consumers began to balk at paying $22,500 for a 10-by-16-foot louvered pergola — kind of a gazebo without walls — that was sold through dealers. Sales sank last year. So Elmore pivoted to do-it-yourself models, selling directly to shoppers at a sharply reduced price of $12,580.

            “With inflation so high, we’ve worked to broaden the appeal of our products and make them easier for the average person to acquire,” Elmore said.

            In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, many street vendors know they can’t pass along surging food prices to their already struggling customers. So some are skimping on portions instead, a practice known as “shrinkflation.’’ 

            “One kilogram of rice was for eight portions ... but now we made it 10 portions,"" said Mukroni, 52, who runs a food stall and like many Indonesians goes by only one name. Customers, he said, “will not come to the shop"" if prices are too high.

            “We hope for peace,"" he said, “because, after all, no one will win or lose, because everyone will be a victim.’’

            Wiseman reported from Washington and McHugh from Frankfurt, Germany. AP journalists Samy Magdy in Cairo; Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria; Anne D’Innocenzio in New York; Iain Sullivan in Anchuelo, Spain; and Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed.An Egyptian widow is struggling to afford meat and eggs for her five children. An exasperated German laundry owner watches as his energy bill jumps fivefold. Nigerian bakeries have shut their doors, unable to afford the exorbitant price of flour.One year after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and caused widespread suffering, the global economy is still enduring the consequences — crunched supplies of grain, fertilizer and energy along with more inflation and economic uncertainty in a world that was already contending with too much of both.As dismal as the war's impact has been, there’s one consolation: It could have been worse. Companies and countries in the developed world have proved surprisingly resilient, so far avoiding the worst-case scenario of painful recession.But in emerging economies, the pain has been more intense.In Egypt, where nearly a third of the population lives in poverty, Halima Rabie has struggled for years to feed her five school-age children. Now, the 47-year-old widow has cut back on even the most basic groceries as prices keep rising.“It’s become unbearable,” Rabie said, heading to her job as a cleaner at a state-run hospital in Cairo’s twin city of Giza. “Meat and eggs have become a luxury.”In the United States and other wealthy countries, a painful surge in consumer prices, fueled in part by the war’s effect on oil prices, has steadily eased. It's buoyed hopes that U.S. Federal Reserve inflation fighters will relent on interest rate increases that have threatened to tip the world’s biggest economy into recession and sent other currencies tumbling against the dollar.China also dropped draconian zero-COVID lockdowns late last year that hobbled growth in the second-largest economy.Some good fortune has helped, too: A warmer-than-usual winter has helped lower natural gas prices and limit the damage from an energy crisis after Russia largely cut off gas to Europe.

Global study on “Proctoscope” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.Global proctoscope market, which was worth USD 981.32 millions in 2022, will soar to USD 6583.42 million by 2030. It is projected to grow at a 27.1% CAGR during the 2023- 2030 forecast period.The proctoscope can be used as a medical exam tool to diagnose haemorrhoids and conduct a rectal exam.

To offer disposable and reusable options, lightweight plastic and metal are used in the construction of the device. Non-compliance with reprocessing guidelines and failure to follow current reprocessing procedures are key factors in the proctoscope market growth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811065,Tuesday's Sports In Brief,"NFL

            HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Quarterback Derek Carr was released by the Las Vegas Raiders on Tuesday as the club evaluates its future at the position.

            The move was expected after Carr was benched with two games remaining this season because the Raiders would have owed him $40.4 million in guaranteed money over the next two years if he remained on the roster beyond Tuesday. By releasing Carr, the Raiders’ salary dead cap hit will be $5.6 million next season.











            Las Vegas tried to work out a trade with the New Orleans Saints, and Carr visited the team last week. He exercised his no-trade clause and turned down the deal Sunday because Carr didn’t want to take a pay reduction, a person with knowledge of the situation said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly.

            Now Carr, who turns 32 on March 28, will see what he’s worth on the open market, and there is little doubt there will be interest in the nine-year veteran given how many teams need to upgrade at quarterback.

            TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon on Tuesday to be their next head coach. 

            Gannon replaces Kliff Kingsbury, who was fired last month after going 4-13 in his fourth season. Gannon becomes Arizona’s fourth coach in seven years and the second Eagles coordinator to become a head coach after Shane Steichen was hired by Indianapolis on Tuesday.

            The 40-year-old Gannon has been Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator the past two seasons, helping rebuild a defense that helped the Eagles reach the Super Bowl last Sunday. The Eagles lost to Kansas City 38-35 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Cardinals.

            The Eagles had the NFL’s No. 2 defense this season and the third-most sacks in NFL history with 78 under Gannon in 2022. Philadelphia led the NFL with 70 sacks this season — 15 more than any other team.

            Gannon’s resume took a bit of a hit during the Super Bowl. The Eagles coughed up a 10-point halftime lead and couldn’t stop Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, even though the MVP wasn’t moving at his best because of a sprained ankle.

            INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts have hired Shane Steichen as their head coach.

            The move announced Tuesday ends a search that took more than a month, involved more than a dozen candidates and finally gives the Colts some direction in what still appears to be a tumultuous offseason. A news conference was scheduled for later in the day.

            Each of Indy’s last two full-time hires were offensive coordinators for Philadelphia Eagles teams that made the Super Bowl. Frank Reich was hired in 2018 after the Eagles won their first championship since 1960 but was fired in October as the Colts’ season started to unravel.

            He was replaced by interim coach Jeff Saturday, who won his first game but lost the final seven to give Indy the No. 4 overall draft pick. Saturday was one of the finalists for the full-time job.

            Now, though, the Colts seem to be changing directions again, this time likely with a young, promising quarterback. That’s a major reason team owner Jim Irsay and general manager Chris Ballard, who led the lengthy search, sought out the 37-year-old Steichen.

            COLLEGE BASKETBALL

            New Mexico State fired basketball coach Greg Heiar on Tuesday in the wake of hazing allegations within the team that shut down the program for the rest of the season. 

            Chancellor Dan Arvizu announced the firing of the first-year coach and said “hazing has no place on our campus, and those found responsible will be held accountable for their actions.”

            The chancellor said decisions about the rest of the coaching staff will be made after further investigation.

            Arvizu shut down the program for the season on Sunday, after reviewing a campus police report in which an Aggies player said three teammates ganged up on him and attacked him. The report, which redacted the names of the players, included allegations of false imprisonment, harassment and criminal sexual contact.

            The 47-year-old Heiar spent time earlier in his career as an assistant for former Aggies coach Chris Jans, who left after last season to coach Mississippi State. Last season, Heiar was at Northwest Florida State, where he helped the Raiders win the junior college national title.

            NBA

            Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo is teaming up with his brothers once again on All-Star Saturday. Portland’s Damian Lillard is taking a third shot at the 3-point title, Indiana’s Buddy Hield will aim to win that one again and Philadelphia’s Mac McClung now can be a slam-dunk champion at the NBA and high school levels.

            The NBA released the full list of participants for All-Star Saturday’s events in Salt Lake City — the Skills Competition, the 3-point contest and the dunk contest. It’ll be a particularly busy weekend for 11 players who are now slotted to be in multiple events during the three days of action in Utah.

            BASEBALL

            SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Spring training games might be a little ugly this year, particularly during the first few weeks.

            For Major League Baseball, that’s a feature, not a bug. 

            The Grapefruit and Cactus League games in Florida and Arizona over the next month will be used as a petri dish for the sport’s rule changes, including a pitch clock, bigger bases and limits to infield shifts. The idea is that the worst kinks will be worked out before opening day on March 30.

            Though there’s multiple innovations, one stands above the rest.

            The pitch clock has been tested for a few years at the minor league level. Pitchers will have 15 seconds to deliver their pitch with no runners on base and 20 seconds when runners are on base. There will be 30 seconds between batters and 2 minutes, 15 seconds between innings.

            MLB games averaged 3 hours, 4 minutes last season following the introduction of the PitchCom electronic device to signal pitches, down from a record 3:10 in 2021. Sword said MLB’s research indicates fans prefer games that are around 2:30.

            The pitch clock’s effect on minor league games in 2022 was substantial. Games that used the clock were, on average, 25 minutes shorter than those that did not.NFLHENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Quarterback Derek Carr was released by the Las Vegas Raiders on Tuesday as the club evaluates its future at the position.The move was expected after Carr was benched with two games remaining this season because the Raiders would have owed him $40.4 million in guaranteed money over the next two years if he remained on the roster beyond Tuesday. By releasing Carr, the Raiders’ salary dead cap hit will be $5.6 million next season.Las Vegas tried to work out a trade with the New Orleans Saints, and Carr visited the team last week. He exercised his no-trade clause and turned down the deal Sunday because Carr didn’t want to take a pay reduction, a person with knowledge of the situation said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly.Now Carr, who turns 32 on March 28, will see what he’s worth on the open market, and there is little doubt there will be interest in the nine-year veteran given how many teams need to upgrade at quarterback.TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals hired Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon on Tuesday to be their next head coach.Gannon replaces Kliff Kingsbury, who was fired last month after going 4-13 in his fourth season. Gannon becomes Arizona’s fourth coach in seven years and the second Eagles coordinator to become a head coach after Shane Steichen was hired by Indianapolis on Tuesday.The 40-year-old Gannon has been Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator the past two seasons, helping rebuild a defense that helped the Eagles reach the Super Bowl last Sunday. The Eagles lost to Kansas City 38-35 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Cardinals.The Eagles had the NFL’s No. 2 defense this season and the third-most sacks in NFL history with 78 under Gannon in 2022. Philadelphia led the NFL with 70 sacks this season — 15 more than any other team.Gannon’s resume took a bit of a hit during the Super Bowl. The Eagles coughed up a 10-point halftime lead and couldn’t stop Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, even though the MVP wasn’t moving at his best because of a sprained ankle.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts have hired Shane Steichen as their head coach.The move announced Tuesday ends a search that took more than a month, involved more than a dozen candidates and finally gives the Colts some direction in what still appears to be a tumultuous offseason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811067,Environmentalists say new airport threatens Albanian lagoons,"AKERNI, Albania (AP) — A new, multimillion-euro international airport near Albania's coastal city of Vlora will mean hundreds of jobs for area residents. But environmentalists warn it could cause irreparable damage to the fragile ecosystems of protected lagoons that host flamingos, pelicans and millions of other migratory birds.

            Albania's new, 104 million-euro ($125 million) international airport — the country's third — is currently being constructed at the Narta lagoon some 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city of Vlora. Set to start operations in 2025, the airport will boast a 3.2-kilometer (2-mile) runway and is expected to handle up to 2 million passengers a year.

            That's good news for Adriatik Sela, a resident of Akerni village. The unemployed man hopes that “if there is business here, I could sell a cigarette package, or a coffee, or work as a guard.” He and others among the village's 1,000-strong population see the airport as an opportunity for a better life.











            Heavy earth-moving vehicles and workers from Swiss company Mabco Constructions are currently busy building the runway as well as a road linking the airport to a nearby highway.

            But Aleksander Trajce from the Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania, (PPNEA) says the airport poses a grave threat to the Narta lagoon and the Karavasta lagoon farther north and environmentalists have launched a court battle to stop its construction.

            Millions of migratory birds use the lagoons as a rest stop as part of the Adriatic flyway, a route the birds use to travel from central and northern Europe to Africa. Up to 3,000 flamingos and pelicans visit the lagoons each year. 

            “Building such infrastructure right in the middle of this route would mean incredible damage to the bird populations for which this region is famous and on which it flourishes,” Trajce said.

            Niko Dumani, from the non-governmental group Natural Environment Preservation and Protection Vlora, accuses the government of changing a pre-approved plan delineating a protected zone to incorporate a part of the lagoon into the airport's construction plans. 

            “It is strange how development policies change from promoting tourism to promoting other industries, like air transport, exploiting a habitat which is so important for tourism, like the lagoon,” he said.

            Annette Spangenberg, from the German-based conservation group EuroNatur, said the Narta lagoon is part of an ecological network of conservation areas aiming at the long-term survival of bird species and their habitats.

            “If you build the airport within this area, it’s going to harm the integrity of your river ecosystem. It is like cutting off the leg of the Vjosa River,” she said.

            The Ministry of Tourism and Environment says it has consulted with locals and with experts. The new airport will generate at least 1,500 jobs.

            The ministry told the Associated Press in an email that the site was selected “as the most favorable alternative"" for the airport because a military airstrip had started to be built there in the 1920s. 

            But a European Union progress report on Albania last year noted that work on the airport started in December 2021 “in contradiction with national laws and international biodiversity protection conventions that have already been ratified.”

            Environmentalists also fear birds could threaten flight safety.

            In its most recent meeting in December last year, the Standing Committee to the Bern Convention called on the Albanian government to “suspend the construction of the airport due to its apparent lack of adherence to national and international laws.”

            The ministry said “a series of protective steps will be applied.” 

            The residents of Akerni are unconcerned. Sela wants the airport to start operating as quickly as possible “to help all people in southern Albania take flights from here and, for sure, that will bring good luck to our lives.”

The controversial intelligence chief was in hot water last year after two of his students at NTU were disqualified over plagiarism investigations and for his inappropriate comments and his unreserved support for Lin.The relentless support was, once again, displayed following Lin's Tuesday post, which showed remorse for his master's thesis and announced his decision to take a step back from politics to spend more time with his family.Chen issued a statement the same day which continued to claim Lin's innocence, saying it was the alleged victim, Yu Cheng-huang (余正煌), who sought advice for completing a thesis from Chen in 2016, committing plagiarism by stealing the ideas of Lin's proposed thesis.In response, Yu, who was said to be working for the Investigation Bureau's Hsinchu Branch, expressed his anger over Chen's statement through his lawyer, describing it as ""false"" and ""shameless."" ""We will have a discussion with Yu and are likely to press charges against Chen in the near future,"" Yu's lawyer said.In early January, Yu accused Chen of bullying him after Yu accused Lin of plagiarism last year.",2023/2/15,1077,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811095,"Taiwan loses musical legend, Liu Wen-cheng","UPDATE: 02 16 2023, 14:00: Liu Wen-cheng's ex-agent reversed the announcement of Liu's death the next day, admitting Liu intentionally faked death to stop countless harassment from fans and entertainment agencies from reaching out to him begging for a comeback.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Fans of Liu Wen-cheng (劉文正) were in shock when news of his passing eventually made its way back to Taiwan.An inter-generational superstar, Liu was one of the most popular male singers in Taiwan throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He was known for his good looks and a signature personal style that included a hat often worn at a rakish angle and a scarf thrown over one shoulder.Reports of his death were initially dismissed as rumors. The late singer had been reclusive in his later years, though reportedly still fit and in fine shape through regular swimming and hiking, according to his long-time agent. Later, it was confirmed that Liu passed away due to a heart attack on November 12, 2022, one day before what would have been his 70th birthday, according to BCC report.In the 70’s, Taiwanese singers such as Liu and Teresa Deng (鄧麗君) dominated Asian markets for popular music sung in Mandarin. This meant that Liu’s popularity extended as far away as Singapore, Hong Kong, the U.S., and Canada. Liu’s popularity in multiple markets would lead him to command unheard-of show fees at the time.Aside from his lucrative performances and record royalty payments, Liu also won over many women who swooned over his soft features and his gentlemanly appearance, becoming the dream lover of many teens and young mothers alike, though he would choose to remain single for the rest of his life.Born in Taipei, Liu was the youngest child in a well-to-do family which worked in the import and export business. He planned to follow his brother and two sisters who emigrated to the U.S. He had even planned to attend college in the U.S. but a chance appearance at a singing competition hosted by Taiwan Television (TTV) led him to take fifth place, which resulted in a recording contract at 17.Like many of his peers, his career was interrupted by military service and upon release from duty, he launched his debut album in 1975 titled ""Nuoyan"" 諾言 (The Promise) which ignited his career.Liu's path to super-stardom had begun and in rapid succession, he was awarded ""Best Male Singer"" at the Golden Bell Awards three times: 1980, 1982, and 1983. Cumulatively, he would release nearly 40 albums and act in over a dozen Taiwanese movies. An excessive workload eventually led him to announce his retirement at the age of 30.He quit show business once and for all in 1984, first dabbling in production and artist management with the Fei Ying (飛鷹) production company. Liu eventually closed the company in 1991 when he chose to settle in the U.S.He took the money he made from singing and acting and invested much of it in real estate, owning more than 100 properties in areas popular with Chinese communities in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Singapore, and Malaysia. His net worth was estimated to be upwards of US$100 million (NT$30 billion).Liu’s interest in real estate is partially inspired by his distaste for hotels, as he expressed a desire to stay in small apartments he owned in major cities around the world. The fortune he amassed from real estate investments precluded any need for a reunion or comeback tour, as he was reported to turn away lucrative offers to perform again.Liu’s life is notable in that he remained single and unmarried. He explained this as being comfortable with himself and naturally unassuming in his private life. The fact that it would take four months for Liu’s fans to learn of his passing speaks volumes about the personal, private nature of this singer from a bygone era that many will never forget.",2023/2/15,3412,Culture

            According to The Manila Times on Tuesday (Feb. 14), an initial 100 Smartscooters, 400 smart batteries, and seven battery swapping stations (GoStations) have arrived in the Philippines.

            Gogoro announced a strategic partnership with Globe’s 917Ventures and Ayala Corporation at the end of November. Through the pilot, Gogoro will introduce its Smartscooters and battery swapping infrastructure in Manila in order to provide an alternative to gas-powered vehicles for the last-mile delivery sector in the Philippines.

            “We are excited about this pilot rollout as it will not only address the need for more sustainable transportation options but also contribute to the overall goal of creating a greener future for Metro Manila and the entire country,” The Manila Times cited 917Ventures Managing Director Vince Yamat as saying.











            917Ventures said if the pilot succeeds it will pave the way for a new sustainable business model in other Philippine cities, adding that relevant details would be disclosed in due course, per The Manila Times.

            Gogoro has over 520,000 riders in Taiwan who can swap for new batteries at around 2,491 GoStations around the entire country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811118,"Barenboim takes it day-by-day, balancing music with illness","MILAN (AP) — No one was more surprised than Daniel Barenboim himself at the impromptu homecoming to Milan’s Teatro alla Scala as a last-minute sub just two weeks after he formally stepped down as the Berlin's State Opera's music director after 30 years. 

            A towering figure in classical music, the 80-year-old conductor and pianist got a call at 7:15 a.m. on Sunday with an unexpected invitation to conduct three Mozart concerts, after Daniel Harding canceled for family reasons. By Wednesday, Barenboim — who left his Berlin post for health reasons — was running rehearsals at La Scala, a theater where he worked for nearly a decade, as chief conductor and then musical director.

            “It’s as if I had been away for one week. I was very touched, really,’’ Barenboim told The Associated Press, saying more than the faces, he found familiarity in “the sound.”











            There is no question his health remains a chief concern after being diagnosed with what he has described only as a “serious neurological condition.” He moves slowly and takes his time standing up. People who have watched him in rehearsal, however, say his energy is apparent as soon as he picks up the baton. 

            Despite the illness, Barenboim is determined to inhabit the conductor’s podium as much as possible — even if it means doing so sitting down, which he did for a New Year's Concert in Berlin, and which he may do again in Milan. “We will take it day by day,"" he said.

            Barenboim received a standing ovation and more than five minutes of applause at the end of Wednesday night's performance, which he conducted from a seated position. The musicians stomped their feet in appreciation as he came out for final bows. 

            “I know I am expected to say this illness changed my life. No,"" he insisted. “Things that were very important to me as a musician before are still as important. Things that were not important are still not important. I can’t say I feel perfectly, but I feel well enough to conduct tomorrow, and I hope Thursday and Saturday. And next we will see.”

            Piano is another matter. He has only performed twice publicly in the last year, he said. If he plays in private, well, he wants to keep that his business.

            What is clear is that at no time during his seven-decade career traversing the globe, commanding orchestras from Berlin to Milan, Chicago to Paris, did Barenboim ever consider slowing down his frenetic pace. That is until his health issues forced him to.

            “You know, I never felt my age. I never took into consideration that I was not 20, or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 anymore,"" Barenboim said. “I have been hit, but I feel well, and I can make music. I am very happy making music.""

            Giving up the Berlin State Opera, he said, saddened him. “But it was necessary,"" he said. “It is a full-time job. And this I can’t do anymore. I don’t want to do it anymore.”

            Maintaining ties, Barenboim will conduct two concerts with the Berlin State Opera's orchestra, the Staatskapelle Berlin, later this month, and looks to do more. “I don't need to hope. I will do it,” he said. 

            Barenboim made his first public performance at age 7 in his native Argentina.

            His extraordinary biography traces a broad swath of the geopolitical history of the 20th Century, from his Jewish grandparents fleeing Russian pogroms in the early 1900s to his parents' decision to move with him to the newly created Jewish state of Israel when he was 10 because, he said, they wanted him to live “as part of a majority, not part of a minority.”

            He first became aware of the persecution of Jews en route to Israel. His parents took the young Barenboim to Salzburg, for a master class, but would not allow him to accept an invitation to play in Germany because the memory of the Nazi Holocaust was too near. He still struggles to understand why Austria, Hitler's birthplace that annexed with Nazi Germany, was a yes, and Germany a no to his parents.

            Fast-forward decades, and Berlin has been his home for 30 years, and his work reviving the Berlin State Opera, located in what is former East Berlin, is widely credited with relaunching cultural life in Germany after reunification.

            Even against such historical sweep, Barenboim is troubled by the world around him. Putin’s war in Ukraine, which he struggles to comprehend. The state of affairs in Israel. And the decision by some in the West to isolate Russian musicians, which he does not see as justified. “Not all Russians are anti-Ukraine,” he said.

            “Let’s face it, we don’t live in a very spiritual time nowadays. The spiritual dimension has diminished, in all ways,"" Barenboim said. “I think it is very sad, and I hope it’s only a transition. I’ve known the world since the 1950s. For better or worse, I have always been a very happy person to visit the universe. But it has become very matter-of-fact, I find. Very material.”

            He believes people could find salve in music, but that many, even musicians, are too hurried to take time to appreciate it.

            “People don’t know how to listen to music. They don’t have to know the intricate, technical compositional details. But you must concentrate when you listen. You can’t look at the phone and do other things,"" Barenboim said. “And I think you’re supposed to look for this spiritual condition that music can give you. It doesn’t come by itself.”

            Barenboim is continuing his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which he began with writer Edward Said, with plans to conduct this summer in Salzburg and Lucerne, and the Barenboim-Said music academy in Berlin, which launched in 2017.

            Both bring together musicians from countries that have historically been enemies, to promote dialogue.

            He finds their level of cooperation exemplary, and is especially impressed by the students at the academy. He recounts recently watching a performance at the academy: a Palestinian student on the clarinet, an Israeli pupil of Ethiopian origin the first violin, a Syrian the second violin, an Iranian the viola, and the cellist was Israeli.

            “To see this quintet, with what understanding of each other, and what each one is doing and contributing, was heart-warming,"" he said, pausing to consider. “Which means there is hope.”

            The bulk of the joint appeal — $3.9 billion — is for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which aims to help more than 11 million people by funneling funds through more than 650 partner organizations. 

            Refugee agency UNHCR, meanwhile, is seeking $1.7 billion to help some 4.2 million refugees who have fled to 10 host countries in eastern and central Europe.











            The joint appeal, one of the largest of its kind for a single country, could draw a large outpouring of funds from Western countries, as a similar appeal did since the war began. Such U.N. appeals rarely get fully funded. 

            “We were relatively well-funded last year,"" said Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. “I think the refugee appeal was funded in excess of 70% — not total, but quite good. We count on that to last.”

            The appeal comes as a string of crises around the world have stretched the generosity of wealthy donors.

            “Of course, this is not the only crisis in the world,” Grandi added. ""There’s many others that deserve — I’m just back from Ethiopia, Burundi. Who talks about Burundi? Sorry, but this is the reality and people need support as much as anywhere else.”

            The appeal from UNHCR does not cover Russia. Its figures, which are largely drawn from numbers provided by national governments, show that more than 2.8 million refugees from Ukraine have been taken in by Russia. 

            Grandi said Russia gets funds for those refugees “from other sources” — including un-earmarked funds. 

            “We stand ready to do more if it’s needed for any Ukrainian that is in need in Russia,"" he said. ""That offer is on the table and is available.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811143,French pension tension triggers turbulent parliament debate,"PARIS (AP) — Sparks are flying over French President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the retirement age — not just in the streets, but in parliament too. The proposed pension reforms have unleashed the most turbulent debate in years in the National Assembly, with uncertainty looming over the final outcome.

            Tensions at parliament are fed by the unpopularity of the reform aimed at raising the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 and requiring people to have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension, amid other measures. 

            The bill started being examined in the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, last week. Over 20,000 amendments have been proposed, mostly by the leftist opposition coalition Nupes. This makes the debate almost impossible to finish before a Friday night deadline. The government denounced the tactic.











             “What do our fellow citizens see? asked Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne at the National Assembly on Tuesday. ""A held-up debate — held up by the multiplication of amendments... held up by the multiplication of insults… held up by abhorrent personal attacks.”

            In recent days, multiple incidents have marked the debate, from legislators shouting and interrupting each other to insulting remarks toward a minister. In addition, a leftist lawmaker was excluded for 15 days after he tweeted a photo of himself and a soccer ball representing the head of Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt.

            On Monday, another lawmaker of the hard-left France Unbowed party called Dussopt “a murderer” while speaking about growing numbers of fatal workplace accidents in France, prompting outrage across the Assembly’s ranks. The lawmaker apologized. 

            If the debate is not over in the lower house by Friday, the bill will be sent without a vote to the Senate. The end of the legislative process is not expected before next month.

            The parliamentary situation is challenging for Macron, who has made the reform the centerpiece of his second term in office. In last year’s elections, his centrist alliance won the most seats but lost its majority in the National Assembly. That allowed opposition lawmakers from the left and the right to reject article 2 of the bill — requiring companies to publish reports about the proportion of older employees — in a vote late on Tuesday evening. The debate was to resume Wednesday.

            The speaker of the National Assembly, Yael Braun-Pivet, said on RTL radio that the situation is “serious” because “we have been demonstrating for a week … that we are not able to conduct a democratic debate up to the French people’s expectations.”

            Last week, Braun-Pivet also reported that the bill had triggered anonymous voicemails, graffiti and a threatening letter to the head of the chamber’s Social Affairs Committee.

            Alexis Corbière, vice-president of the France Unbowed group at the National Assembly, defended lawmakers' actions in the debate. 

            “If you blame lawmakers for proposing amendments, it’s as if you’re blaming butchers for cutting meat or bakers for making bread … A lawmaker is about speaking. If you want silent MPs, try totalitarian societies, but here, fortunately, we are in a democracy,” he said.

            Sebastien Chenu, vice-president of the far-right National Rally party, which opposes the pension plan, denounced the toxic atmosphere in parliament.

            “I believe that this government is irresponsible for having given too little time to debate and that the Nupes coalition is completely irresponsible in creating a blockade when we must ... vote against (the bill),"" he said.

            Opinion polls consistently show the pension plan is widely unpopular — yet they also show a majority of the French believe it will still be implemented.

            “I first want the work to be able to continue at parliament,” Macron said last week. “That’s how democracy must function.” 

            He also urged unions to show a “spirit of responsibility” and “not block the life of the rest of the country” while staging protest actions.

            A fifth round of demonstrations and strikes is scheduled on Thursday. Nearly 1 million people took to the streets in the latest protest day Saturday according to authorities — up to 2.5 million according to the CGT union, one of the organizers.

            Macron’s alliance hopes it will get support from conservative legislators to ultimately be able to pass the bill.

            The Republicans party said in a statement Tuesday the French pension system “will collapse in five to 10 years” without changes. That’s why, despite being in the opposition, the party decided to support the reform, it said.

            Yet some Republican lawmakers have publicly expressed their disagreement with the bill and said they won't approve it, making the outcome of the vote hard to predict. 

            In addition, if legislators don’t manage to vote on the text by the end of next month, the government could choose to use a special constitutional power to force the bill through. Such a decision would be highly unpopular.

            AP journalists Jeffrey Schaeffer, Oleg Cetinic and Catherine Gaschka contributed to the story.PARIS (AP) — Sparks are flying over French President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the retirement age — not just in the streets, but in parliament too. The proposed pension reforms have unleashed the most turbulent debate in years in the National Assembly, with uncertainty looming over the final outcome.Tensions at parliament are fed by the unpopularity of the reform aimed at raising the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 and requiring people to have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension, amid other measures.The bill started being examined in the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, last week. Over 20,000 amendments have been proposed, mostly by the leftist opposition coalition Nupes. This makes the debate almost impossible to finish before a Friday night deadline. The government denounced the tactic.“What do our fellow citizens see? asked Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne at the National Assembly on Tuesday. ""A held-up debate — held up by the multiplication of amendments... held up by the multiplication of insults… held up by abhorrent personal attacks.”In recent days, multiple incidents have marked the debate, from legislators shouting and interrupting each other to insulting remarks toward a minister. In addition, a leftist lawmaker was excluded for 15 days after he tweeted a photo of himself and a soccer ball representing the head of Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt.On Monday, another lawmaker of the hard-left France Unbowed party called Dussopt “a murderer” while speaking about growing numbers of fatal workplace accidents in France, prompting outrage across the Assembly’s ranks. The lawmaker apologized.If the debate is not over in the lower house by Friday, the bill will be sent without a vote to the Senate. The end of the legislative process is not expected before next month.The parliamentary situation is challenging for Macron, who has made the reform the centerpiece of his second term in office. In last year’s elections, his centrist alliance won the most seats but lost its majority in the National Assembly. That allowed opposition lawmakers from the left and the right to reject article 2 of the bill — requiring companies to publish reports about the proportion of older employees — in a vote late on Tuesday evening. The debate was to resume Wednesday.The speaker of the National Assembly, Yael Braun-Pivet, said on RTL radio that the situation is “serious” because “we have been demonstrating for a week … that we are not able to conduct a democratic debate up to the French people’s expectations.”Last week, Braun-Pivet also reported that the bill had triggered anonymous voicemails, graffiti and a threatening letter to the head of the chamber’s Social Affairs Committee.Alexis Corbière, vice-president of the France Unbowed group at the National Assembly, defended lawmakers' actions in the debate.“If you blame lawmakers for proposing amendments, it’s as if you’re blaming butchers for cutting meat or bakers for making bread … A lawmaker is about speaking. If you want silent MPs, try totalitarian societies, but here, fortunately, we are in a democracy,” he said.Sebastien Chenu, vice-president of the far-right National Rally party, which opposes the pension plan, denounced the toxic atmosphere in parliament.“I believe that this government is irresponsible for having given too little time to debate and that the Nupes coalition is completely irresponsible in creating a blockade when we must ... vote against (the bill),"" he said.Opinion polls consistently show the pension plan is widely unpopular — yet they also show a majority of the French believe it will still be implemented.“I first want the work to be able to continue at parliament,” Macron said last week. “That’s how democracy must function.”He also urged unions to show a “spirit of responsibility” and “not block the life of the rest of the country” while staging protest actions.A fifth round of demonstrations and strikes is scheduled on Thursday. Nearly 1 million people took to the streets in the latest protest day Saturday according to authorities — up to 2.5 million according to the CGT union, one of the organizers.Macron’s alliance hopes it will get support from conservative legislators to ultimately be able to pass the bill.The Republicans party said in a statement Tuesday the French pension system “will collapse in five to 10 years” without changes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811198,Russia claims minor Ukraine progress; Kyiv readies offensive,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces claimed some battlefield success Wednesday as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine labored to gain momentum almost a year after it began, while Ukraine said it needs another few months to stage its own offensive.

            The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops broke through two Ukrainian defensive lines in the eastern Luhansk region and pushed back Ukrainian troops some three kilometers (two miles), forcing them to leave behind equipment and the bodies of those killed.

            It was not possible to independently verify Moscow's claim. Ukrainian official s made no immediate comment.











            Russian artillery, drones and missiles have relentlessly pounded Ukrainian-held areas in the country's east for months, indiscriminately hitting civilian targets and wreaking destruction, as the war largely slowed to a grinding stalemate in the winter. Moscow is hungry for some progress after months of setbacks.

            Meanwhile, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said his country’s forces would need “a few months” to learn how to use new Western weapons before they can try and push the Russians out of Ukraine.

            The Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which together make up the industrial Donbas region bordering Russia, continue to bear the brunt of Russia's bombardments as Moscow reportedly moves more troops into the area.

            In Luhansk, the number of Russian ground and air attacks is “growing every day,” Gov. Serhii Haidai said on Ukrainian TV.

            “The Russians were able to transfer new forces for the offensive and now they are trying to overwhelm us with sheer human mass,” Haidai said. 

            Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said Wednesday that one town had come under “nonstop” fire from multiple rocket launchers for over three hours the previous day that damaged at least 12 residential buildings. 

            At least 12 civilians were wounded when Russian forces struck a five-story apartment block in the city of Pokrovsk, Kyrylenko said. Two others remained under the rubble.

            Meanwhile, Kyiv’s military administration said that six apparent reconnaissance balloons were detected floating over the capital on Wednesday. Ukrainian air defense systems shot down “most of” them, an online statement read, adding that the balloons “could carry corner reflectors and certain reconnaissance equipment” and were designed to “identify and deplete” Ukraine’s air defenses.

            The statement promised more details about the objects following “a detailed study and analysis.”

            With the one-year anniversary of Russia’s war approaching, followed by improved spring weather, Western officials and analysts say the fighting could be nearing a critical phase when both sides look to launch offensives.

            The Kremlin is striving to secure eastern areas it illegally annexed in September — the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions — and where it claims its rule is welcomed. Pro-Moscow separatists have controlled part of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province since 2014.

            “The enemy, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, continues to focus his main efforts on conducting offensive operations in the Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Shakhtarsk areas,” the Ukrainian military reported, referencing towns in the two provinces as well as on the eastern edge of the neighboring Kharkiv region.

            Kyiv’s continued defense of Bakhmut, a Donetsk province mining town that for months has been a key target of Russia’s campaign in the east, has been “strategically sound” because it sapped Moscow’s momentum, a U.S. think tank said. 

            Kyiv’s defense has “degraded significant Russian forces,” including units from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military contractor, the Institute for the Study of War said late Tuesday.

            Some analysts had doubted the wisdom of Ukraine holding out in Bakhmut because it could hurt the chances of its expected spring offensive.

            On Wednesday, however, the Wagner Group's owner acknowledged in comments to Russian media that it could take weeks for his forces to encircle the city.

            Russia’s state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Yevgeny Prigozhin as saying that his personnel might have Bakhmut surrounded in “March-April.” 

            “Although it is hard to estimate. They (Ukrainian forces) are now getting new types of weapons. (It’s) 100% that we will be destroying these (German-made) Leopard (tanks), 100% that we will figure out how to burn them down. But it is still an important factor,” Prigozhin said.

            Prigozhin said though his spokespeople earlier this week that the “toughest battles” were underway north of Bakhmut. His soldiers were storming the area “house by house, square meter by square meter” while the Ukrainian army intensified artillery fire and deployed up to 500 new fighters to the embattled city every day, he said. 

            Ukrainian officials have not provided details about their troop movements and tactics to defend the city. 

            Last week, Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, said that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Donbas. 

            He predicted the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture even more territory east of the Dnieper River.

            Prigozhin's remarks represented a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties the Kremlin has faced in eastern Ukraine, where it initially expected its troops to wrap up within weeks after invading the country on Feb, 24, 2022. 

            Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.

            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday claimed that Western support for Kyiv’s war effort was prearranged, telling the lower house of Russian parliament that “the U.S. and its satellites are waging a comprehensive hybrid war following years of preparation.” 

            Lavrov said a revised Russian foreign policy doctrine to be published soon will emphasize the need to “end the Western monopoly on shaping frameworks of international life.”

Pro-Moscow separatists have controlled part of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province since 2014.“The enemy, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, continues to focus his main efforts on conducting offensive operations in the Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Shakhtarsk areas,” the Ukrainian military reported, referencing towns in the two provinces as well as on the eastern edge of the neighboring Kharkiv region.Kyiv’s continued defense of Bakhmut, a Donetsk province mining town that for months has been a key target of Russia’s campaign in the east, has been “strategically sound” because it sapped Moscow’s momentum, a U.S. think tank said.Kyiv’s defense has “degraded significant Russian forces,” including units from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military contractor, the Institute for the Study of War said late Tuesday.Some analysts had doubted the wisdom of Ukraine holding out in Bakhmut because it could hurt the chances of its expected spring offensive.On Wednesday, however, the Wagner Group's owner acknowledged in comments to Russian media that it could take weeks for his forces to encircle the city.Russia’s state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Yevgeny Prigozhin as saying that his personnel might have Bakhmut surrounded in “March-April.”“Although it is hard to estimate. They (Ukrainian forces) are now getting new types of weapons. (It’s) 100% that we will be destroying these (German-made) Leopard (tanks), 100% that we will figure out how to burn them down. But it is still an important factor,” Prigozhin said.Prigozhin said though his spokespeople earlier this week that the “toughest battles” were underway north of Bakhmut. His soldiers were storming the area “house by house, square meter by square meter” while the Ukrainian army intensified artillery fire and deployed up to 500 new fighters to the embattled city every day, he said.Ukrainian officials have not provided details about their troop movements and tactics to defend the city.Last week, Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, said that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Donbas.He predicted the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture even more territory east of the Dnieper River.Prigozhin's remarks represented a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties the Kremlin has faced in eastern Ukraine, where it initially expected its troops to wrap up within weeks after invading the country on Feb, 24, 2022.Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday claimed that Western support for Kyiv’s war effort was prearranged, telling the lower house of Russian parliament that “the U.S. and its satellites are waging a comprehensive hybrid war following years of preparation.”Lavrov said a revised Russian foreign policy doctrine to be published soon will emphasize the need to “end the Western monopoly on shaping frameworks of international life.”___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/2/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811243,IRS nominee Werfel faces questioning on 'thankless' job,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican and Democratic senators who have been arguing over how much money to give the IRS and how it should be spent found at least one point of unanimity Wednesday as they considered President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the agency: Both sides wished Danny Werfel good luck with the worst job in Washington.

            
                Werfel pledged before senators not to expand tax audits on businesses and households making less than $400,000 per year, a key point of concern to legislators, as he faced rounds of questions before the Senate Finance Committee on how he would spend the agency's big new infusion of money. He drew praise for being willing to leave a private consulting job to take on the top job at the troubled agency.

            Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called the job “one of the more thankless tasks” in Washington. Sen James Lankford, R-Okla., said Werfel was “walking right into fire.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told Werfel the IRS was never going to be one of the most admired agencies in Washington given its mission of collecting taxes. And Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., offered Werfel best wishes in one of the “least popular jobs in town.”











            A vote on Werfel's nomination will be scheduled after the committee allows time for him to answer follow-up questions. But the bipartisan acknowledgment of the tough job ahead served as a reminder of just how beleaguered the national tax collector has become in recent decades and the work it will take to modernize the organization. 

            President Joe Biden nominated Werfel to steer the IRS as it receives nearly $80 billion over the next 10 years through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress passed in August. Taking note of the potential impact of the funding, Werfel said “Americans rightfully expect a more modern and high-performing IRS.”

            Werfel, 51, said he would be “unyielding in following my true north to increase public trust” in the agency even as he works to modernize the agency's technology, address its paperwork burden and audit high-income earners. 

            Werfel, who led Boston Consulting Group’s global public sector practice, would replace Charles Rettig, whose five-year term ended in November. An acting commissioner has been filling in.

            Werfel will have to navigate controversy surrounding the new funding as critics distort how the new law would affect the IRS and taxes for the middle class. About $46 billion was allocated for enforcing tax laws and the rest to taxpayer services, operations support and updating business systems.

            Republicans have suggested without evidence that the agency would use the new money to hire an army of tax agents with weapons.

            Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Republican concerns center around potential misuse of government funding.

            Taxpayers “are rightly concerned about the vitality of their taxpayer rights” he said. 

            Werfel pulled out a paper copy of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights and said he pledged to read the document every day if confirmed to the role. 

            ”I'm ready to roll up my sleeves to help working families,"" he said. 

            Senators on both sides of the aisle probed the IRS' intent to audit more high-income earners — and Werfel's commitment not to expand audits of households and businesses making less than $400,000 per year. 

            House Republicans began their tenure in the majority last month by passing a bill that would rescind new IRS funding. That legislation has not advanced in the Senate and is unlikely to reach Biden, who has promised a veto.

            Caroline Bruckner, a tax professor at the American University Kogod School of Business, said that, if confirmed, Werfel would have to address the massive workforce challenges at the IRS wrought by attrition, an aging workforce and a generally poor reputation. 

            “The next generation of accountants don't want to work for the IRS,” Bruckner said. She added, ""To attract the best talent, particularly with Millennials and Gen-Z workers who will be the future of the workforce, transparency as a leader will go a long way.”

            Bruckner referred to a Stanford University study that showed IRS data-driven algorithms chose Black taxpayers for audit at up to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. “The next generation of workers care about these things, and this is a leadership challenge,"" she said.

            Werfel said he would “absolutely” report to the Senate Finance committee within 60 days of his confirmation on the matter.

            “The bottom line is what will build trust with the taxpayers,” Werfel said.WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican and Democratic senators who have been arguing over how much money to give the IRS and how it should be spent found at least one point of unanimity Wednesday as they considered President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the agency: Both sides wished Danny Werfel good luck with the worst job in Washington.Werfel pledged before senators not to expand tax audits on businesses and households making less than $400,000 per year, a key point of concern to legislators, as he faced rounds of questions before the Senate Finance Committee on how he would spend the agency's big new infusion of money.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811244,Study shows 'striking' number who believe news misinforms,"NEW YORK (AP) — Half of Americans in a recent survey indicated they believe national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public to adopt a particular point of view through their reporting.

            The survey, released Wednesday by Gallup and the Knight Foundation, goes beyond others that have shown a low level of trust in the media to the startling point where many believe there is an intent to deceive.

            Asked whether they agreed with the statement that national news organizations do not intend to mislead, 50% said they disagreed. Only 25% agreed, the study found.











            Similarly, 52% disagreed with a statement that disseminators of national news “care about the best interests of their readers, viewers and listeners,” the study found. It said 23% of respondents believed the journalists were acting in the public's best interests.

            “That was pretty striking for us,” said Sarah Fioroni, a consultant for Gallup. The findings showed a depth of distrust and bad feeling that go beyond the foundations and processes of journalism, she said.

            Journalists need to go beyond emphasizing transparency and accuracy to show the impact of their reporting on the public, the study said.

            “Americans don’t seem to think that the national news organizations care about the overall impact of their reporting on the society,” said John Sands, Knight’s senior director for media and democracy.

            In one small consolation, in both cases Americans had more trust in local news.

            The ability of many people to instantly learn news from a device they hold in their hand, the rapid pace of the news cycle and an increased number of news sources would indicate that more Americans are on top of the news than ever before.

            Instead, an information overload appears to have had the opposite effect. The survey said 61% of American believe these factors make it harder to stay informed, while 37% said it's easier.

            Like with many other studies, Knight and Gallup found Democrats trust news more than Republicans. Over the past five years, the level of distrust has particularly spiked among independents. Overall, 55% of respondents said there was a great deal of political bias in coverage, compared to 45% in 2017.

            In a finding reflected in the financial struggles of some news organizations and declining ratings of television news networks, the survey found 32% of Americans said they pay a great deal of attention to local news, compared to 56% in early 2020. That was at the outset of a presidential election year and the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.

            In a picture of how people get their news, 58% said online, 31% said television, 7% said radio and 3% mentioned printed newspapers or magazines.

            For members of Gen Z, aged 18- to 25-years-old, 88% said they got their news online, the survey found.

            In one olive branch, if Americans believed local news organizations didn't have the resources or opportunities to cover the news, they would be more likely to pay for it.

            The results are based on a Gallup study of 5,593 Americans aged 18 and older conducted between May 31 and July 21, 2022.NEW YORK (AP) — Half of Americans in a recent survey indicated they believe national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public to adopt a particular point of view through their reporting.The survey, released Wednesday by Gallup and the Knight Foundation, goes beyond others that have shown a low level of trust in the media to the startling point where many believe there is an intent to deceive.Asked whether they agreed with the statement that national news organizations do not intend to mislead, 50% said they disagreed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811245,Biden says GOP plans would drive US debt up by $3 trillion,"LANHAM, Maryland (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday said Republican policies would blow up the national debt by $3 trillion over 10 years, taking direct aim at GOP lawmakers who say their priority is a balancing the federal budget.

            “It would explode the deficit and leave the American taxpayer holding the bag,” the president said in a Wednesday speech.

            The president said his budget, which is set to be released March 9, would protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, while reducing the national debt by $2 trillion over a decade. One key driver of Biden’s planned deficit reduction appears to be his willingness to increase taxes on the wealthiest U.S. households. 











            “I want to reward work, not just wealth,” Biden told union workers gathered in Lanham, Maryland.

            The president essentially charged the GOP with hypocrisy for favoring tax policies that could push the accumulated $31.4 trillion national debt higher. But Biden, too, wants to preserve some of the same tax cuts as Republicans so long as the approach is “fiscally responsible.”

            The speech was the latest evolution in a political and economic debate that will play out over several months. Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy need to reach a deal by midsummer on raising the government's legal borrowing authority or else the government could lack the funds to pay its bills and default.

            McCarthy, R-Calif., says they should agree on a path toward balancing the budget, posting on Twitter last Friday, “No more blank checks for runaway government spending.”

            The president detailed a recent exchange with the GOP speaker in a speech Tuesday in Washington to county government officials. He told them that McCarthy “made it real clear to me what he wants to do. He says he’s not going to raise any taxes at all on anybody. He just wants to cut programs.""

            The president said Republican lawmakers should present their budget plan to the public, just as the White House intends to do.

            “I believe we could be fiscally responsible without risking — threatening to send our country into chaos,” Biden said Tuesday of debt limit talks.

            But the actual path of the national debt could hinge on the upcoming expiration of individual tax cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017. Extending those tax cuts would in theory raise the national debt, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based its projections on them lapsing after 2025. 

            The CBO released an updated budget outlook Wednesday, estimating that total publicly held debt would top $46.4 trillion in 2033. Separately, the CBO said the president and Congress would have some time between July and September to raise the debt limit, at which point the Treasury Department would exhaust its extraordinary measures and default would become a risk.

            The White House fact sheet said Republicans would increase the debt by $2.7 trillion by prolonging those tax cuts, in addition to cutting a corporate minimum tax established by Biden and other policies that would add to the debt.

            The White House noted that the extension of the Trump-era tax overhaul would give a $175,000 tax cut to families with incomes over $4 million. The size of that tax cut is roughly double the median U.S. household income.

            But the same White House fact sheet adds that Biden would like to preserve some of the same tax cuts as Republicans, just not those that benefit the wealthy. Biden pledged during the 2020 campaign to not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000, so letting the tax cuts expire could be viewed as a tax hike on the middle class.

            The Tax Policy Center, a think tank, estimated when the law was passed that 53% of taxpayers would see their IRS bills increase in 2027 after the cuts expire. About 70% of those solidly in the middle class — the middle 40% to 60% of all taxpayers — would owe more.

            The fact sheet previewing the speech said the president is committed to a “fiscally responsible approach to continuing current tax policies"" for people earning less than $400,000. It's not entirely clear what that could mean for the national debt, despite Biden repeating Wednesday his promise in last week's State of the Union address to cut deficits by $2 trillion.

            That leaves Republicans and Democrats theoretically in agreement on keeping taxes low for most people, while leaders in both parties have pledged no cuts to Social Security or Medicare.

            Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that lawmakers should be open minded and consider changes across the board in order to lower deficits.

            “Everything should be on the table to get our unsustainable fiscal problems under control,” she said in a statement.LANHAM, Maryland (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday said Republican policies would blow up the national debt by $3 trillion over 10 years, taking direct aim at GOP lawmakers who say their priority is a balancing the federal budget.“It would explode the deficit and leave the American taxpayer holding the bag,” the president said in a Wednesday speech.The president said his budget, which is set to be released March 9, would protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, while reducing the national debt by $2 trillion over a decade. One key driver of Biden’s planned deficit reduction appears to be his willingness to increase taxes on the wealthiest U.S. households.“I want to reward work, not just wealth,” Biden told union workers gathered in Lanham, Maryland.The president essentially charged the GOP with hypocrisy for favoring tax policies that could push the accumulated $31.4 trillion national debt higher. But Biden, too, wants to preserve some of the same tax cuts as Republicans so long as the approach is “fiscally responsible.”The speech was the latest evolution in a political and economic debate that will play out over several months. Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy need to reach a deal by midsummer on raising the government's legal borrowing authority or else the government could lack the funds to pay its bills and default.McCarthy, R-Calif., says they should agree on a path toward balancing the budget, posting on Twitter last Friday, “No more blank checks for runaway government spending.”The president detailed a recent exchange with the GOP speaker in a speech Tuesday in Washington to county government officials. He told them that McCarthy “made it real clear to me what he wants to do. He says he’s not going to raise any taxes at all on anybody. He just wants to cut programs.""The president said Republican lawmakers should present their budget plan to the public, just as the White House intends to do.“I believe we could be fiscally responsible without risking — threatening to send our country into chaos,” Biden said Tuesday of debt limit talks.But the actual path of the national debt could hinge on the upcoming expiration of individual tax cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017. Extending those tax cuts would in theory raise the national debt, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based its projections on them lapsing after 2025.The CBO released an updated budget outlook Wednesday, estimating that total publicly held debt would top $46.4 trillion in 2033. Separately, the CBO said the president and Congress would have some time between July and September to raise the debt limit, at which point the Treasury Department would exhaust its extraordinary measures and default would become a risk.The White House fact sheet said Republicans would increase the debt by $2.7 trillion by prolonging those tax cuts, in addition to cutting a corporate minimum tax established by Biden and other policies that would add to the debt.The White House noted that the extension of the Trump-era tax overhaul would give a $175,000 tax cut to families with incomes over $4 million. The size of that tax cut is roughly double the median U.S. household income.But the same White House fact sheet adds that Biden would like to preserve some of the same tax cuts as Republicans, just not those that benefit the wealthy. Biden pledged during the 2020 campaign to not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000, so letting the tax cuts expire could be viewed as a tax hike on the middle class.The Tax Policy Center, a think tank, estimated when the law was passed that 53% of taxpayers would see their IRS bills increase in 2027 after the cuts expire.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811246,Former youth world champion Wambui banned 2 years for doping,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Former 800-meter youth world champion Jackline Wambui of Kenya was banned for two years on Wednesday after testing positive for the substance norandrosterone.

            The 23-year-old Wambui's ban was backdated to start on Dec. 20, 2021, the date of her provisional suspension, the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya said.

            Wambui won gold over two laps at the 2017 under-18 world championships in Kenya. She was also the 2019 African junior champion but was one of the Kenyan athletes to withdraw from that year's senior world championships in Qatar after failing to take a mandatory doping test.











            Norandrosterone is a metabolite of the anabolic steroid nandrolone.

            Wambui's ban is another in a long list of recent doping punishments handed out to Kenyan athletes.

            The East African nation has been under scrutiny for years because of the apparent failure of its doping controls and had to make guarantees to track governing body World Athletics last year to avoid an all-out ban for the country.

""When it comes to navigating choppy waters, resolving seemingly intractable issues, or soldiering on when walking away would be the simpler option, I have plenty of experience to draw on.""""This decision comes from a deeper and long-term assessment,"" she said, adding she had been wrestling with it for some weeks.Sturgeon said she would remain as leader of the Scottish government until a successor was found. The Scottish National Party (SNP) leader attributed the decision to the personal toll that the relentless nature of the role, saying that her tenure was ""now in danger of becoming too long.""She became the leader of the ruling SNP in the wake of a 2014 independence referendum, in which the country voted 55% to 45% to remain as part of the United Kingdom.Several UK media outlets, including the BBC and The Guardian newspaper, had reported Sturgeon's planned resignation. The BBC reported a source close to Sturgeon as saying: ""She's had enough.""Sturgeon suffered a major setback in November when the UK's Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish government needed approval from the British parliament to hold a second referendum on independence.The Scottish leader had also recently become embroiled in a dispute over transgender policies, with the legislature in Edinburgh passing a bill to make it easier for people to change their legal gender.The UK government used a rarely invoked power to block the law, arguing that it could undermine UK-wide equality legislation guaranteeing access to single-sex spaces for women and girls.More to come...",2023/2/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811274,Almuth Schult: Putting motherhood above the World Cup,"The World Cup is usually the peak of any footballer's career. But a footballer's career is not necessarily a footballer's life.""Family was always my first priority. It has been my whole life. I learned  from my parents that this is the most important thing in the world,"" Almuth Schult tells DW.The Olympics, Bundesliga and Champions League-winnning goalkeeper is true to her word and announced recently that she's expecting another child in August. Schult gave birth to twins in 2020 and got back to full match fitness in time to be part of the Germany squad at the COVID-delayed Euro 2021, eventually played last year.Though she enjoyed taking the twins around England for the Euros with the Germany squad, Schult said that planning her family around tournaments, or other major events in the football calendar, has never been for her.""You can have a break in your career, and I know the reason I'm doing this. I have two healthy and happy kids. That's the best thing and I'm fine with this,"" she said.But Schult also acknowledged that her status in the game made life easier for her than it would be for those who haven't scaled the heights before.""I played every major tournament in women's football….and I'm grateful for this. So it's maybe a little easier to miss a World Cup.""Though it's starting to become more common, Schult's situation is unusual.""I was the first player in about 20 years in Germany who came back from pregnancy to play for the national team [a World Cup qualifier in 2022]. Usually the thinking was that when you were pregnant, your career was over, so they were not prepared for having children around,"" she said.The same was often true at her club in Germany, Wolfsburg. There are currently no mothers playing in the Bundesliga and, as such, provision for them is poor to non-existent.""For example, the first time I could take them to away games or to a training camp there was some kind of fight required. Afterwards, they were really surprised how well the kids behaved, that they didn't disturb anyone and had this positive impact.""But there are always questions about who's paying for everything. There is much more cost when you bring two children and the person caring for them. These are the questions that have to be answered. And we are still in this process of getting those frameworks in place.""The 32-year-old found more support during a recent stint with Angel City FC, in the USA.""They were really open minded. I could bring the kids everywhere when I wanted to,” she said. ""Also my husband was really welcomed with open arms. That was a real good feeling. I think in Europe it's not that usual to have kids around, in the US it's much more usual.""Schult welcomes the publicity over the successful case of her former Wolfsburg teammate Sara Björk Gunnarsdottir against French side Lyon last month. It re-iterated that clubs must abide by FIFA rules that state that professional female football players are entitled to maternity leave at two-thirds pay for at least 14 weeks. In addition, clubs are not allowed to discriminate against or sack players because of their pregnancy, and must reinstate them after giving birth.As important as those protections are, they are not a silver bullet. Female players are often on short-term contracts, making their financial and employment position precarious.""It's hard when you're thinking about having a child. Maybe you find out in February that you're pregnant and you know your contract only runs for another four months until the summer. So you talk to the club and they say: 'let's talk again in April'. Then that comes and you have to tell them you're pregnant and can't play for some time. Then they won't renew and you're out, you've lost your job in one moment, at a bad time.""Schult was determined from very early on to be a pioneer for women, and German women in particular, who want to have a child during their careers. She believes it's her duty to speak out and that football shouldn't be losing players because they are mothers. She points to former Germany teammates Celia Sasic and Fatmire ‘Lira' Alushi as examples of players who retired early and may not have needed or wanted to, had support structures been better.Her international teammate Melanie Leupolz has recently returned to action at Chelsea after having a baby boy in late 2022. Schult is in touch with her and sees positive changes in how football treats motherhood. But there's a way to go until it's as normal for a footballer to be a mother as it is for a doctor, a cleaner, a lawyer or a shop assistant.""We have to talk more about it. Not only the players, it's also up to the associations and the clubs, because they have to prepare. Players are curious about a lot of things; how it works with the club, what it looks like when the pregnancy is done, and what mothers need or pregnant athletes need.""Though she's happy taking time to be with her family, Schult plans to get back to football, to ""play for another team and in another league."" With Germany number 1 Merle Frohms taking her starting spot at Wolfsburg and Schult reluctant to play for any other German team, she's ruled out returning to the Bundesliga.Come August, Schult's former teammates will be hoping to find joy in the knockout rounds of the World Cup. But she will be finding her own joy in something she feels is much more important.Edited by Chuck Penfold.",2023/2/15,,

Its capture could provide Russia with a stepping stone to further cities in the region and potentially give momentum to its offensive.NATO's defense ministers were meeting in Brussels for a two-day gathering to discuss the war and ammunition stocks.Zelenskyy said Russia was rushing to advance as far as it could before Ukraine could muster strength.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811278,White House: Tesla to make some EV chargers available to all,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Electric car giant Tesla will, for the first time, make some of its charging stations available to all U.S. electric vehicles by the end of next year, under a new plan announced Wednesday by the White House.

            The plan will make at least 7,500 chargers from Tesla's Supercharger and Destination Charger network available to non-Tesla EVs by the end of 2024, the White House said. 

            The plan to open the nation's largest and most reliable charging network to all drivers is a potential game-changer in promoting EV use, a key component of President Joe Biden's pledge to fight climate change. Biden has set a goal that 50% of new U.S. car sales be electric by 2030, and he has promised to install 500,000 chargers across America and build a network of fast-charging stations across 53,000 miles of freeways from coast to coast.











            ""As President Biden said, the great American road trip will be electrified,' ' said Mitch Landrieu, a White House aide who oversees implementation of the 2021 infrastructure law signed by Biden.

            Soon, charging an EV ""will be as easy as filling up at a gas station,'' Landrieu told reporters Tuesday ahead of the White House announcement. 

            The plan to open up Tesla's charging network was among a series of developments announced Wednesday by the White House, including new standards to make EV charging networks convenient and reliable for all Americans and made-in-America requirements for EV components.

            “No matter what EV you drive, we want to make sure that you will be able to plug in, know the price you’re going to be paying and charge up in a predictable, user-friendly experience,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

            Standards imposed by the Transportation Department require that EV chargers funded through the infrastructure law be built in the United States, effective immediately. By July 2024, 55% of the cost of all components must come from the U.S.

            Automakers warned before the rules were issued that imposing made-in-America requirements on EV components could harm EV growth.

            Biden, who has clashed with Musk over a range of issues, praised the billionaire on Twitter, the social media platform Musk bought last year.

            Musk's decision to open up Tesla's charging network to all drivers is ""a big deal, and it'll make a big difference,'' Biden tweeted late Wednesday.

            Musk tweeted his thanks to Biden, adding, ""Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network.''

            By opening up its network, Tesla will be eligible to compete for federal grants to help create a nationwide charging network. The infrastructure law blocks federal subsidies for chargers that only serve one brand. 

            Tesla, General Motors, EVgo, Pilot, Hertz and other companies have agreed to add thousands of public charging ports in the next two years, using private funds and federal spending from the infrastructure law, ""putting the nation’s EV charging goals even closer within reach,'' the White House said. 

            Under the administration's plan, Tesla will set up charging sites at hotels, restaurants and other public spaces in urban and rural locations, the White House said. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website, officials said. Tesla plans to triple its nationwide network of Superchargers over the next few years, the White House said.

            The developments come after Landrieu and another top White House aide, John Podesta, met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington last month. Biden did not attend the meeting, which centered on the EV industry and the broader goal of electrification of the U.S. economy, the White House said.

            A week later, the Treasury Department said it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions. The revised standards follow lobbying by Tesla and other automakers to change vehicle definitions to allow higher-priced EVs to qualify for a maximum tax credit. 

            
                Tesla raised prices on its Model Y SUV within hours of the Treasury announcement.

            Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse Insight, said the agreement to open up Tesla chargers to non-Tesla EVs ""is potentially a very big deal.''

            The plan ""should be a big help to non-Tesla EV drivers if they can use the Tesla network and if the network remains as reliable as it is today,'' he said. A lack of high-quality public chargers on U.S. roads has slowed the growth of EV sales and is often cited by potential buyers as a leading obstacle to purchase of an EV.

            While the White House said the Tesla network should be available through use of a company app or website, an adaptor — or even a new charger design — will likely be required for non-Tesla EVs, Abuelsamid said.

            Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner, said the agreement with Tesla was important on its own, but also as a sign of relative peace between Musk and the Biden administration. Musk has repeatedly clashed with Biden and other Democrats, and as the new owner of Twitter, Musk has released a slew of company information showing internal debates among Twitter employees over a decision to block a story about Hunter Biden, the president’s son.

            “It's not good for the U.S. government to alienate the top seller of EVs,'' Ramsey said in an interview. 

            The Biden administration “needs Musk's help to grow EV use” in the United States, he added, and the new agreement ""is a sign the government is working with the world's most important EV maker.''WASHINGTON (AP) — Electric car giant Tesla will, for the first time, make some of its charging stations available to all U.S. electric vehicles by the end of next year, under a new plan announced Wednesday by the White House.The plan will make at least 7,500 chargers from Tesla's Supercharger and Destination Charger network available to non-Tesla EVs by the end of 2024, the White House said.The plan to open the nation's largest and most reliable charging network to all drivers is a potential game-changer in promoting EV use, a key component of President Joe Biden's pledge to fight climate change.

The infrastructure law blocks federal subsidies for chargers that only serve one brand.Tesla, General Motors, EVgo, Pilot, Hertz and other companies have agreed to add thousands of public charging ports in the next two years, using private funds and federal spending from the infrastructure law, ""putting the nation’s EV charging goals even closer within reach,'' the White House said.Under the administration's plan, Tesla will set up charging sites at hotels, restaurants and other public spaces in urban and rural locations, the White House said. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website, officials said. Tesla plans to triple its nationwide network of Superchargers over the next few years, the White House said.The developments come after Landrieu and another top White House aide, John Podesta, met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington last month. Biden did not attend the meeting, which centered on the EV industry and the broader goal of electrification of the U.S. economy, the White House said.A week later, the Treasury Department said it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions. The revised standards follow lobbying by Tesla and other automakers to change vehicle definitions to allow higher-priced EVs to qualify for a maximum tax credit.Tesla raised prices on its Model Y SUV within hours of the Treasury announcement.Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse Insight, said the agreement to open up Tesla chargers to non-Tesla EVs ""is potentially a very big deal.''The plan ""should be a big help to non-Tesla EV drivers if they can use the Tesla network and if the network remains as reliable as it is today,'' he said. A lack of high-quality public chargers on U.S. roads has slowed the growth of EV sales and is often cited by potential buyers as a leading obstacle to purchase of an EV.While the White House said the Tesla network should be available through use of a company app or website, an adaptor — or even a new charger design — will likely be required for non-Tesla EVs, Abuelsamid said.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner, said the agreement with Tesla was important on its own, but also as a sign of relative peace between Musk and the Biden administration. Musk has repeatedly clashed with Biden and other Democrats, and as the new owner of Twitter, Musk has released a slew of company information showing internal debates among Twitter employees over a decision to block a story about Hunter Biden, the president’s son.“It's not good for the U.S. government to alienate the top seller of EVs,'' Ramsey said in an interview.The Biden administration “needs Musk's help to grow EV use” in the United States, he added, and the new agreement ""is a sign the government is working with the world's most important EV maker.''",2023/2/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811279,Scottish leader Sturgeon quits with independence goal unmet,"LONDON (AP) — Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said Wednesday that she plans to step down after more than eight years in office, amid criticism of her drive to expand transgender rights and her strategy for achieving independence from the United Kingdom.

            Sturgeon made the surprise announcement during a news conference at her official residence in Edinburgh, Bute House, saying the decision wasn’t a response to the “latest period of pressure.” But she added that part of serving well was knowing when to make way for someone else.

            “In my head and in my heart I know that time is now,” she said. “That it’s right for me, for my party and my country.”











            Sturgeon, 52, has led Scotland since 2014, when Scots narrowly voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. While the referendum was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision on independence, Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party have pushed for a new vote, arguing that Britain’s departure from the European Union had changed the ground rules. 

            
                The U.K. government has refused to allow a second referendum.

            The first female leader of Scotland’s devolved government, Sturgeon won praise for her calm, measured public communications during the pandemic — a contrast to the erratic messaging of then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

            She led her party to dominance in Scottish politics but leaves office with the goal of her political life — independence — unfulfilled.

            Sturgeon said she planned to remain in office until the SNP elects a new leader. Scotland is part of the U.K. but, like Wales and Northern Ireland, has its own semi-autonomous government with broad powers over areas including health care.

            Sturgeon’s announcement caught political observers by surprise amid her staunch support for both independence and legislation that would make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change genders. Just two weeks ago she scoffed at resignation rumors, saying she still had “plenty in the tank.”

            “This is as sudden as Jacinda Ardern … Geez,” tweeted SNP lawmaker Angus MacNeil, referring to the resignation last month of New Zealand’s prime minister.

            Sturgeon came under pressure in recent weeks after she pushed the gender recognition bill through the Scottish parliament over the objections of some members of her own party. That raised concerns that Sturgeon’s position on transgender rights could undermine support for independence, the SNP’s overarching goal.

            Joanna Cherry, an SNP member of Parliament who opposes the new gender law, said the resignation provided an opportunity for the party.

            “We must restore the SNP’s tradition of internal party democracy, open respectful debate and intellectual rigour and we must also put the welfare of everyone living in Scotland back at the heart of our endeavours,” Cherry said on Twitter.

            Sturgeon said she had been “wrestling” with whether it was time step down for weeks. She said she wasn’t resigning because of recent criticism, though she acknowledged that the “physical and mental impact” of the job had taken their toll. 

            Sturgeon led Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic and guided her party during three U.K.-wide elections and two Scottish elections.

            “If the question is, can I battle on for another few months, then the answer is yes, of course I can,” she said. “But if the question is, can I give this job everything it demands and deserves for another year, let alone for the remainder of this parliamentary term, give it every ounce of energy that it needs in the way that I have strived to do every day for the last eight years, the answer honestly is different.”

            Sturgeon weathered a period of scandal after her predecessor and former mentor Alex Salmond was tried and acquitted in 2020 on charges of sexual assault and attempted rape. A parliamentary investigation found that Sturgeon had misled lawmakers about what she knew, though she was cleared of major wrongdoing. In 2021 Salmond opened a rift in the independence movement by quitting the SNP to form a rival party, Alba.

            For the past few months, much of Sturgeon's energy has been focused on a renewed drive for independence and the gender recognition bill, which would allow people aged 16 or older in Scotland to change the gender designations on identity documents by self-declaration, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.

            Hailed as a landmark by transgender rights activists, the legislation faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers. 

            Criticism of the bill increased after reports that a convicted rapist was being held in a women’s prison in Scotland while transitioning. The inmate was transferred to a men’s prison after being assessed by prison authorities.

            While the Scottish parliament approved the legislation, it has been blocked by the British government because it would present problems for authorities in other parts of the U.K., where a medical diagnosis is needed before individuals can transition for legal purposes.

            Sturgeon had vowed to take the British government to court, arguing that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s administration had made a “profound mistake” by vetoing the legislation. 

            Sturgeon also came under fire for saying she would make the next Scottish parliament election a de facto referendum on independence after the government in Westminster refused to sanction a new vote on Scotland’s links to the U.K.

            The party is set to hold a conference on the strategy next month, with some members saying it won’t work and others criticizing Sturgeon for waiting too long to press ahead with independence.

            Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of the Chatham House think tank, said Sturgeon had made her mark, being both influential and divisive. But she failed to secure the ultimate prize.

            “She’s been more successful in one way of being a figurehead, leading her party and leading the Scottish government, but she has failed to do the one thing she really set out to do, which is to secure independence,'' Maddox said.LONDON (AP) — Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said Wednesday that she plans to step down after more than eight years in office, amid criticism of her drive to expand transgender rights and her strategy for achieving independence from the United Kingdom.Sturgeon made the surprise announcement during a news conference at her official residence in Edinburgh, Bute House, saying the decision wasn’t a response to the “latest period of pressure.” But she added that part of serving well was knowing when to make way for someone else.“In my head and in my heart I know that time is now,” she said. “That it’s right for me, for my party and my country.”Sturgeon, 52, has led Scotland since 2014, when Scots narrowly voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.

            Agency spokesman Robert Ertler said all plane parking spots in Frankfurt were full because passengers and crews are unable to board the airline's flights.

For the Reporting Period, Sunlight REIT's revenue was HK$388.5 million, down 3.9% year on year, mainly attributable to lower passing rents and occupancy rates registered at various properties. Net property income (""NPI"") declined 4.9% year on year to HK$307.6 million, implying a cost-to-income ratio of 20.8%.   Reflecting a higher interest rate regime, distributable income for the Reporting Period was HK$198.2 million, down 8.7% from the same period last year. The Board has resolved to declare an interim distribution per unit of HK 11.0 cents, representing a payout ratio of 93.7% and an annualized distribution yield of 6.5% based on the closing price of HK$3.37 on the last trading day of the Reporting Period.   The portfolio of Sunlight REIT was appraised at HK$17,649.3 million at 31 December 2022, representing a decrease of 2.5% from 30 June 2022. Meanwhile, net assets of Sunlight REIT was HK$13,598.8 million, which translates to a net asset value of HK$8.05 per unit.   Operating Highlights    The overall occupancy rate of Sunlight REIT's portfolio at 31 December 2022 was 92.5% (30 June 2022: 94.7%). Office occupancy rate declined to 92.2% (30 June 2022: 94.8%), while the retail portfolio also recorded a decrease in occupancy rate to 93.1% (30 June 2022: 94.5%). For the Reporting Period, the office and retail portfolios registered negative rental reversions of 4.5% and 4.8% respectively.   Despite a still challenging operating environment, the performance of Dah Sing Financial Centre was relatively resilient, as demonstrated by a slight 0.9% year-on-year drop in NPI to HK$86.9 million. Meanwhile, NPI of Sheung Shui Centre Shopping Arcade and Metro City Phase I Property (""MCPI"") were down 4.9% and 8.2% to HK$66.4 million and HK$61.8 million respectively. In the case of MCPI, the sharper drop in NPI was partially attributable to the rental shortfall caused by the ongoing renovation project.   On 11 January 2023, the Manager announced Sunlight REIT's acquisition of West 9 Zone Kids, a three-storey commercial development located in close proximity to the Olympic station with a gross rentable area of about 58,800 sq. ft, for a total consideration of HK$748 million (subject to adjustments). Completion of the transaction is expected to take place in April 2023.   Mr. Au Siu Kee, Alexander, Chairman of the Manager said, ""The disruptive forces that have undermined global macro stability are likely to remain potent, while interest rates will stay at a higher level than previous years. Gratifyingly, the gradual relaxation of cross-border traffic controls in Hong Kong should prove a boon to the tourism industry, generating more momentum to a nascent economic recovery. We will closely monitor the evolving trend and strive to maintain a prudent and agile management strategy to optimize the performance of Sunlight REIT. Notably, the well-timed acquisition of West 9 Zone Kids indicates our intention to initiate a new chapter of asset recycling, with a view to enhancing the value and quality of the overall portfolio.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811293,China expresses support for Sri Lanka ahead of debt meeting,"BEIJING (AP) — China expressed support for Sri Lanka ahead of a meeting Friday of government lenders to poor economies but did not say if it would help reduce a multibillion-dollar debt that has plunged the Indian Ocean nation into financial and political turmoil.

            Beijing is one of Sri Lanka's biggest creditors after extending it loans under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, which expands trade by building ports and other facilities across Asia and Africa. China has offered a two-year suspension of repayments but balked at reducing the amount owed. That is an obstacle to obtaining an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund, which wants creditors to agree to debt reductions.

            Chinese officials are due to attend a meeting of lenders organized by the IMF and the Paris Club of government creditors. The IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said last month the agency was talking with Beijing about ways of “reducing the burden of debt.”











            The Paris Club, after announcing last week its assurances on working with Sri Lanka, said, “The Paris Club members as well as Hungary and Saudi Arabia urged other official bilateral creditors, including China, to do the same in line with IMF program parameters as soon as possible.”

            China accounts for about 10% of Sri Lanka’s $51 billion foreign debt. The island nation of 22 million people ran out of foreign currency last year. That triggered power cuts, food shortages and protests that forced a president and prime minister to resign.

            China is “willing to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to continue to play a positive role to help Sri Lanka get over current difficulties,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked whether Beijing would agree to a debt reduction.

            Wang repeated an earlier official statement saying that China supports Sri Lanka’s application for an IMF loan and would help its government ask for help from commercial and other creditors.

            The China Export-Import Bank last month offered Sri Lanka a two-year repayment suspension. An American official said that was too little and called on Beijing to offer more relief.

            “We are in direct discussions with China,"" Sri Lankan President Rani Wickremesinghe said last week in a speech to Parliament. “We are now working towards unifying the approaches of other countries and that of China.”

            Sri Lanka’s situation reflects conditions across dozens of countries, from South Pacific islands to some of the poorest in Asia and Africa, that borrowed under the Belt and Road Initiative. The total debt of poor countries is rising, increasing the risk that others might also run into trouble.

            Beijing has forgiven interest owed by some but has avoided writing down the amount borrowed.

            Economists say Beijing probably is resisting cuts to Sri Lanka’s debt for fear that other borrowers will want similar relief. Last April, then-opposition leader Wickremesinghe told Republic TV that China offered an additional $1 billion loan instead of reducing Sri Lanka’s debt. That would allow the government to make payments, but the total amount owed would rise.

            Georgieva said IMF officials who visited Beijing discussed with Chinese officials a “pathway for debt reduction” for Chad, Zambia, Sri Lanka and other struggling debtors.

            A “very broadly shared” notion in China is that the country wants to help but “they expect to be paid back,” Georgieva said.

            That makes a reduction in the amount borrowed “politically very difficult,” Georgieva said. But she said there “might be a way to reach the same objective” by changing interest rates or repayment terms.

            Sri Lanka is trying to complete negotiations by the end of March, government spokesperson Bandula Gunawardena said Tuesday. Gunawardena said the IMF has concluded that China’s offer of relief “is not sufficient.”

            ""I hope the IMF will, by March, be able to ensure that the debt restructuring can begin,” Wickremesinghe said Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811294,Mahomes adds another Super Bowl comeback to his ledger,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Big Super Bowl comebacks have gone from rarities to frequent occurrences — thanks in large part to Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady.

            
                Mahomes led Kansas City to its second Super Bowl title in four seasons when the Chiefs rallied from 10 points down at the half to beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 on Sunday.

            The first championship for Mahomes also required a second-half rally when Kansas City turned a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit into a 31-20 victory over San Francisco in the 2019 season.











            Brady is the only other quarterback to engineer two double-digit comebacks in the Super Bowl, erasing a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat Seattle 28-24 in Super Bowl 49 and the record rally from 28-3 down in Super Bowl 51 to beat Atlanta 34-28 in overtime.

            Before the four double-digit comebacks by Brady and Mahomes in the past nine Super Bowls, no team had ever rallied from at least 10 points down in the second half to win a Super Bowl.

            The only double-digit comebacks of any kind in the first 48 Super Bowls came when Doug Williams and Washington turned an early 10-0 deficit to Denver into a 42-10 win in Super Bowl 22 and when Drew Brees and New Orleans did the same to Indianapolis in a 31-17 win in Super Bowl 44.

            The only double-digit comeback in the NFL's championship game in the pre-Super Bowl era came in 1934 when the Giants rallied from 13-3 down in the third quarter to beat the Bears 30-13.

            No quarterback has been better at erasing big deficits than Mahomes. The Chiefs have a 14-10 record (.583) with Mahomes at quarterback after falling behind by at least 10 points. The next highest winning percentage in the Super Bowl era for a QB who faced at least 12 double-digit deficits belongs to Brady at .378 (42-69).

            TREND BREAKERS

            The Super Bowl broke many recent trends, with Mahomes being responsible for ending many of them.

            Mahomes followed up his second regular-season MVP award by winning the Super Bowl, ending a stretch of nine straight losses by the MVP in the Super Bowl. The last MVP to win it all before Mahomes was Kurt Warner in the 1999 season.

            Warner and Mahomes both pulled off the MVP double, winning both the regular season and Super Bowl awards in the same season. The only others to do that were Steve Young (1994), Emmitt Smith (1993), Joe Montana (1989), Terry Bradshaw (1978) and Bart Starr (1966). Joe Namath won the AFL Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the 1968 season.

            
                Mahomes joined Brady and Montana as the only players to win multiple regular-season and Super Bowl MVP awards.

            Mahomes also was the first player to lead the league in yards passing and win the Super Bowl. The previous passing leaders were 0-6 in the big game.

            The Chiefs also won the game after also winning the coin toss — ending an eight-game losing streak by the coin toss winner. Seattle was the last to do it in Super Bowl 48 against Denver.

            HURTS SO GOOD

            Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts delivered a memorable performance in a losing cause.

            Hurts went 27 for 38 for 304 yards and a touchdown, ran 15 times for 70 yards and three TDs and scored on a 2-point conversion in one of the most prolific performances in Super Bowl history.

            Hurts set the record for most yards rushing ever by a quarterback in a Super Bowl, tied Terrell Davis’ record for most TD runs by any player, tied James White’s mark with 20 points scored and joined Hall of Famers Steve Young and Joe Montana as the only players ever to account for at least 370 yards and four TDs (rushing and passing) in a Super Bowl.

            After losing in his first Super Bowl start, Hurts will have to overcome some historical trends if he wants to end up on the winning side eventually.

            Of the 34 starting quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, 31 of them won in their first try as starter. Hurts will try to join Len Dawson, Bob Griese and John Elway as the only QBs to lose their first Super Bowl start and win one later in their careers.

            COACHING MOVES

            The Eagles will be looking for new coordinators on both sides of the ball, with offensive coordinator Shane Steichen getting the head coach job in Indianapolis and defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon taking over in Arizona.

            This marks the first time in nine years that one team lost both coordinators to head coach jobs on other franchises. The last time it happened came after the 2013 season, when Cincinnati defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer was hired in Minnesota and offensive coordinator Jay Gruden got the job in Washington.

            Barring any late surprises, the coaching cycle is over for this year with all five openings filled. Frank Reich went to Carolina, DeMeco Ryans to Houston and Sean Payton to Denver.

            Only one of the five jobs went a minority candidate (Ryans), leaving the NFL with just six minority coaches for a second straight season: Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin and Tampa Bay’s Todd Bowles, who are Black; Miami’s Mike McDaniel, who is biracial; the Jets’ Robert Saleh, who is of Lebanese heritage; and Washington’s Ron Rivera, who is Hispanic.

            The promotions for Ryans and Gannon means 8 of the 22 (36.3%) head coaching jobs in the past three cycles have been filled by coaches from defensive backgrounds. That's an increase from the previous five cycles when only 8 of 33 (24.2%) jobs went to defensive coaches.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811295,Former Swedish prime minister to lead soccer federation,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Former Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was recommended on Wednesday to become the next president of the country's soccer federation.

            Reinfeldt was prime minister from 2006-14 as leader of the Moderate Party and has no previous links to soccer.

            “It is an exciting assignment because throughout my life I have tried to find socially useful assignments and for me soccer is just that,” Reinfeldt said. “It is also beneficial to society because it covers all of Sweden, soccer is in every corner of Sweden.”











            Formally, the next chairman of the Swedish soccer association is to be elected to a two-year term on March 25 at a meeting that includes the district associations and the top clubs.

            In a statement, the Swedish soccer association said it had “listened to the entire movement and unanimously decided” on Reinfeldt.

            The two other candidates in the race had pulled out — Hélène Barnekow, who has had high-profile roles in the IT industry in Sweden at Microsoft and telecommunications firm Telia, and Lars-Christer Olsson, a former chief executive at UEFA and a member of its executive committee until 2021.

            Karl-Erik Nilsson is stepping down as the federation’s president after 10 years. He is one of UEFA’s vice presidents and can stay on in that role into 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811296,"NASCAR 75: Car evolution includes stock, wings, safety. EV?","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — NASCAR’s next 75 years almost certainly will include at least a partially electric vehicle turning laps at Daytona International Speedway.

            It’s unfathomable to some, unconscionable to others.

            It’s unlikely the sanctioning body would make the transition without at least trying to keep the heart-pounding sound of a throaty engine and the permeating smell of exhaust fumes – as much garage staples as sponsorship logos and haulers.











            “Do I see us racing EVs down the road? Probably,” former NASCAR crew chief and longtime Fox Sports commentator Larry McReynolds said. “But I’m going to be very honest and very candid. I hope it’s after I’ve left the sport. I like what we’ve got.”

            Even though the Next Gen car is entering its second NASCAR season – a nd already has been tweaked in hopes of preventing more head injuries like the one that sidelined 2004 champion Kurt Busch indefinitely – the evolution of the car has been an integral part of the sport since its debut in 1948.

            The car has gone from “Strictly Stock” in its inaugural season to high-tech platforms distinguished solely by manufacturer stickers in the 1980s to something in between these days. What’s next will be debated, but most believe a new engine will be introduced sooner rather than later.

            “The electrification of the cars has to be on the horizon. Whether it’s 50 miles on the horizon or 300 miles on the horizon, I don’t think any of any of us know right now for sure,” NASCAR historian Ken Martin said. “But I know there’s talk about a hybrid component.”

            Getting there could be trickier to navigate than any road course on the 2023 schedule.

            “We might see the day that we might go to a hybrid and use the electrical power for pace laps or pit stops,” Martin said. “That would be a way to ease into it. We know that a huge component of our sport is the sound. It grabs you, and that’s part of what our fans come to hear, come to see, the sights and smells and sounds. 

            “I think we’ll be very, very careful about eliminating that sound. But we realize that if Detroit says, ‘Hey, we’re not making any fuel-related engines,’ we’d have to take a look at what would need to be done.”

            Even though EVs are becoming more common in driveways across the country, the elimination of gas engines is years, maybe decades, away. Maybe even longer for NASCAR, which has built an empire on squeezing every bit of horsepower from gas-powered cars since it started racing on the Daytona Beach sand.

            Here’s a look at that progression as NASCAR celebrates its 75th anniversary:

            GENERATION 1 (1948-66)

            The first cars debuted in 1948 and were nearly identically to those on the street. There were three rules: The back seat had to be removed, headlights had to be taped over and doors had to be secured. 

            Hall of Famer Hershel McGriff, for example, drove his race car from Portland, Oregon, to Darlington, South Carolina, for the 1950 Southern 500, finished ninth and then drove it back across the country.

            “That’s how stock the cars were back then,” Martin said.

            GENERATION 2 (1967-80)

            As bigger and higher-banked tracks like Daytona started popping up throughout the South, NASCAR began allowing teams to build cars that could handle speedway rigors. Teams were allowed to beef up hubs, gears and suspensions while bodies remained stock. The cars also no longer featured doors.

            Those adjustments led to some of the most memorable winged cars in NASCAR history: the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird.

            GENERATION 3 (1981-90)

            Custom-built race cars no longer resembled their showroom counterparts. The cars became smaller – 110-inch wheelbases -- faster and more aerodynamically sound. They also received support from manufacturers Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, which provided body panels and other parts.

            GENERATION 4 (1991-2006)

            Fiberglass replaced steel bodies to reduce weight, and wind-tunnel time became commonplace to gain aerodynamic advantages. These cars are widely considered the most iconic in NASCAR history. 

            Three GM brands — Buick in 1992, Oldsmobile in 1994 and Pontiac in 2004 — left the series. Dodge, however, returned in 2001. 

            The generation was marred by the on-track deaths of Dale Earnhardt, Kenny Irwin and Adam Petty.

            GENERATION 5 (2007-12)

            Toyota made its debut in 2007 along with the Car of Tomorrow, which was years in the making following Earnhardt’s fatal crash at Daytona. The car was specifically designed to improve safety, with changes that included taller, wider and identical bodies, larger crumple zones and impact-absorbing foam built into both sides. 

            The most noticeable modifications were a front splitter and a rear wing that evoked so much fan vitriol it was replaced by a spoiler midway through 2010.

            “It really got away from what we were doing on the highway,” Martin said.

            The COT proved to be nearly indestructible on the track, evident by violent crashes involving Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards, Kasey Kahne, Michael McDowell and Ryan Newman.

            GENERATION 6 (2013-21)

            Dodge walked away from NASCAR after winning the 2012 Cup Series championship with Brad Keselowski, leaving Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota as the only manufacturers. 

            These cars were designed with manufacturer-specific bodies that better reflected showroom counterparts, and the chassis underneath had very little competitive wiggle room. They were bulkier and faster.

            NEXT GEN (2022-current)

            NASCAR’S current car saw some of the biggest innovations in series history. The sanctioning body moved to an independent rear suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, a five-speed sequential shifter, a transaxle, 19-inch wheels and a center hub instead of lug nuts.

            “We did it all for the sake of being more relative to what the fan drives as a passenger car,"" McReynolds said.

            Following concussions to Busch and Alex Bowman, NASCAR adjusted the car in hopes of reducing the amount of force delivered to drivers amid rear-impact crashes.

            “It’s automobile racing, and as much we’ll always strive to be as safe as we can, we will never, ever make it completely risk free,” McReynolds said. ""I don’t mean to sound morbid, but I don’t think it needs to be risk free because that’s one of the attractions.”

            The sound of the engines is another. And that could ultimately go the way of doors, splitters and wings.

            ""We'll probably see more of a hybrid-type engine,” McReynolds said. “I think that’s a few years down the road. You can’t keep putting huge expenses on these owners or you’re going to run them out of business. If you change the engine package like we just went through the car package, it’s basically throwing everything out the window and starting from scratch again. No one is ready for that.”

            ___

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — NASCAR’s next 75 years almost certainly will include at least a partially electric vehicle turning laps at Daytona International Speedway.It’s unfathomable to some, unconscionable to others.It’s unlikely the sanctioning body would make the transition without at least trying to keep the heart-pounding sound of a throaty engine and the permeating smell of exhaust fumes – as much garage staples as sponsorship logos and haulers.“Do I see us racing EVs down the road? Probably,” former NASCAR crew chief and longtime Fox Sports commentator Larry McReynolds said. “But I’m going to be very honest and very candid. I hope it’s after I’ve left the sport. I like what we’ve got.”Even though the Next Gen car is entering its second NASCAR season – a nd already has been tweaked in hopes of preventing more head injuries like the one that sidelined 2004 champion Kurt Busch indefinitely – the evolution of the car has been an integral part of the sport since its debut in 1948.The car has gone from “Strictly Stock” in its inaugural season to high-tech platforms distinguished solely by manufacturer stickers in the 1980s to something in between these days. What’s next will be debated, but most believe a new engine will be introduced sooner rather than later.“The electrification of the cars has to be on the horizon. Whether it’s 50 miles on the horizon or 300 miles on the horizon, I don’t think any of any of us know right now for sure,” NASCAR historian Ken Martin said. “But I know there’s talk about a hybrid component.”Getting there could be trickier to navigate than any road course on the 2023 schedule.“We might see the day that we might go to a hybrid and use the electrical power for pace laps or pit stops,” Martin said. “That would be a way to ease into it. We know that a huge component of our sport is the sound. It grabs you, and that’s part of what our fans come to hear, come to see, the sights and smells and sounds.“I think we’ll be very, very careful about eliminating that sound. But we realize that if Detroit says, ‘Hey, we’re not making any fuel-related engines,’ we’d have to take a look at what would need to be done.”Even though EVs are becoming more common in driveways across the country, the elimination of gas engines is years, maybe decades, away. Maybe even longer for NASCAR, which has built an empire on squeezing every bit of horsepower from gas-powered cars since it started racing on the Daytona Beach sand.Here’s a look at that progression as NASCAR celebrates its 75th anniversary:GENERATION 1 (1948-66)The first cars debuted in 1948 and were nearly identically to those on the street.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811297,Waters off New England had 2nd warmest year on record in '22,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The waters off New England, which are home to rare whales and most of the American lobster fishing industry, logged the second-warmest year on record last year.

            The Gulf of Maine, a body of water about the size of Indiana that touches Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Canada, is warming faster than the vast majority of the world's oceans. Last year fell short of setting a new high mark for hottest year by less than half a degree Fahrenheit, said scientists with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, a science center in Portland.

            The average sea surface temperature was 53.66 degrees (12 degrees Celsius), more than 3.7 degrees above the 40-year average, the scientists said. The accelerated warming is changing an ecosystem that's host to numerous important commercial fishing industries, especially for lobsters, they said.











            One implication is that the warming is driving species more associated with southern waters into the Gulf of Maine and altering its food chain, said Janet Duffy-Anderson, chief scientific officer with the institute. That includes species such as black sea bass, which prey on lobsters.

            “Who will be the emergent species and who will be the species that decline is, in large part, a function of those interactions,” said Duffy-Anderson. “At the moment, we’re not in a period of stability.” 

            The gulf is the nerve center of the lobster fishing business, which has recorded heavy catches over the past 10 years. However, lobster fisheries in more southern waters have collapsed, and scientists have placed the blame on warming temperatures.

            The Gulf of Maine is also a key area for marine mammals such as the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers only about 340, and sea birds such as Atlantic puffins. Those species and many others are threatened by disruptions in their food supply due to warming waters.

            The environmental factors accompanying high temperatures in the Gulf of Maine include persistent, intense heatwaves, according to a report released by Gulf of Maine Research Institute on Wednesday.

            The warming is also coming at a time when the world's oceans are heating up. Last year was the third-warmest year for global sea surface temperature, the report said.

            “What is being observed in the Gulf of Maine (and elsewhere around the world), however, is a loss of that balance: larger fractions of recent years are experiencing above average temperatures and cold spells are becoming vanishingly rare,” the report said.

            The hottest year in the Gulf of Maine was 2021, according to records that go back to 1982, the institute said. That year, the average annual sea surface temperature was slightly more than 54 degrees (12.2 degrees Celsius). Last year was a fraction of a percent warmer than the third warmest year, which was 2012.

            Those three years are the only ones in recorded history in which the gulf's average temperature exceeded 53 degrees (11.7 degrees Celsius).

            The report states that other data also paint a picture of the Gulf of Maine as the site of prolonged warming. In nine of the year's 12 months, the average monthly sea surface temperature was within the top three warmest among all years on record, the report said. November and December both set new records for highest monthly average sea surface temperature in the gulf, it said.PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The waters off New England, which are home to rare whales and most of the American lobster fishing industry, logged the second-warmest year on record last year.The Gulf of Maine, a body of water about the size of Indiana that touches Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Canada, is warming faster than the vast majority of the world's oceans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811308,Good news for Taiwanese Tourists: Integrated Resorts in Japan are Opening Soon!,"After a three-year travel ban due to the spread of coronavirus, Japan’s borders were finally opened to tourists in October 2022, and many foreign tourists are now visiting Japan.In November 2022, the number of foreign tourists in Japan was 4.5 times higher than in September of the same year. It is also quickly recovering, with 40% of tourists returning compared to the same month in 2019 prior to the corona epidemic.To attract more tourists, Japan is now attempting to build an integrated resort (IR) that includes a casino. Integrated Resort Implementation Bill (IRIB) was enacted in December 2016 with the goal of reviving Japan’s depressed economy by attracting more tourists.The spread of online casinos has increased interest in gambling in Japan, and IR is attracting a lot of attention both inside and outside of Japan.A complex tourist attraction facility known as an “integrated resort” (IR) includes MICE facilities such as international conference halls and exhibition facilities, hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, and movie theaters.The main reason to make IR is to prevent Japan’s economic recession. As you might know, there are huge concerns about a decline in consumer demand in the domestic market due to the declining population in Japan.In order to expand consumption demand, both are essential to increase tourism income from tourists visiting Japan and revitalize local communities.There were originally 8 candidate cities around Japan rivaling each other to host the glamorous IR facility.Japan’s IR was once planned to be finished in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.However, due to schedule delays and the impact of the coronavirus’s spread, Japan was forced to abandon plans for the complete opening in 2020.Osaka, one of the potential sites, wanted to open an IR at the same time as the 2025 World Expo. However, they were forced to abandon it once more due to the long-term impact of the coronavirus impact.Initially, there were eight potential sites, but only Osaka and Nagasaki remain as the final two options because of local opposition and other factors.Osaka mentioned that it changed its plans to open in the late 2020s when it withdrew its plans to open in 2025.On the other hand, Nagasaki,  Casino Austria which is a leading operator of the Nagasaki IR said it is expected to open “by 2027 at the earliest.”The Japanese government said that a decision on IR candidate sites will be made in 2023.　Therefore, as soon as the candidate site is decided, a more detailed schedule for completion will be announced.",2023/2/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811317,Thai suspect in Michigan hit-and-run agrees to return to US,"BANGKOK (AP) — A Thai-American woman living in Michigan who fled to Thailand after allegedly being involved in a hit-and-run accident that killed a college student has agreed to return to the United States to face charges, police said Wednesday.

            Tubtim “Sue” Howson, 57, allegedly struck Michigan State University student Benjamin Kable, 22, shortly before dawn on Jan. 1, and according to U.S. authorities, flew to Thailand on a one-way ticket on Jan. 3. The accident took place in Oakland County, Michigan.

            A state charge of failing to stop at a serious accident was filed on Feb. 2. and a federal charge related to her flying out of the country was filed on Feb. 6.











            Thai deputy national police chief Surachate Hakparn, speaking at a news conference also attended by Howson, announced she intends to return to the United States to face charges, and preparations were being made for her to fly back before Sunday. 

            “I left home for work around 5.30 a.m. to 6 a.m. It is the wintertime and it was very dark. There was usually nobody walking on the road there, except deer,” Howson said, recounting the accident. She said she initially thought she had hit a deer, but when asked later why she fled to Thailand, responded that when she saw Kable’s body, she thought he must be dead.

            “I did not think I would run away, but I was very shocked. I tried to call the police but my hands were shaking. I could not do anything,” she said.

            The FBI, when it filed a federal charge against her, noted in a court filing that she was originally from Thailand and allegedly told a close associate after the crash that she thought she killed somebody and she was going back to Thailand.

            “When encouraged to turn herself in to police, Howson allegedly stated, ‘no cops, no cops,’” FBI agent Matthew Schuff said in the filing.

            Howson arrived in Thailand on Jan. 5, and police said they started to trace her on Jan. 12 at the FBI’s request, finding her on Jan. 14 in the western province of Ratchaburi, where they suggested she turn herself in.

            Thailand and the U.S. have an extradition treaty, and if a suspect challenges an extradition order, it must go through a Thai court, which can be a lengthy process.

            Surachate said Howson has been working and living in Michigan with her family and two children for more than 20 years.

            “We did not arrest her. After she knew the facts, she showed the intention to accept the punishment in the U.S.,” he said. “This will be a good example for Thai society.”BANGKOK (AP) — A Thai-American woman living in Michigan who fled to Thailand after allegedly being involved in a hit-and-run accident that killed a college student has agreed to return to the United States to face charges, police said Wednesday.Tubtim “Sue” Howson, 57, allegedly struck Michigan State University student Benjamin Kable, 22, shortly before dawn on Jan. 1, and according to U.S. authorities, flew to Thailand on a one-way ticket on Jan. 3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811319,China threatens US entities over downing of balloon,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Wednesday it will take measures against U.S. entities related to the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the American East Coast. 

            At a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no details and did not identify the targets of the measures. 

            China says the balloon was a unmanned weather airship that was accidentally blown off course and accuses the U.S. of overreacting in bringing it down with a missile fired from an F-22 fighter jet. 











            Since the Feb. 4 downing of the balloon, the United States has sanctioned six Chinese entities it said are linked to Beijing’s aerospace programs. 

            The U.S. House of Representatives subsequently voted unanimously to condemn China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken also canceled a visit to Beijing that many hoped would stabilize ties that have cratered amid disputes over trade, human rights, Taiwan and China's claim to the South China Sea. 

            While China denies the balloon was a military asset, it has yet to say what government department or company was responsible. 

            After initially expressing regret over the balloon's entry into U.S. airspace, China has returned spying accusations against Washington, alongside threats of retaliation. 

            “China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures in accordance with the law against the relevant U.S. entities that undermine China’s sovereignty and security,” Wang said at Wednesday's briefing. 

            China will “resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and its legitimate rights and interests,"" Wang said. 

            Also Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said the Chinese balloon's intrusion was part of a pattern of aggressive behavior by Beijing. 

            Emanuel noted China’s recent beaming of military-grade laser on a Philippine coast guard patrol vessel, the harassment of U.S. planes by Chinese jets and China's opening of illegal police stations in the U.S., Ireland and other countries. 

            “The balloon to me is not an isolated incident,” Emanuel said. 

            If China wants to be a respected member of the international community, “then you act appropriately to certain basic premises. That is, you don’t open police stations in other countries ignorant of their laws as if your laws don’t have any boundaries,” he said. 

            “This is not exactly the qualities and characteristics of the good neighbor policy,” the ambassador said, referring to China's outreach to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 

            On Tuesday, Japan’s Defense Ministry said at least three flying objects spotted in Japanese airspace since 2019 were strongly believed to have been Chinese spy balloons. It said it has protested and requested explanations from Beijing. 

            Senior lawmakers in Japan’s governing party on Wednesday said they were considering expanding the Self Defense Force law to also include violations of Japanese airspace by foreign balloons.

            Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.BEIJING (AP) — China said Wednesday it will take measures against U.S. entities related to the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the American East Coast.At a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no details and did not identify the targets of the measures.China says the balloon was a unmanned weather airship that was accidentally blown off course and accuses the U.S. of overreacting in bringing it down with a missile fired from an F-22 fighter jet.Since the Feb. 4 downing of the balloon, the United States has sanctioned six Chinese entities it said are linked to Beijing’s aerospace programs.The U.S. House of Representatives subsequently voted unanimously to condemn China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken also canceled a visit to Beijing that many hoped would stabilize ties that have cratered amid disputes over trade, human rights, Taiwan and China's claim to the South China Sea.While China denies the balloon was a military asset, it has yet to say what government department or company was responsible.After initially expressing regret over the balloon's entry into U.S. airspace, China has returned spying accusations against Washington, alongside threats of retaliation.“China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures in accordance with the law against the relevant U.S. entities that undermine China’s sovereignty and security,” Wang said at Wednesday's briefing.China will “resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and its legitimate rights and interests,"" Wang said.Also Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said the Chinese balloon's intrusion was part of a pattern of aggressive behavior by Beijing.Emanuel noted China’s recent beaming of military-grade laser on a Philippine coast guard patrol vessel, the harassment of U.S. planes by Chinese jets and China's opening of illegal police stations in the U.S., Ireland and other countries.“The balloon to me is not an isolated incident,” Emanuel said.If China wants to be a respected member of the international community, “then you act appropriately to certain basic premises.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811366,UN says 73 migrants presumed dead in vessel mishap off Libya,"GENEVA (AP) — An inflatable rubber boat carrying migrants wrecked off the coast of Libya and 73 people were missing and presumed dead, the U.N. migration agency said Wednesday. It was the latest tragedy involving migrants seeking better lives in Europe.

            The U.N. International Organization for Migration said in a statement that the disaster took place Tuesday and that Libya authorities had retrieved 11 bodies.

            It said the boat, packed with around 80 migrants, reportedly departed from the village of Qasr al-Akhyar, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli. The migrants were heading to European shores, it said.











            The dead included one woman and 10 men, said Safa Msehli, IOM's spokesperson.

            It was not immediately clear what happened to the vessel but images showed the deflated broken-up rubber boat on shore.

            Seven migrants, all men, survived the mishap and made it to Libyan shores, the U.N. said, and were in “extremely dire conditions.” They were taken to a hospital.

            Qasr al-Akhyar officials shared footage online showing Libya’s Red Crescent workers handling dead bodies that washed ashore. The footage also showed the broken-up inflatable rubber boat.

            A survivor said in a different video shared by the municipality that scores of migrants were killed in the shipwreck. He said they paid between $3,000 to $5,000 each to smugglers to make the ill-fated trip. 

            In video comments, Salem Awag, the top Qasr al-Akhyar official, called on authorities in Tripoli to step up support to the village to help guard the shore and prevent further crossings.

            Tuesday’s shipwreck was the latest tragedy in the central Mediterranean Sea, a key route for migrants. The death toll on that route has reached at least 130 migrants this year, IOM said.

            In 2022, more than 1,450 migrants died, according to the IOM's missing migrants project.

            “This situation is intolerable,” said Safa Msehli, the organization's spokesperson. She called on governments to increase search and rescue efforts and to “establish clear and safe disembarkation mechanisms as well as safe and regular pathways to migration.

            Off Libya's shores alone, at least 529 migrants were reported dead and 848 others missing last year, while over 24,680 were intercepted and returned to the country, according to the IOM.

            Libya has in recent years emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The oil-rich country plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

            Human traffickers in recent years have benefited from the chaos in war-torn Libya, smuggling in migrants across the desert country’s lengthy borders with six nations. The migrants are then typically packed into ill-equipped rubber boats and set off on risky sea voyages.

            European countries have in recent years pushed Libyan authorities and the coast guard to detain and intercept migrants attempting to cross to European shores.

            Many of those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811368,"EU seeks new Russia sanctions package, targets Iran's drones","BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is considering a new set of sanctions totaling 11 billion euros against Russia and some third countries providing vital goods that Moscow uses to boost its troops on the battlegrounds in Ukraine. 

            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday that the package under consideration by the EU's 27 member countries specifically seeks to deprive Russia of military equipment it needs and cannot get anywhere else.

            It includes proposals to subject seven Iranian entities to sanctions to try to prevent Russia from using Iranian drones to hit Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. 











            The proposals put forward by von der Leyen center on additional electronic weapons components for equipment such as drones, missiles, helicopters and thermal cameras. She had hinted at some of the measures during an EU-Ukraine summit early this month. 

            If the proposals are endorsed unanimously by the EU members, “we have banned all tech products found on the battlefield,” von der Leyen said. 

            Ambassadors were to assess what is called a 10th package of sanctions against Russia later Wednesday. It is further expected to be discussed during a Monday meeting of EU foreign ministers in hopes of having final approval by the Feb. 24 anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

            The package also tries to close loopholes that have allowed some measures from earlier packages to be circumvented and seeks to go after oligarchs who try to escape sanctions. 

            EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said it will also seek to target 100 additional individuals and entities, including those who have been involved in kidnappings and taking Ukraine children to Russia. 

            Usually, EU sanctions are decided in close cooperation with major Western partners like the United States and Britain. The partners usually announce similar packages within a very short time frame.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811370,How climate change can impact your finances,"Kristy Jiayi Xu got an unwelcome surprise this New Year’s Eve: The roof of her garage was leaking during a severe rainstorm in San Francisco. Delays in getting a contractor to fix the roof has brought unexpected costs to keep things dry, including a dehumidifier.

            “My husband and I are both from the East Coast, so we always think the rain here lasts for a day,” says Xu, certified financial planner and CEO of the firm Global Wealth Harbor. 

            In September 2022, she and her husband faced a heat wave — another weather incident they weren’t expecting.











            “We have air conditioning, but the bill was so high,” she says.

            For over a decade , scientific reports have shown how climate change will likely make extreme weather events more frequent. And this trend might affect your wallet.

            Let’s break it down.

            HIGHER INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES AND ADDITIONAL POLICIES

            More storms typically mean more risk of damage to your home or car. And getting enough home and other insurance — at a reasonable cost — can be its own challenge.

            Competition among insurers is shrinking in areas most vulnerable to climate change, which means higher prices for consumers, especially higher deductibles, says Amy Bach , executive director of United Policyholders, a nonprofit that advocates for insurance consumers. A deductible is the amount you pay before an insurer covers damages.

            In hurricane-prone states, some insurers offer home insurance policies with separate hurricane deductibles . And insurers’ policy language keeps changing to limit what they pay for, Bach says.

            Climate change contributes to rising insurance costs, but pricing risks is what insurers are equipped to do, said Jeff Brewer , department vice president of public affairs for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, in an email. However, legal system abuse, claims fraud and regulatory interference contribute to growing market instability in several states, he said.

            If you live in an area prone to flood s or earthquake s, you’d want extra insurance since most homeowners and renters insurance policies don’t cover damages caused by those disasters.

            “The toughest thing is, so many households now are on a tight budget. It’s hard to tell people to buy three separate insurance policies,” Bach says.

            HIGHER FOOD AND ENERGY COSTS

            Extreme temperatures have become more frequent, which can affect crop production and household energy usage. In turn, your grocery and energy bills may increase.

            “Higher temperatures over recent decades have played an increasingly non-negligible role in driving price developments,” according to a 2021 report by the European Central Bank that analyzed temperature data and price indicators in 48 countries, including the U.S. “Food price inflation could be explained by a negative effect of hot summers on food production, resulting in supply shortages.”

            Home heating prices this winter are expected to reach the highest level in 10 years, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And last summer, NEADA found that cooling costs also increased.

            INDIRECT HITS ON INVESTMENTS

            “Climate change is going to impact the long-term valuations of both stocks and bonds,” Zach Stein , co-founder of Carbon Collective — an investment advisory firm focused on creating portfolios that fight climate change — said in an email.

            Some industries’ performance may hurt your investment portfolio returns. Stein predicts that we’ll see the most volatility in upcoming decades in agriculture, insurance and real estate.

            Rising sea levels will likely affect coastal real estate. For example, Florida homes exposed to flooding could lose 15% to 35% of their value by 2050, according to a 2020 report by the global consulting firm McKinsey.

            WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

            — COMPARE HOME INSURANCE OPTIONS. Get quotes from multiple insurers. In areas where insurance is hard to get, Bach recommends getting help from an independent agent or broker. She suggests the website TrustedChoice.com as one option.

            — EXPAND YOUR EMERGENCY FUND. Experts generally recommend setting aside three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a savings account. Since disasters can have more unpredictable costs than job loss, CFP Xu recommends aiming closer to the six months’ figure.

            — CONSIDER BANKING AND INVESTING THAT SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES. A handful of banks and credit unions have third-party certifications to prove that their customers’ deposits don’t support the fossil fuel industry. For investing, look into mutual funds or robo-advisers that use environmental, social and governance factors.

            — “STORM-PROOF” YOUR PROPERTY. Try reducing potential damage before the next big weather event. In case of flooding, have sandbags available and clear your gutters. In case of a wildfire, look into fire-resistant vents and roof materials. In case of a hurricane, cover windows with plywood or metal storm shutters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811378,China's top diplomat starts weeklong Europe tour in Paris,"PARIS (AP) — China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, had talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about the war in Ukraine on Wednesday at the start of his trip to Europe, amid renewed tensions between China and the United States. 

            Wang, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, met with Macron behind closed doors at the Elysee Palace. 

            Macron's office said they especially discussed the consequences of Russia's war in Ukraine on the world's most vulnerable nations regarding food security and financing capacities. They expressed “the same objective of contributing to peace in line with international law,” the statement said. 











            Macron also detailed the goals of a summit focusing on preserving forests that France will co-preside in Libreville, Gabon, on March 2, amid other climate-related issues, his office said.

            Wang later met with French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna. He is scheduled on Thursday to participate in a session of the French-Chinese strategic dialogue with Macron's top diplomatic adviser to discuss bilateral projects. 

            The French capital is the first stop on Wang's tour of Europe. In the coming days, he will also travel to Italy, Hungary, Russia and Germany. He is expected to deliver a speech at the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday. 

            Wang's weeklong tour of Europe is seen as part of China's efforts to restore ties with European nations at a time of rising tensions between the world's two largest economies — China and the United States — following the U.S. shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this month. 

            The trip comes amid China's persistent efforts to push back against Western pressure on trade, technology, human rights and its claims to a broad swath of the western Pacific. China’s refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, and join others in imposing sanctions on Russia as the war heads into a second year has further frayed ties with the West and fueled an emerging divide with much of Europe. 

            In December, Wang defended what he said was his country's position of impartiality on the war in Ukraine and signaled that China would deepen ties with Russia in 2023. 

            Speaking ahead of the trip, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday that Wang will have “in-depth strategic communication"" aiming to ""promote new developments in bilateral relations, enhance strategic mutual trust between China and Europe, and exchange views on major international issues.”PARIS (AP) — China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, had talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about the war in Ukraine on Wednesday at the start of his trip to Europe, amid renewed tensions between China and the United States.Wang, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, met with Macron behind closed doors at the Elysee Palace.Macron's office said they especially discussed the consequences of Russia's war in Ukraine on the world's most vulnerable nations regarding food security and financing capacities. They expressed “the same objective of contributing to peace in line with international law,” the statement said.Macron also detailed the goals of a summit focusing on preserving forests that France will co-preside in Libreville, Gabon, on March 2, amid other climate-related issues, his office said.Wang later met with French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna. He is scheduled on Thursday to participate in a session of the French-Chinese strategic dialogue with Macron's top diplomatic adviser to discuss bilateral projects.The French capital is the first stop on Wang's tour of Europe.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811379,UK’s Labour Party says ex-leader Corbyn can’t run again,"LONDON (AP) — Former U.K. opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who led the left-of-center Labour Party while it was stained by allegations of antisemitism, will not be allowed to run for Labour in the next national election, his successor as party leader said Wednesday.

            Keir Starmer said the party had changed “and we are not going back, and that is why Jeremy Corbyn will not stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.”

            Veteran left-wing lawmaker Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015 on a wave of grassroots enthusiasm and led the party to defeat in elections in 2017 and 2019. 











            A longtime supporter of the Palestinians and critic of Israel, he was suspended from Labour in 2020 after Britain’s equalities watchdog found party officials had committed acts of “harassment and discrimination” against Jews and said anti-Jewish prejudice had been allowed to spread within Labour.

            Starmer said he was determined to root anti-Jewish prejudice from the party.

            “Antisemitism is an evil and no political party that cultivates it deserves to hold power,” he said after the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has been monitoring Labour for several years, gave the party a clean bill of health.

            “Those who seek to blame others or downplay what happened in our party are, themselves, part of the problem and we will have zero patience or tolerance of that,” Starmer said. 

            Corbyn was suspended by the party in 2020 after he claimed opponents had exaggerated the scale of antisemitism in Labour for “political reasons.” He had represented Labour in Parliament since 1983 and now sits as an independent lawmaker.

            Starmer, a lawyer and former head of the U.K. prosecution service, has dragged the party back toward the political center ground since taking over in 2020. He has dropped Corbyn’s opposition to Britain’s nuclear weapons, strongly backed sending weapons to Ukraine and stressed the party’s commitment to balancing the books.

            Labour holds a strong opinion-poll lead over the governing Conservatives, who have been in office since 2010 and are mired in scandal. The next national election must be held by the end of 2024.

            In a strong repudiation of his predecessor, Starmer said Wednesday that Labour had changed “irrevocably … from a party that looked inwards to a party that meets the public gaze. From a party of dogma to a party of patriotism. From a party of protest to a party of public service.”

            He said “the Labour Party is unrecognizable from 2019 and it will never go back.”

            “If you don’t like that, if you don’t like the changes we have made, I say the door is open and you can leave.”LONDON (AP) — Former U.K. opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who led the left-of-center Labour Party while it was stained by allegations of antisemitism, will not be allowed to run for Labour in the next national election, his successor as party leader said Wednesday.Keir Starmer said the party had changed “and we are not going back, and that is why Jeremy Corbyn will not stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.”Veteran left-wing lawmaker Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015 on a wave of grassroots enthusiasm and led the party to defeat in elections in 2017 and 2019.A longtime supporter of the Palestinians and critic of Israel, he was suspended from Labour in 2020 after Britain’s equalities watchdog found party officials had committed acts of “harassment and discrimination” against Jews and said anti-Jewish prejudice had been allowed to spread within Labour.Starmer said he was determined to root anti-Jewish prejudice from the party.“Antisemitism is an evil and no political party that cultivates it deserves to hold power,” he said after the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has been monitoring Labour for several years, gave the party a clean bill of health.“Those who seek to blame others or downplay what happened in our party are, themselves, part of the problem and we will have zero patience or tolerance of that,” Starmer said.Corbyn was suspended by the party in 2020 after he claimed opponents had exaggerated the scale of antisemitism in Labour for “political reasons.” He had represented Labour in Parliament since 1983 and now sits as an independent lawmaker.Starmer, a lawyer and former head of the U.K. prosecution service, has dragged the party back toward the political center ground since taking over in 2020.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811380,Russian journalist sentenced to 6 years over Ukraine posts,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian journalist was convicted of disparaging the military Wednesday and received a six-year prison sentence, the latest punishment in a relentless crackdown on critics of Moscow's actions in Ukraine.

            The court in the city of Barnaul in southern Siberia found Maria Ponomarenko guilty of “spreading false information about the Russian armed forces' actions"" with her posts on a messaging app. Ponomarenko, who worked for the RusNews portal, denied the charges.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811381,"Mercedes intent on giving Hamilton new contract, winning car","Mercedes is determined to give an energized Lewis Hamilton both a winning car and a contract extension this season.

            Toto Wolff just doesn't have a timeline for either.

            Mercedes on Wednesday revealed it has returned to an all-black color scheme for this Formula One season and team principal Wolff was confident the car has improved from last year. Wolff was cautious on when the car might actually be capable of winning, but said the continued development would not be a deterrent in negotiations with Hamilton.











            Mercedes last year had its run of eight consecutive world titles snapped and seven-time champion Hamilton went winless for the first time in his career. George Russell scored Mercedes' only victory.

            The struggles won't be a deterrent in Hamilton's contract negotiations, Wolff said.

            “I don’t think it plays into Lewis’ mind any doubts that we will perform. We will. Eventually,” said Wolff, who made clear repeatedly, “we will be competitive. We don’t know when.”

            Last year was difficult for Hamilton as the Mercedes design badly missed the mark. It was both uncompetitive and physically difficult to drive, and it developed a bouncing phenomenon dubbed “porpoising” that left both Hamilton and Russell bruised and battered after every drive. 

            After narrowly missing out on the title to Max Verstappen in 2021, Hamilton and Mercedes went into 2022 with confidence but were soon disappointed.

            Last season “was a shock to all of us, so this year I think everyone is a lot more grounded,” Hamilton said. “We perhaps won’t be the fastest out of the gate, but we have the potential to close. Hopefully we will be closer, and hopefully we will have the potential to close the gap early on in the season.”

            Despite Mercedes' struggles in 2022, Hamilton said late last season he wanted a long-term contract extension. Hamilton, who turned 38 last month, reiterated his desire to continue driving at Wednesday's car reveal.

            “I continue to love racing and that is never going to change,"" Hamilton said. ""It is part of my DNA and I always believe I can get better. I am planning to stay a little bit longer.”

            Ahead of his 17th season, Hamilton is feeling “very refreshed, very centered” after time away with his family. “I can't remember the last time I felt this excited to get in the car"" for pre-season testing, he added.

            Wolff said there has been one conversation with Hamilton about a new contract but that he had neither a timeline nor an inclination to rush the process. He said neither salary nor age were of concern to Mercedes, and Wolff likened Hamilton to NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who last month retired at age 45.

            “I think the age 38 plays no role for this next contract. If you look at how well top athletes in the world push boundaries, and I am thinking about Tom Brady ... The age plays no role,” Wolff said. ""How (Lewis) appears to me is in great form, very positive. Motivated. Energized. Maybe the best so far I've seen.

            “He knows what he has with the team. We won eight constructors' titles in a row ... and we got it wrong last year.”

            The black color scheme was introduced by Mercedes in 2020 to promote diversity and inclusion in step with Hamilton's own vocal push to increase the representation of minorities in motorsports. Mercedes returned to its traditional silver after two years, but the switch back to black is designed to cut weight from the car.

            “We were overweight last year,” Wolff said. “This year we have tried to figure out where we can squeeze out every single gram.""

            Despite the poor performance of last year's car, Wolff said he plans to display the Mercedes in the lobby of the Brackley headquarters as a motivating tool.

            “It is a symbol of boldness for me, and courage. We took a radical design direction last year, and we dared, and we failed,” Wolff said. ""So for me, that shows a lot of the mindset of the team, how it is important to cope with success and failure at the same time.

            “And I wouldn't want us to go in any shape or form conservative in the future. I want us to take calculated risks and be bold.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811390,Alex Bowman signs 3-year extension with Hendrick Motorsports,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Alex Bowman has a new contract and a familiar spot as he chases his first Daytona 500 victory.

            Bowman received a three-year extension from Hendrick Motorsports on Wednesday that will keep the driver — who won his third career Daytona 500 pole later that night — with the team through the 2026 season.

            Hendrick also locked in Bowman’s sponsor, Ally, to a five-year extension through 2028. The financial-services firm has a full-season primary sponsorship with Bowman and the No. 48 Chevrolet. Ally has been the primary sponsor of the No. 48 team for five years.











            “I’m pumped about what’s in store for the Ally 48 this season and love the direction we’re heading,” Bowman said. “We have a lot to accomplish, and it all starts this week in Daytona.”

            Bowman, who missed five races late last season because of a concussion, starts his ninth season of Cup racing and his sixth full-time with Hendrick. Bowman has all seven of his Cup Series victories since 2019. He won four times in 2021 and once last season before he was sidelined with his head injury. Bowman suffered the concussion in a Sept. 25 crash at Texas Motor Speedway, knocking him out of the playoffs. He was cleared to return for the season finale, finishing 34th. He made NASCAR’s playoffs in all five seasons at Hendrick.

            “We’re thrilled to extend with Alex, who is one of NASCAR’s most exciting young stars,” team owner Rick Hendrick said. “In addition to being hugely talented, he has incredible passion and commitment that set him apart. He’s a proven winner, and I don’t know of anyone who has worked harder to reach this level. The opportunity to continue our relationships with Alex and everyone at Ally is a great way to kick off 2023.”

            Bowman, who succeeded seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 in 2021, won the pole for the Daytona 500 in 2018 and 2021. He has 30-1 odds, per FanDuel Sportsbook, to win Sunday in the traditional season opener at Daytona International Speedway.

            Hendrick Motorsports has had the Daytona 500 pole winner in seven of the last eight years. Hendrick fields cars for Bowman, Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott and William Byron.

            Bowman, who turns 30 in April, had a solid 2022 — the first year of NASCAR's Next Gen car — that included a win at Las Vegas before his season was derailed by the concussion he suffered in a crash.

He’s a proven winner, and I don’t know of anyone who has worked harder to reach this level. The opportunity to continue our relationships with Alex and everyone at Ally is a great way to kick off 2023.”Bowman, who succeeded seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 in 2021, won the pole for the Daytona 500 in 2018 and 2021. He has 30-1 odds, per FanDuel Sportsbook, to win Sunday in the traditional season opener at Daytona International Speedway.Hendrick Motorsports has had the Daytona 500 pole winner in seven of the last eight years. Hendrick fields cars for Bowman, Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott and William Byron.Bowman, who turns 30 in April, had a solid 2022 — the first year of NASCAR's Next Gen car — that included a win at Las Vegas before his season was derailed by the concussion he suffered in a crash.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811391,"Rise in Horn of Africa migration a worry, says UN official","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The numbers of women and children migrating from the Horn of Africa to Gulf countries through Yemen has significantly increased and is a cause of concern, according to the head of the International Organization for Migration.

            The treacherous journey from Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti through Yemen, called the Eastern Migration Route, has seen a 64% increase in the past year of people seeking better livelihoods, with larger numbers of women with children and children travelling alone, IOM Director General Antonio Vitorino told The Associated Press.

            Climate change is a driver of the increased migration, he said.











            In the past, women and children would often opt out of the dangerous journey through the desert mostly made on foot. Previously men would leave their families behind and make the trek in the hope of finding jobs and sending money back home.

            “The pressure is mounting” as the numbers of migrants rise, said Vitorino who was in Kenya for the launch of a $84 million appeal to support more than 1 million migrants using the route through Yemen.

            The desperate migrants are vulnerable to criminal gangs along the route and need protection against rape, violence, traffickers and smugglers, he said.

            Some of the migrants are unaware of the dangers including the war in Yemen and the U.N.'s migration organization needs to improve awareness of the perils, he said. For migrants who still choose to take the journey, the organization should offer basic healthcare and other services and in some cases return them to their countries of origin, he said.

            “Last year, we have returned voluntarily to Ethiopia 2,700 migrants and upon arrival we provided post-arrival assistance to support them to move back to their regions of origin,” Vitorino said. 

            Also rising is the migration of people from West Africa through Libya to Europe and the plight of those migrants, particularly those detained in Libya, is a global concern, he said.

            “We know where the official detention centers are and we have access to them, not permanent, never alone, but under surveillance of security guards. But we have access to provide assistance,"" said Vitorino.

            But the U.N. organization does not have access to the unofficial detentions centers, which are particularly worrying, he said. Abuses have been widely reported in both official and unofficial detention centers. Libya’s political instability makes it difficult to have the political cooperation needed to dismantle the unofficial detention centers, he said.

            The IOM is striving to get more migrants into voluntary return programs in order to reduce those in detention, he said. It's difficult because the number of migrants who want to return is much higher than available flights from Libya, he said. 

            Vitorino said he hopes the factors that lead to increased migration, like climate change and conflict, can be addressed to reduce the number of people moving away from their homes. 

            He stressed the need for migrants to pursue legal migration routes, adding that although the process is complicated and cumbersome, it cannot be compared to the life-threatening conditions along illegal routes.NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The numbers of women and children migrating from the Horn of Africa to Gulf countries through Yemen has significantly increased and is a cause of concern, according to the head of the International Organization for Migration.The treacherous journey from Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti through Yemen, called the Eastern Migration Route, has seen a 64% increase in the past year of people seeking better livelihoods, with larger numbers of women with children and children travelling alone, IOM Director General Antonio Vitorino told The Associated Press.Climate change is a driver of the increased migration, he said.In the past, women and children would often opt out of the dangerous journey through the desert mostly made on foot.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811392,Oprah chooses Susan Cain's 'Bittersweet' for book club,"NEW YORK (AP) — Oprah Winfrey has chosen Susan Cain's “Bittersweet” as her new book club pick. 

            “Bittersweet,” released last year, is the most recent work from the author of “Quiet,” the 2012 bestseller that contended introverted people had been misunderstood and overlooked.

            “Susan started a revolution a decade ago with her book ‘Quiet’ about the power of being an introvert, and her latest book is a revelation on how embracing sadness and heartache can lead you to the path of creativity, connection and even love,” Winfrey said in a statement Wednesday.











            “'Bittersweet' talks about a complicated truth around happiness and has the power to transform the way you see your life and even the world,” the statement said.

            Winfrey is a longtime admirer of Cain, whose other books include “Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths of Introverts” and “Quiet Journal: Discover Your Secret Strengths and Unleash Your Inner Power.” In 2013, Winfrey cited “Quiet” as one of 40 books to read before age 40 and she featured “Bittersweet” last spring in her online publication OprahDaily.com.

            Cain noted in a statement that in “Bittersweet” she writes of Winfrey's “transformative” relationship with her mentor Maya Angelou, who died in 2014.

            “Yet I never dreamed that Oprah would read the book, let alone select it for the Oprah Book Club. This is an honor of honors,"" Cain said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811393,Edmunds: What to know before towing with an electric pickup,"Gas-powered light-duty pickups are a go-to choice for people needing to tow a trailer. But electric light-duty pickups are muscling their way into the market, too. Demand is high for the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Rivian R1T, and the Chevrolet Silverado EV is set to debut this spring. Some versions of these trucks are rated to tow around 10,000 pounds, which is enough to pull a medium-sized travel trailer or toy hauler. But towing with an electric vehicle is a different experience than current truck owners might be used to. Edmunds’ experts share their insights on towing with an EV truck.

            PREPARE FOR A LOSS IN RANGE

            Regardless of the type of vehicle, towing a trailer or boat causes a reduction in fuel efficiency — and therefore range — compared to normal operation. This unavoidable problem of physics is more of a concern in an EV because of the already limited amount of range compared to a gas-powered vehicle. 











            For example, a 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning with its extended-range battery has an EPA-estimated range of up to 320 miles on a full charge. That’s solid for a modern EV. But it pales in comparison to a gas-powered F-150, which can have a range upward of 500 miles on a full tank.

            The reduction in range from towing will depend on many factors, including what EV you’re towing with, what you’re towing, elevation changes, weather conditions, and the speed you’re driving at. But here’s an example, based on Edmunds’ testing: Towing a trailer with an EV truck required about 27% more electricity usage than it would without a trailer. That resulted in a 27% decrease in maximum range. As such, our example F-150 Lightning, hooked up to a trailer, would be left with roughly 234 miles of range to work with.

            Tip: Stick to the speed limit on highways. Even going 10 mph over the speed limit can have a significant impact on range.

            PLAN AHEAD FOR YOUR CHARGING

            The reduced range won’t be an issue if you’re only making a short trip with a trailer attached. But longer road trips, which are typically needed when one is towing a trailer or boat for recreation, can be problematic. You’ll need to plan your route in case you need to stop and recharge along the way. 

            The infrastructure for DC fast-charging stations is still in its infancy and can’t be relied upon in the same way as gas stations can. Charging locations are not nearly as prevalent as gas stations. On top of that, some chargers may be broken or already in use when you arrive. 

            Tip: If you can, plan your charging stops so that you’ll have enough range as an emergency buffer to allow you to drive to another charging location if needed.

            CHARGING SESSIONS WILL TAKE TIME

            Different factors will influence how long you’ll need to charge, including how powerful the charging station is, how much power your EV can accept during fast charging, and how close to 100% you want to charge to. EV trucks typically have higher-capacity batteries that take longer to charge, too. As a general guide, expect to spend 20-40 minutes for a typical charging session during a multi-stop road trip.

            Charging an EV that’s connected to a trailer can also be problematic because most public charging stations are positioned on curbs next to parking spots. It’s likely that you’ll need to unhook your trailer in order to position your truck properly to get it connected to a charging station’s power cord. Unhooking and reconnecting your trailer will use up valuable minutes on your drive.

            Tip: It’s important to know the maximum theoretical charging capability of your EV and use charging stations that will support it. But be understanding when reality sets in and you’re stuck charging at a slower speed than you hoped for.

            ELECTRIC POWER ADVANTAGES

            We’ve painted a dour picture so far but there are upsides. The first is power. An F-150 Lightning with the optional extended-range battery produces a robust 580 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque. And unlike a traditional truck, that maximum torque output is available as soon as you press on the accelerator to help get you moving promptly and keep you steady on grades. EVs also don’t lose power at elevation as internal combustion engines do. Finally, in our test, the cost of recharging an EV truck for a given distance driven was less than refueling a traditional truck.

            EDMUNDS SAYS: In the short term, towing with an electric truck on longer trips will be less convenient than towing with a traditional light-duty truck. The extra stops needed for recharging add extra time and hassle. But there are advantages to towing with an EV, too. Long term, the future is bright for EV truck towing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811409,"Oil, mining giant Glencore posts record profit for 2022","GENEVA (AP) — Mining, oil and metals giant Glencore posted record profits last year on soaring demand for energy products, saying Wednesday that it will pay out more than $7 billion to shareholders.

            The Baar, Switzerland-based company said business rebounded from lows during the coronavirus pandemic and rode a spike in demand for oil and natural gas after Russia invaded Ukraine. 

            Net income soared nearly 250% to $17.32 billion last year, Glencore said. Revenue rose 26% to $255.98 billion.











            
                Record profits from energy giants like Shell, BP and ExxonMobil last year have stirred calls for those companies to do more to reduce high utility bills for households and businesses and invest more in efforts to cut climate-changing emissions.

            The surge in cash generation narrowed Glencore's net debt to $100 million, “allowing for today’s announcement of $7.1 billion ... of shareholder returns” through cash distributions and a share buyback program, CEO Gary Nagle said in a statement.

            He also pointed to some potential upsides ahead, including China lifting tough zero-COVID restrictions. That's despite higher inflation and interest rates that present “some risk” to the economic forecast this year. 

            “China’s reopening, however, together with a continued global focus on energy security and decarbonization (and) electrification, mean that demand for many of our commodities is likely to remain healthy, while supply constraints persist and inventories remain relatively low,” Nagle said. 

            Glencore also could benefit from U.S. legislation that directs new spending toward technology meant to reduce carbon emissions and a European Union plan to favor greener policies. 

            Such initiatives “demonstrate the growing need for critical raw materials through to the end of the decade and beyond, necessitating fresh investment in both primary supply and recycling,” Nagle said.

            Glencore's record profits come after it reached a deal with authorities in the United States, Britain and Brazil last year to resolve corruption and market manipulation allegations in return for penalties totaling up to $1.5 billion.GENEVA (AP) — Mining, oil and metals giant Glencore posted record profits last year on soaring demand for energy products, saying Wednesday that it will pay out more than $7 billion to shareholders.The Baar, Switzerland-based company said business rebounded from lows during the coronavirus pandemic and rode a spike in demand for oil and natural gas after Russia invaded Ukraine.Net income soared nearly 250% to $17.32 billion last year, Glencore said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811410,Pastors' view: Sermons written by ChatGPT will have no soul,"NEW YORK (AP) — Among sermon writers, there is fascination – and unease – over the fast-expanding abilities of artificial-intelligence chatbots. For now, the evolving consensus among clergy is this: Yes, they can write a passably competent sermon. But no, they can’t replicate the passion of actual preaching. 

            “It lacks a soul – I don’t know how else to say it,” said Hershael York, a pastor in Kentucky who also is dean of the school of theology and a professor of Christian preaching at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

            Sermons are meant to be the core of a worship service -- and often are faith leaders' best weekly shot at grabbing their congregation’s attention to impart theological and moral guidance. 











            Lazy pastors might be tempted to use AI for this purpose, York said, “but not the great shepherds, the ones who love preaching, who love their people.”

            A rabbi in New York, Joshua Franklin, recently told his congregation at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons that he was going to deliver a plagiarized sermon – dealing with such issues as trust, vulnerability and forgiveness. 

            Upon finishing, he asked the worshippers to guess who wrote it. When they appeared stumped, he revealed that the writer was ChatGPT, responding to his request to write a 1,000-word sermon related to that week’s lesson from the Torah.

            “Now, you’re clapping -- I’m deathly afraid,” Franklin said when several congregants applauded. “I thought truck drivers were going to go long before the rabbi, in terms of losing our positions to artificial intelligence.”

            “ChatGPT might be really great at sounding intelligent, but the question is, can it be empathetic? And that, not yet at least, it can’t,"" added Franklin. He said AI has yet to develop compassion and love, and is unable to build community and relationships.

            “Those are the things that bring us together,” the rabbi concluded.

            Rachael Keefe, pastor of Living Table United Church of Christ in Minneapolis, undertook an experiment similar to Franklin’s. She posted a brief essay in her online Pastoral Notes in January, addressing how to attend to one’s mental health amid the stresses of the holiday season.

            It was pleasant, but somewhat bland, and at the end, Keefe revealed that it was written by ChatGPT, not by herself.

            “While the facts are correct, there’s something deeper missing,” she wrote. “AI cannot understand community and inclusivity and how important these things are in creating church.”

            Several congregation members responded.

            “It’s not terrible, but yes, I agree. Rather generic and a little bit eerie,” wrote Douglas Federhart. “I like what you write a lot more. It comes from an actually living being, with a great brain and a compassionate, beating heart.” 

            Todd Brewer, a New Testament scholar and managing editor of the Christian website Mockingbird, wrote in December about an experiment of his own -- asking ChatGPT to write a Christmas sermon for him.

            He was specific, requesting a sermon “based upon Luke’s birth narrative, with quotations from Karl Barth, Martin Luther, Irenaeus of Lyon, and Barack Obama.”

            Brewer wrote that he was “not prepared” when ChatGPT responded with a creation that met his criteria and “is better than several Christmas sermons I’ve heard over the years.”

            “The A.I. even seems to understand what makes the birth of Jesus genuinely good news,” Brewer added.

            Yet the ChatGPT sermon “lacks any human warmth,” he wrote. “The preaching of Artificial Intelligence can’t convincingly sympathize with the human plight.”

            In Brentwood, Tennessee, Mike Glenn, senior pastor for 32 years at Brentwood Baptist Church, wrote a blog post in January after a computer-savvy assistant joked that Glenn could be replaced by an AI machine.

            “I’m not buying it,” Glenn wrote. “AI will never be able to preach a decent sermon. Why? Because the gospel is more than words. It’s the evidence of a changed life.”

            “When listening to a sermon, what a congregation is looking for is evidence that the pastor has been with Jesus,” Glenn added. “AI will always have to – literally – take someone else’s words for it... it won’t ever be a sermon that will convince anyone to come and follow Jesus.”

            Also weighing in with an online essay was the Rev. Russell Moore, formerly head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s public policy division and now editor-in-chief of the evangelical magazine Christianity Today. He confided to his readers that his first sermon, delivered at age 12, was a well-intentioned mess.

            “Preaching needs someone who knows the text and can convey that to the people — but it’s not just about transmitting information,” Moore wrote. “When we listen to the Word preached, we are hearing not just a word about God but a word from God.”

            “Such life-altering news needs to be delivered by a human, in person,” he added. “A chatbot can research. A chatbot can write. Perhaps a chatbot can even orate. But a chatbot can’t preach.”

            The Southern Baptist department formerly led by Moore – the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission --- has been monitoring artificial-intelligence developments for several years under the direction of Jason Thacker, its chair of research in technology ethics.

            He shares the view that “wise, virtuous pastors” won’t let new technology deter them from personal immersion in sermon-writing.

            “But I also can see it being used in unhelpful or unethical ways,"" he added.

            “Some young pastors may become overly reliant on these machines … and not see the imperfections of these tools,” Thacker told The Associated Press. “Many pastors are overworked, exhausted, filled with anxiety... One can see why a pastor might say, ‘I can’t do everything I’m supposed to do,’ and start passing ideas off as their own.”

            Hershael York, the Kentucky pastor and professor, said some of the greatest sermons contain elements of anguish.

            “Artificial intelligence can imitate that to some level. But I don’t think it can ever give any kind of a sense of suffering, grief, sorrow, the same way that a human being can,” he said. “It comes from deep within the heart and the soul -- that’s what the great preachers have, and I don’t think you can get that by proxy.”

The AP is solely responsible for this content.NEW YORK (AP) — Among sermon writers, there is fascination – and unease – over the fast-expanding abilities of artificial-intelligence chatbots. For now, the evolving consensus among clergy is this: Yes, they can write a passably competent sermon. But no, they can’t replicate the passion of actual preaching.“It lacks a soul – I don’t know how else to say it,” said Hershael York, a pastor in Kentucky who also is dean of the school of theology and a professor of Christian preaching at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.Sermons are meant to be the core of a worship service -- and often are faith leaders' best weekly shot at grabbing their congregation’s attention to impart theological and moral guidance.Lazy pastors might be tempted to use AI for this purpose, York said, “but not the great shepherds, the ones who love preaching, who love their people.”A rabbi in New York, Joshua Franklin, recently told his congregation at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons that he was going to deliver a plagiarized sermon – dealing with such issues as trust, vulnerability and forgiveness.Upon finishing, he asked the worshippers to guess who wrote it. When they appeared stumped, he revealed that the writer was ChatGPT, responding to his request to write a 1,000-word sermon related to that week’s lesson from the Torah.“Now, you’re clapping -- I’m deathly afraid,” Franklin said when several congregants applauded. “I thought truck drivers were going to go long before the rabbi, in terms of losing our positions to artificial intelligence.”“ChatGPT might be really great at sounding intelligent, but the question is, can it be empathetic? And that, not yet at least, it can’t,"" added Franklin. He said AI has yet to develop compassion and love, and is unable to build community and relationships.“Those are the things that bring us together,” the rabbi concluded.Rachael Keefe, pastor of Living Table United Church of Christ in Minneapolis, undertook an experiment similar to Franklin’s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811411,"NATO chief eyes bigger defense budgets, hard spending target","BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday urged the 30 member countries to commit to spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense by a set date, as Russia’s war on Ukraine and other threats eat into military spending.

            NATO allies agreed in 2014, after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, to halt the spending cuts they had made after the Cold War and move toward spending 2% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2024. That pledge expires next year, and NATO is working on a new target.

            “What is obvious is that if it was right to commit to spend 2% in 2014, it is even more right now because we live in a more dangerous world,” Stoltenberg told reporters, after chairing a meeting of NATO defense ministers, where a first high-level discussion on the issue was held.











            “There is a full-fledged war going on in in Ukraine, in Europe, and then we see the persistent threat of terrorism, and we see also the challenges that China is forcing to our security. So, it is obvious that we need to spend more,” he said.

            NATO allies in Europe and Canada increased defense spending for the eighth consecutive year in 2022, adding around $350 billion to their budgets. According to NATO’s most recent estimates, 10 countries are close to or above the 2% guideline. Thirteen spend around 1.5% or less. 

            Several member countries insist that the figure was only ever a guideline, and not a hard target.

            “Instead of changing the 2%, I think we should move from regarding the 2% as a ceiling to toward the 2% of GDP as a floor and minimum,” Stoltenberg said. He added that this should not be “a long-term perspective or move towards,” but rather “an immediate commitment to spend 2% as a minimum.”

            The United States spends more on its defense budget than all the other allies combined, putting 3.47% of GDP into its military coffers, according to NATO estimates for last year. Some members have suggested that NATO should move toward a 2.5% guideline. Others say that’s unrealistic.

            Many countries insist that it’s the quality of the equipment and the amount of contributions that allies make to NATO operations that is most important. GDP percentages are also a slippery metric. When economies tanked during the COVID-19 pandemic, defense budgets looked bigger.

            The economy of Turkey — traditionally one of NATO’s biggest defense spenders — has been ravaged by inflation and its military budget only stood at 1.22% of GDP last year, according to NATO’s estimate.

            Poland, which borders both Ukraine and Russia, will be spending some 4% of its GDP on defense this year, up from 2.5% recently, as it buys fighter jet, tanks and other weapons — chiefly from the U.S. and South Korea — to deter any potential assault.

            Poland’s President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday advocated new security plans for NATO’s eastern flank, and for more armaments and ammunitions to be stockpiled in Poland to enhance the protection of central and eastern European members.

            Duda, who held talks with Stoltenberg in Brussels, said having a stockpile in the region would shorten the alliance’s response should any eastern flank country be attacked.

            NATO leaders are expected to map out the way ahead when they meet for their next summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July.

            Leaders of NATO's eastern flank countries — the so-called Bucharest Nine —are to meet with President Joe Biden and Stoltenberg in Warsaw next week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811413,Hamilton on FIA rule: 'Nothing will stop me from speaking',"Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton insisted he will not be silenced by offseason rules that prohibit drivers from speaking out on political issues.

            Hamilton said Wednesday he will continue to use his global platform to promote his wide-ranging interests, which include social justice and race, human rights and protection of the LBGTQ community.

            The FIA in December updated its International Sporting Code to require prior written permission for drivers to make or display “political, religious and personal statements or comments” during race weekends. The FIA is the governing body for Formula One.











            The crackdown on free speech has been condemned by most drivers but Hamilton only weighed in for the first time Wednesday, when Mercedes revealed its 2023 car.

            Hamilton said the FIA crackdown ""doesn't surprise me” but he quickly dismissed it when he learned about it over the offseason.

            “Nothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I feel that I'm passionate about and issues there are,” Hamilton said. “I feel the sport does have a responsibility, still, always, to speak out as a means to create awareness on important topics, particularly as we are traveling to all these different places, so nothing changes.”

            Asked if he was prepared to be penalized by the FIA for violating the new rule, Hamilton said “it would be silly to say I would want to take extra penalty points"" but remained steadfast in that he won't be silenced.

            “I'm still going to be speaking on my end,” Hamilton said. “We still have this platform. There's a lot of things we need to tackle.”

            Most of the drivers have spoken out against the new rule and most recently by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, who recently told The Guardian newspaper the series would not be imposing any sort of gag. Domenicali said he expected the FIA to soon clarify its position.

            Hamilton is the most vocal driver in F1 and remains the same change agent 17 years into his career as when he became the first Black winner in F1 in 2008. The British racer is now 38 years old, the winningest driver in series history and is tied with Michael Schumacher with a record seven titles.

            Hamilton remains the only Black driver at the most elite level of motorsports.

            Hamilton often speaks out while racing in countries with questionable human rights records, or when an issue arises in which he feels his voice can lend support, which would be banned under the new FIA rule.

            Hamilton last year sparred with the FIA over its crackdown of drivers wearing jewelry in the car and mocked the rule by arriving at a news conference wearing three watches, eight rings and multiple necklaces. Hamilton and the FIA had a protracted back-and-forth over the jewelry ban in which he received an extension on a deadline to remove some piercings; the two sides eventually came to an agreement.

            Hamilton's teammate George Russell is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, which represents F1 drivers, and shared the criticism of the FIA's attempt to limit drivers' speech.

            “I think it’s totally unnecessary in the sport and in the world we live at the moment. Naturally, we are obviously seeking clarification and I trust it will be resolved,” Russell said Wednesday.

            He added: ""We’re not going to limit our views or our thoughts because of some silly regulation. We’re all here to have free speech and share whatever views we may have.""

            The demonstration was the latest sign of economic pain caused by China’s now-abandoned “zero COVID” policy and a drop in local government coffers exacerbated by the collapse of major players in the real estate industry. 

            The ruling Communist Party maintains strict control over the press, but videos and photos said to be of the protest in front of Wuhan's Zhongshan Park spread on social media before censors took them down. The images couldn't be independently verified by The Associated Press.











            While there is no indication of a nationwide movement, citizens have become more outspoken over the failure of local governments to deliver on social welfare promises. Elder care has become a more acute issue because of a falling birthrate that has left fewer workers to support retirees who were promised pensions and healthcare by the state. 

            In Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 was first detected in late 2019, police lined up in multiple rows, some locking arms, while hundreds of mostly elderly protesters spilled onto the main road, shouting complaints. In one video, the crowd began singing ""The Internationale,"" the communist anthem taught and sung in China since the Communist Party took power at the end of a civil war in 1949. 

            China has experienced a wave of labor unrest and protests sparked by draconian coronavirus lockdowns that were abruptly abandoned in December. Dozens or more people have been arrested on the vague charge of causing disorder.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811415,"Human Rights Watch condemns UK, US actions on Chagos Islands","LONDON (AP) — Britain and the United States committed crimes against humanity when they forced the people of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to leave their homes five decades ago to make way for a U.S. Navy base, a rights group charged Wednesday, calling on the two governments to let the Chagossians return.

            Human Rights Watch also said Britain and the U.S. should pay compensation to the Chagossians and apologize for their treatment of the islanders.

            “The forced displacement of the Chagossians and ongoing abuses amount to crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people,” the rights group said. “U.K. colonial rule in the Chagos Archipelago, unlike in most of its other colonies in Africa, did not end in the 1960s, and it has continued at extraordinary cost to the people of Chagos.”











            The Chagos Islands are the heart of the British Indian Ocean Territory, some 6,000 miles southeast of London and home to the U.S. Navy base at Diego Garcia. The base was built in the 1970s and provides what American authorities have described as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.

            But Diego Garcia has been the source of controversy for decades because the islands were home to about 1,500 people when discussions about the base began in the 1960s. In addition, the islands historically had been administered as a dependency of Mauritius, a U.K. territory that was then moving toward independence.

            Those facts were a problem because the U.S. wanted the freedom to build the base on Diego Garcia without facing local political opposition.

            As a result, Britain decided to separate the archipelago from Mauritius before it became independent and removed the Chagossians from the islands between 1967 and 1973.

            There are now about 10,000 Chagossians who live primarily in Britain, Mauritius and the Seychelles. The consulting firm KPMG, which conducted a feasibility study for the government, said in 2014 that everyone who took part in consultation meetings wanted to return to the islands permanently.

            The government in 2016 refused to allow the Chagossians to return to their homeland, citing “feasibility, defense and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer.”

            But it also acknowledged that the original removal of the islanders was wrong, granted them citizenship and set aside 40 million pounds ($49 million) to improve the lives of Chagossians around the world.

            “The manner in which the Chagossian community was removed from the Territory in the 1960s and 1970s, and the way they were treated, was wrong and we look back with deep regret,” the government said at the time.LONDON (AP) — Britain and the United States committed crimes against humanity when they forced the people of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to leave their homes five decades ago to make way for a U.S. Navy base, a rights group charged Wednesday, calling on the two governments to let the Chagossians return.Human Rights Watch also said Britain and the U.S. should pay compensation to the Chagossians and apologize for their treatment of the islanders.“The forced displacement of the Chagossians and ongoing abuses amount to crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people,” the rights group said. “U.K. colonial rule in the Chagos Archipelago, unlike in most of its other colonies in Africa, did not end in the 1960s, and it has continued at extraordinary cost to the people of Chagos.”The Chagos Islands are the heart of the British Indian Ocean Territory, some 6,000 miles southeast of London and home to the U.S. Navy base at Diego Garcia.

In addition, the islands historically had been administered as a dependency of Mauritius, a U.K. territory that was then moving toward independence.Those facts were a problem because the U.S. wanted the freedom to build the base on Diego Garcia without facing local political opposition.As a result, Britain decided to separate the archipelago from Mauritius before it became independent and removed the Chagossians from the islands between 1967 and 1973.There are now about 10,000 Chagossians who live primarily in Britain, Mauritius and the Seychelles. The consulting firm KPMG, which conducted a feasibility study for the government, said in 2014 that everyone who took part in consultation meetings wanted to return to the islands permanently.The government in 2016 refused to allow the Chagossians to return to their homeland, citing “feasibility, defense and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer.”But it also acknowledged that the original removal of the islanders was wrong, granted them citizenship and set aside 40 million pounds ($49 million) to improve the lives of Chagossians around the world.“The manner in which the Chagossian community was removed from the Territory in the 1960s and 1970s, and the way they were treated, was wrong and we look back with deep regret,” the government said at the time.",2023/2/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811421,"Jordanian FM visits Syria, promises more earthquake aid","BEIRUT (AP) — Jordan's foreign minister Tuesday met with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus, vowing to continue delivering earthquake aid and work to find a political solution to Syria's 12-year conflict, Syrian state media reported.

            Ayman Safadi's visit to the earthquake-hit country makes him the first Jordanian official to do so since the onset of Syria's conflict in 2011. It marks a new thaw in relations between the two countries and more generally between Assad and the Arab world.

            Jordan’s King Abdullah II had called Assad last week to express Amman's willingness to send humanitarian aid. Since then, cargo planes and trucks loaded with assistance from the neighboring country have reached Syria to help with relief efforts. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed over 1,400 people in government-held areas and displaced thousands more.











            Safadi also met with Syrian counterpart Faisal Mekdad. 

            “We discussed our bilateral relations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis that ends this catastrophe,” Safadi said after meeting Mekdad at Damascus airport. “A solution that preserves Syria's unity and sovereignty.” 

            According to a statement from Assad's office, the Syrian president thanked Jordan for its support, and told Safadi that the Syrian people “welcome any positive positions towards them, especially from brotherly Arab countries.” 

            Jordan, like most Arab countries since the start of Syria's civil war, reduced diplomatic relations with Syria in 2011. The kingdom also hosted Western-backed opposition groups and took in hundreds of thousands of refugees.

            Arab and Western countries generally blamed Assad for the deadly crackdown on the protests that erupted in 2011, and supported the opposition in the early days of the conflict, which displaced and killed millions of people.

            Assad has since regained much of Syria's territory with the backing of key allies Russia and Iran, and some Arab countries that once shunned him have been slowly rekindling ties in recent years.

            King Abdullah II and Assad spoke for the first time in a decade in October 2021, discussing cooperation to bolster both countries' ailing economies over the phone.

            United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Assad in Damascus on Sunday, while other Arab countries close to the United States, most notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have delivered aid to Damascus. 

            Some experts say that the earthquake and humanitarian crisis that compounded Syria's woes may accelerate normalization efforts between Assad and Arab countries that have shunned him for over a decade.

            The United States, which has strict sanctions on Syria, has eased some of them since the earthquake for humanitarian relief. But the U.S. has been critical of countries renewing relations with the embattled president without a political settlement to end the conflict.

            Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who plays a leading role in the international effort to bring Assad and his top officials to justice for war atrocities, visited a disaster area in rebel-held Jinderis and Afrin in northwest Syria on Tuesday. He criticized the Syrian president for holding up access to aid to opposition areas before finally authorizing the U.N. to open new crossings almost a week after the quake.

            “There is the crime that this area is besieged by Assad and the international community has been complicit in that siege in the sense that we’ve allowed them to strangle the area and haven’t recognized that the law permits the cross-border assistance,” he told The Associated Press after his tour of the devastated areas.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed over 1,400 people in government-held areas and displaced thousands more.Safadi also met with Syrian counterpart Faisal Mekdad.“We discussed our bilateral relations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis that ends this catastrophe,” Safadi said after meeting Mekdad at Damascus airport. “A solution that preserves Syria's unity and sovereignty.”According to a statement from Assad's office, the Syrian president thanked Jordan for its support, and told Safadi that the Syrian people “welcome any positive positions towards them, especially from brotherly Arab countries.”Jordan, like most Arab countries since the start of Syria's civil war, reduced diplomatic relations with Syria in 2011. The kingdom also hosted Western-backed opposition groups and took in hundreds of thousands of refugees.Arab and Western countries generally blamed Assad for the deadly crackdown on the protests that erupted in 2011, and supported the opposition in the early days of the conflict, which displaced and killed millions of people.Assad has since regained much of Syria's territory with the backing of key allies Russia and Iran, and some Arab countries that once shunned him have been slowly rekindling ties in recent years.King Abdullah II and Assad spoke for the first time in a decade in October 2021, discussing cooperation to bolster both countries' ailing economies over the phone.United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Assad in Damascus on Sunday, while other Arab countries close to the United States, most notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have delivered aid to Damascus.Some experts say that the earthquake and humanitarian crisis that compounded Syria's woes may accelerate normalization efforts between Assad and Arab countries that have shunned him for over a decade.The United States, which has strict sanctions on Syria, has eased some of them since the earthquake for humanitarian relief. But the U.S. has been critical of countries renewing relations with the embattled president without a political settlement to end the conflict.Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who plays a leading role in the international effort to bring Assad and his top officials to justice for war atrocities, visited a disaster area in rebel-held Jinderis and Afrin in northwest Syria on Tuesday. He criticized the Syrian president for holding up access to aid to opposition areas before finally authorizing the U.N. to open new crossings almost a week after the quake.“There is the crime that this area is besieged by Assad and the international community has been complicit in that siege in the sense that we’ve allowed them to strangle the area and haven’t recognized that the law permits the cross-border assistance,” he told The Associated Press after his tour of the devastated areas.___Associated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed from Jenderis, Syria.",2023/2/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811422,NASCAR's Suárez signs multiyear deal with Trackhouse Racing,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Daniel Suárez has signed a second extension in six months with Trackhouse Racing, getting a multiyear deal done after landing a one-year contract last August.

            The team announced Suárez's latest extension Wednesday as NASCAR kicked off Speedweeks with Daytona 500 media day and pole qualifying. The team declined to release details but will keep the 31-year-old Mexican behind the wheel for a third season and beyond for co-owners Justin Marks and Pitbull.

            ""Obviously, everyone at Trackhouse Racing is pleased with the performance and professionalism of Daniel both on and off the track,” Marks said in a statement. “Culture has been of prime importance since the idea of Trackhouse existed only on a whiteboard in an office. Daniel has fulfilled every expectation and we look forward to the future. The best is yet to come.”











            Suárez, the 2016 Xfinity Series champion, has one victory in 215 Cup starts. He won last year at Sonomo Raceway, becoming the first Mexican-born winner in NASCAR's top series.

            He insisted in August, after signing the one-year extension, that he believed he would get a long-term deal done once the team had more financial clarity regarding the racing series' next media rights deal.

            But as the season opener neared, Suárez talked to team management about getting the deal done.

            “I’m the kind of person that once I start racing, I like to focus on that,” Suárez said. “I feel like at times it can be a distraction. This time, when we started having all these conversations, I said, ‘Hey, let’s get it out of the way before the Daytona 500.’

            “It’s a good day because we are announcing this and I am answering these questions, but I don’t want to have to think about it during the weekend, not really heading into next week.”

            Trackhouse competed as a single-car team with Suárez in 2021. That summer, Trackhouse acquired Chip Ganassi Racing’s NASCAR assets and cleared a path for expansion.

            Trackhouse moved into its race shop in Concord, North Carolina, in 2022 and fielded cars for Suárez and Ross Chastain. They combined for three wins, 21 top-five finishes and 34 top-10s last year.

            “The future of Trackhouse is very bright,” Suárez said. “Everybody at Trackhouse believes in me. I believe in Trackhouse since Day 1. We’re building something great here. I think we have something special going on. It would be silly not to see that and to take advantage of that, to take it to the next level.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811423,Drugmaker Biogen tops 4Q forecasts despite sales slip,"Biogen closed 2022 with a better-than-expected fourth quarter, as more cost cutting helped counter sales declines for some key treatments.

            The drugmaker said Wednesday that total cost and expenses fell 17% in the quarter, and Biogen’s bottom line grew nearly 50% to $550.4 million.

            Adjusted earnings totaled $4.05 per share. Total revenue slid 7% to $2.54 billion. Sales of the company's multiple sclerosis treatments tumbled as cheaper generic competition hurt the drug Tecfidera.











            Analysts expected earnings of $3.48 per share on $2.44 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

            Biogen embarked on a broad cost-cutting program last year, which included slashing most of its spending on Aduhelm. The once highly anticipated Alzheimer’s disease treatment has flopped since it debuted with strict government restrictions on who can take it.

            The drug brought in only $4.8 million in sales last year. Biogen’s top-selling multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri generated $2 billion in global sales.

            Biogen Inc. made $3 billion in 2022, with adjusted earnings totaling $17.67 per share.

            For 2023, the company forecasts adjusted earnings to range between $15 and $16 per share.

            Analysts forecast $15.80 per share.

            Biogen also expects revenue to slip next year. The company is helping to produce and sell another Alzheimer's treatment, Leqembi from the Japanese drugmaker Eisai. Biogen said Wednesday that it predicts expenses tied to the drug will exceed the “modest” initial revenue it expects from Leqembi.

            Shares of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company fell more than 2%, or $7.45, to $281.63 in midday trading.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811424,Barcelona and Man United add glamor to Europa League playoff,"They’re two members of European soccer’s aristocracy who, not so long ago, were meeting in Champions League finals.

            Now Barcelona and Manchester United are going head-to-head in the unlikely confines of a Europa League playoff match.

            Not that they are playing like also-rans of the continent.











            “At the end of the day, we don’t deserve to be in the Champions League and neither do they. But the level is still very high,” Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez said Wednesday.

            Indeed, the clubs with two of the biggest followings in world soccer are in a good place on the field, especially considering the plight they have found themselves in recent years.

            Barcelona is emerging, very slowly, from a crippling financial crisis that cost the club Lionel Messi and plenty more. Its economic situation is still grave — Barcelona’s latest accounts show the club is more than $650 million in debt, hardly helped by a group-stage exit from the Champions League — but the team is performing so well that it has an 11-point lead in the Spanish league.

            United, meanwhile, is rising up the Premier League and could win its first trophy in six years when meeting Newcastle in the final of the English League Cup later this month.

            In that sense, both teams have reason to believe they will be back competing at the top of European soccer soon.

            In the meantime, their presence in the Europa League adds glamor to a competition that is widely viewed as the Champions League's little brother. The only disappointment for fans is that the meeting comes so early.

            “I think Barcelona and (us) as well (would) have preferred to play in the final,” United manager Erik ten Hag said. “Hopefully, everyone is fit for Barcelona and for us. So we see a game at the highest level.""

            Barcelona is in good form, with its last loss coming against Bayern Munich as it exited the Champions League in October.

            It is in the Europa League because it couldn't win a group game against either Bayern or Inter Milan. But under Xavi, the team has now won eight in a row in all competitions, with striker Robert Lewandowski taking on the role of star player.

            “I really like his team, the attacking way of play,"" Ten Hag said. ""I think he is in the right direction. I think it’s going to be a good challenge between Manchester United and Barcelona.”

            Xavi, who won two Champions League finals on the field with Barcelona against United, has got his team playing as well as it has all season despite injuries to Ousmane Dembélé and Sergio Busquets. Spain internationals Pedri and Gavi are driving the midfield, while Raphinha is filling in nicely for Dembélé.

            Ten Hag has had to contend with his own absences, but has still been able to put United in a position to compete for the league title. Midfielder Christian Eriksen will miss the majority of the rest of the season with an ankle problem and Anthony Martial continues to struggle to stay fit.

            Given United terminated Cristiano Ronaldo's contract in November, Ten Hag has been left short in attack, which is why the form of Marcus Rashford has been crucial. The England forward, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona in the past, has scored 13 goals in his last 15 games and 21 all season.

            Jadon Sancho is also back after being given time off to rediscover his form and adds to United's options up front.

            Ten Hag has a decision to make in attack, with January loan signing Wout Weghorst failing to provide much of a goal threat so far, scoring once in eight appearances. With Sancho back, Rashford can be switched from the left wing into a central position, where he has managed to score from in each of United's last two games when moved there during the match.

            “Rashford is one of the most dangerous strikers,” Xavi said. “He’s very fast, a good dribbler, good in one-on-ones and very dangerous in the transitions.

            “We need to take care of all of United’s players, but Rashford is certainly one of the most dangerous in Europe.”

            Brazil winger Antony, midfielder Scott McTominay and Martial were absent as United trained on Wednesday morning before flying out to Barcelona. Lisandro Martinez and on-loan Marcel Sabitzer are suspended for the first leg, but Casemiro is available after missing the last two league games through suspension.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811426,Ukraine admitted into UN fund that supports small farmers,"ROME (AP) — 

            Ukraine’s small-scale farmers, who are playing a critical role in feeding the population during the war, will be eligible for funding through the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development following Ukraine’s induction Wednesday into body, officials said.

            Small farmers in Ukraine “play a fundamental role in feeding the country” during the war, producing up to 80% of dairy, fruits and vegetables consumed by the population, IFAD said in a statement.











            Farmers in the western provinces, where many people have fled to escape fighting in the east, “will require support to meet the increased demand for food,’’ the organization said. 

            The farms are also an important source of income for an estimated 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas, as poverty and malnutrition are becoming more widespread, IFAD said. According to a recent report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, many people living in rural areas are on the brink of poverty, with 44% living below subsistence levels and 7% suffering malnutrition. 

            Membership in IFAD will give farmers access to both grants and loans, as well as supplementary funds, officials said. IFAD has provided more than $24 billion to fund projects in developing countries since 1978. 

            Ukraine’s membership in IFAD — in discussion since 2016 — also recognizes Ukraine’s role as a major global producer and exporter of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, as the ripple effects of the war shake the global supply chain. 

            “Despite the war, Ukraine is still committed to contributing to global food security, to defuse the food crisis and save millions of people from hunger,"" Yaroslav Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Italy, said after membership was conferred.

            “However, this requires international assistance and investment, in particular ... support to increase exports and to perform the sowing and harvesting campaigns,"" he said.ROME (AP) —Ukraine’s small-scale farmers, who are playing a critical role in feeding the population during the war, will be eligible for funding through the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development following Ukraine’s induction Wednesday into body, officials said.Small farmers in Ukraine “play a fundamental role in feeding the country” during the war, producing up to 80% of dairy, fruits and vegetables consumed by the population, IFAD said in a statement.Farmers in the western provinces, where many people have fled to escape fighting in the east, “will require support to meet the increased demand for food,’’ the organization said.The farms are also an important source of income for an estimated 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas, as poverty and malnutrition are becoming more widespread, IFAD said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811436,When Beethoven's music was considered 'peculiar',"Inspired to create contemporary music that reflects the challenges of the age, from economic crises to pandemics and the climate emergency, Cologne-based Japanaese composer Malika Kishino looked to English poet T. S. Eliot.His celebrated 2022 poem ""The Waste Land"" described how severe drought created sand-filled streets and dead landscapes, a scene compounded by post-World War One economic hardship.The last section of the poem, ""What the Thunder Said,"" inspired Kishino to compose her piece of the same name that was commissioned in 2021 by the WDR Symphony Orchestra and its conductor, Cristian Macelaru.In this episode of DW Festival Concert, you'll listen to Macelaru leading the WDR Symphony Orchestra and cello soloist Oren Shevlin in a live recording from the 2022 Beethoven Festival.While Kishino's composition may have sounded unusual to some, it's interesting to remember that many other pieces which we consider standard today were originally perceived as different, peculiar or even as radical breaks with musical tradition.Beethoven's Violin Concert in D Major, Op 61 is one of them.The composer wrote the work for violinist Franz Clement, who received bravos from the audience at the premiere in 1806.But the critics were unimpressed.They described the piece as disjointed, its motifs as tedious, and said the sections in the highest register were too difficult for the soloist to play in a refined and precise manner. In the following years, the piece was barely performed.However, one should take critics with a grain of salt. After all, today, the iconic composition is widely performed by acclaimed violinists such as Augustin Hadelich.""The Beethoven Violin Concerto is one of the greatest pieces written for the violin and one of the greatest pieces of music,"" Hadelich told DW on the sidelines of his performance.""It's a piece that I want to play as many times as I can in my life, really. With this piece, I never get bored,"" he said. ""I just love it more and more.""The 38-year-old virtusoso was born in Italy to German parents. His career began in the US, where he is well-known, while his prominence in Europe has grown more recently.Incidently, Beethoven is said to have struggled to write for the violin. The concerto in D major is his only finished concerto for the instrument, yet today it's a standard of every violinist's repertoire.Still, some two hundred plus years after Beethoven wrote it it remains a tricky piece to perform well due to its long passages in the high register.Regardless, Hadelich gives an expressive performance on his warm-toned Guarneri del Gesu violin from 1744. His high notes are incredibly light, precise and imbued with emotion.Cristian Macelaru has been chief conductor of the WDR Symphony Orchestra since 2019.Born in Romania, he began his career as a violinist and conductor in the US. Macelaru considers the WDR Symphony Orchestra to be one of the greatest professional orchestras in Germany, and he wants to broaden the orchestra's activities and raise its prominence on the international stage.In this episode, we will be listening to composer Johannes Brahms' famous Piano Quartet No 1, with a special arrangment created by Arnold Schoenberg in the early 20th century.Schoenberg was a great admirer of Brahms' music in his youth, so perhaps it's no surprise that he orchestrated the piano quartet.When the piece premiered in 1937 in Los Angeles, the performance's conductor, Otto Klemperer, apparently said: ""You don't want to listen to the original quartet anymore – that's how beautiful the arrangement sounds.""Many people associate Schoenberg with atonality, and for good reason. His development of the twelve-tone technique took Western classical music in radical new directions. However, in his younger years, his compositions were in fact quite tonal.In 1897, Schoenberg composed ten waltzes for string orchestra. At the time he was playing cello in an amateur orchestra that was conducted by his teacher, Alexander Zemlinsky, who said his pupil had just as much fire in him as he did wrong notes.It's likely that Schoenberg composed these waltzes for that orchestra that remain relatively unknown today.So it's a real treat that we're going to hear three of them now, in a concert recording from 2021. Finally, we'll hear the crowd-pleasing encore from that concert. It's another piece by Brahms, his Hungarian Dance No. 5.And that brings today's show to an end. We hope you enjoyed the program.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811437,The tradition and future of South Korean cinema,"Before the turn of the millennium, few people, if any, could foresee that South Korean culture was about to go global.After decades as a Japanese colony, the Korean war and a series of military governments, true democratic reform took place in 1987.Since then, the country, once was known as ""Land of Morning Calm,"" has become one of the most important economic players in the world.But when it comes to Korean culture, it's only quite recently that the majority of the West's knowledge has grown beyond K-pop and the song ""Gangnam Style.""The case of Korean cinema is a little different, however. Since the early 2000s, films like Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy,"" or Kim Ki-duk's ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring,"" have drawn attention around the world.Today, Korean films and series are an integral part of the global entertainment industry.The Busan International Film Festival, which takes place in South Korea's second-largest city, is among the most important Asian film festivals, and the country is the fifth-largest movie market in the world, taking in around $1.7 billion (€1.6 billion) per year.Korean entertainment is enjoyed from the US to Africa. It offers something for everyone, from horror to action to soap operas. The ""Hallyu,"" or the new Korean wave of pop culture, has spread throughout the world, especially as cult films like ""Parasite"" win Oscars and a host of international awards.The word ""Hallyuwood"" is even used to reform to South Korean cinema, joinining Hollywood, Bollywood (Hindi cinema) and Nollywood (Nigerian cinema).The trend is only growing stronger. Major US studios have opened branches in South Korea with the aim of co-producing films.US sequels of South Korean films are popular, and streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ vie for dominance when it comes to Korean movies.In 2023, Netflix hopes to continue the success of the hit series ""Squid Game"" and is offering increasingly more South Korean films and series.The Netflix production ""Kill Boksoon"" and other Korean films will also premiere at the 2023 Berlinale.Meanwhile, European cinemas are showing the newest feature from star director Park Chan-wook, ""Decision to Leave,"" for which he won best director at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival.Despite the commercial success of their films, South Korean directors are unafraid to subvert film narrative conventions; or inject bizarre moments like when ""Oldboy"" protagonist Oh Dae-su eats a live octopus.The film industry's eagerness to defy limits and its wealth of creative energy likely stem from South Korea's recent history.Many Korean cinema greats grew up during the era of civilian resistance against the military government. They secretly watched and discussed prohibited films in their university cinema clubs.Additionally, the abrupt split with dictatorial North Korea, combined with the dominance of turbocapitalism in the South, shaped the critical worldview of many.The intrigue of large corporations, the growing gap between rich and poor — it all provides a wealth of material for filmmakers.South Korea is also a country where being hip and innovative is important: Creative, cosmopolitan culture scenes can be found not only in the capital, Seoul, but also in all major cities. If someone wants to grab people's attention here, they have to do something unique.Few female directorsA high state quota for domestic productions also doesn't hurt. Whomever has been to South Korea knows that cinema is celebrated both in private and public. For instance, a traffic circle in the major city of Jeonju, which is known for its international film festival, boasts a statue of a cameraman — and that's year-round, not just during the festival season.The coming years will reveal how South Korea's film industry will develop going forward. One of its greatest weaknesses is that it is still male dominated. Only in recent years has this begun to change: At the 2019 film festival in Busan, 27% of the Korean films were made by women — a giant leap from the previous year.Now, after Korean films and series have hit the global mainstream, it remains to be seen whether Hallyuwood will face the same fate as its namesake: creative stillstand or financial crisis. But just like Hollywood constantly keeps reinventing itself, it may well be that South Korean cinema, a young but strong tradition, does the same to remain relevant in the future. After all, the country definitely has plenty of stories to tell.",2023/2/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811439,Pakistan: Climate activists pay a high price,"Baba Jan, an activist, is becoming something of a household name in Pakistan-administered Kashmir's Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region. He first got into public eye by campaigning for the victims of 2010 and 2011 floods to get compensation. Then, he was arrested on ""terrorism"" allegations and served almost a decade in prison, finally regaining his freedom in late 2020.Jan and over a dozen other campaigners were only freed after their families staged a weeklong sit-in. The 45-year-old is now the president of the Awami Workers Party in GB.Pakistan is very vulnerable to changing weather patterns, and it ranks among the 10 countries in the world most affected by climate change. The devastating floods which hit the country last summer are sure to increase this vulnerability score even further.While GB is not constitutionally part of Pakistan, it is an administrative territory with a de facto province status. It boasts a unique but delicate ecosystem and is home to some of the tallest mountains in the world including the mammoth K2 peak.Activists such as Baba Jan say political parties often attempt to silence and discredit those who speak out.""My activism is against climate change fueled by capitalism, which is breeding destruction and inequality. We demand revolutionary political, economic and social changes, because the current system is taking away our home,"" Jan told DW.Lawyer Yasir Abbas, who serves as coordinator to the chief minister of GB, told DW that he believes that the case against Jan and other protesters was ""mishandled"" and that Jan did not deserve the penalty he received. Abbas also pointed to several sustainability campaigns that the current GB government is investing in. He added he was hopeful that climate activists would be met more favorably in the future due to a rising number of young people speaking out.Jan started focusing on activism following the Attabad Lake disaster in 2010, when the village of Attabad in the Hunza Valley was hit by a huge landslide, burying 20 people and rendering 6,000 villagers homeless.With disastrous flooding following just months later, Jan focused on criticizing people in power and drawing attention to missing compensation funds for flood victims.Today, the lake's dark history is almost forgotten. It has become a premium holiday destination and is surrounded by hotels.But activists remain wary.""Economic progress is not the only progress, these big hotels are not for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan as these businessmen are making profits for themselves only and destroying our ecosystems that will make our children's lives more difficult,"" Jan said.He worries that the unchecked development at Attabad Lake can spell more climate disasters in the future.Anam Rathor, co-founder of Climate Action Pakistan, sees Attabad Lake as a prime example of how corporate interests are greenwashing development projects under the guise of ""community economic uplift"" and ""sustainable tourism"" in GB.Jan, Rathor and other climate advocates are calling for a return to indigenous wisdom and culture, as well as customary laws and practices during development planning of GB.Activist Pervez Ali also looks back to 2010 to explain his stance against climate change. That was the year when a flash flood wiped out his entire village in Ghizer district in GB, making him and his family climate refugees. He was seven years old at the time.Now a 19-year-old, Ali knows what challenges face the 33 million people who were forced to leave their homes due to the 2022 floods. After coordinating the country's ""Fridays for Future movement"" and representing Pakistan at the COP27 climate summit last November, he can also speak from experience about pressure on climate activists.""A person from GB is always at risk, I have been getting threats from private numbers. I had to seek help from Climate Defenders that help activists under threat,"" Ali told DW. ""In Pakistan, if you are talking against powerful forces and in the interest of communities and not profit, then activism has its price.""COP27 ended with a historic deal to create a new fund, which would see countries historically responsible for high carbon emissions compensate vulnerable and affected countries, such as Pakistan.However, climate activists say the focus must be on cutting carbon emissions to prevent crossing the global heating threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, which will compound climate change even further for vulnerable regions.""Reparations are not a solution, it is a bandage,"" Baba Jan stressed. ""It would be much better to not emit the carbon that leads to disasters, than pay for the damages later that are impossible to fully calculate anyway. We need a systemic change to do no harm to the environment in the first place rather than destroying ecosystems.""Activists are also concerned by reparations being distributed on a global rather than local level. While representatives from the government of Pakistan were one of the key negotiators for the ""Loss and Damage"" Fund; activists like Jan were met with force by local government for demanding the same for community reparations.""Climate activism is treated very differently when demands are made to the Global North than when made internally. The government supports reparations for Pakistan as a low emitter country but if we criticize local development projects that are profitable but bad for ecology, then our voice is stifled,"" said Rathor.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/2/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811441,Ukraine: Life after the tragedy of Dnipro,"The Russian rocket attack on the city of Dnipro on January 14 was one of the deadliest of the war so far. According to the Ukrainian authorities, at least 46 people were killed, and 80 injured when a residential building was hit by a Kh-22 supersonic cruise missile. Five of the victims are still in hospital. Dozens more lost their homes, relatives, and friends, and are still suffering the consequences of the tragedy.Anastasia Shvets, 24, is sometimes recognized by people on the street. She even describes herself on her Instagram page as ""the girl who is now in all the news about Dnipro.""Shvets is a survivor of the Russian rocket attack. That day, she lost her parents, her cat, her apartment, and her entire life as she knew it. She still finds it hard returning to the ruined building. Nonetheless, she wants to talk about what she has been through. ""When you talk about it, your heart always feels a little lighter, even though you can't change anything, and you have to live with it,"" she says.Shvets and her parents had lived in that apartment block since she was a child. Her mother, Nataliia, worked in a bank. Her father, Maksym, was a mechanic in a garage. Shvets and her mother were both involved in animal welfare, especially looking after stray cats. They fed them and looked for people to adopt them. When the war broke out, Shvets' father lost his job. After this, he volunteered, building roadblocks around the city.Shvets says that after lunch that Saturday, January 14, her parents were sitting in the kitchen making candles for soldiers in the trenches. She decided to go to and lie down, because she was working nights in a bakery. ""Just ten minutes later, as I put my cellphone down beside me to go to sleep, I heard a massive roar. It was like an earthquake,"" Shvets says, recalling the moment the rocket hit.The entire stairwell of the nine-story building was destroyed, almost down to the ground. All that was left of Shvets' family's sixth-floor apartment was the corridor, and a part of the room with the bed in which she was lying. ""I started calling my parents, even though I realized the kitchen just wasn't there anymore,"" Shvets remembers.She crawled to the edge of what was left of the room, and tried to attract the rescue workers' attention. A photo went viral of her huddled, bare-legged, in the ruins. At that point, she still hoped her parents might have survived, but their bodies were pulled from the wreckage the following day.Since the tragedy, Shvets has been living with her grandmother and aunt. She is still on sick leave, but hopes to be able to work again soon. She says she is frightened by loud noises, banging doors, and air-raid warnings, and that sometimes she has to take sedatives.The loss of her parents is not the first Shvets has suffered in this war. In September, her boyfriend Vladyslav died fighting in the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. ""I still haven't come to terms with this loss, and now my parents are gone as well. I carry the grief for them around in me all the time now,"" she says, with tears in her eyes.When the psychologist Olha Botvinova hears the words ""good morning,"" she smiles. She and her husband Yevhen also lived in the apartment block in Dnipro. ""Weirdly, that day, January 14, we were making plans for the next six months,"" she says. ""It was just an unbelievable feeling — a sign that we weren't meant to die.""Botvinova sees the day of the rocket attack as a kind of second birthday. It was a miracle, she says, the way she survived. ""I was sitting in a room that no longer exists, working on my laptop. Suddenly, my husband called to me to come to the room next door. I went to him. A few minutes later, what happened, happened,"" she explains.When Botvinova and her husband came to, they tried to go downstairs from their apartment on the ninth floor — but behind the door of the room they were in, there was nothing but an abyss. Botvinova was bleeding from her temple. Her husband, who is a surgeon, used a T-shirt to bandage her head. Then he took a flashlight and started signaling from the window to the rescue workers, who managed to rescue the couple from the ninth floor a few hours later.Russia's war against Ukraine has repeatedly turned the Botvinovas lives upside down. They are originally from Donetsk. When the war in Donbas began in 2014, they packed their bags and moved to Kherson. Then, when the city was occupied by Russia in the spring of 2022, they had to move again. The couple fled to the Kyiv-controlled part of the country, and moved into the now-destroyed apartment block in Dnipro.On January 15, the day after the rocket attack, the Botvinovas found out that their previous apartment in Kherson had also been destroyed by a Russian rocket. ""We're starting again for the third time,"" says Olha Botvinova, with a bitter laugh. ""But we're alive, and the material things will come in time.""The Botvinovas are now living in an apartment made available to them by another couple, who used social media to offer help to victims of the tragedy. Friends and acquaintances gave them clothes, and strangers have also donated. Botvinova praises people's solidarity and readiness to help. Her husband is already back working at the hospital, and she plans to run psychology workshops in the near future.Both Shvets and Botvinova say that they do not want to burden themselves with thoughts about the people who fired the rocket that hit their building. Botvinova stresses that she wants to think positively, so as ""not to feel like a victim all my life."" She is busy developing projects to provide victims of war with psychological support.And Shvets comments that anger ""won't bring [her] parents back."" She is focusing on collecting donations for the Ukrainian army, ""so our boys will be able to annihilate this garbage on our territory,"" she says — meaning the Russian invaders.Both women, having survived the rocket attack, say their lives must go on somehow. ""I have to go on living, not just for myself, but for my parents, too, so their life's work wasn't in vain,"" says Shvets.And Botvinova stresses that her own survival makes her feel as though she did not have the moral right to give up. ""Every day is a great miracle, and offers the chance to keep going and to live. I have this — unlike the other people who were also in our building, who had children and plans for their lives, but who didn't survive. I have this chance, and I mustn't waste it!""This article was originally published in Russian.",2023/2/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811442,Italy's Berlusconi acquitted in witness bribery case,"An Italian court on Wednesday acquitted former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in a case where he was charged with paying witnesses to lie about his involvement in underage prostitution.Prosecutors had demanded that Berlusconi be imprisoned for six years for bribing 24 guests at his parties to give false testimony in a previous trial, where he was charged with paying for sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer.He was acquitted in the underage prostitution case because of a lack of proof that he knew he was paying a minor. The former leader was then charged for bribing witnesses.The case of paying off witnesses was split between three cities — Siena, Rome and Milan — because of where the witnesses lived.Berlusconi has already been acquitted in the cases in Siena and Rome. Prosecutors there are appealing this decision.The case in Milan is the most high-profile of the three.Berlusconi has previously acknowledged giving money to his guests but said that it was compensation for the reputational damage they suffered.There have been a total of 35 criminal court cases against him but only one conviction. The total number of cases refers to separate court cases rather than individual trials at each phase of judicial procedure.He was convicted in 2014 but this was overturned the following year, a verdict upheld by an appeals court and the Supreme Court. Berlusconi's one trial to conclude in a final conviction was the one for tax fraud, false accounting and embezzlement.Italy's top court confirmed Berlusconi's sentence, four years' imprisonment, though three were excused by a pardon. Berlusconi was able to cover the remaining time with community service.The case has long cast a shadow on his political career.Dubbed as the ""bunga bunga parties,"" the scandal led to his political downfall and the end of his fourth term as prime minister in 2011.Berlusconi's Forza Italia party — a key player in current Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition — has consistently denied the allegations. According to the party, Berlusconi has been a victim of a years-long ploy by magistrates to end his time in politics.Since then, Berlusconi was re-elected to Italy's upper house in 2022 with more than 50% of the votes in September in the northern city of Monza, where he also owns a soccer team.That marked a significant comeback for him as he was expelled from the Senate in 2013 because of a tax fraud conviction stemming from his media business.ar, mk/fb (Reuters, AFP)",2023/2/15,,

            The six-year-old trial is the third and likely final one in a scandal that made headlines around the world in 2010 when Berlusconi — as a sitting premier — faced charges of having paid for sex with an underage girl. He was eventually acquitted.

            In the third trial, Berlusconi faced charges of paying off witnesses to lie in earlier trials. Prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence for him, along with 10 million euros ($10.7 million) in damages. A further 28 people, including the woman at the center of the scandal, Karima el-Mahroug, were also all found not guilty on Wednesday.











            “I am very happy,'' el-Mahroug told reporters after hearing the acquittal, adding that it showed she had always spoken the truth. ”I just need a moment to assimilate this fact, to believe it.""

            Berlusconi was not present as the verdict was read, but in an Instagram post said the acquittal had ended years of “suffering, of mud and of incalculable political damage.” 

            His lawyer, Federico Cecconi, called the verdict, which formally found no crime had been committed, “the fullest acquittal we could achieve.”

            The earlier trials took place as Berlusconi still wielded considerable power as premier, raising concern among security officials that he had left himself vulnerable to extortion by hosting young women at his villa.

            The 86-year-old three-time former premier is currently head of the third party in Italy’s right-wing governing coalition, whose popularity has shrunk significantly from its heyday to around 6% now, according to polls. 

            Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni welcomed Wednesday's verdict, saying it “puts an end to a long judicial affair that had important repercussions on Italian political and institutional life.”

            Meloni's administration this week took the step of removing the government as an injured party in the case, to avoid creating an awkward political dynamic in the case of guilty verdicts.

            Otherwise, Indianapolis seems like the perfect party spot. He met his wife here, raised his four children here, and now intends to write the final chapter of a long, storied and distinguished racing career here.

            
                The 2013 Indianapolis 500 champion announced Wednesday he intends to make his 22nd — and final 500 start — in May before retiring from America's top open-wheel series. He'll drive the No. 66 Chevrolet for Arrow McLaren.











            “You’re never ready for this, but you've got to weigh your options,” he said during a 45-minute news conference at Indianapolis Motor Speedway after making the initial announcement in a Twitter video. “I went from full-time to part-time (driver), you're 48, you had a great career and as much as you don’t want to go, it’s there.""

            The wildly popular Brazilian seemed more resolute than emotional as he explained the decision, perhaps because Kanaan has had some practice calling it a career.

            In early 2020, he was in Indy when series officials unveiled a logo for what they billed as a five-race farewell tour dubbed Kanaan's “Last Lap.” But when the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the annual 500 from its traditional Memorial Day weekend spot into August and was run in front of no fans, Kanaan wanted another chance to properly say goodbye to the throngs of loyal fans.

            So he returned in 2021 and then again in 2022, alongside new teammate and seven-time Cup champ Jimmie Johnson with the powerhouse Chip Ganassi Racing team. Kanaan revved up the crowd all month last May by qualifying sixth and finishing third to jump start a new debate about a 2023 return.

            “Let’s be real here, if I hadn’t done what I did last year, it probably would have been my final one,” Kanaan said. “You go out and you fight for the lead, and you fight for the win until the last lap, then you’re on a high. People actually are demanding, ‘Why don’t you come back?’ Then you get an invitation from a very good team to do it.”

            Kanaan couldn't say no though he insists he'll call it caputs after the scheduled May 28 race — win or lose.

            If it is the end, Kanaan will celebrate a remarkable career that began in Brazil, took him to Columbus, Ohio, in 1996 with just a few English words scribbled on a sheet of paper to help him get acclimated to a new country and ended with him as one of the series' top ambassadors and a staple for Indianapolis charities.

            Kanaan didn't just learn the native language, he won over Americans with his charismatic personality, aggressive driving, a penchant for winning with style and losing with grace.

            He became the first IndyCar driver to complete every lap of every race during his series-championship winning 2004 season. He emerged as the series' Ironman by starting a record 318 consecutive races and competing in triathlons. His mountain bike and nose became a fixture around Gasoline Alley, and winning 17 races, tied for 26th all-time, only added to his reputation.

            But local fans also appreciated the way he handled his many Brickyard travails.

            After winning 2005 the pole, he wound up eighth — the third of four straight of four consecutive top-eight finishes and behind three of his teammates. Two years later, Kanaan was leading when the race was red-flagged for rain then lost it with a spin — 10 laps before more arrived, allowing teammate Dario Franchitti to reach victory lane under yellow for the first of his three Indy wins. Kanaan faded to 12th.

            He also finished fourth in 2011 and third in 2012 before finally shedding the title of leading the second-most laps of any non-winner at Indy in 2013, a win that brought the crowd to its feet and the emotions out of Kanaan as he took the traditional milk bath.

            Since then, he's had five more top-10s in the 500 and no other wins but Kanaan never really complained.

            And now on a rival team of Ganassi's, Kanaan will team up with 2015 Indy winner Alexander Rossi, 2020 series runner-up Pato O'Ward of Mexico and Swedish driver Felix Rosenqvist, with one last shot to join the two-time winner's club. Kanaan couldn't ask for anything more in his adopted hometown.

            “No, I couldn’t imagine,"" Kanaan said, reflecting on his career. ""It’s been a great journey and a lot of people helped. I’m glad that I’m going out on my own terms.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811448,"Key developments in the aftermath of Turkey, Syria quakes","ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — The earthquakes that killed more than 39,000 people in southern Turkey and northern Syria produced more grieving and suffering along with extraordinary rescues and appeals for aid. 

            Here's a look at key developments Wednesday from the aftermath of the earthquakes:

            DEFYING ODDS AFTER NINE DAYS











            A woman and her two children – a boy and a girl – were extricated from a collapsed apartment building in Antakya, Turkey, a full 228 hours after the first 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck in the early hours of Feb. 6. All three were taken to a hospital. 

            Rescuer Mehmet Eryilmaz said the woman, named Ela, asked what day it was when she was pulled from the wreckage.

            “First, I held her hand,” Eryilmaz told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency about reaching her in the rubble. “We talked, chatted and calmed (her) down. After that, we continued our work. ... We are very happy; it’s the fifth life we saved.”

            Eryilmaz, who is a member of a team trained to perform mine rescues, added: “She asked for water in the first place but we did not give anything before the medical teams intervened. She asked ‘What day are we on?’”

            Health worker Ali Parlas, who treated Ela and her son and daughter, said the three were dehydrated but in reasonable condition.

            The children’s names are Meysam and Ali, Eryilmaz said.

            
                The rescues were exceptions to the grim work of locating the bodies of the remaining dead. The first earthquake and a 7.5 magnitude quake nine hours later destroyed thousands of buildings. Survivors and building experts have said shoddy construction contributed to the massive death toll. 

            ANKARA EXPRESSES GRATITUDE

            Turkey’s foreign minister thanked the international community Wednesday for its support following last week's earthquakes. 

            Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said 76 countries sent search and rescue teams to help Turkish personnel comb through collapsed buildings. Twelve of the foreign teams have returned home after completing their missions, he said.

            “Of course, everything isn’t perfect. There were shortcoming, shortcomings in coordination in the beginning, but in a short time, the system was established,” Cavusoglu said of the emergency response.

            The minister said 36,000 tents had arrived in Turkey from abroad to help shelter the tens of thousands of people left homeless and that another 51,000 were en route along with shipping containers that Qatar used to house soccer fans during last year's World Cup tournament.

            Cavusoglu said his government also was working to ensure “urgent housing needs” were met with the local production of tents and containers that would be used for temporary shelter.

            Aid is also coming from ethnic Greeks in Cyprus who for nearly half a century have been locked in a dispute with Turkey. 

            British soldiers serving with a United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus helped to transfer aid donated by Greek Cypriots in the south of the ethnically divided island nation to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north. From there, it is expected to be taken to Turkey for distribution to earthquake victims.

            At least two dozen Turkish Cypriot students taking part in a volleyball tournament in the Turkish city of Adiyaman died in the quakes, while many other people from Cyprus remained missing. 

            SUFFERING IN SYRIA

            Along with the more than 35,000 people killed in Turkey, nearly 3,700 deaths were confirmed across the border in war-torn Syria, where the quakes multiplied the suffering of residents who had endured 12 years of civil war.

            The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, said in a statement after visiting to Syria that “communities already devastated by the years of conflict are now being pushed beyond their limits.” She emphasized an immediate need for clean water.

            While rescue teams from around the world went to help in Turkey, aid relief for Syria was slowed by demolished roads and by the tensions between rebel-held areas of the country and those controlled by the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

            
                The United Nations launched a $397 million appeal Tuesday to provide aid for nearly 5 million Syrians for the coming three months. That was a day after the global body announced a deal with Damascus to deliver U.N. aid through two more border crossings from Turkey to rebel-held areas of northwest Syria.

            
                The needs on the ground remained daunting, with fiercely cold weather adding to the misery. 

            CRACKS AND AFTERSHOCKS

            Orhan Tatar, general director of earthquake and risk reduction at Turkey’s disaster management authority, said that the earthquakes had produced a shift of about 7.3 meters in the ground and a massive crack of about 400 kilometers. 

            The two earthquakes took place on five faults and were followed by some 3,900 aftershocks, Tatar said, calling the number a “very serious” and “unusual” amount. The aftershocks have meant people in the affected areas could feel significant shaking every 15 minutes, the official said.

            Tatar said billions of cubic meters of rubble would have to be removed. He also warned that heavy snow in some rural areas was creating a risk of avalanches.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811449,Sweden says its weapons are 'significant' boost for Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Sweden pledged Wednesday to rush fearsome Archer artillery cannons to Ukraine “as soon as possible"" but also cautioned that future military aid would have to be balanced with its own defense needs as a would-be future member of the NATO military alliance.

            Speaking on a visit to the Ukrainian capital, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Archer howitzers, as well as 51 infantry fighting vehicles and anti-tank weapons that Sweden has promised, will together “make a significant contribution to Ukraine's combat power.” 

            The latest promised package of Swedish military aid, which Kristersson's government first announced last month, comes as Ukraine is fiercely clinging to territory in the east of the country against renewed Russian assaults. Ukraine is counting on continued Western military aid to repel Russian advances and to launch its own offensives. 











            The truck-mounted Archer is a so-called “shoot and scoot” weapon, able to quickly fire a succession of three rounds and be on the move again before the first shell hits its target. 

            NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that Ukraine's Western suppliers are “in a race of logistics” to stop Russia from seizing the battlefield initiative. 

            Archer cannons will join other Western-supplied equipment that has helped tilt artillery engagements in Ukraine's favor, along with French-made Caesar howitzers, U.S.-supplied HIMARS and other precision-strike systems. 

            Kristersson, speaking at a news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wouldn't say exactly when his country's Archer cannons would arrive, citing security needs and “practical reasons as well, in terms of training and things like that.""

            But he said training would start “very soon"" and pledged Archer deliveries “as soon as possible."" 

            Zelenskyy described the Archer as “one of the best artillery pieces"" and predicted it would impact Russia's invasion forces on the battlefield.

            “The stronger Ukraine is now, the sooner the Russian aggression ends,” he said. 

            Kristersson was less emphatic about another weapons system on Kyiv's wish-list: Fighter planes. 

            He didn't rule out such support. But he suggested that Sweden wouldn't want to go it alone as a potential supplier and that other nations would have to rally around the idea of plane deliveries, as they eventually did around sending NATO-standard tanks to Ukraine.

            “We don't exclude anything right now, this is not the time of excluding anything,” the Swedish prime minister said. ""But at the same time we also acknowledge the fact that we need an international coalition to do further steps. That is quite obvious."" 

            Kristersson said Sweden's drive to join NATO — along with fellow candidate nation Finland — will also play into its thinking about military supplies to Ukraine. 

            Being a candidate for NATO membership “puts us in a very special situation right now. We have very obvious reasons to be very careful with our own defense right now.” he said. 

            “We will do everything we can to support Ukraine and we will do it in a way that doesn't adventure or risk the Swedish ability to defend ourselves, because that is a core competence for a NATO-applicant country to uphold,” the prime minister said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811450,Brazil picks Ramon Menezes as interim national team coach,"SAO PAULO (AP) — Ramon Menezes will serve as Brazil's interim coach while the search continues for a permanent successor to Tite, who stepped down after the World Cup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811451,Cavaliers sign Danny Green with eye on postseason impact,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Danny Green was best known for his sideline dance routines during his first stint with the Cavaliers.

            He has picked up some new moves since then.

            Green rejoined Cleveland's roster Wednesday after agreeing to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Cavaliers, who believe the three-time NBA champion can help them in the postseason.











            Green, who was drafted by Cleveland in 2009 and waived after one season, gives the team another proven outside shooter. More importantly, he's a selfless teammate expected to blend in nicely with a young team looking to make its mark in the playoffs.

            “Someone who is about the team and who just wants to fit in,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.

            Green is expected to be in Philadelphia on Wednesday night for the final game before the All-Star break.

            After tearing a knee ligament during last year's playoffs while with the 76ers, the 35-year-old Green played in just three games for Memphis this season before being traded last week to Houston. The Rockets bought out his contract, making him a free agent, and the Cavaliers lured him away over several other interested contenders.

            The Cavs envision Green having an on-floor impact during the postseason, where he has shined before. Green has appeared in 165 playoff games and can help Cleveland's young players navigate what will be a new experience for many of them.

            Bickerstaff already has spoken with Green about playing time. The Cavaliers, who entered the day fourth in the Eastern Conference standings, have won seven straight going into their game at Philadelphia and finally are healthy.

            Bickerstaff doesn't want to mess up what Cleveland has going while planning ahead.

            “We have to figure the balance between continuing with the group that has started to head that way and then how you mix in a piece that could possibly help you down the road,” he said. “But we will be very ginger with that because we do not want to disrupt the rhythm of what these guys are finding right now.”

            Green has a reputation for being a big-game, big-shot maker.

            With San Antonio in 2013, he set an NBA Finals record by making 23 3-pointers, a mark that didn't set well with Cavaliers All-Star Donovan Mitchell, who was a teenage hope fan back then.

            “I remember watching him against the Heat breaking Ray Allen’s 3-point record,” Mitchell cracked. “I hated him at the time.”

            All has been forgiven, and Mitchell, who has known Green since Mitchell was 11, is excited about adding a player with a championship pedigree.

            “Veteran presence around the locker room, calming presence, great personality,” Mitchell said. “But when he gets in, a sniper, especially in big-time situations. He’s done it year in and year out.”

            Green has averaged 8.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 822 career games. He has made 39.9% of his 3-pointers.

            He played collegiately at North Carolina. After playing 23 games for Cleveland, Green spent eight seasons with San Antonio, winning a title with the Spurs in 2014. He won championships with Toronto and the Los Angeles Lakers, and is one of four players in league history to win titles with three franchises.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCLEVELAND (AP) — Danny Green was best known for his sideline dance routines during his first stint with the Cavaliers.He has picked up some new moves since then.Green rejoined Cleveland's roster Wednesday after agreeing to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Cavaliers, who believe the three-time NBA champion can help them in the postseason.Green, who was drafted by Cleveland in 2009 and waived after one season, gives the team another proven outside shooter. More importantly, he's a selfless teammate expected to blend in nicely with a young team looking to make its mark in the playoffs.“Someone who is about the team and who just wants to fit in,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.Green is expected to be in Philadelphia on Wednesday night for the final game before the All-Star break.After tearing a knee ligament during last year's playoffs while with the 76ers, the 35-year-old Green played in just three games for Memphis this season before being traded last week to Houston. The Rockets bought out his contract, making him a free agent, and the Cavaliers lured him away over several other interested contenders.The Cavs envision Green having an on-floor impact during the postseason, where he has shined before. Green has appeared in 165 playoff games and can help Cleveland's young players navigate what will be a new experience for many of them.Bickerstaff already has spoken with Green about playing time. The Cavaliers, who entered the day fourth in the Eastern Conference standings, have won seven straight going into their game at Philadelphia and finally are healthy.Bickerstaff doesn't want to mess up what Cleveland has going while planning ahead.“We have to figure the balance between continuing with the group that has started to head that way and then how you mix in a piece that could possibly help you down the road,” he said. “But we will be very ginger with that because we do not want to disrupt the rhythm of what these guys are finding right now.”Green has a reputation for being a big-game, big-shot maker.With San Antonio in 2013, he set an NBA Finals record by making 23 3-pointers, a mark that didn't set well with Cavaliers All-Star Donovan Mitchell, who was a teenage hope fan back then.“I remember watching him against the Heat breaking Ray Allen’s 3-point record,” Mitchell cracked. “I hated him at the time.”All has been forgiven, and Mitchell, who has known Green since Mitchell was 11, is excited about adding a player with a championship pedigree.“Veteran presence around the locker room, calming presence, great personality,” Mitchell said. “But when he gets in, a sniper, especially in big-time situations. He’s done it year in and year out.”Green has averaged 8.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 822 career games. He has made 39.9% of his 3-pointers.He played collegiately at North Carolina. After playing 23 games for Cleveland, Green spent eight seasons with San Antonio, winning a title with the Spurs in 2014.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811464,Peru reopens Machu Picchu after agreement with protesters,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's Machu Picchu, an Inca-era stone citadel nestled in its southeastern jungle, reopened on Wednesday after being closed nearly a month ago amid antigovernment protests, the culture ministry announced.

            Agreements were made between authorities, social groups and the local tourism industry to guarantee the security of the famed tourist attraction and transport services.

            Protests calling for the resignation of President Dina Boluarte and members of Peru's Congress have shaken the region, including Cuzco, for more than two months. The demonstrations caused a blockade of the train tracks leading to the stone citadel.











            The protests have led to 60 deaths: 48 are civilians who died in clashes with the security forces; 11 civilians killed in traffic accidents related to road blockades; and one policeman who died inside a patrol car when it was set on fire, according to data from the Ombudsman’s Office.

            The closure of Machu Picchu, on Jan. 21, forced the government to airlift more than 400 tourists from Machu Picchu to the city of Cusco by helicopter. 

            Machu Picchu was built by the Incas in the 15th century as a religious sanctuary high in Andes Mountains.LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's Machu Picchu, an Inca-era stone citadel nestled in its southeastern jungle, reopened on Wednesday after being closed nearly a month ago amid antigovernment protests, the culture ministry announced.Agreements were made between authorities, social groups and the local tourism industry to guarantee the security of the famed tourist attraction and transport services.Protests calling for the resignation of President Dina Boluarte and members of Peru's Congress have shaken the region, including Cuzco, for more than two months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811469,EPA declined to challenge federal utility on new gas plant,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Critics have long blasted the nation’s largest public utility over its preference to replace coal-burning power plants with ones reliant on gas, another fossil fuel. 

            The same advocates are now frustrated that federal environmental regulators won't stand in the way of the utility's latest extensive project, which clashes with the Biden administration’s directives to fight climate change, despite their laundry list of concerns. 

            
                The gas plant decision by the Tennessee Valley Authority came January 10, capping a monthslong conflict between the TVA and the Environmental Protection Agency — two federal agencies that are both charged with a mission to protect the environment. It was also just a few weeks before the first meeting of TVA’s new board of directors, with a majority appointed by President Joe Biden, which will convene this Thursday.











            The EPA had written to the TVA on Jan. 6 regarding its “substantial” concerns with the plan to bank on gas at the Cumberland Fossil Plant. But ultimately, the nation's environmental watchdog relented when it could have challenged the utility’s claims about the gas plant’s expected environmental impacts at the highest ranks of government — the White House.

            In essence, the TVA “thumbed their nose at EPA’s comments,” said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor specializing in environmental law at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. The TVA provides power to about 10 million customers in parts of seven southern states. 

            The EPA had recommended integrating a combination of renewables, like wind and solar, along with projects that reduce the overall demand for electricity, like energy efficiency, to replace the mammoth aging coal plant near Cumberland City. Instead, TVA’s analysis of alternatives compared only new gas plants to a massive array of solar and battery storage.

            TVA's environmental impact statement confirmed a new combined-cycle gas plant will release earth-warming carbon dioxide and methane pollution for decades to come. However, the utility found the solar and battery option would take too long to build and cost $1.8 billion more than a new gas plant. The TVA also stated greenhouse gas effects from the two options would be “relatively close.” 

            The EPA took issue with TVA's conclusions, saying the utility relied on misleading comparisons and inaccurate economic data. The environmental agency also noted the TVA could be left with “stranded assets” in the form of a plant it has to stop using before it has recuperated the cost of building. As for the environmental impacts, the utility’s own analysis results in a $3 billion savings with the solar option over the 30-year life of the project, according to the EPA. 

            EPA’s decision not to take further action smacks of politics, Parenteau said.

            “We know that the Biden administration is schizophrenic on gas,” he said, noting large gas exports under Biden and high rates of oil and gas leasing. “This, of course, is in total contradiction to what he campaigned on. But it does reflect, to be fair, the political reality of the day. It reflects the war in Ukraine. It reflects the prices at the gas pump, it reflects lots of stuff.”

            Concerned citizens sent a letter on Jan. 4 to EPA Administrator Michael Regan urging him to refer TVA’s Cumberland Fossil Plant project to the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The Department of the Interior was the last agency to send the council a project in 2016. The EPA hasn’t done it since 1996.

            While referrals are rare, they have sometimes resulted in “major changes,” Parenteau said. “The abandonment of the jet port in the Everglades is one of them.”

            Instead, the EPA sent a letter to the TVA on Jan. 6 outlining the deficiencies of its final environmental impact statement and urging the utility to address them in its record of decision. Four days later, TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash issued that record of decision, moving forward with a 1,450-megawatt natural gas plant. It once again failed to address EPA’s concerns. 

            In an email to The Associated Press, EPA spokesperson James Pinkney said the agency carefully considered all available options.

            “EPA determined that there were practical and achievable actions TVA could do within its Record of Decision, as well as with future actions, to improve environmental outcomes while meeting its need to retire the Cumberland coal plant,” he wrote.

            Critics of TVA's long-stated preference for gas have accused the utility of not giving serious consideration to other alternatives, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. 

            “TVA clearly spent a lot of time and money developing the gas alternative,” said Amanda Garcia, Tennessee director for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “It did not do the same for solar and storage, let alone a range of alternatives like wind, energy efficiency and demand response,” which helps customers change their usage patterns to flatten peak demand periods.

            The law center has pointed out that the TVA signed contracts with two gas companies months before it completed the environmental impact study that was supposed to guide its decision. 

            The utility corporation said the contracts were necessary to allow preliminary planning work. They were not binding agreements to choose gas, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said in an email. They were contingent on TVA’s final fuel decision.

            The TVA has faced criticism for other environmental reviews in the past.

            The Sierra Club is suing the utility over its decision to install gas turbines at a retired coal plant in New Johnsonville. In that case, the TVA said the new gas plant will not have a significant environmental impact, so it did not have to complete an impact statement required under the National Environmental Policy Act — despite TVA’s own estimates that it will emit more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

            And the TVA has been involved in a decade-long lawsuit over its decision to begin clear-cutting millions of trees around its transmission lines without completing an environmental impact statement. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against the corporation repeatedly in that case.

            The utility, in turn, pointed to its recent victory in a lawsuit over its decades-long power-provider agreements. A judge dismissed the challenge, ruling in part that the environmental act “does not require review of every major federal action.”

            The new gas plant at Cumberland is not yet a done deal. A 32-mile pipeline still needs approval, requiring yet another environmental impact statement. TVA's board members have remained mum about the project when contacted by the AP.

            “It seems to me that enough serious questions have been raised that the new board might want to take a second look at it,” Parenteau said.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811471,Bryan Reynolds acknowledges he couldn't force Pirates' hand,"BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — Bryan Reynolds requested a trade this offseason. He also had no real power to force one.

            So he's back at spring training with Pittsburgh, preparing for another season with the Pirates. There's no use looking too far into an uncertain future.

            “I’m always going to be where my feet are at,"" the 28-year-old outfielder said Wednesday. ""I’m here right now, so I’m locked in for a hundred percent Pirates — whatever that takes.”











            Pittsburgh's first workout for pitchers and catchers was Wednesday, but for outfielders like Reynolds it's not until Monday. So he was in camp several days early. Still, Reynolds said nothing has really changed since he made his trade request before the winter meetings.

            He made it clear the request is related to his desire for a contract extension — and not any discontent with playing in Pittsburgh.

            “I’ve always said I like playing here. I like the city, I like the fans, I like the stadium. We like living in Pittsburgh for half the year,"" he said. “I’m happy. I like my teammates, I like the staff, I like all that.”

            He also indicated he'd be willing to stay if the price is right.

            “My number one would be to sign an extension in Pittsburgh, but I want that to be a fair deal for both sides,"" Reynolds said. ""Not a crazy player, not a crazy team deal. That’s always been my number one.”

            The problem for Reynolds is that although he's a good player who might bring back a nice return for the Pirates if they dealt him, Pittsburgh can keep him a while if it wants. In fact, when he made his trade request, the Pirates said that would have “zero impact” on the team's decision-making and noted he still has three years before hitting free agency.

            That's a reality Reynolds acknowledges.

            “I was frustrated,” he said. ""I think we have a right to kind of have those emotions, too, and that’s what we did, but obviously can’t force them to do anything.”

            Reynolds hit .302 with 24 home runs and was an All-Star in 2021. His average dipped to .262 last year, when he hit a career-high 27 homers.

            If the Pirates do trade him soon, it would be a full-circle moment. Reynolds came to Pittsburgh in the 2018 deal that sent star outfielder Andrew McCutchen to San Francisco. Now McCutchen has returned to the Pirates via free agency.

            “Full circle, coming from being in that trade and answering all the questions about me trying to replace McCutchen,"" Reynolds said. ""Now he’s finally back.”

            Now McCutchen might end up helping replace Reynolds. Not yet, though.

            “I'm just going to focus on the same thing I've always focused on,"" Reynolds said. ""Try to be the best player and try to help us win.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811472,PolyMet mine in Minnesota becomes NewRange Copper Nickel,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — PolyMet Mining and Teck Resources finalized a joint venture Wednesday to complete the copper-nickel mine that PolyMet has been developing in northeastern Minnesota, and the partnership hopes to eventually build a separate mine next door in an even larger ore body that Teck controls.

            The long-planned PolyMet mine near Babbitt will now be known as NewRange Copper Nickel, the name of the 50-50 joint venture. Combined, the joint venture's mineral resources are more than quadruple the size of what PolyMet had on its own. 

            Under the newly closed deal, NewRange now controls about half of the known copper, nickel, cobalt and platinum-group metal reserves in the geological formation known as the Duluth Complex, one of the world's largest untapped resources of the critical minerals.











            “Successful closing of the joint venture moves NewRange Copper Nickel to the forefront of responsible development of American-sourced critical minerals for the manufacture of clean energy and clean transportation technologies such as battery storage, wind and solar generation and electric vehicles,” Jon Cherry, PolyMet chairman, president and CEO, said in a statement. 

            Environmental groups that have long fought PolyMet raised concerns when initial plans for the joint venture were announced last summer, saying it potentially could lead to even bigger threats to the water-rich region. But NewRange says it will be a conscientious steward of the area's water, air and natural resources.

            The name NewRange pays homage to the mining heritage of northeastern Minnesota's Iron Range. The joint venture's first task is to bring the open pit mine that PolyMet had been developing in its NorthMet ore body over the finish line. That project remains on hold because three key permits, which were issued over four years ago, are still tied up in challenges in courts and regulatory agencies. Because of those, NewRange still isn't projecting a date for major construction to begin.

            Environmentalists have opposed the mine because the copper and nickel in the Duluth Complex are bound up in sulfide minerals that can leach sulfuric acid when exposed to water and air. For that reason, President Joe Biden's administration is trying to kill another proposed mine nearby, Twin Metals near Ely, which sits in a watershed that flows into the pristine Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. While the administration last year committed itself to expanding domestic sources of critical minerals for electric vehicles and renewable energy, it says the Boundary Waters merit special protections. 

            The joint venture controls both the NorthMet deposit and Teck's Mesaba deposit a few miles to the east. The lower-profile Mesaba project hasn't progressed past the exploratory stages. NewRange plans further studies. A formal proposal for the envisioned open pit mine would have to go through a full environmental review and permitting process. That process would take at least several years. It hasn't been decided whether a mine at the Mesaba site would use the former LTV Steel processing plant near Hoyt Lakes that will handle NorthMet's ore.

            The combined indicated and inferred resources of the two deposits adds up to nearly 4.8 billion tons (4.4 billion metric tons) — over 1.1 billion tons (1 billion metric tons) from NorthMet and over 3.6 billion tons (3.3 billion metric tons) from Mesaba, the companies said.

            While the NorthMet deposit is in a watershed that eventually flows into Lake Superior, the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy has pointed out that the Mesaba ore body sits mostly in the Boundary Waters watershed, like Twin Metals. But unlike Twin Metals, the Mesaba mineral rights leases are from the state, not the federal government.

            Also in the early stages is the proposed Talon Metals mine near Tamarack, which has a deal to supply nickel to electric-carmaker Tesla Inc. It's about 90 miles (145 kilometers) to the southwest, in the Mississippi River watershed. Talon plans to submit its application to kick off the review process in the next few weeks.

            Both St. Paul-based PolyMet Mining Corp. and Vancouver, British Columbia-based Teck Resources Ltd. will remain publicly traded companies listed on both the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges. PolyMet's majority shareholder is Swiss commodities giant Glencore, which owns 71% of its common stock plus rights to acquire 78%, and has pledged continued financial support for the project. Teck's largest shareholder is the China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund of the Beijing government, with a 10% stake.

            Tannice McCoy, who had been Teck's Mesaba project manager since 2018, will be general manager of NewRange, responsible for day-to-day operations. Cherry will remain chairman, president and CEO of PolyMet and will chair the management committee of the joint venture.ST. PAUL, Minn.

While the administration last year committed itself to expanding domestic sources of critical minerals for electric vehicles and renewable energy, it says the Boundary Waters merit special protections.The joint venture controls both the NorthMet deposit and Teck's Mesaba deposit a few miles to the east. The lower-profile Mesaba project hasn't progressed past the exploratory stages. NewRange plans further studies. A formal proposal for the envisioned open pit mine would have to go through a full environmental review and permitting process. That process would take at least several years. It hasn't been decided whether a mine at the Mesaba site would use the former LTV Steel processing plant near Hoyt Lakes that will handle NorthMet's ore.The combined indicated and inferred resources of the two deposits adds up to nearly 4.8 billion tons (4.4 billion metric tons) — over 1.1 billion tons (1 billion metric tons) from NorthMet and over 3.6 billion tons (3.3 billion metric tons) from Mesaba, the companies said.While the NorthMet deposit is in a watershed that eventually flows into Lake Superior, the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy has pointed out that the Mesaba ore body sits mostly in the Boundary Waters watershed, like Twin Metals. But unlike Twin Metals, the Mesaba mineral rights leases are from the state, not the federal government.Also in the early stages is the proposed Talon Metals mine near Tamarack, which has a deal to supply nickel to electric-carmaker Tesla Inc. It's about 90 miles (145 kilometers) to the southwest, in the Mississippi River watershed. Talon plans to submit its application to kick off the review process in the next few weeks.Both St. Paul-based PolyMet Mining Corp. and Vancouver, British Columbia-based Teck Resources Ltd. will remain publicly traded companies listed on both the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges. PolyMet's majority shareholder is Swiss commodities giant Glencore, which owns 71% of its common stock plus rights to acquire 78%, and has pledged continued financial support for the project. Teck's largest shareholder is the China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund of the Beijing government, with a 10% stake.Tannice McCoy, who had been Teck's Mesaba project manager since 2018, will be general manager of NewRange, responsible for day-to-day operations. Cherry will remain chairman, president and CEO of PolyMet and will chair the management committee of the joint venture.",2023/2/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811478,At least 39 migrants dead in bus crash in Panama,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — At least 39 migrants were killed and about 20 were injured early Wednesday when the bus they were riding in western Panama tumbled off a cliff, authorities said.

            Officials did not immediately report nationalities, but the migrants had crossed the treacherous Darien Gap from Colombia. 

            The Panamanian government typically moves migrants who have crossed the Darien to a camp near the Costa Rica border on the other side of Panama. The migrants pay for the bus tickets, but the buses are only for migrants. There are usually two drivers, as well as personnel from the National Immigration Service.











            Samira Gozaine, director of Panama’s National Immigration Service, said it appeared the bus driver had passed the entrance to a shelter in Gualaca and when he tried to turn around to get back on the highway, the bus collided with another bus and went off the cliff.

            Images from the scene showed a broken guardrail on a curve in a forested area just a couple hundred yards beyond the shelter. The bus was carrying 66 migrants to the Los Planes shelter. 

            Ambulances carried the injured to the nearest hospital in David.

            “This news is regrettable for Panama and for the region,” President Laurentino Cortizo said via Twitter.

            It was the worst accident involving migrants in Panama in at least a decade. The flow of migrants through Panama surged in recent years as more risked the dangerous crossing as they tried to make their way north to the United States. 

            Last year, nearly 250,000 migrants crossed the Darien jungle – the majority Venezuelans – a record number that nearly doubled the total from the previous year. In January, more than 24,000 migrants crossed Darien, mostly Haitians and Ecuadoreans, according to Panamanian authorities.PANAMA CITY (AP) — At least 39 migrants were killed and about 20 were injured early Wednesday when the bus they were riding in western Panama tumbled off a cliff, authorities said.Officials did not immediately report nationalities, but the migrants had crossed the treacherous Darien Gap from Colombia.The Panamanian government typically moves migrants who have crossed the Darien to a camp near the Costa Rica border on the other side of Panama.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811479,"At 25, Backyard Bird Count shows power of citizen science","It’s a given that when the Great Backyard Bird Count begins Friday, Steve and Janet Kistler of Hart County, Kentucky, will be joining in. They’ve done so every year since the now-global tradition began 25 years ago.

            For Moira Dalibor, a middle-school math teacher a couple hours away in Lexington, this will be the first count. She’s leading a group of students and parents to an arboretum for an exercise in data-gathering.

            They’re expected to be among hundreds of thousands of people around the world counting and recording over four days, Feb. 17-20. Last year, about 385,000 people from 192 countries took part in the Great Backyard Bird Count, or GBBC.











            “Every year we see increased participation,” and 2022 was a big jump, says Becca Rodomsky-Bish, the project's leader at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, in Ithaca, New York, which organizes the count along with the National Audubon Society and Birds Canada.

            In India, which had the highest participation outside the U.S. last year, tens of thousands of people submitted bird checklists — a 28% increase from 2021.

            This global data goes into the eBird database used by scientists for research on bird populations, which have declined sharply overall in past decades. It’s part of a rise in citizen science projects in which volunteers collect data about the natural world for use by researchers.

            And if it gets more people interested in bird-watching, so much the better, says Steve Kistler.

            “It’s fun and important to get the numbers, but it’s just a joyful thing to do,” says Kistler, 71, who leads bird-watching trips near his home and abroad.

            Many bird-watchers use eBird year-round, and it has collected huge amounts of data — often between 1 million and 2 million bird checklists a month from around the world in the past couple of years, says Rodomsky-Bish.

            Those numbers help researchers track the ups and downs of various species, which then helps determine the direction of conservation efforts.

            “The net number of birds around the world — we’re losing them,” says Rodomsky-Bish.

            A 2019 study by Cornell researchers found there were 3 billion fewer birds in North America than in 1970.

            “The bad news is that the declines are coming out strong and hard in the data,” Rodomsky-Bish adds. “The good news is if we didn’t have that data, we wouldn’t know. And that helps a lot of areas take direct action.”

            The pandemic contributed to the surge in interest in the GBBC and birds in general, she says.

            “Birds were company during this period of isolation,” she says, and observing them “is an accessible way to connect with the natural world. Birds are everywhere. You don’t have to leave your house. They will come. … And they’re charismatic. They’re fun and fascinating to watch.”

            Compared to other counts — including Audubon’s 123-year-old Christmas Bird Count and the Cornell Lab’s Project FeederWatch — the GBBC is accessible to beginners. 

            How it works: Participants watch birds, whether that means looking out the window for 15 minutes or taking a longer trip to a nature area. Organizers recommend the Merlin bird ID app to distinguish birds by size, shape, song or other characteristics. Many participants also carry field guides and binoculars along with their phones.

            They then enter the findings into the eBird app.

            “Anyone can say, ‘I can contribute to science — it’s easy. I can identify one bird over a four-day period and I’ve done my part,’” says Rodomsky-Bish.

            Counting in February, she says, provides a snapshot right before many birds start their annual migrations.

            Dalibor, who teaches at the Redwood Cooperative School in Kentucky, has been preparing her classes with information about local species and practicing with the Merlin app. The kids will record bird sightings with pencils and clipboards, and parent volunteers will enter those numbers on phones.

            “It’ll be authentic data that we collected ourselves that real scientists are going to use. There’s purpose and action behind it, which is special for them, being connected to the wider world,” Dalibor says.

            Giving young children an appreciation of nature is the priority for Ganeshwar SV, director of the Salem Ornithological Foundation in India. He helps get schools involved in conservation programs, including the GBBC, and says the goal “is not to count but to just enjoy birds.”

            “In rural areas, it’s not unusual for children to wander around and use catapults (slingshots) and to kill birds,” he says. Now, “the hands that used catapults to hit birds are the same hands that are building nest boxes and taking notes about birds and their behavior.""

            The students don’t have smartphones, he says, and “wouldn’t have seen a binocular in real life.” They write up their sightings in notebooks.

            Steve Kistler, in rural Kentucky, advises beginners to “start easy, birding around home. Or join a group going out that day.”

            Don’t worry about exact counts, he says: “If 50 grackles fly by in a flock, you get pretty good at estimating. For the purposes of what you’re doing, we don’t have to have it down to the last grackle.”

            Bird counts can get competitive, too. 

            “If you can beat last year’s number of species, well that’s a good day,” Kistler says.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811480,One of 12 boys rescued from Thai cave dies at British school,"BANGKOK (AP) — One of the 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in Thailand in 2018 after being trapped for more than two weeks has died in England, where he was attending a sports academy, the foundation sponsoring his studies said Wednesday.

            Duangphet “Dom” Phromthep, 17, was found unconscious Sunday in his room at the Brooke House College Football Academy in Leicestershire and was taken to a hospital where he died Tuesday, Thailand’s Zico Foundation said. The school also confirmed his death.

            “This event has left our college community deeply saddened and shaken,"" school principal Ian Smith said in a statement. ""We unite in grief with all of Dom’s family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college’s global family.”











            Former Thai national team captain and coach Kiatisuk Senamuang, who heads the Zico Foundation, said in an online news conference that he did not know the cause of death and that Dom had apparently been in good health.

            Dom was the captain of the Wild Boars, a youth soccer team in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai. Twelve members of the team, ages 11 to 16, and their coach were exploring the Tham Luang cave complex in June 2018 when they were trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters. A massive search and rescue operation involving international divers was launched.

            The boys spent nine nights lost in the cave, living on very little food and water, before a diver spotted them deep in the twisting cave complex huddled on a patch of dirt above the rising water line. The moment was captured on video and soon broadcast to the world.

            It was another eight days before all were safely rescued. A team of expert divers guided each of the boys out of the cave on special stretchers after anesthetizing them to keep them calm enough to transport. The operation required placing oxygen canisters along the path where the divers maneuvered through dark, tight and twisting passageways filled with muddy water and strong currents.

            Dom’s mother, who joined the online news conference, said she hoped a Buddhist monk in England could conduct rites for Dom so his spirit would not be trapped where he died according to Buddhist beliefs.

            The story of the Wild Boars, which was covered intensely by international media, has been retold in several movies, including Ron Howard’s 2022 feature film “Thirteen Lives"" and the 2021 documentary “The Rescue.”BANGKOK (AP) — One of the 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in Thailand in 2018 after being trapped for more than two weeks has died in England, where he was attending a sports academy, the foundation sponsoring his studies said Wednesday.Duangphet “Dom” Phromthep, 17, was found unconscious Sunday in his room at the Brooke House College Football Academy in Leicestershire and was taken to a hospital where he died Tuesday, Thailand’s Zico Foundation said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811481,Rwanda says Congolese soldiers attack its border army post,"KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwanda’s army said its troops briefly exchanged fire with soldiers from Congo early Wednesday, in a new spike in tension between the neighbors who have accused each other of supporting armed rebel groups on the other side of the border. Congo denied that account.

            A statement said that twelve to fourteen Congolese soldiers entered the no man’s land near the western district of Rusizi and opened fire at a Rwandan border post, in “an act of provocation.” 

            “Our security forces responded and (the Congolese) soldiers withdrew,” the Rwandan statement said. “There were no casualties on the Rwanda side and the situation is calm.”











            Congo’s government said there were clashes between its military and a group of “bandits” near the border in Bukavu, but denied entering the neutral zone. 

            “In no case did the (army) cross the neutral zone, let alone open fire in the direction of Rwanda,” Theo Ngwabidje Kasi, governor of South Kivu province, said in a statement.

            Congo for months has accused Rwanda of supporting an armed rebel group called M23, that’s fighting in eastern Congo.

            The conflict in eastern Congo has gone on for decades, with more than 100 armed groups fighting for control of valuable mineral resources while others protect their communities, and has triggered an exodus of refugees.

            Rwanda in turn accuses Congo of supporting the FDLR, a Rwandan armed rebel group based in Congo that has carried out raids into Rwanda in the past. The FDLR has been accused of participation in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which ethnic Hutus killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus who tried to protect them.

            United Nations experts in December said they had “substantial evidence” of Rwandan government forces crossing into Congo to reinforce M23 rebels or to conduct operations against the FDLR. The United States, France and Germany have urged Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels. 

            The Rwandan government has denied supporting M23 and says the accusations are part of a “tired old blame game” undermining efforts for peace, “to which Rwanda is fully committed.”

            Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame has said Congolese authorities should solve their own problems. In January he said that the crisis in Congo “is not Rwanda’s problem, and we are going to make sure that everybody realizes it is not Rwanda’s problem.”

            Last month, Rwanda said it fired on Congo military aircraft it accused of violating its airspace and urged Congo to stop the ""aggression.”

            But Congo’s government said the incident occurred in Congolese airspace near the city of Goma’s international airport. It said the plane landed without major damage.

            Congo had described the attack on its aircraft as “a deliberate act of aggression that equals an act of war” with the goal of sabotaging regional peace efforts.

            Regional leaders called for a cease-fire in eastern Congo and ordered a withdrawal of rebels from major towns under M23 control — which hasn’t happened.KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwanda’s army said its troops briefly exchanged fire with soldiers from Congo early Wednesday, in a new spike in tension between the neighbors who have accused each other of supporting armed rebel groups on the other side of the border.

It said the plane landed without major damage.Congo had described the attack on its aircraft as “a deliberate act of aggression that equals an act of war” with the goal of sabotaging regional peace efforts.Regional leaders called for a cease-fire in eastern Congo and ordered a withdrawal of rebels from major towns under M23 control — which hasn’t happened.",2023/2/15,,World

            Viking Children's Books announced Wednesday that “Something, Someday,” by Gorman and Christian Robinson, is scheduled for Sept. 26. Viking is calling the book “a message of hope” about the ability to make a difference in a troubled world. 

            “I wrote ‘Something, Someday’ to show that though it might be difficult, when we work together, even the smallest acts of kindness can lead to the largest positive change,” the 24-year-old Gorman said in s statement. Gorman became an international sensation after reading her poem “The Hill We Climb” at President Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021.











            “I’ve long admired Christian’s art and having the opportunity to collaborate with him has been a dream come true. I hope that readers find joy and inspiration in ‘Something, Someday' and I can’t wait for it to be out in the world.”

            Robinson has illustrated books ranging from “Last Stop on Market Street,” written by Matt de la Peña, to “The Bench” by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. 

            “Amanda Gorman’s words offer us a much-needed balm, with healing properties of honesty, hope and community care,” Robinson said in a statement. “This book was an honor to illustrate and it’s my hope that it encourages young readers to be the change they want to see in the world.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811493,"Gear, goods to celebrate birds and a big global count","If you're planning to take part in the four-day, global Great Backyard Bird Count this month (Feb. 17-20), or if you just love birds, there's plenty of gear and goods to help you enjoy them.

            RECOGNIZING AND RECORDING

            Merlin and eBird are the apps recommended by the count's organizers to help you identify birds, get acquainted with local species and enter your findings in a database. Others birding apps include iNaturalist, Song Sleuth and others more specific to regions or species, such as Raptor ID.











            You’ll want a field guide, too. Chad Witko, senior coordinator of avian biology for Audubon’s Migratory Bird Initiative, lists some for U.S. bird watching: “There’s the National Audubon Society `Birds of North America,' `The Sibley Guide to Birds,' the Peterson Field Guide series, and renowned naturalist and birder Kenn Kaufman’s books.” 

            Witko recommends getting guides with paintings as well as photos so you can see more angles and variations of a species.

            Note and sketch your own observations in a pocket-size waterproof notebook, such as those from Rite in the Rain and Field Notes.

            Periodicals like Birds & Blooms and Bird Watcher’s Digest (BWD) offer birding basics.

            Witko also recommends finding a birding mentor. Social media sites often have bird-watching groups where more seasoned birders share their knowledge and promote outings.

            “So many tips, tricks, ID advice and more are passed down through generations of birders,” he says.

            BIRD SPOTTING

            Witko recommends binoculars with a magnification of 8x for beginning birders. That means you’ll see an object 800 meters away as if it were 100 meters away. “They’re the most versatile,” he says.

            Aleta Burchyski, an outdoors writer and birder in Santa Fe, New Mexico, says it’s easy to spend $500 or more on field binoculars, but for casual birdwatching she has a pair of rugged Nocs, which go for $95, and are waterproof and fog-proof. They weigh significantly less than many higher-end binoculars, and the 8x magnification is enough to see feather and beak details.

            Witko also suggests getting a longer strap than the one that comes standard with most binoculars.

            “Buy one that can be extended to wear over the shoulder like a sling, or purchase a harness to keep the weight off your neck,” he says.

            Harnesses can also help steady your focus. You’ll find options from outdoor brands like Nyack Exchange, Trummul and outdoors retailers.

            Nocs makes a photo ring adaptor that attaches to binoculars and aligns your phone lens to them for photos and videos.

            And digiscoping is a trend. You use a spotting scope to line up with your smartphone or camera to zero in and capture images more accurately than if you had just pointed your regular lens at the subject.

            FEEDERS

            Watching birds from your window can yield great results, and different bird feeders are designed to attract different birds.

            “Tube feeders filled with sunflower seeds are great for most backyard birds, as are hopper or tray feeders,"" says Witko. ""Black oil sunflower seeds are hands-down the best and will attract the most species — chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, jays, doves, sparrows, grosbeaks and finches.

            “I also recommend thistle feeders to attract finches like goldfinches, siskins and redpolls. And suet feeders for woodpeckers, nuthatches and wrens.”

            If your feeder is on a deck or porch, consider “no mess” seed mixes that have no shells.

            Bird Buddy’s AI-equipped feeder alerts you when winged visitors come calling. If you aren't able to take the photo yourself, it will do that, and also identify the birds and organize the photos into a collection. A solar panel is available to power the gadget. Mount the feeder on a wall or post, and you can add suet balls or water dispensers too.

            Squirrel-proof feeders hang on a branch or mount on a pole. Dunford's has a metal skirt that drops when a squirrel tries to climb aboard, closing off the seed portals. 

            “Always keep feeders far enough from the house so that birds aren’t likely to fly into windows,” says Witko. Also, place feeders in an area that allows birds to hide if they need to, and that lets them see any approaching predators like cats and hawks.

            Cleaning feeders is also critically important, he says.

            BIRDHOUSES

            There are all kinds of birdhouses made of weather-resistant materials and painted in all kinds of designs. If you want to make your own, Duncraft and BestNest are among those with DIY kits, for wrens, bluebirds and purple martins.

            ORNITHOLOGICAL HOME DECOR

            Just want to show your love of our avian friends indoors too?

            From Charley Harper, the artist who was known for modern, graphic illustrations of birds, comes a set of decals that let you create your own migratory flock on a wall. Glassware features cardinals and other wild birds, and there are coasters, doormats and wall art, all at the Charley Harper Art Studio.

            A more low-key flock can be found at West Elm. Mej Mej has a wall decal set showing a dozen watercolored birds; another includes a pair of bluebirds.

            A set of three carved bronze birds perched on wooden columns are at Pottery Barn for a contemporary display on a side table or bookshelf. The retailer also has an organic percale duvet set patterned with colorful birds.

            And side tables at Society 6 have tops featuring depictions of birds from all corners of the skies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811494,"Biden's empathy shapes policy, but some voters don't feel it","WASHINGTON (AP) — Sitting aboard Air Force One last year, President Joe Biden was scanning the newspaper and spotted a ghostly photo of a child’s swing set engulfed in raw sewage.

            He didn't just sigh or shake his head. Upon landing back in Washington, he ordered longtime aide Steve Ricchetti to phone the White House infrastructure coordinator.

            By August, Lowndes County, Alabama, had a $10 million grant to fix the problem with money from the 2021 infrastructure law. And administration officials told the community the money came at the president’s insistence. 











            But here’s the rub for Biden: A majority of voters in Alabama and across the U.S. don't believe he cares about people like them. Nor do they trust his ability to manage a sprawling federal government that often moves at a sluggish pace. 

            This perception has made it harder for Biden to sell his plans for the economy and make his case to voters around the country that he deserves a second term in an all-but-declared reelection campaign.

            “If you go and you walk in some of these folks’ yards, the kids are running outside and they’re running in sewage,” says Mitch Landrieu, the White House infrastructure coordinator. “These are the people that the president wants to touch.”

            For all of that, however, 53% of voters in the midterm elections said Biden didn’t care about people like them, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate. That belief about Biden — a president known to commiserate with grieving families and offer to phone children who want puppies — is a reflection of how people judge leaders through a rigidly partisan lens. About 9 in 10 Republicans say Biden is indifferent to them; roughly that many Democrats see him as empathetic.

            “To Republicans, Biden has no redeeming traits,” said Stanford University professor Shanto Iyengar. “Not only are evaluations of incumbents completely polarized, cues like personal traits matter less.”

            The broader public is also skeptical that Biden, at 80 years old, can oversee the $6 trillion enterprise that is the federal government. A January poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a mere 23% of U.S. adults have “a great deal” of confidence in Biden to effectively manage the White House, down from 44% when he took office.

            The president told PBS in a interview last week that he thinks polling is irrelevant. But for the next two years, he's telling staffers and donors, voters need to get a fuller sense of everything his administration has done, from $35 price caps on insulin for older people to more than 20,000 infrastructure projects in the pipeline.

            “It’s really important we let people know what we’ve done — let people know,” Biden recently told donors. They were gathered for a fundraiser in the living room of a posh New York City apartment, but his remarks focused more on the needs of blue collar workers.

            Many voters want leaders who echo their frustration rather than provide policy fixes, said Shawn Parry-Giles, a professor of political communications at the University of Maryland. She noted that Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, won the presidency by expressing the rage that many felt.

            “Candidates like Trump seemingly gain traction because they speak to such anger that makes people feel like he understands them,” she said. “Biden doesn’t tap into that anger, but he does try to make inroads through empathy.”

            Trump also had the ability to take credit for any successes, claiming strong economic growth when the data suggested it had changed little from Barack Obama’s second term. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said Biden has not been “as adept at credit-taking” as was Trump.

            “If his policies are benefiting the skeptical public, he ought to be able to show them proof of it and in the process increase their perception that he cares about them,” she said.

            Plenty of presidents have aimed to show empathy for everyday Americans: Obama stressed the 10 letters he read every day from people around the country. George W. Bush offered himself as a “compassionate conservative.” Bill Clinton famously declared during the 1992 presidential campaign, “I feel your pain.” 

            Biden tries to put himself in the scuffed shoes of a worker and asks Ivy League educated aides to do the same. He repeatedly tells them that real people must be able to easily apply for the government resources being created for them.

            When Gene Sperling took on the role of overseeing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief programs in 2021, the president gave him direct instructions.

            “When you are guiding implementation of these programs, I want you every time to imagine a couple of parents coming home from a 10 hour shift, trying to make dinner and help a child with homework,” Sperling said Biden told him.

            That meant helping in personal ways as well as with broad steps. Sperling worked with Treasury and the IRS to ensure that the child tax credit's monthly payments arrived on the same day each month. He told the team it was something of a victory if someone complained on Facebook or Twitter that their payment was late, since it meant people knew about the program and valued it.

            Those now-lapsed payments pulled child poverty to its lowest level on record. And when some in Congress suggested the benefits should only be targeted to the poor, the president pushed back. In an Oval Office meeting, he told aides it also mattered for middle-class parents to have a sense of dignity, that they should be able to afford a prom dress or a Little League uniform for their kids.

            Biden referenced the frustrations of his own father at tax time. Parents got an income-tax deduction for their children then. But if the parents’ income fell because of a layoff, the value of the deduction also fell.

            The president remembered his father asking how it could be fair to give parents less when they were enduring a rough year and needed more help.

            Aides tell stories of a president who has made snap decisions based on what he felt people needed, stressing that the government must act with ordinary Americans in mind and make it easier to receive benefits.

            After Hurricane Ian struck Florida last year, Biden flew down to survey the damage. Homeowners were crowding “insurance villages” to apply for damages, something that Biden learned about during his flight. He ordered the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to send teams to expedite relief.

            Julie Rodriguez, White House director of intergovernmental affairs, said the mandate from Biden was to deliver services and not “allow the guts of government to get in the way.”

            In last week's State of the Union address, Biden said the coronavirus emergency is ending, that “we have broken the COVID grip on us.”

            But the pandemic still matters for the president. Each day, he continues to tuck a card into his suit jacket that lists the deaths and infections from COVID-19, according to aides. He references the numbers in meetings, knowing they represent people and families.

            Even with abysmal approval ratings, the best strategy for Biden might be to simply keep doing what he's doing, giving speeches about what he's achieved, with lines that reporters might have heard before but that seem fresh to local audiences, said William Howell, a professor at the University of Chicago.

            ""The thing to do is what Biden is doing right now,"" Howell said. “It’s really about repetition, not just him saying it over and over again, but his surrogates saying it, and have these messages break through.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Sitting aboard Air Force One last year, President Joe Biden was scanning the newspaper and spotted a ghostly photo of a child’s swing set engulfed in raw sewage.He didn't just sigh or shake his head.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811495,FAA head defends safety of US air travel after close calls,"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday the agency has taken steps to avoid a repeat of the technology failure last month that briefly halted all flights nationwide, but he said he couldn't promise there won't be another breakdown.

            Separately, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen defended the safety of airline travel in the United States after recent incidents at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, in Austin, Texas, and off the coast of Hawaii. Still, Nolen said, he is putting together a team of experts to review airline safety.

            “We are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we do not take that for granted,” Nolen said during testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee. “Recent events remind us that we cannot become complacent.”











            The committee's hearing was billed as an examination of the failure of an FAA system that provides safety alerts to pilots, but lawmakers were most animated when they quizzed Nolen on the recent flight scares.

            Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, showed a video re-enactment of the Feb. 4 Austin incident in which a FedEx cargo plane flew over the top of a departing Southwest Airlines flight. Both planes had been cleared to use the same runway. The FedEx pilots aborted their landing just in time to avoid a collision.

            “How can this happen?” Cruz asked. “How did air traffic control direct one plane on to the runway to take off and another plane to land, and have them both within 100 feet of each other?”

            Nolen said the incident is still under investigation by his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board, but he suggested that the fact the planes did not collide should be reassuring. 

            “It is not what we would expect to have happened, but when we think about how we train both our controllers and our pilots, the system works as it is designed to avert what you say could have been a horrific outcome,” Nolen said.

            Nolen pointed out that the U.S. has not had a fatal crash involving an airline plane since 2009. Still, he said, he is forming an expert panel to review the aviation system and hold a safety summit next month to determine what steps are needed to maintain the record of recent years. 

            The breakdown of the FAA system of distributing alerts called NOTAMs to pilots began late on Jan. 10 when contractors accidentally deleted files, corrupting the main database and a backup, he said. Attempts to fix the problem by the next morning failed, and FAA barred all planes from taking off for nearly two hours on Jan. 11, leading to 1,300 canceled flights and 11,000 delays. 

            Nolen said there is now a delay in synchronizing the databases to avoid both the main and backup going down at the same time. But he can't rule out a repeat.

            ""Could I sit here today and tell you there will never be another issue on the NOTAM system? No, sir, I cannot,” Nolen said under questioning by Cruz.

            Committee chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., pressed Nolen to build more redundancy into the system to avoid another meltdown.

            Part of the NOTAM system is 30 years old, although most airline flights use a newer system, Nolen said. But during the failure, all flights were stopped. 

            Nolen, a pilot and the former top safety official at FAA, has been acting administrator since the agency's last Senate-confirmed leader stepped down in March 2022, midway through his five-year term. The nomination of President Joe Biden's choice for the job, Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington, has stalled amid questions over his thin aviation experience and involvement in a corruption investigation.The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday the agency has taken steps to avoid a repeat of the technology failure last month that briefly halted all flights nationwide, but he said he couldn't promise there won't be another breakdown.Separately, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen defended the safety of airline travel in the United States after recent incidents at John F.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811496,"Arizona interstate reopens after deadly crash, leak","TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The main freeway in southern Arizona reopened in both directions Wednesday evening and officials said people living southeast of downtown Tucson could return home a day after a deadly crash sent acrid plumes into the desert sky and prompted evacuations.

            “The public may resume normal activities,” Arizona's Department of Public Safety said in statement Wednesday night.

            Less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of Interstate 10 had been closed in both directions for more than a full day after a truck tractor pulling a box trailer crashed Tuesday afternoon.











            Residents within a half-mile (800 meters) of the crash initially were told to leave, and those within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) were told to shelter in place after liquid nitric acid was determined to be leaking from the wreck.

            The shelter in place order was extended for a time to 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) but was lifted altogether by Wednesday night. Before that, area residents were told to turn off heaters and air conditioning systems that bring in outside air.

            The acid sent up eerie yellow and red plumes over a section of the asphalt roadway that runs through dry land scattered with scrub brush. The interstate stretches across the entirety of southern Arizona in its nearly 2,500 mile (4,023 kilometer) coast-to-coast sweep from Santa Monica, California, to Jacksonville, Florida.

            Officials have been dealing with Arizona's hazardous crash as Ohio residents continue to raise concerns about the release of toxic chemicals on board a freight train that derailed Feb. 3 and left 50 cars in a fiery, mangled mess. There were no injuries but officials later ordered the evacuation of the immediate area. Residents in that state worried about the potential health impacts from the wreckage.

            Winter weather temporarily impeded hazardous material recovery and mitigation efforts overnight, but by Wednesday morning, officials said the material had been removed from the truck and crews were using dirt to keep more nitric acid from being released.

            The driver of the truck was killed, the department said, but few other details about the accident were released.

            The University of Arizona Tech Park was among the areas evacuated. Some schoolchildren in Rita Ranch were among those who sheltered in place, the Arizona Daily Star reported. Officials canceled classes at several nearby schools Wednesday.

            A high school that was ordered closed, a mobile home park for older adults and an RV resort are located less than a mile from the accident site. Calls left for managers at the Trails West Active Adult Community and Voyager RV Resort & Hotel seeking information about whether people had been affected were not immediately returned Wednesday.

            Nitric acid is used to make ammonium nitrate for fertilizers and in the manufacture of plastics and dyes.

            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website says nitric acid is a highly corrosive, colorless liquid with yellow or red fumes and can cause an acrid smell.

            It says exposure to nitric acid can irritate the eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Depending on how long someone is exposed to the material, and how much, it also can cause delayed pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, bronchitis and dental erosion.

            Pima County's health department and poison control center on Wednesday recommended that anyone who may have been in contact with the gas for more than 15 minutes get a medical evaluation if they develop respiratory difficulties like wheezing or shortness of breath. They said symptoms could be delayed up to 24 hours after exposure.

            Health officials said it is possible that some people living within a mile of the accident may have been exposed to the material for more than 15 minutes if the building where they were sheltering in place was using an air conditioner or heater pulling in air from the outside.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811497,Skinny robot documents forces eroding Doomsday Glacier,"Scientists got their first up-close look at what’s eating away part of Antarctica’s Thwaites ice shelf, nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier because of its massive melt and sea rise potential, and it’s both good and bad news.

            Using a 13-foot pencil-shaped robot that swam under the grounding line where ice first juts over the sea, scientists saw a shimmery critical point in Thwaites' chaotic breakup, “where it’s melting so quickly there, there’s just material streaming out of the glacier,” said robot creator and polar scientist Britney Schmidt of Cornell University. 

            Before, scientists had no observations from this critical but hard-to-reach point on Thwaites. But with the robot named Icefin lowered down a slender 1,925-foot (587-meter) hole, they saw how important crevasses are in the fracturing of the ice, which takes the heaviest toll on the glacier, even more than melting. “That’s how the glacier is falling apart. It’s not thinning and going away. It shatters,” said Schmidt, lead author of one of two studies in Wednesday’s journal Nature. 











            That fracturing “potentially accelerates the overall demise of that ice shelf,” said Paul Cutler, the Thwaites program director for the National Science Foundation who returned from the ice last week. “It’s eventual mode of failure may be through falling apart.”

            The work comes out of a massive $50 million multi-year international research effort to better understand the widest glacier in the world. The Florida-sized glacier has gotten the nickname the “Doomsday Glacier"" because of how much ice it has and how much seas could rise if it all melts — more than 2 feet (65 centimeters), though that's expected take hundreds of years. 

            The melting of Thwaites is dominated by what’s happening underneath, where warmer water nibbles at the bottom, something called basal melting, said Peter Davis, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey who is a lead author of one of the studies.

            “Thwaites is a rapidly changing system, much more rapidly changing than when we started this work five years ago and even since we were in the field three years ago,” said Oregon State University ice researcher Erin Pettit, who wasn't part of either study. “I am definitely expecting the rapid change to continue and accelerate over the next few years.”

            Pennsylvania State University glaciologist Richard Alley, who also wasn’t part of the studies, said the new work ""gives us an important look at processes affecting the crevasses that might eventually break and cause loss of much of the ice shelf.”

            The good news: Much of the flat underwater area they explored is melting much slower than they expected. The bad news: That doesn't really change how much ice is coming off the land part of the glacier and driving up sea levels, Davis said.

            Davis said the melting isn’t nearly the problem at Thwaites that glacier retreat is. The more the glacier breaks up or retreats, the more ice floats in water. When ice is on ground as part of the glacier it isn't part of sea rise, but when it breaks off land and then goes onto water it adds to the overall water level by displacement, just as ice added to a glass of water raises water level.

            And more bad news: This is from the eastern, larger and more stable part of Thwaites. Researchers couldn’t safely land a plane and drill a hole in the ice in the main trunk, which is breaking up much faster. And they also found staircase-like steps, those crevasses, in parts of the more stable eastern side where the break-up is far faster and worse.

            The key to seeing exactly how bad conditions are on the glacier would require going to the main trunk and looking at the melting from below. But that would require a helicopter to land on the ice instead of a heavier airplane and would be incredibly difficult, said studies co-author Eric Rignot of the University of California Irvine.

            The main trunk’s glacier surface “is so messed up by crevasses it looks like a set of sugar cubes almost. There’s no place to land a plane,” NSF’s Cutler said.

            Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who wasn’t part of the studies, said the results add to understanding how Thwaites is diminishing. 

            “Unfortunately, this is still going to be a major issue a century from now,” Scambos said in an email. “But our better understanding gives us some time to take action to slow the pace of sea level rise.”

            When the skinny robot wended its way through the hole in the ice – made by a jet of hot water – the cameras showed not just the melting water, the crucial crevasses and seabed. It showed critters, especially sea anemones, swimming under the ice. 

            “To accidentally find them here in this environment was really, really cool,” Schmidt said in an interview. “We were so tired that you kind of wonder like, ‘am I really seeing what I’m seeing?’ You know because there are these little creepy alien guys (the anemones) hanging out on the ice-ocean interface. 

            “In the background is like all these sparkling stars that are like rocks and sediment and things that were picked up from the glacier,” Schmidt said. “And then the anemones. It’s really kind of a wild experience.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811498,Rio's first all-female samba school prepares defiant parade,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — As Carnival approaches in Rio de Janeiro, members of a samba school perfect a minutely-tuned performance with dancers twirling in blue, red and white skirts and 40 drummers pounding the rhythm with gusto. 

            There isn’t a single man in sight. This samba school, in Rio's Madureira neighborhood, is the city's first to be run by and for women. 

            The community-tied music and dance clubs have always included women, most commonly as seamstresses and dancers. They’ve played the schools’ smaller instruments and Carnival queens lead processions in elaborate, sequined outfits. But rarely do women call the shots on finances, themes or even costumes. 











            “The big samba schools are coordinated by men, which means women are used to receiving orders,” Barbara Rigaud, a 54-year-old cultural producer and hairdresser who is the head of the new Turma da Paz de Madureira samba school, or Group of Peace from Madureira, known by the initials TPM.

            During a recent rehearsal, the musicians played under a huge red and orange marquee, offering some protection from the sweltering sun, while older women and a young girl sat in chairs lined against the wall. 

            “Here, a woman can express her desires, her ideas, her opinions, which increases self-esteem,” said Rigaud, a Black woman who wears beaded earrings and a wide smile. “It is empowering.”

            TPM started in 2011 as a bloco, the name for musical groups that flood streets with parties during the Carnival season. Rigaud decided she wanted to take the women-only group further and compete in the city's samba leagues. She successfully sought approval from city councilors and the school was inaugurated last September. 

            The school has 320 members, and rehearses in the the lower middle-class neighborhood of Madureira in Rio’s north zone, along with some of the city's most prestigious samba schools, including Portela and Império Serrano.

            Among the group's dozens of drummers is Gisele Rosires, 47. She is proud of her big, bulky surdo drum, but the blowback is strong. 

            “Men look me up and down, they think I’m not capable,” she said. A year and a half ago, she was playing in Madureira’s park for her first show with the school, when a man took the instrument from her. “He said, ‘You’re a woman, get out’”, said Rosires, who, not wanting to make a fuss, ended up leaving, annoyed.

            Challenges start at the very mention of TPM’s name; the acronym is the same in Portuguese for pre-menstrual syndrome, or PMS. While Carnival’s street bands often employ clever puns, this was an unintended coincidence that often elicits laughter and mockery from men. Some call them the Turma de Putas de Madueira, or Group of Whores from Madureira.

            Patriarchy in Brazil remains persistent. Women are the majority of Brazil's electorate, yet in October congressional elections claimed only 18% of the Lower House seats. There's an even smaller proportion of female senators. In business, women hold leadership positions in 38% of 250 mid-market companies surveyed by consultant Grant Thornton. That percentage has climbed from 15% in 2015, but remains short of parity.

            Meanwhile, sexual harassment and assault remain widespread in Carnival’s street parties. Over the last decade, however, women have increasingly been standing up for their rights and spreading the message “No means No!” on stickers and pamphlets.

            When women are in the spotlight for Carnival, they are often sexualized — particularly Black women. During its coverage of Carnival each year, behemoth TV network Globo airs vignettes with the so-called Globeleza, meaning “Globo beauty,” played by a Black actress whose role is to promote the spectacle by dancing suggestively while virtually nude. 

            “Being part of this school is a way of saying we are together. I think women need this, Black women in particular,” Margaret Oliveira, a 55-year-old Black housewife who is part of TPM’s group of dancers, said at the rehearsal. 

            Making time for oneself in a society that values and expects self-sacrifice from women is an act of resistance, Oliveira added. 

            With rare exception, women who contributed to samba over time are omitted from its history, said Maira de Deus Brito, who researches samba and the afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé at the University of Brasilia.

            For their first parade, on Feb. 19, TPM will honor Iansã, a female deity and warrior of Candomblé. Carnival is just a few days off, but costumes remain incomplete due to a lack of funds. Their vision also will fall somewhat short given the procession is required by parade protocol to include two men as masters of ceremony. 

            “It has to be a man for now, until it changes, until this machismo ends,” Rigaud said. 

            As in any power dispute, the school is going to face problems and opposition, said Paula Dürks Cassol, who wrote a paper about women’s rights and samba in Rio de Janeiro published in the Journal of International Women’s Studies last year. 

            “Every time women try to create new methods of resistance, emancipation and empowerment, there are going to be barriers,” Dürks Cassol said. “But I am sure that thanks to their union and strength, they will overcome.”

            At dusk on the day of TPM's recent rehearsal, the group spilled out from the courtyard, with the sound of their drums reverberating up and down the narrow street leading off Madureira Park.

            This year, the school will make its debut in Rio's lowest-tier samba league. If the women perform well enough, they can climb the ranks for next year's parade. Already, Rigaud has her sights on reaching the Sambodrome, where only the top schools compete.

            ""We’re not here to play around,"" Rigaud said. ""We’re here to fight, to win.""RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — As Carnival approaches in Rio de Janeiro, members of a samba school perfect a minutely-tuned performance with dancers twirling in blue, red and white skirts and 40 drummers pounding the rhythm with gusto.There isn’t a single man in sight. This samba school, in Rio's Madureira neighborhood, is the city's first to be run by and for women.The community-tied music and dance clubs have always included women, most commonly as seamstresses and dancers. They’ve played the schools’ smaller instruments and Carnival queens lead processions in elaborate, sequined outfits. But rarely do women call the shots on finances, themes or even costumes.“The big samba schools are coordinated by men, which means women are used to receiving orders,” Barbara Rigaud, a 54-year-old cultural producer and hairdresser who is the head of the new Turma da Paz de Madureira samba school, or Group of Peace from Madureira, known by the initials TPM.During a recent rehearsal, the musicians played under a huge red and orange marquee, offering some protection from the sweltering sun, while older women and a young girl sat in chairs lined against the wall.“Here, a woman can express her desires, her ideas, her opinions, which increases self-esteem,” said Rigaud, a Black woman who wears beaded earrings and a wide smile. “It is empowering.”TPM started in 2011 as a bloco, the name for musical groups that flood streets with parties during the Carnival season. Rigaud decided she wanted to take the women-only group further and compete in the city's samba leagues. She successfully sought approval from city councilors and the school was inaugurated last September.The school has 320 members, and rehearses in the the lower middle-class neighborhood of Madureira in Rio’s north zone, along with some of the city's most prestigious samba schools, including Portela and Império Serrano.Among the group's dozens of drummers is Gisele Rosires, 47. She is proud of her big, bulky surdo drum, but the blowback is strong.“Men look me up and down, they think I’m not capable,” she said. A year and a half ago, she was playing in Madureira’s park for her first show with the school, when a man took the instrument from her. “He said, ‘You’re a woman, get out’”, said Rosires, who, not wanting to make a fuss, ended up leaving, annoyed.Challenges start at the very mention of TPM’s name; the acronym is the same in Portuguese for pre-menstrual syndrome, or PMS. While Carnival’s street bands often employ clever puns, this was an unintended coincidence that often elicits laughter and mockery from men. Some call them the Turma de Putas de Madueira, or Group of Whores from Madureira.Patriarchy in Brazil remains persistent. Women are the majority of Brazil's electorate, yet in October congressional elections claimed only 18% of the Lower House seats. There's an even smaller proportion of female senators. In business, women hold leadership positions in 38% of 250 mid-market companies surveyed by consultant Grant Thornton. That percentage has climbed from 15% in 2015, but remains short of parity.Meanwhile, sexual harassment and assault remain widespread in Carnival’s street parties. Over the last decade, however, women have increasingly been standing up for their rights and spreading the message “No means No!” on stickers and pamphlets.When women are in the spotlight for Carnival, they are often sexualized — particularly Black women. During its coverage of Carnival each year, behemoth TV network Globo airs vignettes with the so-called Globeleza, meaning “Globo beauty,” played by a Black actress whose role is to promote the spectacle by dancing suggestively while virtually nude.“Being part of this school is a way of saying we are together. I think women need this, Black women in particular,” Margaret Oliveira, a 55-year-old Black housewife who is part of TPM’s group of dancers, said at the rehearsal.Making time for oneself in a society that values and expects self-sacrifice from women is an act of resistance, Oliveira added.With rare exception, women who contributed to samba over time are omitted from its history, said Maira de Deus Brito, who researches samba and the afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé at the University of Brasilia.For their first parade, on Feb. 19, TPM will honor Iansã, a female deity and warrior of Candomblé. Carnival is just a few days off, but costumes remain incomplete due to a lack of funds. Their vision also will fall somewhat short given the procession is required by parade protocol to include two men as masters of ceremony.“It has to be a man for now, until it changes, until this machismo ends,” Rigaud said.As in any power dispute, the school is going to face problems and opposition, said Paula Dürks Cassol, who wrote a paper about women’s rights and samba in Rio de Janeiro published in the Journal of International Women’s Studies last year.“Every time women try to create new methods of resistance, emancipation and empowerment, there are going to be barriers,” Dürks Cassol said. “But I am sure that thanks to their union and strength, they will overcome.”At dusk on the day of TPM's recent rehearsal, the group spilled out from the courtyard, with the sound of their drums reverberating up and down the narrow street leading off Madureira Park.This year, the school will make its debut in Rio's lowest-tier samba league. If the women perform well enough, they can climb the ranks for next year's parade. Already, Rigaud has her sights on reaching the Sambodrome, where only the top schools compete.""We’re not here to play around,"" Rigaud said. ""We’re here to fight, to win.""",2023/2/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811499,China faces grilling in review of key rights by UN committee,"GENEVA (AP) — China came in for a grilling Wednesday over its human rights record as a two-day hearing opened at the United Nations human rights office, with rights advocates raising issues like relocations from Tibet, COVID-19, reprisals against human rights defenders and a security law that crushed dissidents in Hong Kong.

            With advocates of China's Uyghur minority protesting loudly outside, Chinese Ambassador Chen Xu and a delegation of about 40 envoys from China, Hong Kong and Macau faced questions from the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which reviews respect of those rights in nearly all U.N. member states every few years.

            The six-hour hearings mark the first time a Chinese delegation has traveled to answer to a U.N. body in Geneva since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, U.N. officials said.











            Ambassador Chen rattled off an array of accomplishments, including poverty alleviation, education, longer life spans in China as well as support for other countries in his opening remarks.

            “No one can claim a perfect record in human rights protection, as there is always room for improvement. China still faces multiple problems and challenges in promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights,"" including “glaringly unbalanced” development and “stumbling blocks” in some areas of reform, Chen said. He cited problems in areas like education, jobs, medical care, housing and environmental protection.

            The hearing was built around questions from submissions from nearly 20 nongovernmental groups, and conducted by independent experts working with the U.N. who make up the committee, which aims to help countries uphold their commitments under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

            Michael Windfuhr, deputy director of the German Institute for Human Rights and the committee's country rapporteur on China, laid out a number of questions on issues as diverse as discrimination, access to lawyers, and assurances that Chinese multinational firms wouldn't undermine human rights abroad. 

            “Dealing with China in six hours devoted to a state review is a challenge for the committee,” he said. “The committee will therefore prioritize the most pressing human rights issues under the covenant.”

            He asked how many organizations have been classified as having endangered national security under the hotly contested National Security Law in Hong Kong, and asked how China would improve transparency in the sharing of data about COVID-19 with the international community.

            But Hong Kong officials, speaking in English, insisted that the security law has specific provisions for respecting human rights, particularly in the context of some trade union activities, which they considered to have violated the law and had nothing to do with labor rights.

            “The Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region) government is dedicated to defend and protect the lawful rights and freedom of association in Hong Kong,” said Hoi-shan Cheung, assistant commissioner in Hong Kong’s Labor Department.

            Chinese delegates were expected to provide at least some answers as the hearing on China — one of six countries before the panel this month — concluded Thursday.GENEVA (AP) — China came in for a grilling Wednesday over its human rights record as a two-day hearing opened at the United Nations human rights office, with rights advocates raising issues like relocations from Tibet, COVID-19, reprisals against human rights defenders and a security law that crushed dissidents in Hong Kong.With advocates of China's Uyghur minority protesting loudly outside, Chinese Ambassador Chen Xu and a delegation of about 40 envoys from China, Hong Kong and Macau faced questions from the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811504,What causes death after rescue?,"After the massive earthquakes in Syria and Turkey, Zeynep spent over 100 hours under the rubble of a collapsed house before rescue workers were finally able to free her.""The woman is doing well given the circumstances,"" a February 10 press release from the aid organization ISAR Germany (International Search And Rescue), which was involved in the rescue, said.Shortly after being freed, however, Zeynep died.""She was still laughing on the way to the hospital,"" said emergency doctor Bastian Herbst, one of the ISAR doctors who helped rescue Zeynep from the rubble and transport her to help.There could be 120,000 reasons why the woman died, said Herbst. Perhaps she had internal injuries that rescuers couldn't detect immediately. Or maybe Zeynep died the so-called ""rescue"" death.""Rescue death has various causes,"" said Herbst.One of them is hypothermia. The icy temperatures in the earthquake area work to constrict the blood vessels of people trapped under the rubble. This constriction ensures that as little valuable body heat as possible is lost to the environment through the skin or extremities. The temperature of the blood drops in these parts of the body, while the warm blood in the core of the body ensures the functioning of the vital organs.Zeynep's recovery was complicated. ""We had to move her a lot to be able to free her,"" said Herbst. Through this movement, the emergency doctor said Zeynep's blood vessels could have widened, allowing cold blood to flow to the core of her body. This could have caused cardiac arrhythmias and her subsequent death.Or she could have experienced kidney damage and heart arrhythmia.Although she was able to move her feet, ""her legs were buried under stones and rubble,"" Herbst said. It is possible the tissue in her legs was damaged, causing her body to release myoglobin, a protein responsible for transporting oxygen within muscle cells when tissue is injured.Once victims are freed and blood can suddenly flow unhindered again, the body can become flooded with myoglobin, which can lead to kidney failure and an associated increase in potassium levels. Too much potassium in the body can in turn lead to ventricular fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm prohibiting the heart from pumping blood to the rest of the body) which is particularly dangerous for people with previous heart conditions.""We know it from shipwrecked people: The moment they see the rescue team, they won't allow themselves to drown,"" said Herbst, adding that stress hormones can keep organ functions maintained. When these hormones subside after rescue, the circulatory system can collapse.Zeynep lost her husband and children in the earthquake.""Perhaps she became aware of this, and it robbed her of her will to live,"" said Bastian Herbst. ""We don't know.""This article was translated from German.",2023/2/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811506,Judge to Trump: Too late to offer DNA to rebut rape claim,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump missed his chance to use his DNA to try to prove he didn’t rape a longtime magazine advice columnist, a federal judge said Wednesday, clearing away a potential roadblock to an April trial.

            Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected the 11th-hour offer by Trump’s legal team to provide a DNA sample to rebut claims E. Jean Carroll first made publicly in a 2019 book.

            Kaplan said that lawyers for Trump and Carroll had over three years to make DNA an issue in the case and that both chose not to do so.











            He said it would almost surely delay the trial scheduled to start April 25 to reopen the DNA issue four months after the deadline passed to litigate concerns over trial evidence and just weeks before trial.

            Trump’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, declined comment on the ruling. Carroll’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, also declined to comment.

            Carroll's lawyers have sought Trump's DNA sample for three years to compare it with stains found on the dress Carroll wore the day she says Trump raped her in an upscale Manhattan department store dressing room in late 1995 or early 1996. An analysis of DNA on the dress concluded it did contain traces of an unknown man's DNA.

            Trump has denied knowing Carroll and said repeatedly, and sometimes angrily, that he never raped Carroll and that she was making the claim to stoke sales of her book.

            After refusing to provide Trump's DNA sample, his lawyers recently switched tactics, saying they would provide his DNA if Carroll's lawyers turned over the full DNA report on the dress.

            Kaplan wrote in an order that Trump had provided no persuasive reason to relieve him of the consequences of his failure to seek the full DNA report in a timely fashion.

            And the judge noted that the report did not find evidence of sperm cells and that reopening the dispute would raise a “complicated new subject into this case that both sides elected not to pursue over a period of years.”

            He said that a positive match of Trump's DNA to that on the dress would prove only that there had been an encounter between Trump and Carroll on a day when she wore the dress, but that it would not prove or disprove that a rape occurred and might prove entirely inconclusive.

            Kaplan added: “His conditional invitation to open a door that he kept closed for years threatens to change the nature of a trial for which both parties now have been preparing for years. Whether Mr. Trump's application is intended for a dilatory purpose or not, the potential prejudice to Ms. Carroll is apparent.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811507,Austin’s city manager fired over widespread power outages,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Austin's city manager was fired Wednesday in the wake of outrage over a slow and fumbled response to a winter storm power outage that left thousands of people in the Texas capital without electricity for a week or longer. 

            The 10-1 vote by the Austin City Council to remove Spencer Cronk, the city's top executive, followed growing calls for accountability after an ice storm this month knocked out power to more than 170,000 customers. Frustration in the nation's 11th-largest city boiled as Austin officials for days gave few updates about the widespread outages and no assurances about how long repairs would take.

            Cronk, who had been in the job since 2018, was the city's first executive to lose his job over the prolonged outages. He will receive about $463,000 in severance. 











            He did not publicly dig in and fight for his job as his ouster seemed increasingly likely, and said Wednesday that he was proud of his accomplishments. 

            “I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor and Council and acknowledge their decision,"" Cronk said in a statement released through the city. 

            The ice storm toppled trees and power lines across the city of more than 1 million residents, causing outages and damage on a scale that Austin officials compared to a hurricane or tornado. Slow restoration efforts left thousands of people dealing with school closures, malfunctioning traffic lights and the financial pinch of spoiled groceries and hotel bills. Although the majority of Austin never lost power, at the peak of the outages nearly 1 in 3 homes and businesses had no electricity. 

            Power was not fully restored in Austin until nearly two weeks after the outages began. 

            Cronk previously apologized for “any shortcomings in our response” and had vowed that the city would implement changes to better respond to future disasters. For now, his job will be filled by Jesús Garza, who previously served as Austin’s city manager and was appointed by the council to replace Cronk on an interim basis.

            Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who took office in January, put in motion meetings that plunged Cronk’s job into jeopardy. In Austin, the city manager is appointed by the mayor and city council, and operates like the chief executive officer of a business.

            Austin Energy, the city-run power provider, brought in additional utility crews from across Texas to help tackle the vast number of outages.

            For thousands of Austin residents, it was the second time in three years that a February winter storm knocked out their power for days. Although Texas’ catastrophic blackouts in 2021 were the result of a different failure — an ice storm pushing the state’s electric grid to the brink of collapse — the different reason was of little comfort to Austin residents.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Austin's city manager was fired Wednesday in the wake of outrage over a slow and fumbled response to a winter storm power outage that left thousands of people in the Texas capital without electricity for a week or longer.The 10-1 vote by the Austin City Council to remove Spencer Cronk, the city's top executive, followed growing calls for accountability after an ice storm this month knocked out power to more than 170,000 customers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811509,Barcelona downplays payments for refereeing reports,"MADRID (AP) — Barcelona denied a possible conflict of interest on Wednesday for having made payments for technical reports on referees to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain.

            The payments for information on how referees officiate were made from 2016-18 and totaled 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million), according to radio station SER Catalunya. The station said the company hired by Barcelona belonged to former referee José María Enríquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish soccer federation’s refereeing committee from 1994-2018. The payments are under investigation as part of a tax probe into the company.

            The Spanish federation noted that Enríquez Negreira left the committee after the new administration took over in 2018.











            “The refereeing committee regrets behavior that could be considered unethical,” the federation said in a statement. “No active referee or member of the committee can participate in work that could be considered a conflict of interest.”

            Enríquez Negreira told SER he never favored Barcelona while assigning referees to matches, and that his job was only to aid the club verbally about how players should conduct themselves before each referee.

            Getting reports on referees is common practice and clubs can pay other companies or have them prepared internally. It’s not known if other clubs also got them from the company of the former referee.

            Barcelona said the “technical reports related to professional refereeing"" and were ordered “in order to complement the information requested by the first and second team coaching staff.”

            The club said reviewing reports on referees is ""a common practice among professional football clubs.” They are currently prepared internally at Barcelona instead of being outsourced, the club said.

            Barcelona president Joan Laporta said the news about the payments was released now to try to destabilize the team’s good run. The Catalan club will go for its 12th win in a row in all competitions when it hosts Manchester United in the Europa League on Thursday.

            “Barcelona is sorry that this information has been released precisely when the team has hit its best form of the season,” the club said. “Barcelona shall be taking legal actions against those who are trying to tarnish the club’s image with possible insinuations against its good reputation that could be caused by the release of such information.”

            Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez also defended the club.

            “We always analyze the referees, we want to know who is refereeing, if they are communicative or not,” he said. “It’s been like that for years. It’s not new.”

The station said the company hired by Barcelona belonged to former referee José María Enríquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish soccer federation’s refereeing committee from 1994-2018. The payments are under investigation as part of a tax probe into the company.The Spanish federation noted that Enríquez Negreira left the committee after the new administration took over in 2018.“The refereeing committee regrets behavior that could be considered unethical,” the federation said in a statement. “No active referee or member of the committee can participate in work that could be considered a conflict of interest.”Enríquez Negreira told SER he never favored Barcelona while assigning referees to matches, and that his job was only to aid the club verbally about how players should conduct themselves before each referee.Getting reports on referees is common practice and clubs can pay other companies or have them prepared internally. It’s not known if other clubs also got them from the company of the former referee.Barcelona said the “technical reports related to professional refereeing"" and were ordered “in order to complement the information requested by the first and second team coaching staff.”The club said reviewing reports on referees is ""a common practice among professional football clubs.” They are currently prepared internally at Barcelona instead of being outsourced, the club said.Barcelona president Joan Laporta said the news about the payments was released now to try to destabilize the team’s good run. The Catalan club will go for its 12th win in a row in all competitions when it hosts Manchester United in the Europa League on Thursday.“Barcelona is sorry that this information has been released precisely when the team has hit its best form of the season,” the club said. “Barcelona shall be taking legal actions against those who are trying to tarnish the club’s image with possible insinuations against its good reputation that could be caused by the release of such information.”Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez also defended the club.“We always analyze the referees, we want to know who is refereeing, if they are communicative or not,” he said. “It’s been like that for years. It’s not new.”___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811511,"US casinos top $60B in revenue in 2022, their best year ever","ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Commercial casinos in the United States won more than $60 billion from gamblers in 2022, the best year in the industry's history.

            Figures released Wednesday by the American Gaming Association, the gambling industry's national trade group, show that in-person gambling remains the bread-and-butter of the industry, accounting for more than 80% of its revenue. Online betting provided nearly a fifth of the industry's revenue.

            The figures do not include tribal casinos, which report their revenue separately. But David Forman, a vice president with the association, estimated that tribal casinos could report an additional $41 billion in revenue later this year, putting the total U.S. casino industry over the $100 billion mark. That would put the gambling revenue roughly equal with the amount of money raised from beer sales in the U.S., he said.











            “Our industry significantly outpaced expectations in 2022,” said Bill Miller, the association's president and CEO. “Simply put, American adults are choosing casino gaming for entertainment in record numbers, benefiting communities and taking market share from the predatory, illegal marketplace.”

            The $60.4 billion won by casinos last year was up nearly 14% over 2021 levels.

            “That growth is almost the equivalent of adding another Las Vegas Strip to the U.S. market,” Forman said.

            The Las Vegas strip and Atlantic City remained among the top gambling markets in the country in 2022, with the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., Chicago and Mississippi Gulf coast markets also performing well.

            The association ranked gambling markets according to their in-person winnings at table games, slot machines and at-the-counter sports betting, but excluded online sports betting and internet casino games.

            The top 10 are: the Las Vegas Strip ($8.2 billion, up 17%); Atlantic City ($2.8 billion, up 8.5%); Baltimore-Washington D.C. ($2.2 billion, up 8.7%); the Chicago region spanning parts of Illinois and Indiana ($2.1 billion, up 6.1%); the Mississippi Gulf coast ($1.6 billion, down 0.5%); New York City ($1.5 billion, up 2.6%); Philadelphia ($1.4 billion, down 1.8%); Detroit ($1.3 billion, down 1.4%); the St. Louis market spanning parts of Missouri and Illinois ($1.1 billion, up 3.6%); and the Boulder Strip in Nevada ($966 million, virtually flat compared with last year).

            The association split several statewide markets into smaller regional components, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, Louisiana and Mississippi, diluting their overall ranking nationwide.

            Thirty-two jurisdictions saw an increase in gambling revenue compared with 2021, with 29 states setting new annual records. This included the new Nebraska market, as well as four states that reported their first full year of revenue: Arizona, Connecticut, Virginia and Wyoming.

            Mississippi (down 3.6%) and South Dakota (down 2.2%) saw their annual revenue decrease compared with 2021. Additionally, the sports betting-only market in Washington, D.C., continued to lose ground to neighboring Maryland and Virginia.

            The association said 84 million American adults, or 34% of the adult population, visited a casino in the past year, including newly opened markets in Nebraska and Virginia. 

            Table games revenue was up 13.9%, while slot machines were up by 5.1%.

            Sports betting continued to grow rapidly in 2022, setting new records for the total amount wagered ($93.2 billion) and sportsbook revenue ($7.5 billion). This growth was helped in part by Kansas, which began retail and mobile sports wagering, and by the launch of mobile sports betting in Louisiana, Maryland and New York.

            The association predicted that 40 states might legalize sports betting by the end of 2023, up from the 36 plus Washington D.C. that have done it already.

            Online casino revenue grew by 35.2% to $5 billion. Six states currently offer internet gambling: New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania; Connecticut, West Virginia and Delaware. (Nevada only offers online poker). Miller said five additional states have introduced bills that would legalize internet gambling: Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, New Hampshire and New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811514,Charges dropped against reporter arrested at news conference,"A cable news reporter pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference about a train derailment in Ohio will no longer face charges, the state's attorney general said Wednesday.

            Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost dismissed trespassing and resisting arrest charges against NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert, saying he had every right to be at the press conference. 

            
                Lambert was arrested and then jailed for five hours on Feb. 8 after authorities said he was told to stop his live broadcast and refused their orders to leave the news conference with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.











            The reporter said in a statement Wednesday that he was grateful for who those worked to see that the charges were dismissed, including DeWine. 

            “It is by design that reporters aren't meant to become the story. In my case, I truly did not choose this,” he said. 

            
                Body-camera footage showed Lambert had a heated confrontation with Maj. Gen. John Harris Jr., commander of the Ohio National Guard, just before he was arrested by a sheriff's deputy and an East Palestine police officer.

            Police said Lambert was talking loudly while on the air from the back of the gym while DeWine was speaking at the same time.

            Yost, who was asked by the county prosecutor to review the charges, said the local officials appeared to be following the lead of the National Guard.

            “Regardless of the intent, arresting a journalist reporting at a press conference is a serious matter,” Yost said. “Ohio protects a free press under its constitution, and state officials should remember to exercise a heightened level of restraint in using arrest powers.” 

            DeWine, who as governor was at the news conference giving an update about the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals, said he did not authorize the arrest or see the disagreement, adding that reporters have “every right” to report during briefings. 

            He had called for the charges to be dismissed and said on Tuesday that he had talked with Harris. “I think the general regrets the whole situation,” DeWine said. 

            Body-camera footage showed Harris confronted and pointed a finger at Lambert and then briefly pushed the reporter with one hand in the chest. Lambert also was pointing and talking to Harris until a state trooper stepped in between the two and moved away the commander, the footage showed.

            Lambert later pulled away from two officers who then pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him, the video showed.

            “This is what it’s like to be a Black reporter in 2023,” Lambert said while he was being held down, according to the footage.

            The two officers who handcuffed Lambert are white as is the Columbiana County sheriff who ordered Lambert to leave. Both Lambert and Harris, the national guard commander who is a member of the governor’s cabinet, are Black.

            Lambert said in his statement Wednesday that he was still processing what was a traumatic event “in the context of a time where we are hyper aware of how frequently some police interactions with people of color can end in much worse circumstances.”A cable news reporter pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference about a train derailment in Ohio will no longer face charges, the state's attorney general said Wednesday.Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost dismissed trespassing and resisting arrest charges against NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert, saying he had every right to be at the press conference.Lambert was arrested and then jailed for five hours on Feb. 8 after authorities said he was told to stop his live broadcast and refused their orders to leave the news conference with Ohio Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811515,Panel backs moving opioid antidote Narcan over the counter,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The overdose-reversing drug naloxone should be made available over the counter to aid the national response to the opioid crisis, U.S. health advisers said Wednesday.

            The panel of Food and Drug Administration experts voted unanimously in favor of the switch after a full day of presentations and discussions centered on whether untrained users would be able to safely and effectively use the nasal spray in emergency situations.

            The positive vote, which is not binding, came despite concerns from some panel members about the drug’s instructions and packaging, which caused confusion among some people in a company study. The manufacturer, Emergent Biosolutions, said it would revise the packaging and labeling to address those concerns. The FDA will make a final decision on the drug in coming weeks.











            Panel members urged the FDA to move swiftly rather than waiting for Emergent to conduct a follow-up study with the easier-to-understand label.

            “There’s perhaps a far greater risk of delaying the availability of the product given the climate of this crisis and its devastating consequences,” said Maria Coyle, a pharmacy professor from Ohio State University, who chaired the panel.

            The prefilled nasal device, Narcan, is the leading version of the drug in the U.S., which is also available as an injection. If FDA approves, Narcan would be the first opioid treatment to make the regulatory switch to a non-prescription drug.

            The potential move represents the latest government effort to increase use of a medication that has been a key tool in the battle against the U.S. overdose epidemic that kills more than 100,000 people annually. The decades-old drug can counteract the effects of an opioid overdose in minutes.

            Narcan is already available without a prescription in all 50 states, where state leaders have issued standing orders for pharmacists to sell the drug to anyone who asks for it. But not all pharmacies carry it and those that do must keep it behind the counter. Also, the stigma of opioids can discourage people from asking for the drug.

            “We believe that nonprescription naloxone may help address these barriers,” said FDA's Dr. Jody Green, noting the switch would allow the drug to be sold in vending machines, convenience stores and supermarkets.

            Emergent presented results from a 70-person study designed to show that people of various ages and backgrounds could quickly and correctly understand how to use the device in an emergency. About a third of people in the study had low reading ability, a group that FDA said should have been larger.

            FDA staffers also cautioned that a number of participants had trouble following the directions, in part because of the way the multi-step instructions were laid out across two sides of the carton, FDA noted. 

            “Where is step one?” one participant asked, according to interview transcripts from the study presented by the FDA.

            Emergent said it plans to move all the directions to a single panel and add pictograms, per FDA's suggestion.

            Despite flaws in the original packaging, the panel of 19 pain and medical education experts expressed confidence that the product could be used effectively by most adults and adolescents.

            “Perfect should not be the enemy of the good and the evidence we saw today provides clear indication that the drug can be used without the direction of a health care provider,” said Dr. Brian Bateman of Stanford University.

            Government officials hope that moving naloxone beyond the pharmacy counter will boost sales, with the potential to lower costs. Currently the drug can cost $50 for a two-pack, when not covered by insurance.

            Community advocates and organizations that favor distributing the drug welcomed the potential approval of an over-the-counter version.

            “It’s going to make a tremendous impact on how people view the medication,” said Sheila Vakharia, deputy director of research and academic engagement at the Drug Policy Alliance. “It will help to destigmatize it and make people know it’s safe and easy to use.”

            But Maya Doe-Simkins, a co-director of Remedy Alliance/For The People, worried that an over-the-counter version of Narcan could also lead to a perception that it’s better than other forms of naloxone.

            “We have some trepidation about how companies that have ‘over-the-counter’ products may misrepresent injectable products,” said Doe-Simkins, who has long advocated for an over-the-counter version.

            U.S. overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s, driven by painkillers. Waves of deaths followed, led by other opioids like heroin and — most recently — illicit fentanyl. Nearly 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2021, an all-time high, though recent data suggests deaths may be plateauing.

            Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Emergent Biosolutions makes most of its money from medical products purchased by the federal government for the Strategic National Stockpile, including drugs and vaccines against anthrax.

            In 2021, the company came to the public's attention for its disastrous handling of COVID-19 vaccine production for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. Contamination problems at the company’s Baltimore plant ultimately forced the drugmakers to discard the equivalent of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses.

            Universal Orlando Resort plans to raise its starting minimum wage by $2 to $17 an hour, becoming the wage leader among the big theme parks in central Florida, just as its crosstown rival, Walt Disney World, is in contract talks with service worker unions who are pushing to increase the starting hourly wage from $15 to $18.

            The new wage structure, which includes raising pay for other workers based on the new rates and their time with the company, goes into effect in June, Universal Orlando Resort President and Chief Operating Officer Karen Irwin said in a letter Tuesday to the resort's 25,000 workers.











            The starting hourly wage hike is part of a larger effort aimed at improving worker benefits in a tight labor market that includes increasing 401(k) matches and tuition reimbursement, adding compassionate leave, doubling the amount of parental leave and upgrading behind-the-scenes areas for workers like break rooms and bathrooms, park officials said. 

            “But it doesn’t stop there, our culture seeks to create a path forward that supports our Team Members, gives them an opportunity to grow and fosters a real sense of purpose and belonging,"" Irwin said in the letter.

            Universal Orlando currently is recruiting for 2,500 positions across the resort. It also is gearing up toward opening a new park, Epic Universe, in 2025. The resort's workers aren't unionized.

            At crosstown rival Walt Disney World, union members voted down a contract proposal covering 45,000 service workers earlier this month, saying it didn’t go far enough toward helping employees face cost-of-living hikes in housing and other expenses in central Florida. The company and unions plan to return to the negotiating table.

            Disney World service workers who are in the six unions that make up the Service Trades Council Union coalition had been demanding a starting minimum wage jump to at least $18 an hour in the first year of the contract, up from the starting minimum wage of $15 an hour won in the previous contract.

            The rejected proposal would have raised the starting minimum wage to $20 an hour for all service workers by the last year of the five-year contract, an increase of $1 each year for a majority of the workers it covered. Certain positions, like housekeepers, bus drivers and culinary jobs, would start immediately at a minimum of $20 under the proposal.ORLANDO, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811517,Jane Fonda to attend Vienna Opera Ball with 90-year-old date,"VIENNA (AP) — American actor Jane Fonda said Wednesday she accepted an Austrian building tycoon's invitation to attend the Vienna Opera Ball because he offered to “pay me quite a bit of money.” 

            The 85-year-old Academy Award and Golden Globe winner said at a news conference with her date, 90-year-old Richard Lugner, that she needed the money to pay her bills and to support her grandchildren.

            “I support a lot of people,” Fonda said. 











            The opera ball is one of the highlights of the social calendar in Austria and known for a guest list that includes many celebrities. This year's event is on Thursday.

            Lugner is known for paying undisclosed sums of money to famous women to accompany him to the ball. His past guests include Pamela Anderson, Kim Kardashian and model Elle MacPherson. 

            Fonda said her commitment would not include dancing at the ball because she has a “fake shoulder, two fake hips, two fake knees.”

            “I’m old and I may fall apart,” quipped the actor, whose recent roles have included the TV series ”Grace and Frankie"" and the film “80 for Brady.” 

            She acknowledged not being well informed before she accepted Lugner's invitation, telling reporters she thought it was to an “opera performance” and not a ball.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811518,Mini-union vote at Nissan Tennessee plant set for March 16,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Fewer than 100 employees out of the thousands who work at Nissan’s auto assembly plant in Tennessee will have the chance to vote on March 16 on whether to form a small union.

            On Tuesday, the National Labor Relations Board set the secret ballot election date for about 86 tool and die technicians at Nissan’s Smyrna plant. The vote on whether to be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers will take place at the Nissan facility, which is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) outside Nashville.

            The board ruled earlier this month that the smaller bloc of employees is eligible for union organizing. The decision was made by a board majority picked by President Joe Biden. It overturned a June 2021 ruling by one of the board's regional officials that had long blocked the vote.











            The vote offers measured hope for unions in their uphill fight to get a foothold in foreign-owned auto assembly plants in the traditionally anti-union South.

            Nissan had contended that the employees are not sufficiently distinct from other plant workers to be eligible for their own small unionized subgroup. 

            A spokesperson for Nissan, which has about 7,000 employees at the Smyrna facility, said Wednesday that the company believes its workplace is “stronger without the involvement of third-party unions” like the Machinists, while emphasizing that it is the right of employees to decide.

            “Our history reflects that Nissan respects the right of employees to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace,"" Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said in a statement. ""However, we believe our workplace is stronger without the involvement of third-party unions, including the IAM, that have not been involved in our history of quality job creation and do not understand the relationship we have with Nissan teammates.”

            In a statement, the Machinists union commended the group of workers for “standing up to Nissan and demanding a voice in the workplace.”

            ""We hope that over the next month, Nissan North America will respect the rights of their employees and let them make a decision free of intimidation and coercion,” Machinists union Southern Territory General Vice President Rickey Wallace said in a news release.

            Nissan does work with organized labor in the rest of the world, but votes to unionize broadly at the U.S.' two Nissan plants have not been close. Workers in Smyrna rejected a plantwide union under the United Auto Workers in 2001 and 1989. The Japan-based automaker’s other U.S. assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, rejected facility-wide representation by the UAW during a 2017 vote.

            The margin was much closer in 2014 and 2019 votes at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where workers twice rejected a factory-wide union under the UAW.

            The year after the 2014 vote failed, 160 Chattanooga maintenance workers won a vote to form a smaller union, but Volkswagen refused to bargain. The German automaker had argued the bargaining unit also needed to include production workers. As a result, the 2019 factory-wide vote followed.

            Unions also have run into opposition from Republican politicians when they attempt to organize at foreign automakers in the South, including in Tennessee.

            Tennessee already has a big union presence at an American automaker: the General Motors plant in Spring Hill has thousands of production and skilled trades workers represented by UAW.

            There is also an open question about whether workers will unionize at four sprawling new factories planned by Ford in Kentucky and Tennessee by 2025, with an aim of hiring nearly 11,000 workers. Three of the plants — two in Kentucky, one in Tennessee — will be built with Ford’s South Korean corporate partner, SK Innovation, to produce electric vehicle batteries. A fourth, in Tennessee, will make electric F-Series pickup trucks.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811519,NATO chief heads to Ankara as Turkey holds up Nordics,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg conceded Wednesday that Turkey has blocked efforts to let Finland and Sweden join the world’s biggest security alliance at the same time, and said he is heading to Ankara to discuss the issue with the Turkish president and foreign minister.

            Finland and neighboring Sweden abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join the 30-nation alliance in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago. All NATO members except Turkey and Hungary have ratified their accession, but unanimity is required.

            Stoltenberg and most allies have long insisted that the Nordic neighbors should join at the same time.











            But Turkey has accused the government in Stockholm of being too lenient toward groups it deems as terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups. Earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.

            “There are different assessments in Turkey about to what extent Finland and Sweden are in the same position to be ratified, and that is a Turkish decision,” Stoltenberg told reporters, after chairing a meeting of NATO defense ministers.

            “That’s not a NATO decision. It’s a decision by Turkey,” he said, while underlining his belief that both countries have fulfilled their commitments to NATO and Turkey and should be allowed to join.

            Stoltenberg added that “the sequencing is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that both Finland and Sweden soon become members of the alliance,” breaking with a stance he has voiced for many months that it was important that they join together.

            But the former Norwegian prime minister did not criticize Turkey. The country was rocked last week by a devastating earthquake and aftershocks that killed more than 39,000 people there and in neighboring Syria.

            Turkey is also in an election year, and the topic of Nordic membership of NATO is a possible vote winner.

            In recent weeks, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed anger at a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged.

            Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said it would be “unfortunate” if Finland entered NATO first.

            Stoltenberg was due to fly to Ankara later Wednesday and meet Erdogan and Cavusoglu.

            U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declined to take a stand, but he said that NATO has trained with both candidate countries and praised them for investing in modern military equipment.

            “They are ready to join now, and these are two countries that are highly capable, that bring a lot of value to the alliance once they join,” Austin told reporters.

            Of the two countries, only Finland shares a border with Russia and would appear to be more at risk should Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to target his neighbor. That said, some NATO allies, led by the United States, have offered security guarantees to both should they come under threat.

            Hungary has pushed back its ratification date for both countries three times so far but has not publicly raised any substantial objections to either of them joining.BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg conceded Wednesday that Turkey has blocked efforts to let Finland and Sweden join the world’s biggest security alliance at the same time, and said he is heading to Ankara to discuss the issue with the Turkish president and foreign minister.Finland and neighboring Sweden abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join the 30-nation alliance in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811522,What's a legal slap? Slap fight league regulators weigh in,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The state commission that regulates slap fighting — in which opponents take turns striking each other in the face — attempted Wednesday to address a critical question for the budding sport: What constitutes a legal slap?

            Competitors in the Power Slap League must deliver only open-handed blows and must not hit opponents below the chin, according to amended rules approved by the Nevada Athletic Commission that seek to make the matches safer.

            The commission originally voted in October to sanction slap fighting, asserting it wanted to prevent unregulated matches and ensure competitors are safe. However, commissioners were concerned the rules weren’t specific enough.











            “So, these guys want to get serious about the sport and it sounds like they do,” said Anthony Marnell III, chairman of the commission which also regulates boxing and other combat sports. “It sounds like they want to evolve the rules. We as a commission need to keep up with them at lightning speed on how we’re going to review this. And we have to have a process for it because there’s going to be controversy.”

            In November, the commission also approved UFC President Dana White’s license to promote the Power Slap League. White and other UFC officers are involved in the league, but the UFC does not operate it.

            Power Slap is being featured in the TBS show “Power Slap: Road to the Title.” The first four episodes averaged 275,000 viewers.

            However, many competitors exhibited apparent concussion-like symptoms, raising safety concerns about the competition.

            Power Slap President Frank Lamicella told the commission Wednesday there have been “no major injuries” among the 25 matches the commission approved.

            Any slap that doesn’t meet the criteria will result in disqualification, and every strike is subject to video review. The review official has the final say over whether someone is disqualified.

            Marnell was especially concerned about replay guidelines being followed.

            “I think we have to take this sport, whether you like it or not, just as serious as we take the $20 million, $100 million boxing match that we’re responsible for,” Marnell said. “We need a process for this because the way that I see this going, and I haven’t been to one yet in person, but watching this you are going to be reviewing every single slap. The clamp down on the carpal bone hitting the cheek first has got to be zero tolerance. It’s over at that point.”

            Lamicella said the league is using the same replay equipment as the UFC. “We’ve taken the MMA rules and adjusted it for slap, and it is evolving and will be evolving even more,” Lamicella said.

            White promoted the TBS show in an interview with Front Office Sports last week. He acknowledged in the interview that a video of him and his wife slapping each other during an argument on New Year’s Eve at a Mexican nightclub didn’t help in his efforts to promote the new sport. He called the timing “ironic and horrible at the same time.”

            
                White also has publicly apologized for slapping his wife.

            AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLAS VEGAS (AP) — The state commission that regulates slap fighting — in which opponents take turns striking each other in the face — attempted Wednesday to address a critical question for the budding sport: What constitutes a legal slap?Competitors in the Power Slap League must deliver only open-handed blows and must not hit opponents below the chin, according to amended rules approved by the Nevada Athletic Commission that seek to make the matches safer.The commission originally voted in October to sanction slap fighting, asserting it wanted to prevent unregulated matches and ensure competitors are safe. However, commissioners were concerned the rules weren’t specific enough.“So, these guys want to get serious about the sport and it sounds like they do,” said Anthony Marnell III, chairman of the commission which also regulates boxing and other combat sports. “It sounds like they want to evolve the rules. We as a commission need to keep up with them at lightning speed on how we’re going to review this. And we have to have a process for it because there’s going to be controversy.”In November, the commission also approved UFC President Dana White’s license to promote the Power Slap League. White and other UFC officers are involved in the league, but the UFC does not operate it.Power Slap is being featured in the TBS show “Power Slap: Road to the Title.” The first four episodes averaged 275,000 viewers.However, many competitors exhibited apparent concussion-like symptoms, raising safety concerns about the competition.Power Slap President Frank Lamicella told the commission Wednesday there have been “no major injuries” among the 25 matches the commission approved.Any slap that doesn’t meet the criteria will result in disqualification, and every strike is subject to video review. The review official has the final say over whether someone is disqualified.Marnell was especially concerned about replay guidelines being followed.“I think we have to take this sport, whether you like it or not, just as serious as we take the $20 million, $100 million boxing match that we’re responsible for,” Marnell said. “We need a process for this because the way that I see this going, and I haven’t been to one yet in person, but watching this you are going to be reviewing every single slap. The clamp down on the carpal bone hitting the cheek first has got to be zero tolerance. It’s over at that point.”Lamicella said the league is using the same replay equipment as the UFC. “We’ve taken the MMA rules and adjusted it for slap, and it is evolving and will be evolving even more,” Lamicella said.White promoted the TBS show in an interview with Front Office Sports last week. He acknowledged in the interview that a video of him and his wife slapping each other during an argument on New Year’s Eve at a Mexican nightclub didn’t help in his efforts to promote the new sport. He called the timing “ironic and horrible at the same time.”White also has publicly apologized for slapping his wife.The commission has approved upcoming Power Slap events March 9 and 11 at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811523,"Yankees' Montas needs surgery, out most or all of season","TAMPA, Fla, (AP) — Frankie Montas needs shoulder surgery and will miss most or all of the New York Yankees' season.

            As pitchers and catchers reported to spring training on Wednesday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said the 29-year-old right-hander will have right shoulder surgery on Feb. 21. Boone said Montas could possibly return in the season's second half.

            “He was building back up and just still wasn't quite right,” Boone said. “Now we've gotten to the point where they're going to go in and they'll scope it. Best case is he woild be back late in the season but we're really going to know a lot after the 21st.""











            Montas was acquired from Oakland on Aug 1. and went 1-3 with a 6.35 ERA in eight starts with the Yankees. He didn't pitch after Sept. 16 due to inflammation in his pitching shoulder.

            Montas left a July 3 start at Seattle after 13 pitches with shoulder tightness — his velocity was down about 3 mph. He returned July 21 and had a 2.25 ERA in starts against Detroit and Houston.

            “He had shoulder issues when he got to us,” Boone said. “I think with all these pitchers, you're going to have this similar thing. That's why, especially with shoulders, they don't race into shoulder surgeries all the time. You treat these things, and sometimes these things lay dormant, sometimes they are asymptomatic, sometimes they become very symptomatic. For Frankie, it was just I think that nagging thing that didn't allow him to continue to get over the hump.”

            Montas is eligible for free agency after this season.

            New York left-hander Nestor Cortes is sidelined by a strained right hamstring and is uncertain for opening day.

            Gerrit Cole, newcomer Carlos Rodón and Luis Severino project to be part of a rotation that also could include Domingo Germán and Clarke Schmidt.

            Reliever Michael King, coming back from a fractured right elbow that required surgery, said he is 100% and has no limitations at spring training, King was 6-3 with a 2.29 ERA in 34 outings in 2022 before the season-ending injury in July.

            STICKING IN THE OUTFIELD

            Outfielder Aaron Judge worked out at first base Tuesday at the Yankees' minor league complex.

            “We needed someone to take the throws over there,” Boone said. “I don't expect you to see him out there this year. Maybe five years from now, maybe it's something we're talking about.""

            DJ ROCKING

            Infielder DJ LeMahieu has been working out at the Yankees' minor league complex since December after missing the 2022 postseason with a right toe injury. He is expected to be ready for opening day.

            “I'm really excited where DJ's at,” Boone said. “Again, it's something that we're always playing close attention to, but he's been in a pretty good spot now for awhile. He looks really good, and he's moving really well.""

            .TORRES LOOKING AHEAD

            After All-Star seasons in 2018 and 19, infielder Gleyber Torres has struggled at times offensively. He agreed to a $9.95 million, one-year deal to avoiid arbitration.

            Torres remains under Yankees' control for two more years, which he see as an opportunity. He hasn't looked at social medai since November when he saw a lot of trade speculation.

            “If they don’t trade me, I’ve got a great opportunity, make some really good numbers for my career, really good numbers for the team."" Torres said. ""I think I’ve got two more opportunities.""

            Torres said there have been no discussions about a long-term contract.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811524,Ihsanullah's 5-12 earns Multan big win over Quetta in PSL,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Unheralded fast bowler Ihsanullah picked up 5-12 and Rilee Rossouw smashed a rapid 78 in the Multan Sultans’ nine-wicket win over the Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League on Wednesday.

            The 20-year-old Ihsanullah consistently troubled Quetta's top-order batters by clocking over 145kph as the 2019 champions were bowled out for 110 in 18.5 overs in their opening game of the season.

            Rossouw then racked up an unbeaten half century as Multan raced to its first win in the tournament by reaching 111-1 with more than six overs to spare.











            The South African led the run-chase off 42 balls by smashing nine fours and three sixes and captain Mohammad Rizwan remained unbeaten on 28. Shan Masood missed out when he was trapped leg before wicket by Sri Lankan Nuwan Thushara before Rossouw led the run-charge with his aggressive batting in an unbeaten century-stand with Rizwan.

            Multan ace fast bowler Shahnawaz Dahani was ruled out of the tournament because of a finger injury he sustained during a one-run loss to the Lahore Qalandars on Monday.

            Fellow rookie fast bowler Abbas Afridi, who replaced Dahani in the playing XI, picked up 2-27 while paceman Sameen Gul finished with 2-20 as Quetta batters had no answer to Multan’s pace.

            Ihsanullah, playing in his second PSL season, used his sharp pace and bounce after Rizwan won the toss and elected to field for the second home game in a row.

            New Quetta signing Martin Guptill of New Zealand fell to a tame pull shot for just seven in only the second over before Ihsanullah sliced through the long batting lineup by clean bowling Sarfaraz Ahmed not long after dropping the Quetta skipper at short fine-leg.

            Ihsanullah then had top-scorer Jason Roy (27) caught at mid-off and trapped Iftikhar Ahmed out leg before wicket for a golden duck off a delivery that nipped back sharply into the right-hander.

            Quetta was in danger of getting bowled out for less than 100 when it was reduced to 68-8 after Pakistan leg-spinner Usama Mir had Mohammad Nawaz leg before wicket and then Ihsanullah got a thick outside edge of Umar Akmal’s bat off another brilliant short delivery before knocking the top of Naseem Shah’s off stump.

            Mohammad Hafeez made 18 and Mohammad Hasnain scored 22 off 20 balls for Quetta before both were caught behind to give Rizwan three catches behind the stumps.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811525,Ex-officer's trial date postponed in Breonna Taylor case,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The large volume of evidence collected in the Breonna Taylor case prompted a judge on Wednesday to push back the trial date for a former Kentucky police officer who fired blindly into Taylor's apartment during the deadly no-knock raid on her apartment in 2020.

            The trial will mark a second attempt by prosecutors to convict Brett Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death by police in Louisville. Taylor, who worked as an emergency medical technician, was shot multiple times during the raid. The warrant for the raid was later found to be flawed.

            U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings moved the trial back about two months to Oct. 30, after Hankison's lawyers asked for more time to process massive amounts of evidence turned over by federal prosecutors.











            Hankison was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department last year along with three other officers, one of whom has pleaded guilty to helping falsify the warrant used to enter Taylor's apartment on March 13, 2020. Taylor was killed in her hallway after officers broke down the door and Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot that struck a police sergeant. None of Hankison's shots hit Taylor.

            Her killing along with George Floyd's death at the hands of Minnesota police in 2020 ignited protests that summer around the country over racial injustice. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the federal indictments in the Taylor case in August, remarking that Taylor “should be alive today.”

            Hankison is the only officer who fired shots during the raid who has been charged in any court. Prosecutors determined that two other officers who fired and struck Taylor were justified in shooting back after Taylor's boyfriend fired at them. 

            Hankison attorney Jack Byrd also told Jennings Wednesday that his team needs time to meet with use-of-force and crime scene experts to go over evidence.

            Hankison, 46, was acquitted in March of charges brought by state prosecutors for endangering Taylor's next-door neighbors with shots he fired into Taylor's apartment that went through her walls. Hankison retreated from the open doorway and fired 10 bullets into a sliding door and window on the side of Taylor’s apartment. The more recent federal charges accuse him of endangering neighbors along with Taylor and her boyfriend. 

            Another former officer, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to a federal conspiracy charge, and is expected to testify in the cases against two more officers who were involved in crafting the Taylor warrant. Former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany are charged with conspiring to deprive Taylor of her civil rights. Jaynes and Meany are set to be tried together on Oct. 25.

            Goodlett's guilty plea was moved from last year to Dec. 13, presumably after Jaynes and Meany's cases are finished.LOUISVILLE, Ky.

(AP) — A winter storm packing gusty winds and heavy snow that shut down schools and stretches of highways in northern Arizona and New Mexico was making its way out of the region late Wednesday. But unseasonably cold weather with bitter wind chills was forecast to keep an icy grip on much of the Southwest into Friday.

            “High temperatures on Thursday and low temperatures Friday morning will be unseasonably cold areawide,” the National Weather Service in Albuquerque said Wednesday afternoon. “Conditions will improve over the weekend with warmer temperatures and dry conditions.”

            Several stretches of Interstate 40 east of Flagstaff, Arizona, were closed off and on Wednesday because of multiple crashes and spinoffs after a foot of snow (30 centimeters) fell in the area Tuesday night into Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.











            The same was true with a couple of stretches of U.S. Highway 60 in New Mexico south of Albuquerque. Fifteen inches (38 cm) of snow was reported at Los Alamos and schools were closed in Santa Fe.

            A winter storm warning was set to expire Wednesday evening in northern Arizona and New Mexico. But bitterly cold temperatures were forecast Wednesday night into Thursday from as far west as the Sierra Nevada to the New Mexico-Texas Line.

            Temperatures were expected to drop below zero around Lake Tahoe, as cold as minus 6 Fahrenheit (minus 21 Celsius) at Truckee, California. Lows early Thursday were expected to drop to minus 10 (minus 23 C) in Ely, Nevada near the Utah line.

            In New Mexico, the temperatures fell early Wednesday to minus 28 (minus 33 C) at Angel Fire, minus 6 (minus 21 C) at Taos. Winds gusted up to 46 mph (74 kph) in Albuquerque.

            In Flagstaff, where schools also were closed Wednesday, it was expected to be even colder overnight into Thursday, with raw temperatures around zero (minus 17 C) and wind chills as low as minus 13 (minus 25 C).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811541,N Mexico St AD gets vote of confidence after hoops shutdown,"New Mexico State's chancellor expressed his confidence in athletic director Mario Moccia on Wednesday, less than a week after the school's most high-profile sports program — the men's basketball team — was shut down for what the chancellor said was a culture of bad behavior, egregious violations of the student code of conduct and other “despicable acts.”

            In addition to backing Moccia, chancellor Dan Arvizu said at a news conference that he was confident the behavior that led to the cancellation of the season and firing of head coach Greg Heiar was not reflective of the athletic department or the school overall.

            “Our review indicates that this culture of bad behavior is contained within the basketball program,” Arvizu said.











            He was speaking less than 24 hours after firing Heiar, whose program was sunk by a pair of scandals, both of which are subject to ongoing investigations. The latest was the hazing allegations reported to campus police last week by a player who said three teammates ganged up on him and attacked him in the team locker room.

            That came less than three months after the fatal shooting of a student at rival University of New Mexico in November. Surveillance video of the shooting shows New Mexico State player Mike Peake being shot at by that student, then responding by shooting the student as they ran through an apartment parking lot. Peake has been suspended from school but not charged in the incident.

            Arvizu said the shooting, which had roots in a fight that Peake and others were involved in at an Aggies football game a month earlier, is still under investigation. He said players who are under investigation could be suspended from school, suspended from basketball or exonerated.

            At a board of regents meeting held shortly after the fatal shooting, chair Ammu Devasthali said guns are not permitted on the university campus or on university trips.

            Moccia, who appeared with Arvizu at the news conference, defended his hiring record over his eight years on the job, along with the vetting process he led on Heiar, who went 9-15 in his first season before it was abruptly halted.

            “I made a list of every coach I've hired ... and, you know, we have an excellent batting average,” Moccia said. “Nobody bats a thousand. But surely, tremendously disappointed in this outcome, specifically for this victim, but for everyone involved. We'll go back and look at our processes.”

            The AD also was pressed on whether Heiar ultimately bore responsibility for Peake and his teammates being out after curfew on the night of the shooting in Albuquerque.

            “What my heart tells me is that when you’re sound asleep in your bed and you're awoken and a situation has occurred, what is your direct responsibility?” Moccia said. “However, setting the culture matters, and for individuals to think that the night before a big game, to get out of a room and do some things we would never condone, is certainly troubling.”

            Heiar coached 22 games after the Nov. 19 shooting. His firing — which Arvizu said was “with cause,” meaning the school isn't obligated to pay him — came after the hazing allegations surfaced, and after Arvizu called off the season. The chancellor said the coach had not been cooperating with investigators. Arvizu also said the fates of the rest of the coaching staff, along with players involved, would be determined after the multiple investigations are complete.

            Safe, however, is Moccia, who is in charge of a basketball program that, more than any other sport, puts New Mexico State and its 14,000-student campus in Las Cruces, on the map. The Aggies have made 26 March Madness trips over their long history and have long drawn more nationwide attention than their football or any other team.

            “He still has my confidence to turn this problem around,"" Arvizu said. ""Clearly there are some issues that we need to see why it took so long to understand that there was an issue. But I think there’s plenty of evidence to support this particular incident, or set of incidents, is contained within the basketball program and primarily as a coach's responsibility. The oversight of that is in question, and we'll continue to look at that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811546,States' push to define sex decried as erasing trans people,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Adam Kellogg was a self-described nerdy 16-year-old preparing to board a flight from Kansas City to Florida for a space and science camp trip to Cape Canaveral when security held him up for 30 minutes because his driver's license identified him as female.

            Three years later, the University of Kansas student's driver's license identifies him as male, but legislative proposals in at least eight states could prevent transgender people like him from changing their driver's licenses and birth certificates. The Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature is considering a bill that would define male and female in state law and base people's legal gender identities on their anatomy at birth. 

            Nationally, conservatives are pushing dozens of proposals in statehouses to restrict transgender athletes, gender-affirming care and drag shows. But in measures like Kansas', LGBTQ-rights advocates see a new, sweeping effort to erase trans people's legal existence, deny recognition to nonbinary or gender-fluid people and ignore those who are intersex — people born with genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes and/or hormone levels that don’t fit typical definitions for male or female.











            “Something that's really important for me is being able to just simply exist as a man, not even think about it,"" Kellogg said this week while visiting the Statehouse with other transgender people and LGBTQ advocates. 

            Kellogg laughs now about his experience at the airport, but it was no laughing matter at the time. Back then, he bound the breasts that he'd later have surgically removed and, “They thought I had a bomb strapped to me.”

            Doctors say reproductive anatomy at birth doesn’t always align with strict definitions of sex and that binary views of sexual identity can miss biological nuances. 

            LGBTQ-rights advocates say having a driver's license or birth certificate confirm a transgender person's identity is important by itself but also can prevent daily hassles or harassment. They believe Kansas' bill also would prevent transgender people from using restrooms and other facilities aligned with their gender identities.

            Republicans have put transgender issues at the center of their agenda, a tactic that many observers see as an effort to keep conservative voters energized and to push voters sympathetic to Democrats on other issues into the GOP camp. In the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders derided the Democratic president as “the first man to surrender his presidency to a woke mob that can’t even tell you what a woman is.”

            
                The Kansas bill had a hearing Wednesday before the state Senate's health committee and is similar to a Republican measure introduced in the U.S. House last year. Oklahoma's Legislature is weighing a similar proposal, while North Dakota lawmakers are considering a resolution that would urge public schools and other “public entities” to distinguish “between the sexes according to biological sex at birth.” Mississippi lawmakers had three proposals like Kansas', but none advanced this year. 

            New Hampshire, Tennessee and Texas also have proposals to define male and female in state law, and a Republican lawmaker in South Carolina has proposed an amendment to the state's constitution to declare that legally, a person's gender would be based on anatomy at birth, not a “psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.”

            “They’re afraid of what they don’t understand,"" said Luc Bensimon, a transgender man who serves on Topeka's anti-discrimination commission and is an activist for the Black Trans Advocacy Coalition. ”Anything or any lifestyle that is different or outside the norm, they’re not OK.""

            The Kansas measure would declare that legally, “sex” means “biological” sex, “either male or female, at birth.” It says females have a reproductive system “developed to produce ova,” while males have one “developed to fertilize the ova.”

            It's not clear how far the measure will go, though the state Senate committee could vote on it next week. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly twice vetoed bills to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's club, K-12 and college sports, and she opposes restricting gender affirming care. 

            Supporters of the Kansas bill contend that they're responding to parents and others who are uncomfortable with “biological men” or “biological boys” sharing spaces meant for women and girls — especially bathrooms and locker rooms but also prisons and domestic violence shelters. 

            They also are trying to frame the debate as protecting the rights of “biological” women, and the Kansas bill is called, “The Women's Bill of Rights.”

            In Kansas, Republican state Sen. Renee Erickson, the Senate health committee's vice chair, asked it to sponsor the measure. A former college basketball player, she has also led the push to restrict transgender athletes. She said defining male and female in state law would not prevent anyone from “living how they choose to live.""

            In North Dakota, Republican state Rep. SuAnn Olson decried what she called “radical gender ideologues” and said they want to redefine womanhood as a subjective state. In Kansas, conservative activist and Statehouse lobbyist Phillip Cosby called young people's increased identity as transgender or nonbinary “a social contagion.”

            Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said she doesn’t automatically assume female reproductive anatomy means female gender.

            “It’s helpful to know what anatomical structures are present when I’m doing an exam, when I’m recommending tests,” she said. “I often ask my patient, how do they like to be identified? And I go with that.’’

            Brandi also said proclaiming that sex is binary ignores that intersex conditions and differences in gender identity exist. 

            At birth, external genital anatomy can be ambiguous, sometimes because of differences in sex development, or intersex conditions, which affect about 1% of the population. 

            Intersex conditions can involve external genitals that don’t match a person’s sex chromosomes. In one condition, testes develop internally but external genitals and breasts appear female. These babies are usually assigned female at birth, but their bodies will never produce eggs.

            “There’s variation,’’ Brandi said. “Not everyone fits into this exact box.’’

            Jae Moyer, a Kansas City-area activist, has a driver's license and birth certificate identifying them as male, although they identify as nonbinary. The Kansas measure feels designed to force them into “molds that I personally don’t fit into.”

            “They want to make sure that they’re taking every avenue possible to just erase who I am as a person,” Moyer said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811548,Manfred: MLB prepared for whatever happens with Diamond,"PHOENIX (AP) — Commissioner Rob Manfred said Major League Baseball is prepared for whatever happens to the financially troubled company that owns regional broadcast rights for 14 teams after Diamond Sports Group skipped about $140 million in interest payments due Wednesday.

            The missed payments by the parent company of 19 Bally Sports regional networks started a 30-day grace period that could be the prelude to a bankruptcy filing, possibly leading to changes in how televised games are made available to viewers. MLB hopes any upheaval leads to an end of local blackouts.

            “The company intends to use the 30-day grace period to continue progressing its ongoing discussions with creditors and other key stakeholders regarding potential strategic alternatives and deleveraging transactions to best position Diamond Sports Group for the future,” Diamond said in a statement.











            Diamond is a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., and its regional networks broadcasts games of 14 MLB, 16 NBA and 12 NHL teams.

            Manfred said Diamond has told MLB it intends to pay its baseball teams, but he called it an “unfolding story” that could change.

            “We are prepared no matter what happens with respect to Diamond to make sure the games are available to fans in their local markets,” he said. “We think it will be both linear in the traditional cable bundle and digitally on our own platforms, but that remains to be seen.”

            Diamond said as of Sept. 30 it had debt of $8.674 billion. It has nearly $1 billion in rights payments, mostly to baseball teams, due in the first quarter this year. 

            “Our Bally RSNs have been negatively impacted by elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced in part by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment and related uncertainties,"" Diamond said in its financial statement for the quarter ending Sept. 30. “These factors are expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenues and margins of our Bally RSNs.""

            Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s film and television assets to be approved.

            If Diamond Sports Group doesn't pay its MLB teams, Manfred said the clubs will terminate their contracts with the company.

            “We’ve been really clear that if Diamond doesn’t pay under every single one of the broadcast agreements, that creates a termination right, and our clubs will proceed to terminate those contracts,” Manfred said. 

            “In the event that MLB stepped in, what we would do is we would produce the games, we would make use of our asset with the MLB Network to do that, we would go directly to distributors, Comcast, Charter, the big distributors, and make an agreement to have those games distributed on cable networks,” he added. ""We would also be seeking flexibility on the digital side so that, when you look at MLB.TV, you could buy your out-of-market package like you always had but have the option to buy up into in-market games, something the fan has never had before, which I see as a huge improvement for fans.”

            Manfred said he sees a future for regional sports networks in cable bundles, but smaller than it was in its heyday.

            “It's really important for the game to preserve the economics in the remaining RSN cable bundle while developing a digital alternative that has more flexibility and gives us better reach in terms of getting to fans who want to watch and don't have the ability to watch,” he said. 

            If MLB does take over distribution from Diamond, Manfred said it would not be able to replace 100% of the revenue in the short term. Increasing distribution is MLB's goal.

            “Blackouts are the kind of opposite side of the coin of reach,"" he said. ""We need to deliver product to fans who want to watch on platforms that they customarily use at a realistic price. That is our No. 1 priority.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811549,Brazil police target illegal gold exports from the Amazon,"BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil’s Federal Police on Wednesday were carrying out a court order to seize more than 2 billion reais ($384 million) related to about 13 tons of gold mined illegally in the Amazon rainforest, then exported through an unnamed U.S.-based company.

            Police said in a statement they were also executing 27 search warrants and three arrest warrants in seven states and the Federal District related to the investigation. The operation forms part of a fresh crackdown on illegal Amazon gold mining in the wake of the government announcing a health emergency for Yanomami Indigenous people caused by prospectors.

            Gold extracted from the Amazon is usually brought to nearby cities and sold to financial brokers that are regulated by Brazil’s central bank. All that’s required to transform the raw ore into a tradable asset is a handwritten document attesting to the specific point in the rainforest where the gold was extracted, but which is virtually impossible for the broker to verify.











            The police statement said the criminal organization used shell companies to issue fraudulent receipts and lend the appearance of legality to purchases of gold in excess of 4 billion reais between 2020 and 2022.

            The unnamed American company sold the gold onward to buyers in Italy, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong.

            There has been increasing awareness that the current lack of transparency surrounding the purchase of gold contributes to illegality. This week, Brazil’s central bank told the Supreme Court that it is discussing a new system of oversight that would facilitate tracing the gold to its point of extraction, including adoption of electronic receipts.

            Yanomami adults and children have suffered malnourishment, disease and even death as a result of illegal gold mining on their land. Prospectors leave pools that become breeding grounds for mosquitoes that spread illness, and use mercury that pollutes water used for fishing.BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil’s Federal Police on Wednesday were carrying out a court order to seize more than 2 billion reais ($384 million) related to about 13 tons of gold mined illegally in the Amazon rainforest, then exported through an unnamed U.S.-based company.Police said in a statement they were also executing 27 search warrants and three arrest warrants in seven states and the Federal District related to the investigation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811550,Bolivian hospitals under strain as dengue kills dozens,"LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Hospitals in Bolivia’s eastern Santa Cruz region struggled Wednesday to keep up with an outbreak of dengue that has killed at least 26 people.

            It marks the largest outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease since the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the almost 7,000 cases detected since January have been in Santa Cruz, the country’s most populous region, where two of the most lethal variants of the illness have been detected.

            “The hospital is full, there’s no more space, patients sleep in the hall in order to be admitted,” Fredy Rojas, a pediatrician at the Santa Cruz Children’s Hospital, told a local radio station. “Many children get here in serious condition and there isn’t enough time to reverse the situation.”











            At least 26 people have died, Bolivia's health ministry said.

            Dengue causes flu-like symptoms that most people recover from, but also can rapidly lead to internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. There generally is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccines are available. 

            Dengue is endemic in Bolivia and proliferates in the country's east during its December-to-March rainy season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811551,Ukraine to boycott OSCE meeting in Vienna if Russia attends,"VIENNA (AP) — Ukraine has informed the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that it won't attend the next meeting of its parliamentary assembly if sanctioned Russian lawmakers are allowed to participate.

            The meeting is scheduled to take place in Vienna on Feb. 23-24, during the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

            In a letter obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Mykyta Poturaiev, wrote, “We do not find ourselves in a position to attend the winter meeting in case of Russia’s participation.”











            The letter, which was dated Feb. 10 and addressed to Parliamentary Assembly President Margareta Cederfelt, noted that Russia's decision to invade Ukraine was widely supported by Russian politicians, including members of the Russian delegation to the OSCE.

            “We have no doubts that the Russian delegation will use the OSCE ... for justification of the aggression against my country as well as for whitewashing numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against the Ukrainian people,” Poturaiev wrote.

            He suggested the meeting's postponement “to preserve the integrity of the assembly,” which is a separate body consisting of 323 parliamentarians from the OSCE’s 57 member states,

            The Vienna-based OSCE was created during the Cold War as a platform for dialogue between East and West. The group has a wide-ranging mission, including peace, human rights, arms control and other security issues. The invasion of Ukraine has complicated its work, with many Western countries joining Ukraine in protesting Russia’s participation.

            
                The Austrian government has granted visas to the Russian delegates to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly even though they are under European Union sanctions and despite protests from 20 countries including Britain, France and Canada. The Austrians said as host nation they were obliged to grant visas to representatives from all OSCE member states.

            After a meeting with members of the assembly and Ukrainian parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk on Tuesday, Cederfelt decided to go ahead with next week's meeting as planned, given the rules of the assembly which say the group's winter meeting needs to take place during the first two months of the year. 

            Nat Parry, a spokesperson for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, said it’s “too late” to postpone the gathering.

            Lithuania is so far the only other country to have announced publicly that it will boycott the meeting. Other nations are still weighing their options. Latvia will decide Thursday, Katrina Kaktina, the country’s ambassador to the OSCE, told the AP.

The cause of death has not been revealed but Leicestershire police said it was ""not being treated as suspicious.""Ian Smith, the principal of Brooke House College, said it was ""devastated"" and the college community ""deeply saddened and shaken"" by his death.""We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand,"" he added.The head of the Zico Foundation, former Thai national team captain and coach Kiatisuk Senamuang, said in an online news conference that he did not know the cause of death and that Dom had apparently been in good health.Dom's mother, who joined the online news conference, said she hoped a Buddhist monk in England could conduct rites for Dom so his spirit would not be trapped where he died according to Buddhist beliefs.Dom was the captain of the Wild Boars, a youth football team in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai.Twelve members of the team aged 11 to 16 and their coach were exploring the Tham Luang cave complex in June 2018 when they were trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters.They were found nine days later in a flooded chamber 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the entrance of the caves. It was another eight days before all were safely rescued.The story of the Wild Boars made headlines across the globe and has since inspired movies, documentaries and books.dh/rs (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/2/15,,

            Colorado was 68-94 last season, 43 games behind the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Rockies added Hensley Meulens as hitting coach and Warren Schaeffer as third base and infield coach.

            The Rockies didn’t make major offseason moves. Instead, they’re banking on a bounce-back season from outfielder Kris Bryant, who was limited to 42 games due to injuries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811557,El Salvador extends special powers in fight against gangs,"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador’s congress has approved President Nayib Bukele’s request to extend the period of special powers for another month, meaning the country will go at least a full year with some fundamental rights suspended in fight against gangs.

            Justice and Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro said the state of exception would continue until the last gang member is captured.

            “The historic results achieved in security confirm for us that we’re on the right path, transforming the country,” Villatoro told lawmakers.











            The Legislative Assembly voted 67 in favor to six opposed late Tuesday night. Eight lawmakers abstained and three did not attend.

            After a surge in gang violence in March 2022, in which 62 people were killed in a single day across the country, Bukele requested the special powers to pursue the gangs. 

            Street gangs had long plagued El Salvador, stifling the economy with oppressive extortion rackets and displacing thousands within the country and abroad through violence.

            Under the special powers, the right to association is suspended, police don’t have to tell someone being arrested the reason or inform them of their rights. Someone arrested does not have a right to a lawyer and can be held for 15 days without seeing a judge rather than the previous 72 hours. 

            Villatoro said more than 64,000 people had been arrested so far and more than 57,000 of them were in jail awaiting pending formal charges or trial. 

            Civil and human rights organizations have criticized the situation, citing widespread abuses, including deaths of dozens in detention.

            Bukele has rejected such criticism, noting that the measures have broad support in El Salvador, violence has dropped precipitously and people are returning to neighborhoods that were long controlled by the gangs.

            Last year, El Salvador reported 495 homicides, the lowest figure in recent decades. The official number did not include at least 120 suspected gang members killed in confrontations with authorities.

            The government recently unveiled a massive new prison they could eventually hold 40,000 gang membrs. 

            Villatoro said the gang members incarcerated there “are never going to return to our communities, it is President Nayib Bukele’s promise.”SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador’s congress has approved President Nayib Bukele’s request to extend the period of special powers for another month, meaning the country will go at least a full year with some fundamental rights suspended in fight against gangs.Justice and Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro said the state of exception would continue until the last gang member is captured.“The historic results achieved in security confirm for us that we’re on the right path, transforming the country,” Villatoro told lawmakers.The Legislative Assembly voted 67 in favor to six opposed late Tuesday night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811558,"Things to know about Nikki Haley, GOP presidential hopeful","CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Republican Nikki Haley joined the 2024 race for president this week, becoming the first major rival to former President Donald Trump in a field that is expected to grow in coming months. Here are some things to know about the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations:

            ‘I WAS DIFFERENT’

            Haley, 51, grew up in the small rural community of Bamberg, South Carolina, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Raised in the Sikh faith by a father who wore a turban and a mother who wore a sari, she has described enduring racist taunts and feeling like she didn't fit in, an experience she says had an impact on on her personal and political life. In a video announcing her presidential bid, Haley referenced that past, saying she grew up “not Black, not white — I was different.” She also insisted — as she has in past speeches — that America is not a racist country. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” she said in her formal announcement Wednesday. 











            ___

            NOTABLE FIRSTS

            Before becoming South Carolina governor, Haley was an accountant and served in the state House of Representatives. In her first campaign in 2004, she defeated the state’s longest-serving House member. Three terms later, she made a longshot bid for governor and defeated a field of more veteran politicians to become the first woman and first Indian American to lead South Carolina. At 38, she also was the nation's youngest governor. Haley is the first woman to be a major candidate for president in 2024, and just the fifth Republican woman this century. 

            ___

            ‘DIVISIVE SYMBOL’

            Haley's biggest moment on the national stage as governor came during her second term, when a self-avowed white supremacist who had been pictured holding Confederate flags murdered nine Black parishioners as they gathered for Bible study in a Charleston church. For years before the 2015 killings, Haley had resisted calls to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds, even casting a rival’s push for its removal as a desperate stunt. But after the massacre and with the support of other leading Republicans, Haley advocated for legislation to remove the flag. It came down less than a month after the murders. 

            Haley later faced criticism for telling conservative host Glen Beck in a 2019 interview that the Charleston shooter “hijacked” the ideals many connected to the flag, including the “service, and sacrifice and heritage” it meant to some. After many responded saying that the flag represented treason and racial hatred, Haley said in a statement on Twitter that she stood by her call to remove it. In a 2020 speech to the Republican National Convention that followed weeks of protests alleging racial injustice by police, Haley called the flag a “divisive symbol” that was removed peacefully.

            HISTORY WITH TRUMP

            Haley has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Trump, going from harsh critic to ardent supporter and now a 2024 rival. 

            During the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Haley supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. She later backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811559,Bill raising abortion to homicide draws Republican pushback,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Newly filed legislation allowing illegal abortions to be prosecuted as homicides drew a quick pushback Wednesday from the state's anti-abortion attorney general, who warned it would wrongly subject Kentucky women to charges for terminating pregnancies.

            Republican state Rep. Emily Callaway raised the stakes in the state's bitter abortion debates when she introduced the measure Tuesday in a state where most abortions are currently banned.

            The freshman lawmaker's proposal would subject illegal abortions to the “same legal principles as would apply to the homicide of a person who had been born alive.” The bill would expand the definition of a human being to include an “unborn child.”











            Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is running for governor, responded Wednesday that the bill “strikes the wrong balance” and urged the GOP-led legislature to reject it.

            “If adopted by the General Assembly, this bill would allow pregnant mothers who have an abortion to be criminally charged and prosecuted with homicide,” Cameron said in a statement from his office that also touted his anti-abortion credentials.

            So far, the highly charged abortion issue has mostly been on the back burner in this year's legislative session in the Bluegrass State. Lawmakers are awaiting a ruling by Kentucky's Supreme Court in a case revolving around the constitutionality of the state's near-total abortion ban.

            The state’s trigger law outlawing nearly all abortions is being challenged. It took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Kentucky law carved out narrow exceptions to save a pregnant woman’s life or prevent disabling injury.

            Kentucky's Republican House speaker, David Osborne, said Wednesday that he anticipates other abortion-related legislation being introduced in the coming days, including proposals that would provide further exceptions when abortion would be legal.

            Osborne gave a chilly response to Callaway's proposal to prosecute abortions as homicides. He said Kentucky lawmakers have “never passed a ‘pro-life’ measure that did not take into consideration the necessity for any exceptions, nor has this House majority caucus ever contemplated doing so.”

            Republicans have supermajorities in both the Kentucky House and Senate.

            The state's trigger law targets doctors for prosecution for providing abortions in violation of state law, but pregnant women who receive abortions are not subject to prosecution. But the new bill introduced by Callaway did not appear to make exceptions for pregnant people.

            Her bill would exempt abortions necessary to prevent a pregnant woman's death. It includes other exceptions for a “spontaneous miscarriage;” or for abortions provided only after “all reasonable alternatives to save the life of the unborn child are unavailable or were attempted unsuccessfully.""

            The measure would give the attorney general's office concurrent jurisdiction along with local prosecutors in prosecuting illegal abortions as homicides.

            Cameron, in the midst of this year's hotly contested GOP primary campaign for governor, immediately distanced himself from the proposal.

            “While I strongly support prohibiting abortions in Kentucky, I just as strongly support helping pregnant women,"" Cameron said. “Pregnant mothers deserve our help, support and life-affirming options, not to face criminal charges.”

            Cameron's office has defended the trigger law and a separate six-week state abortion ban in legal challenges that reached the state's highest court.FRANKFORT, Ky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811560,Bill to set annual remembrance for Marshall plane crash,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A bill has won final legislative approval in West Virginia that would establish an annual day of recognition for the worst sports disaster in U.S. history, a plane crash that killed most of Marshall University's football team.

            On Nov. 14, 1970, the chartered jet crashed in fog and rain into a hillside upon approach to an airport near Huntington as the team was returning from a game at East Carolina, killing all 75 on board. The victims included 36 football players and 39 school administrators, coaches, fans, spouses and flight crew.

            Marshall decided to continue the football program. But for the university and the entire community, it left a huge void. Some who were left off the flight and did not make the trip or lost loved ones spent the next five decades with crippling questions that had no answers.











            The bill establishes that Nov. 14 will become a ""special memorial day"" in remembrance of the crash.

            Prior to the state Senate’s unanimous vote Wednesday, the chamber held a moment of silence for the crash victims at the request of Upshur County Republican Sen. Bill Hamilton. The House of Delegates passed the bill last month.

            Cabell County Democratic Sen. Mike Woelfel said he was 17 years old driving in his car in Huntington when news of the crash came on the radio. 

            “Just like winter leads to spring, these bad memories now lead us to, I think, a day of celebration,” Woelfel said. “I’m glad that we’re going to honor them for each year in this way from here on out.""

            Wayne County Democratic Sen. Robert Plymale was 15 at the time and was with friends in Kenova, near the airport. It was raining hard, and he remembered seeing ambulances speeding past the group.

            Plymale said his mother was a professor at Marshall. Four of the crash victims were students in her class, and Marshall faculty were sent to attend the funerals. Plymale's mother attended a funeral in North Carolina, and her family became close friends with the victim’s family. 

            Plymale said 64 children lost one or both of their parents in the crash. 

            Among them were Dr. Ray Hagley, who was a Marshall team physician, and his wife. They left behind six children who were being babysat by Dan D'Antoni, a 23-year-old assistant with the Marshall basketball program in 1970. D'Antoni is now Marshall's basketball coach. 

            “This goes deep,” Plymale said. “It really sort of shapes the fiber in you, of what you are.”

            Six weeks before the Marshall tragedy, a plane carrying members of the Wichita State football team crashed in Colorado, killing 31 people. 

            Among those who were not on the Marshall plane were Red Dawson, an assistant coach who was driving on a recruiting trip and was heading home when he learned about the crash. The following offseason, Dawson went to a national coaching convention. He recalled talking at length with some of his counterparts at Wichita State, and how they leaned on each other for support.

            While Wichita State ended its football program in 1986, Marshall carried on. 

            Jack Lengyel was hired as the new coach in 1971. Marshall won just two games, and the first winning season didn’t come for another 13 years. Then success occurred in streaks. Marshall captured Division I-AA national championships in 1992 and 1996 and amassed the most wins of any team in the nation in the 1990s, many of them during a step up to Division I-A, now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision. 

            The rebuilding was the subject of the 2006 movie “We are Marshall” starring Matthew McConaughey as Lengyel. 

            Woelfel, who had a speaking part in the movie, said it ""brought a lot of people back together to deal with the loss and they did it collectively. So I think this is another step along in that healing process.”CHARLESTON, W.Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811562,Oregon joins debate over police education requirements,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Amid a renewed nationwide focus on police qualifications following the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, an Oregon lawmaker has introduced a bill that would require law enforcement officers to complete at least two years of higher education.

            Police departments have wrestled for years with officer education requirements. Many say that raising them would worsen current staffing shortages and make it harder to recruit candidates from diverse backgrounds. But reform advocates say that continuing education past high school can equip officers with critical life skills that could help improve their interactions with the public.

            “You’re learning, you’re reading about other communities, you’re reading about other people, you’re getting a sense of respect for people who you do not know, communities that you do not know,” said Democratic Oregon state Sen. Lew Frederick, the bill’s chief sponsor. 











            The bill, which was introduced last month, would push back against the recent trend of lowering police hiring standards by requiring two years of higher education for departments with less than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would apply to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers.

            The bill would set police education requirements in state law. Generally, these requirements are determined by municipalities or individual departments.

            Nationwide, about 80% of police agencies only require a high school or GED diploma, according to a 2016 survey of more than 2,700 agencies by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The number requiring a two-year degree hovers around 10%, while just over 1% require a bachelor’s degree. 

            Many police agencies that do have college credit requirements waive them if a candidate has military or law enforcement experience. These include departments in major cities, such as New York City, Dallas and Washington, D.C. Tulsa's police department is among the few requiring a bachelor's degree.

            Many agencies, however, have dropped degree requirements in recent years because of recruitment difficulties stemming partly from a crisis of public trust, according to the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank. Its executive director, Chuck Wexler, said that while many departments may want more educated entry-level officers, they can't raise the bar when a shrunken hiring pool means they already have less applicants to choose from.

            “The combination of the pandemic, the George Floyd murder and the narrative of policing has made policing less attractive than ever,” he said. “The recent killing of Tyre Nichols only adds to the concerns that people are having about the policing profession.”

            While a college education doesn’t automatically make a good officer, it can help people develop critical thinking and communication skills, Wexler said.

            “I think merely requiring a high school degree is hugely inadequate for the complexities associated with a very complicated and important position in America,"" he said.

            The Portland Police Bureau in Oregon is among the agencies that have struggled to recruit. The city was gripped by months-long protests in 2020 following the racial justice demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death, and has seen record numbers of homicides the past two years.

            The police bureau only requires a high school or GED diploma. But that minimum requirement, it says, doesn’t necessarily result in hiring candidates with less education. While testifying against the Oregon bill on Tuesday, PPB Capt. Greg Pashley said that about 70% of the bureau's sworn employees have a bachelor's degree or higher, and that 46% of applicants have a two-year degree or higher.

            Echoing other agencies around the country, he also said that requiring college courses excludes lower-income candidates who aren’t able to afford them and makes police forces less diverse. 

            “Arbitrary requirements such as a four-year degree would have a chilling effect on potential applicants, including applicants of color, who may not have had educational opportunities growing up but who, as adults, have established themselves as dedicated servants in their community,"" Pashley said. “Undoubtedly, education is valuable. But it shouldn’t be a litmus test for public service.""

            Even if it’s not mandated, many police officers choose to pursue higher education in order to be eligible for higher salaries or promotions. About a third of law enforcement officers have at least a four-year degree, according to a 2017 survey conducted by the National Policing Institute and California State University, Fullerton.

            There is research showing that officers with more education are more likely to resolve conflict without resorting to coercion, said William Terrill, criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University.

            “In terms of handling conflictual situations, those with an education seem to be able to problem solve without relying on force to the same extent,” he said.

            The training that police receive once hired, however, can be just as important as education, Terrill said. But training only lasts a few months and often focuses on tactical and mechanical skills—“how to handcuff, how to tase”—rather than critical thinking exercises, he said.

            “In many respects, I think the issue is much bigger than a four-year or two-year requirement,” he said. “If they have two years of education, and they get six months of academy, we’re still putting someone out there, with half a year of training, with a gun and the ability to take life and handcuffs with the ability to take liberty.”

            Another hearing for the Oregon bill has yet to be scheduled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811565,"Corbin Burnes, Brady Singer lose in salary arbitration","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Two-time All-Star Corbin Burnes and Brady Singer lost in salary arbitration on Wednesday.

            Burnes will receive $10.01 million from the Milwaukee Brewers rather than his $10.75 million request, Melinda Gordon, Jules Bloch and Keith Greenberg ruled one day after hearing arguments.

            Singer will get $2.95 million rather than $3,325,000 from the Kansas City Royals, according to the decision by Howard Edelman, Walt De Treux and Brian Keller.











            Teams have a 5-3 lead in decisions.

            Three players went to hearings on Wednesday: Los Angeles Angels infielder Gio Urshela ($10 million vs. $8.4 million), St. Louis Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley ($3 million vs. $2.15 million) and Arizona Diamondbacks infielder Josh Rojas ($2.9 million vs. $2,575,000).

            Five other players await pending decisions and four more have possible hearings.

            Burnes, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 12-8 with a 2.94 ERA last year and made a career-best 33 starts, which tied for most in the major leagues. He led the National League with 243 strikeouts, second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole at 257. Burnes earned $6.55 million.

            He won the 2021 NL Cy Young Award after leading the majors with a 2.43 ERA. He went 11-5 for the Brewers that year.

            A five-year veteran, Burnes is 35-19 with a 3.21 ERA. He is eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series.

            Singer, a 26-year-old right-hander, was 10-5 with a 3.23 ERA in 24 starts and three relief appearances last year, when he had a salary of $726,250. He was optioned to Triple-A Omaha on April 28 and recalled on May 17.

            Singer was eligible for arbitration for the first time.

            All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta earlier, outfielder Kyle Tucker ($5 million) was beaten by Houston and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle.

            Left-hander Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat Miami, and reliever Jason Adam ($1,775,000) defeated Tampa Bay.

            The 31-year-old Urshela hit .285 with 13 homers and 64 RBIs last season for Minnesota, which traded him to the Angels on Nov. 18 for minor league right-hander Alejandro Hidalgo. Urshela earned $6.55 million.

            His case was heard by Fredric Horowitz, Jeanne Charles and Stephen Raymond.

            Urshela is primarily a third baseman. He has a .275 batting average with 62 homers and 256 RBIs in parts of seven seasons with Cleveland (2015, ’17), Toronto (2018), the Yankees (2019-21) and the Twins. He is eligible for free agency after this year's World Series.

            Helsley, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 9-1 with a 1.25 ERA and 19 saves in 23 chances over 54 relief appearances, earning $722,450 . He struck out 94 and walked 20 in 64 2/3 innings. His case was heard by Bloch, Jeanne Vonhof and John Woods.

            Rojas, also 28, set career bests with a .269 average and 56 RBIs while hitting nine home runs. He earned $730,900. Rojas' case was heard by Keller, Mark Burstein and Scott Buchheit.

            Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe and infielder Luis Rengifo await decisions along with Rays pitchers Colin Poche and Ryan Thompson, and Tampa Bay outfielder Harold Ramírez.

            Seattle outfielder Teoscar Hernández, Pittsburgh first baseman Ji-Man Choi, Cardinals left-hander Génesis Cabrera and Philadelphia reliever Seranthony Domínguez have possible hearings this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811566,Rep. Gaetz says no charges for him in sex trafficking case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican known for his strong support of former President Donald Trump and membership in the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said Wednesday that the Justice Department has ended a sex trafficking case with no charges against him.

            The lawmaker who represents much of the Florida Panhandle issued a statement through his congressional office that the long-running investigation was over. Gaetz had insisted throughout he was innocent of any wrongdoing.

            “The Department of Justice has confirmed to Congressman Gaetz’s attorneys that their investigation has concluded and that he will not be charged with any crimes,” the statement said.











             A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The development was first reported by CNN.

            While he is a relatively junior member of Congress, Gaetz has gained national attention through his frequent cable news appearances in recent years in which he offered an unvarnished defense of Trump. But few Republicans had rushed to support him as the investigation unfolded and shadowed his career, and some treated him like a pariah.

            Just last month, Gaetz again ran afoul of his fellow Republicans, when he was among a group of hard-right conservatives who opposed GOP leader Kevin McCarthy’s bid for the House speakership and who forced McCarthy to a record 15 ballots. At one point, Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican ally of McCarthy, angrily confronted Gaetz on the House floor, telling Gaetz that he would regret his decision. Lawmakers yelled in disbelief as Rogers was held back by a colleague. McCarthy eventually prevailed in the speaker's race.

            Federal prosecutors were investigating whether Gaetz and onetime political ally Joel Greenberg paid underage girls and escorts or offered them gifts in exchange for sex, according to two people familiar with the case who were not authorized to public discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

            Greenberg, a fellow Republican who served as the tax collector in Florida's Seminole County, admitted as part of a plea deal with prosecutors that he paid women and an underage girl to have sex with him and other men. The men were not identified in court documents when he pleaded guilty.

            
                Greenberg was sentenced in late 2022 to 11 years in federal prison for a variety of crimes.

            Federal investigators were looking into a trip that Gaetz took to the Bahamas with a group of women and Jason Pirozzolo, a hand surgeon and Gaetz campaign donor, and whether the women were paid or received gifts to have sex with the men, said a person familiar with the matter.

            David Haas, a lawyer for Pirozzolo, said in a statement Wednesday that he received a similar notification from the Justice Department about the investigation being closed.

            “Dr. Pirozzolo requests that he and his family’s privacy be respected as the last few years have been extremely difficult to endure,” Haas said.

            Prosecutors had also been investigating whether Gaetz and his associates tried to secure government jobs for some of the women, the people said. Prosecutors were scrutinizing Gaetz’s connections to the medical marijuana sector, including whether his associates sought to influence legislation Gaetz sponsored.

            The House ethics committee in April 2021 announced an investigation into Gaetz. The opening of that bipartisan inquiry was one of the first official indications that Gaetz’s party leaders were willing to scrutinize his actions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811567,"CBO projects higher unemployment, slow exit from inflation","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that it expects the U.S. economy to stagnate this year with the unemployment rate jumping to 5.1% — a bleak outlook that was paired with a 10-year projection that publicly held U.S. debt would nearly double to $46.4 trillion in 2033.

            The office's updated 10-year Budget and Economic Outlook outlined stark expectations for the decade ahead, where Social Security would be unable to pay full benefits to recipients in 2032 — with a roughly 20 percent reduction in benefits across the board — and the net interest costs on U.S. debt would eclipse what the nation spends on defense.

            “The debt trajectory is unsustainable,” CBO director Phillip Swagel told journalists at a press conference after the report's afternoon release. The CBO can't tell Congress what to do, he said, ”but at some point, something has to give — whether it’s on spending or revenue.""











            The latest figures seemed to affirm the worst fears of many U.S. consumers and businesses. But in a reminder that the U.S. economy has seldom behaved as anticipated through the pandemic and its aftermath, the employment forecast looks very different from the pace of hiring so far this year.

            The CBO estimated that just 108,000 jobs will be added in 2023, but employers added 517,000 jobs in January alone. It also assumes that inflation will ease from 6.4% to 4.8% this year, far more pessimistic than Federal Reserve officials who in December said inflation would fall to 3.5%.

            The CBO separately pointed to the risks of not increasing the government's legal borrowing authority, noting that the Treasury Department could exhaust its current “extraordinary measures” to keep the government running while President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy jostle over a deal.

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote to congressional leadership last month, stating that her agency will use creative accounting measures to buy time until Congress can pass legislation that will either raise the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority or suspend it again for a period of time.

            If tax receipts from this year’s filing season fall short of estimated amounts, the U.S. could hit its statutory debt ceiling earlier than July, according to the nonpartisan organization, which provides independent analyses of budget and economic issues to Congress.

            Following the CBO issuing its report, Senate Democrats reiterated their calls for Republicans to help pass legislation to increase the nation’s borrowing authority. Then, they said, lawmakers could turn their attention to funding the government and addressing the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.

            “We don’t want to cut benefits. We don’t want to privatize. We don’t want to do the kinds of things that Republicans have talked about in that area,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of Social Security. “And we have some plans to make it solvent, which you’ll hear from down the road.”

            Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, said the report “paints a dire picture.”

            “If we don’t get serious about reining in spending, reducing annual budget deficits and bringing down the debt, the country will end up spending more on interest payments than the programs that actually benefit Americans,” Grassley said.

            The outlook warns about rising yearly budget deficits. In 2033, the CBO anticipates that the yearly shortfall in tax revenues relative to spending would exceed $2.85 trillion, more than double the deficit in 2022. Publicly held debt was roughly equal to U.S. gross domestic product in 2022, but it would climb to 118% of GDP by 2033.

            The office says the biggest drivers of rising debt in relation to GDP are increasing interest costs and spending for Medicare and Social Security.

            The two parties also engaged in blaming the other side for the rising deficit projections. Republicans blamed Democrats for spending too much during the Biden presidency and Democrats blamed Republican for the tax cuts undertaken during the Trump presidency.

            “Biden’s numerous bailouts and massive government expansion disguised as COVID relief has blown out spending and exacerbated our debt disaster,” said Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee. “House Republicans must rein-in the unbridled spending and restore fiscal sanity in Washington before it’s too late.”

            Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Republicans “deliberately” made the deficit worse during the Trump presidency with “massive revenue losses because they lowered tax rates for their corporate and billionaire friends and donors.”

            One reason why the CBO expects a slowdown this year are the actions taken by the Fed. The U.S. central bank has been trying to reduce inflation by raising its benchmark interest rates. Earlier this month the Fed raised its key interest rate a quarter-point, its eighth hike since March of last year.

            The CBO expects growth to pick up once the Fed has tamed inflation and pulls back on its benchmark rates.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that it expects the U.S. economy to stagnate this year with the unemployment rate jumping to 5.1% — a bleak outlook that was paired with a 10-year projection that publicly held U.S. debt would nearly double to $46.4 trillion in 2033.The office's updated 10-year Budget and Economic Outlook outlined stark expectations for the decade ahead, where Social Security would be unable to pay full benefits to recipients in 2032 — with a roughly 20 percent reduction in benefits across the board — and the net interest costs on U.S. debt would eclipse what the nation spends on defense.“The debt trajectory is unsustainable,” CBO director Phillip Swagel told journalists at a press conference after the report's afternoon release. The CBO can't tell Congress what to do, he said, ”but at some point, something has to give — whether it’s on spending or revenue.""The latest figures seemed to affirm the worst fears of many U.S. consumers and businesses. But in a reminder that the U.S. economy has seldom behaved as anticipated through the pandemic and its aftermath, the employment forecast looks very different from the pace of hiring so far this year.The CBO estimated that just 108,000 jobs will be added in 2023, but employers added 517,000 jobs in January alone. It also assumes that inflation will ease from 6.4% to 4.8% this year, far more pessimistic than Federal Reserve officials who in December said inflation would fall to 3.5%.The CBO separately pointed to the risks of not increasing the government's legal borrowing authority, noting that the Treasury Department could exhaust its current “extraordinary measures” to keep the government running while President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy jostle over a deal.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote to congressional leadership last month, stating that her agency will use creative accounting measures to buy time until Congress can pass legislation that will either raise the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority or suspend it again for a period of time.If tax receipts from this year’s filing season fall short of estimated amounts, the U.S. could hit its statutory debt ceiling earlier than July, according to the nonpartisan organization, which provides independent analyses of budget and economic issues to Congress.Following the CBO issuing its report, Senate Democrats reiterated their calls for Republicans to help pass legislation to increase the nation’s borrowing authority. Then, they said, lawmakers could turn their attention to funding the government and addressing the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.“We don’t want to cut benefits. We don’t want to privatize. We don’t want to do the kinds of things that Republicans have talked about in that area,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of Social Security. “And we have some plans to make it solvent, which you’ll hear from down the road.”Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, said the report “paints a dire picture.”“If we don’t get serious about reining in spending, reducing annual budget deficits and bringing down the debt, the country will end up spending more on interest payments than the programs that actually benefit Americans,” Grassley said.The outlook warns about rising yearly budget deficits. In 2033, the CBO anticipates that the yearly shortfall in tax revenues relative to spending would exceed $2.85 trillion, more than double the deficit in 2022. Publicly held debt was roughly equal to U.S. gross domestic product in 2022, but it would climb to 118% of GDP by 2033.The office says the biggest drivers of rising debt in relation to GDP are increasing interest costs and spending for Medicare and Social Security.The two parties also engaged in blaming the other side for the rising deficit projections. Republicans blamed Democrats for spending too much during the Biden presidency and Democrats blamed Republican for the tax cuts undertaken during the Trump presidency.“Biden’s numerous bailouts and massive government expansion disguised as COVID relief has blown out spending and exacerbated our debt disaster,” said Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee. “House Republicans must rein-in the unbridled spending and restore fiscal sanity in Washington before it’s too late.”Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Republicans “deliberately” made the deficit worse during the Trump presidency with “massive revenue losses because they lowered tax rates for their corporate and billionaire friends and donors.”One reason why the CBO expects a slowdown this year are the actions taken by the Fed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811568,"India beats W. Indies, Muneeba hits 1st T20 100 for Pakistan","CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Teenage wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh guided India to a second victory in two games at the Women's T20 World Cup on Wednesday as her effective finishing overshadowed the return of star Smriti Mandhana.

            Opener Mandhana, who became the most expensive player at this week's Women's Premier League auction, was out for 10 on her comeback from a finger injury as India chased the West Indies' modest 118-6 at Newlands in Cape Town.

            India was 43-3 in the eighth over when the 19-year-old Ghosh arrived at the crease, and she stroked five fours in her 44 not out and constructed a 72-run stand with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (33) to take their team home for a six-wicket win with 11 balls to spare.











            Kaur was out just before the end, leaving Ghosh to smack a short ball through square leg for four for the winning runs. India made 119-4.

            Muneeba Ali, another wicketkeeper-batter, hit the first T20 international century by a Pakistan woman and her 102 from 68 balls set up a dominant 70-run win over Ireland in the day's second game.

            It was a convincing all-around performance from Pakistan as its 165-5 was way too much for Ireland, which was all out for 95 in 16.3 overs. Pakistan's spinners collected nine of the 10 Irish wickets, led by left-armer Nashra Sandhu's 4-18.

            After its win, India went level with England at the top of Group 2, with the English in first place on net run rate. Those two will meet in a top-of-the table match on Saturday, the highest profile game at the tournament so far.

            India beat Pakistan in its opening game, when Ghosh also showed her value with 31 not out to help seal victory.

            ""She (Ghosh) has been great for us,"" Kaur said. ""She is someone who can always pull the game for us. She is a very dangerous batter. She can express herself. We are happy with the results and the next game is very important. (We) just want to continue the rhythm.”

            A partnership of 73 for the second wicket between Stafanie Taylor (42) and Shemaine Campbelle (30) seemed likely to set West Indies up for a good total but the late-innings acceleration never came.

            India spinner Deepti Sharma claimed both their wickets in her 3-15 and West Indies struggled from a good position at 77-1 to a below-par total.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811572,Alaska carbon plan: Boost state coffers without cutting oil,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Oil-dependent Alaska has long sought ways to fatten its coffers and move away from the fiscal whiplash of oil’s boom-and-bust cycles.

            The newest idea, promoted by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, would have the state capitalize on its oil and gas expertise to tap into a developing industry — carbon storage — as a way to generate new revenues without curtailing the extraction industries that underpin Alaska's economy. It's also being pitched as a potential way for petroleum and mining companies to head off legal challenges over greenhouse gas impacts.

            Hearings with state lawmakers are underway on legislation that would charge companies rent and fees for carbon dioxide storage deep underground in places like the Cook Inlet oil and gas basin. Hearings are coming on another bill that would enable Alaska to set up programs so companies could buy credits to offset their emissions. While details are few, such so-called “carbon offset” proposals sometimes include letting trees stand that otherwise might have been logged with the idea that the carbon stays stored in the trees so a company can pollute elsewhere. 











            Dunleavy said the state could ultimately earn billions annually without raising taxes on industry or Alaska residents. Alaskans currently receive yearly checks from the state’s oil-wealth fund and pay no statewide sales or personal income taxes. 

            “The reason we landed on this is it doesn't gore any ox, and more importantly, it's in line with what Alaska does, and that's resources,” Dunleavy said, underscoring the idea that the plan, as laid out, wouldn't harm existing interests.

            But some environmentalists say the state, which has a front-row seat to the ravages of climate change, should be focused more on investing in renewables and green projects. Many of the oil companies operating in Alaska have emissions reductions targets, but the state itself has no overarching climate plan or emissions reduction goals. 

            The governor “will be the first person to tell you it doesn’t have anything to do with climate change, and it doesn’t have anything to do with solving Alaska’s energy needs,” said Matt Jackson, climate program manager with the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. 

            It’s unclear exactly how much money Alaska could reap from the proposals, and there are still many questions around ideas such as the potential for other states or countries to ship in carbon dioxide for underground storage. Alaska officials for now have emphasized they want to prepare a regulatory framework for future carbon storage. 

            Shipping carbon dioxide is being analyzed in parts of the world. A project in Norway aims to ship carbon dioxide captured at European industrial sites and pump it into the seabed in Norway, according to the International Energy Agency. Japan is working on shipping technology.

            Lawmakers in Alaska want to find experts who can help them analyze Dunleavy's proposals, said state Rep. Ben Carpenter, who chairs the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee. Carpenter said finding people with the experience necessary has been a challenge. It’s not clear if Dunleavy’s proposals will gain traction during the current legislative session. 

            Alaska is rich in traditional resources — oil, gas, minerals and timber — and is home to a largely intact forest the size of West Virginia that is estimated to hold more carbon than any other U.S. national forest. But Alaska is also feeling the impacts of climate change: coastal erosion threatening Indigenous villages, unusual wildfires, thinning sea ice and permafrost that threatens to release carbon as it melts. 

            Dunleavy’s plan would give the Department of Natural Resources, which manages state lands for development including oil leasing, authority to implement carbon offset programs and would set up protocols for underground injection and mass storage of carbon dioxide.

            Alaska’s concept echoes efforts in other fossil fuel-dependent states to capitalize on carbon offsets and sequestration or other emissions-reducing technologies while continuing to support the traditional industries they’ve long relied on, such as oil, gas or coal. 

            The proposal for underground storage would also offer a way for companies to mitigate emissions that might otherwise tie a project up in court, said Aaron O'Quinn with the state Division of Oil and Gas.

            Cook Inlet, the state’s oldest-producing oil and gas basin near Anchorage, could serve as an underground storage site for carbon dioxide pollution from other states or even countries, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. The agency also said federal tax credits aimed at spurring carbon storage could provide a boost for a long-hoped-for liquefied natural gas project. 

            As part of its plan, Alaska wants to get authority from federal regulators for oversight of carbon injection wells, something North Dakota and Wyoming have already secured and that other states, like Louisiana, are pursuing or interested in. 

            An Iowa-based company working with Midwest ethanol plants is pursuing a $4.5 billion carbon dioxide pipeline project that would store the gas underground in North Dakota. The idea has gotten pushback from some landowners. In Wyoming, a state law requires utilities to evaluate getting at least some of their electricity from power plants fitted with carbon capture equipment, but utility reports suggest such retrofitting could cost hundreds of millions of dollars per plant with the expense showing up in higher electricity bills. Wyoming's governor, Republican Mark Gordon, has vowed to make the coal state carbon negative, in part by trapping the carbon dioxide emitted by the state's coal-fired power plants and pumping it underground. 

            ConocoPhillips Alaska, Alaska’s largest oil producer, is among the companies that have expressed interest in Dunleavy’s carbon plan but said it is too early to make any commitments. 

            The company is pursuing an oil project on Alaska's far-northern edge that it says could produce up to 180,000 barrels (29 million liters) of oil a day. Environmentalists call the Willow oil project a “ carbon bomb "" that could lead to more development in the region if approved by the federal government. A decision could come by early March. 

            Alaska officials see perhaps the most immediate carbon opportunities on forest lands. Several Alaska Native corporations have made money through the sale of credits to let trees go unlogged, and the University of Alaska system is proposing a carbon credits program on some lands it manages as a revenue generator.

            A report commissioned by the Department of Natural Resources identified three “high potential” carbon offset pilot projects on state forest lands, pegging the revenue potential for all three around $80 million over 10 years. The department said the report was limited in scope.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811573,Pritzker calls for universal preschool in Illinois by 2027,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for making preschool available to every 3- and 4-year-old in Illinois within four years, arguing that the state's improved financial picture allows it to not only invest in early education but also take on such problems as homelessness and hunger.

            “Smart Start Illinois,” the name given to the preschool program, makes good on a Pritzker campaign promise last year when he easily won a second term amid speculation of a future White House run. It would start with a $440 million investment to bring 5,000 additional children into the program this fall.

            The program's introduction followed quickly on the governor's boasts of tens of billions of dollars in debt elimination he and lawmakers accomplished in his first term after a disastrous two-year budget stalemate between Democrats who control the Legislature and his Republican predecessor.











            “Today, I ask you to partner with me once again — this time on the long-term investment that has the greatest return for taxpayers with the most positive social and economic impact I have ever come to you with...,"" Pritzker said of the early learning program. “It will make our state the best place in the nation to raise young children.”

            With annual increases in spending — although smaller than in the initial year — the program would ultimately make room for the approximately 20,000 children whose families desire pre-K but can't enroll their children for lack of space.

            Of the $440 million first-year payout, $75 million would go toward the existing account funding pre-K, a 12.5% increase in the budget that currently serves 89,000 kids. That funds space for the additional 5,000 learners, all outside of Chicago, which has its own preschool plan.

            Democrats praised Pritzker's vision, saying he understands that while the fiscal picture is bright today, there are forecasts for a downturn, prompting the governor to show restraint.

            “What was laid out in the budget today were increases that show a nice amount of fiscal discipline,” said the House speaker pro tempore, Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth of Peoria. “We need to talk about the necessity to move forward while making the proper investments.""

            House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel of Evanston noted research Pritzker relies on showing the benefits of early schooling, including estimates that it provides a potential $7 return for each $1 in spending.

            “These are investments that make a lot of a sense at a time when we have some funds and we don't know what the future brings,” Gabel said.

            Republicans aren't convinced. House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, a Savanna Republican, noted that Pritzker's own budget office predicts a fiscal 2024 revenue drop of $1.42 billion, while the governor proposes $2.75 billion in spending increases.

            ""This will require future tax increases or cuts to vital programs serving our most vulnerable.” McCombie said.

            Senate GOP Leader John Curran of Downers Grove echoed the criticism, although he embraces some increase in early childhood spending.

            Elementary and secondary education and universities would see increases, with the $350 million K-12 increase required by law and $200 million more for higher education, half of that going to needs-based scholarships.

            As a dramatic aside to his education plans, the Democrat ended with a stinging rebuke of hate, bigotry and censorship, proselytizing beyond the state’s borders as he’s done previously and which has fueled speculation about his future plans.

            The state’s third Jewish governor decried a “virulent strain of nationalism” fed by idealogues claiming “that they would protect our children — but whose real intention is to marginalize people and ideas they don’t like.”

            The best education available is “all meaningless if we become a nation that bans books from school libraries about racism suffered by Roberto Clemente and Hank Aaron,” Pritzker said to thunderous applause from the joint session of the General Assembly, “And tells kids they can’t talk about being gay and signals to Black and brown people and Asian Americans and Jews and Muslims that our authentic stories can’t be told.”

            Taking on homelessness and hunger, Pritzker plans a $50 million increase, to $350 million, on prevention, crisis help and housing units.

            “After the cameras leave, often so do the commercial chains — leaving poorer rural and urban communities high and dry,” Pritzker said. “It’s time we return to a tried-and-true model — one where those communities are served by independent, local grocery stores that sell food grown by Illinois farmers.”

            The spring session of the General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn May 19.

            Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor.SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for making preschool available to every 3- and 4-year-old in Illinois within four years, arguing that the state's improved financial picture allows it to not only invest in early education but also take on such problems as homelessness and hunger.“Smart Start Illinois,” the name given to the preschool program, makes good on a Pritzker campaign promise last year when he easily won a second term amid speculation of a future White House run. It would start with a $440 million investment to bring 5,000 additional children into the program this fall.The program's introduction followed quickly on the governor's boasts of tens of billions of dollars in debt elimination he and lawmakers accomplished in his first term after a disastrous two-year budget stalemate between Democrats who control the Legislature and his Republican predecessor.“Today, I ask you to partner with me once again — this time on the long-term investment that has the greatest return for taxpayers with the most positive social and economic impact I have ever come to you with...,"" Pritzker said of the early learning program. “It will make our state the best place in the nation to raise young children.”With annual increases in spending — although smaller than in the initial year — the program would ultimately make room for the approximately 20,000 children whose families desire pre-K but can't enroll their children for lack of space.Of the $440 million first-year payout, $75 million would go toward the existing account funding pre-K, a 12.5% increase in the budget that currently serves 89,000 kids. That funds space for the additional 5,000 learners, all outside of Chicago, which has its own preschool plan.Democrats praised Pritzker's vision, saying he understands that while the fiscal picture is bright today, there are forecasts for a downturn, prompting the governor to show restraint.“What was laid out in the budget today were increases that show a nice amount of fiscal discipline,” said the House speaker pro tempore, Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth of Peoria. “We need to talk about the necessity to move forward while making the proper investments.""House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel of Evanston noted research Pritzker relies on showing the benefits of early schooling, including estimates that it provides a potential $7 return for each $1 in spending.“These are investments that make a lot of a sense at a time when we have some funds and we don't know what the future brings,” Gabel said.Republicans aren't convinced. House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, a Savanna Republican, noted that Pritzker's own budget office predicts a fiscal 2024 revenue drop of $1.42 billion, while the governor proposes $2.75 billion in spending increases.""This will require future tax increases or cuts to vital programs serving our most vulnerable.” McCombie said.Senate GOP Leader John Curran of Downers Grove echoed the criticism, although he embraces some increase in early childhood spending.Elementary and secondary education and universities would see increases, with the $350 million K-12 increase required by law and $200 million more for higher education, half of that going to needs-based scholarships.As a dramatic aside to his education plans, the Democrat ended with a stinging rebuke of hate, bigotry and censorship, proselytizing beyond the state’s borders as he’s done previously and which has fueled speculation about his future plans.The state’s third Jewish governor decried a “virulent strain of nationalism” fed by idealogues claiming “that they would protect our children — but whose real intention is to marginalize people and ideas they don’t like.”The best education available is “all meaningless if we become a nation that bans books from school libraries about racism suffered by Roberto Clemente and Hank Aaron,” Pritzker said to thunderous applause from the joint session of the General Assembly, “And tells kids they can’t talk about being gay and signals to Black and brown people and Asian Americans and Jews and Muslims that our authentic stories can’t be told.”Taking on homelessness and hunger, Pritzker plans a $50 million increase, to $350 million, on prevention, crisis help and housing units. There would be $50 million more for grocery assistance for those needing it. And he wants $20 million to encourage homegrown supermarkets by cities or other groups, acknowledging that state incentives to draw major chains has failed.“After the cameras leave, often so do the commercial chains — leaving poorer rural and urban communities high and dry,” Pritzker said. “It’s time we return to a tried-and-true model — one where those communities are served by independent, local grocery stores that sell food grown by Illinois farmers.”The spring session of the General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn May 19.___Claire Savage, a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative, contributed from Chicago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811585,Israel approves law to strip Arab attackers of citizenship,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a law to strip Arabs convicted in nationalistic attacks of their Israeli citizenship or residency and deport them if they have accepted stipends from the Palestinian Authority.

            The decision, which could potentially affect hundreds of Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel, was condemned as racist by Arab lawmakers as well as Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank.

            The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has long provided stipends to the families of Palestinians killed or imprisoned for attacks on Israelis.











            Prisoners are widely seen as heroes in Palestinian society, and the PA considers these payments as a form of welfare to needy families. But Israel says they reward violence and serve as an incentive for others to carry out attacks.

            Roughly 4,700 Palestinians are imprisoned by Israel for alleged security offenses, according to Israeli rights group HaMoked. Of those, roughly 360 are Israeli citizens or residents of east Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and subsequently annexed. 

            Though Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its undivided capital, its annexation of the eastern part of the city is not internationally recognized. Most Palestinians in Jerusalem have Israeli residency rights, which allow them to work and travel freely and provide access to Israeli social services, but not full citizenship, which would allow them to vote.

            In Wednesday’s vote, parliament voted 94-10 in favor of the law, which gives authorities the right to strip people of their citizenship or residency and deport them to either the neighboring West Bank or Gaza Strip.

            The Palestinian Authority has limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank, where Israel wields overall control. The Gaza Strip, meanwhile, is controlled by the Hamas militant group and largely closed by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade.

            “It is inconceivable that Israeli citizens and residents who have not only betrayed the state and Israeli society, but have also agreed to receive payment from the PA as wages for committing the act of terrorism and continue to benefit from it — will continue to hold Israeli citizenship or residency status,” says an explanatory note to the bill.

            Jewish lawmakers across the political spectrum, including the opposition, voted in favor of the bill, while Arab lawmakers voted against it.

            Arab lawmaker Ahmad Tibi said the bill was racist because it only applies to Palestinians convicted of violence. 

            “An Arab who commits an offense is a conditional citizen,” he said. “If a Jew commits the same offense or a more serious one, they don’t even think of revoking his citizenship.” 

            Kadoura Fares, the head of the Palestinian prisoners’ club, a West Bank group that represents prisoners and their families, said the law was a “very dangerous decision that aims to transfer Palestinians from their cities and villages under the pretext of getting social assistance from the PA.”

            HaMoked, the Israeli rights group, said 140 Arab citizens and 211 Jerusalem residents could be affected by the law. 

            It said the Jerusalem residents are especially vulnerable since they have fewer legal protections to fight the order. The group also says that because east Jerusalem is considered occupied territory, transferring the population would violate international humanitarian law.

            In a separate case, Israel recently deported an east Jerusalem Palestinian man to France after claiming he belonged to a banned militant group.

            “It’s shameful that this law passed, and with an overwhelming majority of support from the opposition as well,” said Jessica Montell, HaMoked's executive director. “Revoking citizenship is an extreme measure — and revoking the residency of east Jerusalem Palestinians and deporting them would be a war crime.”JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a law to strip Arabs convicted in nationalistic attacks of their Israeli citizenship or residency and deport them if they have accepted stipends from the Palestinian Authority.The decision, which could potentially affect hundreds of Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel, was condemned as racist by Arab lawmakers as well as Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank.The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has long provided stipends to the families of Palestinians killed or imprisoned for attacks on Israelis.Prisoners are widely seen as heroes in Palestinian society, and the PA considers these payments as a form of welfare to needy families.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811586,Clevinger reports as MLB probes domestic violence charges,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Mike Clevinger has reported to the Chicago White Sox for spring training, joining his new team amid an ongoing investigation by Major League Baseball into allegations of domestic violence.

            Clevinger addressed the team, apologizing for being a distraction on the first day of camp. The pitcher also told reporters he is confident he will be exonerated.

            “I trust the process from MLB, I really do,” Clevinger said Wednesday. “I think there’s a reason I’m sitting in front of you today. I’m just asking everyone to wait before they rush to judgment. Wait until the actual facts are out there, wait until there’s actual evidence, and then make your decision on who you think I am.”











            The 32-year-old Clevinger finalized a $12 million, one-year contract with Chicago in December. MLB's probe predates his agreement with the White Sox.

            Chicago general manager Rick Hahn told reporters the team’s “only option” was to allow the right-hander to come to camp while awaiting results of MLB’s investigation. He said the team “can get better” in how it vets potential additions.

            “The longer answer is, without anyone having violated the confidentiality of the policy, we weren't going to find this information out,"" Hahn said, “and the fact of the matter is is that the confidentiality element of the policy is essential for it to function properly.” 

            In an Instagram post on Jan. 24, Olivia Finestead said she is the mother of Clevinger’s child and alleged he fathered two other children who were not hers. She posted a photo of marks on her body with accompanying words that alleged the injuries were “from when he threw an iPad at me pregnant” and “finally left when he strangled me.”

            “Mike Clevinger,” she added, “you really deserve hell I’ve kept quiet now for almost a year and you continue to covertly abuse your infant.” She said Clevinger ”threw chew spit on our baby.”

            The Associated Press typically does not identify victims of domestic violence or sexual assault unless they agree to be named or come forward publicly with their allegations, as Finestead has.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811588,Rangers hold deGrom out of 1st spring workout with tightness,"SURPRISE, Ariz. (AP) — Two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom was held out of the first spring training workout for the Texas Rangers on Wednesday because their top free-agent acquisition felt some tightness in his left side. 

            Each of deGrom's past two seasons with the New York Mets were shortened substantially by injuries, but Rangers general manager Chris Young insisted the decision to hold out deGrom was precautionary. It was an unusually chilly day in Arizona and some fields were slick from overnight rain. 

            “It's as much about it being Day 1 of spring training as anything,” Young said. “He's been throwing. His arm feels great.”











            Young said deGrom, who signed a $185 million, five-year deal in December, wanted to participate in the first workout of spring training. The GM said deGrom has already thrown about six bullpens. He felt tightness after his latest bullpen a few days ago. 

            “Nothing major, but having him come in today with the weather conditions, I made the decision that we're going to hold him off from throwing for a day or two until we can treat him and things return to normal,” said Young, a former big league pitcher. “We wanted to make sure that we play things slowly.”

            The 34-year-old deGrom spent the first nine years of his big league career with the Mets. 

            Before missing the final three months of the 2021 season with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, he had a career-low 1.08 ERA over 92 innings. 

            The right-hander was then shut down late in spring training last year because of a stress reaction in his right scapula and didn’t make his first big-league start until Aug. 2. He went 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA over 64 1/3 innings in 11 starts, then opted out of a $30.5 million deal to become a free agent for the first time. 

            DeGrom is 82-57 with a 2.52 ERA and 1,607 strikeouts in 1,326 career innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811589,"Prosecution, defense get wins with Alex Murdaugh lead agent","The lead agent investigating the deaths of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh's wife and son zeroed in on inconsistencies in his actions the night of the killings, according to a videotaped interview two months after the crime played Wednesday at Murdaugh's double murder trial.

            The interview led to Murdaugh becoming the main suspect in the shooting deaths and ended with state Law Enforcement Division agent David Owen asking point-blank if Murdaugh killed his wife and son and a stunned Murdaugh saying he didn't.

            Owen's testimony Wednesday also opened the door to cross-examination, where Owen acknowledged he told the grand jury that indicted Murdaugh on two murder charges last summer incorrect information about blood stains on Murdaugh's T-shirt and that several shotguns in the house were loaded with two different sizes of pellets like the killing weapon, which hasn't been found.











            Owen also testified agents did not search the sprawling property where Murdaugh's mother lived for weapons, bloody clothes or anything else for three months, even though it was the place Murdaugh was at just before finding the bodies.

            ""That was an opportunity missed?” defense attorney Jim Griffin asked.

            “Probably, yes,"" Owen replied.

            Alex Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of killing his 52-year-old wife Maggie and their 22-year-old son Paul. Their bodies were found June 7, 2021, near the dog kennels at their Colleton County home.

            Prosecutors called Owen to summarize their case and get the final interview Alex Murdaugh did with investigators into evidence.

            It backed up much of what the jury had heard about the case already in three weeks of testimony — Murdaugh said he wasn’t at the kennels when witnesses said they heard his voice there minutes before the killings. Murdaugh also changed clothes sometime in the hours before he found the bodies. 

            At the end of the friendly interview, after Owen told Murdaugh to reach and call if he had any questions and Murdaugh told the agent he appreciated the help, Owen dropped the hammer.

            “Did you kill Maggie?” he asked.

            “No,” Murdaugh replied, pausing for a moment. “Did I kill my wife? No.”

            Owen then methodically asked if Murdaugh killed his son or knew who killed either of them. Murdaugh said no to each question.

            Then Murdaugh asked, sounding surprised and irritated: ""Do you think that I killed Maggie?”

            “I have to go where the evidence and the facts take me, and I don’t have anything that points to anyone else at this time,"" Owen said.

            It would take 11 months to get murder indictments against Alex Murdaugh, only after agents finally hacked into his son's cellphone and found a video Paul Murdaugh took at the kennels about five minutes before the shootings that several witnesses have testified has the voices of all three Murdaughs in it.

            Murdaugh started crying at the beginning of the interview. The tears dried up as Owen brought up evidence Murdaugh at the time didn't know existed — a Snapchat video posted by his son taken a few hours before the killing showing Murdaugh wearing different clothes than the shorts and T-shirt he had on when police arrived after he called 911.

            ""What point in that evening did you change clothes?"" Owen asked.

            ""I'm not sure,"" Murdaugh said, pausing for several moments. “What time of day was it?”

            In cross-examination, Griffin pointed out state agents never asked for those clothes before the interview even though they knew Murdaugh had changed.

            Griffin's questioning of Owen focused on other crime scene issues — why agents didn't search for blood in drains or sinks and why Maggie and Paul Murdaugh's clothes weren't tested for DNA. Owen didn't have an answer.

            Prosecutor John Meadors ended his questioning of Owen by asking if Alex Murdaugh suggested state agents search his mother's home in the hours after the killings. Another defense attorney laughed.

            “Is it police procedure that the suspect of your investigation is supposed to solve the crime?"" Griffin asked.

            During the August 2021 interview, Murdaugh's lawyer asked Owen for details on the evidence and the investigation so far.

            “The only DNA we have are family and close friends. We don’t have any fingerprints. Unfortunately, we don’t have any shoe wear or tire wear impression because it rained that night,"" Owen said, “The only thing we can go off of are the cell tower dumps.”

            Later in the interview, Murdaugh asked Owen if his wife or son suffered, and the agent said they would have only for seconds, if that. Murdaugh also asked how far apart his wife and son were killed and how certain he was that Paul Murdaugh had been shot first. Owen said he based that idea on figuring Paul Murdaugh would have reacted if he saw or heard his mother being shot.

            “Maggie would have known that then, wouldn’t she?"" Alex Murdaugh said.

            Owen told Murdaugh not to beat himself up over those details. 

            In cross-examination, Griffin asked if Owen took DNA from gang members to compare to unknown genetic material from a man found under Maggie Murdaugh's fingernails.

            Alex Murdaugh was buying drugs through a middleman in a money laundering scheme, and the defense attorney suggested the middleman was skimming money and the drug dealers were angry. Owen said they didn't.

            Prosecutors expected to rest their case Thursday, but Judge Clifton Newman ruled questioning about the drug dealers opened up prosecutors to present testimony about Alex Murdaugh being shot on the side of the road in September 2021.

            Murdaugh originally said he was shot changing a flat tire, but later said he had asked that same middleman to kill him so his surviving son could get a $10 million life insurance policy, but the gunman's shot only grazed his head.

            Newman announced at the beginning of court Wednesday that all the remaining jurors and alternates tested negative for COVID-19. On Monday, two jurors were dismissed after testing positive for the virus and the clerk of court also has COVID-19, leading to worries that the virus has been spreading through the courtroom and could cause a delay or a mistrial.The lead agent investigating the deaths of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh's wife and son zeroed in on inconsistencies in his actions the night of the killings, according to a videotaped interview two months after the crime played Wednesday at Murdaugh's double murder trial.The interview led to Murdaugh becoming the main suspect in the shooting deaths and ended with state Law Enforcement Division agent David Owen asking point-blank if Murdaugh killed his wife and son and a stunned Murdaugh saying he didn't.Owen's testimony Wednesday also opened the door to cross-examination, where Owen acknowledged he told the grand jury that indicted Murdaugh on two murder charges last summer incorrect information about blood stains on Murdaugh's T-shirt and that several shotguns in the house were loaded with two different sizes of pellets like the killing weapon, which hasn't been found.Owen also testified agents did not search the sprawling property where Murdaugh's mother lived for weapons, bloody clothes or anything else for three months, even though it was the place Murdaugh was at just before finding the bodies.""That was an opportunity missed?” defense attorney Jim Griffin asked.“Probably, yes,"" Owen replied.Alex Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of killing his 52-year-old wife Maggie and their 22-year-old son Paul. Their bodies were found June 7, 2021, near the dog kennels at their Colleton County home.Prosecutors called Owen to summarize their case and get the final interview Alex Murdaugh did with investigators into evidence.It backed up much of what the jury had heard about the case already in three weeks of testimony — Murdaugh said he wasn’t at the kennels when witnesses said they heard his voice there minutes before the killings. Murdaugh also changed clothes sometime in the hours before he found the bodies.At the end of the friendly interview, after Owen told Murdaugh to reach and call if he had any questions and Murdaugh told the agent he appreciated the help, Owen dropped the hammer.“Did you kill Maggie?” he asked.“No,” Murdaugh replied, pausing for a moment. “Did I kill my wife? No.”Owen then methodically asked if Murdaugh killed his son or knew who killed either of them. Murdaugh said no to each question.Then Murdaugh asked, sounding surprised and irritated: ""Do you think that I killed Maggie?”“I have to go where the evidence and the facts take me, and I don’t have anything that points to anyone else at this time,"" Owen said.It would take 11 months to get murder indictments against Alex Murdaugh, only after agents finally hacked into his son's cellphone and found a video Paul Murdaugh took at the kennels about five minutes before the shootings that several witnesses have testified has the voices of all three Murdaughs in it.Murdaugh started crying at the beginning of the interview. The tears dried up as Owen brought up evidence Murdaugh at the time didn't know existed — a Snapchat video posted by his son taken a few hours before the killing showing Murdaugh wearing different clothes than the shorts and T-shirt he had on when police arrived after he called 911.""What point in that evening did you change clothes?"" Owen asked.""I'm not sure,"" Murdaugh said, pausing for several moments. “What time of day was it?”In cross-examination, Griffin pointed out state agents never asked for those clothes before the interview even though they knew Murdaugh had changed.Griffin's questioning of Owen focused on other crime scene issues — why agents didn't search for blood in drains or sinks and why Maggie and Paul Murdaugh's clothes weren't tested for DNA. Owen didn't have an answer.Prosecutor John Meadors ended his questioning of Owen by asking if Alex Murdaugh suggested state agents search his mother's home in the hours after the killings. Another defense attorney laughed.“Is it police procedure that the suspect of your investigation is supposed to solve the crime?"" Griffin asked.During the August 2021 interview, Murdaugh's lawyer asked Owen for details on the evidence and the investigation so far.“The only DNA we have are family and close friends. We don’t have any fingerprints. Unfortunately, we don’t have any shoe wear or tire wear impression because it rained that night,"" Owen said, “The only thing we can go off of are the cell tower dumps.”Later in the interview, Murdaugh asked Owen if his wife or son suffered, and the agent said they would have only for seconds, if that. Murdaugh also asked how far apart his wife and son were killed and how certain he was that Paul Murdaugh had been shot first. Owen said he based that idea on figuring Paul Murdaugh would have reacted if he saw or heard his mother being shot.“Maggie would have known that then, wouldn’t she?"" Alex Murdaugh said.Owen told Murdaugh not to beat himself up over those details.In cross-examination, Griffin asked if Owen took DNA from gang members to compare to unknown genetic material from a man found under Maggie Murdaugh's fingernails.Alex Murdaugh was buying drugs through a middleman in a money laundering scheme, and the defense attorney suggested the middleman was skimming money and the drug dealers were angry. Owen said they didn't.Prosecutors expected to rest their case Thursday, but Judge Clifton Newman ruled questioning about the drug dealers opened up prosecutors to present testimony about Alex Murdaugh being shot on the side of the road in September 2021.Murdaugh originally said he was shot changing a flat tire, but later said he had asked that same middleman to kill him so his surviving son could get a $10 million life insurance policy, but the gunman's shot only grazed his head.Newman announced at the beginning of court Wednesday that all the remaining jurors and alternates tested negative for COVID-19.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811590,Loggerhead sea turtle released after rehabbing in Florida,"JUNO BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A loggerhead sea turtle named Rocky paused briefly on the sand Wednesday morning before slowly crawling into the Atlantic Ocean after spending six weeks rehabbing at Florida's Loggerhead Marinelife Center.

            Turtle hospital staff and volunteers cheered as the turtle made its way down the beach, which is directly across the street from the center. Rocky was equipped with a blue tracking device on its back, which allows the staff to continue monitoring the large turtle.

            
                Rocky, a 220-pound (100-kilograms) female turtle, was found floating off North Hutchinson Island on Dec. 29 with a tear in the lung caused by a boat strike, Andy Dehart, the center's president and CEO, said Wednesday.











            The turtle “had a perforation in the lung, so was trapping air in the body cavity, which was making it essentially be what’s called a floater,” Dehart said. “It couldn’t dive. It couldn’t get underwater.""

            The center's goal is to rehab the turtles and get them back into their natural habitat.

            “So, every one of these animals that goes back is critical to the survival of the sea turtle populations, especially a large breeding female like Rocky,"" he said. “Seeing that return to nature is truly something magical.""

            Juno Beach is north of West Palm Beach on Florida's Atlantic Coast.

            Last year, the center monitored some 18,000 turtle nests along a 10-mile (16-kilometer) stretch of beach. Most of the nests were comprised of loggerhead turtles, along with leatherbacks and green sea turtles, which are all endangered species. Nesting season runs from March 1 to the end of October.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811591,Audit denounces French soccer boss Le Graët for harassment,"PARIS (AP) — Noël Le Graët no longer has legitimacy to remain as French soccer federation president because his management style and behavior toward women are ""incompatible with the exercise of his functions,"" a government audit released Wednesday found.

            The 81-year-old Le Graët is currently under judicial investigation for alleged sexual and “moral” harassment as part of a probe being carried out by a special police unit dedicated to crimes against individuals.

            An audit by the General Inspectorate of Education, Sport and Research concluded that Le Graët’s behavior toward women was inappropriate.











            “The mission considers that Mr. Le Graët no longer has the necessary legitimacy to manage and represent French soccer,” the audit report said. “It believes that the drifting behavior of Mr. Le Graët is now detrimental to the image of the (federation) and invites the federal authorities to examine this situation in application of the statutory provisions.”

            Le Graët was also criticized for the way he runs the federation, with the report blaming him for his “very centralized exercise of power.”

            Le Graët, who was separately criticized last month for perceived disrespect toward France soccer great Zinédine Zidane, had agreed to step away from his role until the audit’s findings have been fully reviewed by the federation's executive committee.

            Federation vice president Philippe Diallo has stepped in to handle Le Graët's duties on an interim basis. It remains unclear if Le Graët will now agree to step down. The federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the audit's findings.

            French sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra ordered the audit into the federation in September after the federation said it would file a defamation lawsuit against So Foot magazine, which reported that Le Graët allegedly harassed several female employees.

            The French magazine published a six-page investigation quoting anonymous former and current employees, and revealed inappropriate text messages that Le Graët allegedly sent to the women.

            “The mission noted not only comments and text messages from Mr. Le Graët, some of which were ambiguous and others of a clearly sexual nature, but also points to the the late hour of the messages, their repetitive nature and the nature of the recipients — women under his authority and/or in a relationship of dependence,” the audit report said.

            Le Graët was re-elected to a four-year term last March.

            The hearings conducted by the mission highlighted that Le Graët's inappropriate remarks may have been ""accentuated by the excessive consumption of alcohol.""

            Sports agent Sonia Souid, who is among those who have accused Le Graët, said in an interview with L’Equipe sports daily that Le Graët repeatedly tried to approach her from 2013-17.

            Souid said Le Graët texted her to ask her out or tell her he missed her. Souid said Le Graët never went too far verbally but made clear she should have sex with him to move her ideas forward.

            “He never looked at me like an agent but like a piece of candy,” Souid said.

            Souid said she was hurt by Le Graët’s attitude and that she thought about ending her career as an agent.

            The audit report, based on more than 100 interviews and analysis of various documents, highlighted other dysfunctions at the federation and noted that its policy against gender-based and sexual violence is “neither effective or efficient.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811592,Michigan State students' training kicked in during shooting,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — When the texts began coming in about a shooter at Michigan State University, training that many students started receiving as schoolchildren automatically kicked in.

            They ran. They found a place to hide. They locked and barricaded the doors. They turned out the lights. Then they waited as a gunman who killed three students and wounded five more eluded police for about four hours.

            They are part of a generation that has grown up with active shooter drills. Schools and districts across the U.S. implemented such training after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and the practice has evolved and grown since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six educators.











            “First, we were taught to be quiet. Run. And then to fight if you are caught,” said Michigan State junior James Cameron, who added that the first lockdown he experienced was in elementary school, when there was a shooting a block away. 

            Many school districts use ALICE training, which stands for alert, lockdown, inform, counter and evacuate. 

            Fighting back is a final option. Students and educators are taught to use scissors, pencils, pens, books, fire extinguishers and any other item they can find as weapons.

            “Our generation has never been safe at school and in places of celebration and in places of peace,” said Jacob Toomey, a Michigan State student who is also a commissioner in nearby Eaton County, who recalled his high school's active shooter drills while speaking at an event Wednesday at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing.

            All of the people shot at Michigan State on Monday night were students. The lockdown ended after the gunman, 43-year-old Anthony McRae, killed himself miles away when confronted by police. Authorities were still trying to determine a motive Wednesday and have said he has no known connection to the university.

            Senior Jamison Bandivas ran into a Target store after hearing someone had been shot at the student union nearby. He and others barricaded themselves in the back of the store, he said, and he watched another student write a “goodbye letter” on a Valentine’s Day card.

            Architecture student Clay Griffith hid in an office, then texted his friends about the best places to hide because “the shooter’s path was my daily walk,” he said. But he also said Americans are no longer shocked by mass shootings — or the preparations their children undergo.

            “I’m not surprised, especially when my 9-year-old sister comes home with a homework assignment of what to do if there’s a school shooter,” he added. “These past few days we’ve been saying all the slogans and mechanisms that we’ve been learning since we were children.”

            For some students, it was not their first experience with a mass shooting. A few attended Oxford High School, where four teens were killed 14 months earlier, on Nov. 30, 2021, some 70 miles west of Michigan State. 

            Matthew Riddle recalled the conversations he had with his daughter, now a Michigan State student, after she survived the Oxford shooting.

            ”‘Lightning doesn’t strike twice, right? This has happened to you and it can’t happen again, right? To Oxford, to you or anybody else,’ and frankly that’s not true,” Riddle told NBC News.

            Maya Manuel, organizer of Wednesday’s protest, asked people to raise their hands if they had “experienced lockdown drills.” Almost all of the MSU students seated on the Capitol steps in front of Manuel had their arms up in the air.

            Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin suggested parents and others might benefit from witnessing the drills their children experience.

            “I think there’s a generational divide. And I heard a couple of students say they wanted to invite our elected officials to participate in these lockdown drills, have them experience what it’s like with our third graders,” Slotkin told The Associated Press. “And I think there’s something to that because, even for me, I didn’t experience it.”

            Later Wednesday, hundreds of students gathered for a campus vigil also attended by school officials, religious leaders, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Hall of Fame basketball coach Tom Izzo, whose son Steven is a Michigan State student.

            Izzo said Steven “was at one of the buildings two nights ago about 10 minutes after things happened.”

            He also said he, Whitmer and others visited the hospital where the injured students are “fighting for their lives.”

            “I can’t begin to imagine what all of you are going through,” he told the students, who poured into a site near “The Rock,” a community gathering place that has become a makeshift memorial in the days since the attack.

            The event concluded with all in attendance singing the alma mater, arms around each other, swaying to the song.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811594,Death of man stopped by mental health team ruled a homicide,"DENVER (AP) — The death of a man who was handcuffed after a mental health team was called and found him walking out into traffic last year has been ruled a homicide, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by lawyers for his family.

            According to the report, Kevin Dizmang, 63, died on Nov. 22 as the result of cardiac arrest that occurred while he was being restrained and while he was acutely intoxicated by methamphetamine and suffering from health problems such as obesity and asthma. 

            The report, dated Jan. 6 and signed by five doctors, concluded that the manner of Dizmang's death in Colorado Springs was determined to be a homicide because of “the contribution of physical restraint to the cause of death.” 











            This is the latest incident in the U.S. that raises questions about how police handle encounters with people experiencing mental health crises.

            Lawyers representing Dizmang's family also released body camera footage in which an officer is repeatedly heard ordering Dizmang to put his hands behind his back while in the street, as others try to stop cars, and resisting attempts by the officer to put handcuffs on him. He then is taken to the ground with the help of another person in a red jacket — identified by family lawyer Harry Daniels as the team's paramedic.

            It's hard to see what is happening but, with the person in red holding his arm around the upper part of Dizmang's body as he lies face down, Dizmang soon stops moving. After he is turned face up, others around him call on Dizmang to talk to them but there is no response. 

            Daniels noted that no one made any effort to try to revive Dizmang at that point. He also faulted the officer for treating the call like a crime scene from the start, rather than like a mental health crisis.

            “The people who came to help him are the people who ended up killing him,” said Daniels, who expects to file a lawsuit over Dizmang's death.

            The Colorado Springs Police Department said the case was investigated and turned over to the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office for review. A spokesperson for the district attorney's office, Howard Black, said the district attorney found the actions of the officer and the paramedic were justified and no criminal charges would be filed.

            One expert in de-escalation techniques said the team may have been able to get Dizmang to voluntarily comply to go to the hospital for help by closing down the street, giving the members more time to talk to him in a more relaxed way, without making demands, and without having to stand as close to him. 

            Even people who are in a mental health crisis or under the influence of drugs can agree to cooperate if given some time, space and understanding, as long as they're not posing a threat, said Tamara Lynn, the chair and an associate professor in the criminal justice department at Fort Hays State University and president of the executive council of the National De-Escalation Training Center. 

            Lynn noted that police ended up closing the street anyway and putting up police tape around a large area in a neighborhood as part of a time-consuming investigation into the use of force. By contrast, had the road been closed and the officer approached Dizmang in a calm and relaxed way, it may have taken an hour to get him into an ambulance, she said. 

            In initial information released after Dizmang's death, the police department said it dispatched a Community Response Team, comprised of a police officer, a paramedic from the city's fire department and a mental health clinician to respond to a call about a man who was experiencing a “mental health episode” at a home and he was found in a roadway. 

            The officer tried to escort the man out of the street, a struggle ensued and the paramedic helped the officer, it said. The man was placed in handcuffs and become unresponsive, it said. Both the officer and paramedic were placed on paid administrative leave, it said.DENVER (AP) — The death of a man who was handcuffed after a mental health team was called and found him walking out into traffic last year has been ruled a homicide, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by lawyers for his family.According to the report, Kevin Dizmang, 63, died on Nov. 22 as the result of cardiac arrest that occurred while he was being restrained and while he was acutely intoxicated by methamphetamine and suffering from health problems such as obesity and asthma.The report, dated Jan. 6 and signed by five doctors, concluded that the manner of Dizmang's death in Colorado Springs was determined to be a homicide because of “the contribution of physical restraint to the cause of death.”This is the latest incident in the U.S. that raises questions about how police handle encounters with people experiencing mental health crises.Lawyers representing Dizmang's family also released body camera footage in which an officer is repeatedly heard ordering Dizmang to put his hands behind his back while in the street, as others try to stop cars, and resisting attempts by the officer to put handcuffs on him.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811595,"Man sues Indianapolis, cop who he says kicked him in head","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A Black man is suing the city of Indianapolis, its police department and an officer who arrested him in 2021, alleging that the officer kicked him in the face while he was handcuffed.

            The lawsuit filed last week by Jermaine Vaughn in Marion County alleges that Sgt. Eric Huxley “used excessive and unlawful force when he viciously attacked and kicked” Vaughn while arresting him at downtown Indianapolis' Monument Circle.

            Vaughn's suit names as defendants the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, the city of Indianapolis, Huxley and two other officers who were with him during Vaughn's arrest, The Indianapolis Star reported.











            The complaint, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, says Vaughn was the victim of intentional battery, unlawful and excessive force, official misconduct and negligence.

            Indianapolis' Office of Corporation Counsel said Wednesday in a statement that it does not comment on pending litigation.

            Huxley was indicted by a federal grand jury in October, accused of using excessive force and charged “with violating the civil rights of an arrestee by using excessive force.” The indictment identifies the victim only as J.V., but Vaughn’s attorney, Robert B. Turner, said Wednesday that Vaughn is the victim described in the indictment.

            That case is ongoing, as is a criminal case Huxley faces in Marion County, where he is charged with two felonies: official misconduct and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury.

            Body camera footage that police released of Vaughn's Sept. 24, 2021, arrest show an officer forcing Vaughn to the ground near steps at Monument Circle. Seconds later, it shows Huxley thrusting his foot down onto Vaughn’s face, according to The Indianapolis Star.

            Vaughn's lawsuit alleges that he was in handcuffs as he was being detained on suspicion of disorderly conduct.

            Huxley was suspended from IMPD without pay after the 2021 incident.

            After his arrest, Vaughn was charged with two misdemeanors of disorderly conduct and resisting law enforcement, but those charges were dismissed two weeks later.

            Turner said Vaughn was homeless when he was arrested and that the video of his arrest “tells it’s own story.”

            “We’re certainly not saying that Indianapolis has a bad police department. They have great officers on the Indianapolis police department, but in this case this is an officer who simply went too far,” he said, adding that, “These are things that are happening all over the nation.”

            Chief Randal Taylor has condemned Huxley's alleged action and recommended his termination to the department’s Civilian Police Merit Board, which will review that recommendation when Huxley’s criminal cases conclude.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A Black man is suing the city of Indianapolis, its police department and an officer who arrested him in 2021, alleging that the officer kicked him in the face while he was handcuffed.The lawsuit filed last week by Jermaine Vaughn in Marion County alleges that Sgt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811603,Family of man shot by Memphis officer wants case reviewed,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The family of a 19-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by a white Memphis police officer during a confrontation nearly eight years ago has asked the city’s top prosecutor to reopen the case, a lawyer said Wednesday.

            Darrius Stewart's father, Henry Williams, wants the death of his son to be reviewed by Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who could convene a grand jury to consider murder or manslaughter charges, Williams' attorney, Carlos E. Moore, said in a statement.

            Then-Officer Connor Schilling shot Stewart in July 2015 during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants. 











            A grand jury declined to charge Schilling despite a recommendation by then-District Attorney Amy Weirich, who reviewed an 800-page Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report on the shooting, that he be indicted for voluntary manslaughter and employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony.

            In September 2016, a federal prosecutor announced that there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges against Schilling. 

            Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allowed him to receive disability pay. 

            “Darrius was unarmed and Schilling has never been tried or convicted,” Moore said in the statement. “I am asking that you re-open the case and convene a new grand jury to see if a murder or manslaughter indictment is returned.”

            Mulroy’s office said the DA was scheduled to meet with Stewart’s family Thursday and may comment publicly afterwards.

            Art Quinn, Schilling’s lawyer in the Stewart shooting, said he hasn't heard of new evidence being presented in the case. Quinn noted that the TBI already investigated and a grand jury did not indict Schilling.

            “I don’t know of any basis why the case would be reopened,” Quinn told The Associated Press.

            The request comes weeks after the January arrest, beating and death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man, in Memphis. Five officers, who also are Black, have been fired and face charges including second-degree murder in connection with Nichols’ death. The district attorney’s office has said it will be reviewing past cases involving those officers.

            The Stewart shooting happened at a time when police shootings across the nation sparked sharp debate on use of force and racial profiling. It led to peaceful protests and vigils in Memphis, and calls for Schilling to be fired. 

            Activists and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, called on the U.S. Justice Department to conduct a “pattern or practice” investigation of civil rights violations in the department. Such inquiries often result in sweeping reforms, including staffing and training overhauls.

            Moore warned the Justice Department at the time of a deadly trend that preceded Stewart’s shooting. “There have been over 24 suspicious killings of civilians by officers of the Memphis Police Department since 2009,” he wrote in a 2015 letter obtained by AP, “and not one officer has been indicted for killing unarmed, largely Black young men.”

            The Justice Department decided not to open such an inquiry for reasons it didn’t explain at the time, and it declined to comment for a Feb. 7 story by the AP.

            Moore made the request to reopen the Stewart case under a Justice Review Unit started by Mulroy, who was elected last year. The independent unit works separately from active prosecutions in the district's attorney's office and reports directly to Mulroy.MEMPHIS, Tenn.

Moore, said in a statement.Then-Officer Connor Schilling shot Stewart in July 2015 during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants.A grand jury declined to charge Schilling despite a recommendation by then-District Attorney Amy Weirich, who reviewed an 800-page Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report on the shooting, that he be indicted for voluntary manslaughter and employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony.In September 2016, a federal prosecutor announced that there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges against Schilling.Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allowed him to receive disability pay.“Darrius was unarmed and Schilling has never been tried or convicted,” Moore said in the statement. “I am asking that you re-open the case and convene a new grand jury to see if a murder or manslaughter indictment is returned.”Mulroy’s office said the DA was scheduled to meet with Stewart’s family Thursday and may comment publicly afterwards.Art Quinn, Schilling’s lawyer in the Stewart shooting, said he hasn't heard of new evidence being presented in the case. Quinn noted that the TBI already investigated and a grand jury did not indict Schilling.“I don’t know of any basis why the case would be reopened,” Quinn told The Associated Press.The request comes weeks after the January arrest, beating and death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man, in Memphis. Five officers, who also are Black, have been fired and face charges including second-degree murder in connection with Nichols’ death. The district attorney’s office has said it will be reviewing past cases involving those officers.The Stewart shooting happened at a time when police shootings across the nation sparked sharp debate on use of force and racial profiling. It led to peaceful protests and vigils in Memphis, and calls for Schilling to be fired.Activists and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, called on the U.S. Justice Department to conduct a “pattern or practice” investigation of civil rights violations in the department. Such inquiries often result in sweeping reforms, including staffing and training overhauls.Moore warned the Justice Department at the time of a deadly trend that preceded Stewart’s shooting. “There have been over 24 suspicious killings of civilians by officers of the Memphis Police Department since 2009,” he wrote in a 2015 letter obtained by AP, “and not one officer has been indicted for killing unarmed, largely Black young men.”The Justice Department decided not to open such an inquiry for reasons it didn’t explain at the time, and it declined to comment for a Feb. 7 story by the AP.Moore made the request to reopen the Stewart case under a Justice Review Unit started by Mulroy, who was elected last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811614,Longtime Steelers assistant John Mitchell retiring at 71,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Longtime Pittsburgh Steelers assistant coach John Mitchell retired on Wednesday after nearly three decades with the club.

            The 71-year-old Mitchell won two Super Bowl rings in 29 seasons with the Steelers after first joining Bill Cowher's staff in 1994 as a defensive line coach. Mike Tomlin retained Mitchell when he replaced Cowher in 2007 then promoted Mitchell to assistant head coach in 2017.

            Mitchell, the longest-tenured coach on Pittsburgh's staff by a wide margin, played an integral role in putting together defensive fronts that helped the Steelers win four AFC championships and a pair of Super Bowl titles in 2005 and 2008.











            “He has coached some of the best players in this franchise’s illustrious history, and each one of them, to a man, would tell you their success was a direct result of not only Mitch’s coaching acumen, but also his mentorship, leadership and character,"" Tomlin said in a statement.

            Mitchell, a native of Mobile, Alabama, made history when he became the first Black player to play in a game at the University of Alabama in 1971.

            He later became the first Black coach at the school shortly after graduating, starting a 50-year career on the sideline that included a stop at LSU, where he became the first Black defensive coordinator in Southeastern Conference history in 1990.

            Mitchell's NFL career began in 1991 when he joined Bill Belichick's staff in Cleveland. Mitchell moved on to the Steelers in 1994, where his pupils on the defensive line included five-time Pro Bowl nose tackle Casey Hampton and defensive tackle/end Cam Heyward.

            “When you consider (Mitchell's) path, as both a player and coach, Mitch created opportunities in football for young Black men that quite honestly didn’t previously exist,"" Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. ""He has left an imprint on this franchise, and the sport and culture of football, that will continue well beyond his retirement.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811615,Missouri activists seek more wrongful conviction hearings,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — As racial justice activists in Missouri celebrate the overturned conviction of Lamar Johnson, they're questioning why other inmates with credible innocence claims aren't getting the chance to make their cases in court.

            
                A Missouri law enacted in 2021 allows prosecuting attorneys to request a hearing before a judge in cases of possible wrongful convictions. In the year-and-a-half since, just two hearings have occurred. A judge in Kansas City in November 2021 overturned the conviction of Kevin Strickland, who spent four decades in prison in a triple murder case.

            And on Tuesday, St. Louis Circuit Judge David Mason overturned the sentence of Johnson, who spent nearly 28 years in prison for the death of a St. Louis man. A little over an hour after Mason's ruling, Johnson walked out of the courthouse a free man.











            The Missouri NAACP has compiled a list of seven inmates with claims the organization believes are credible enough to be heard by a judge immediately, and NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said there are many more whose cases deserve further investigation.

            “We understand and believe that there are many people who have valid innocence claims that are not being brought before the courts,” Chapel said. “And so, while taxpayers are paying for innocent people to be in jail, those same lives are being wasted away.”

            Jamala Rogers of the St. Louis-based Organization for Black Struggle said many innocence claims “never see the light of day” because proving it is expensive, often requiring teams of lawyers and testimony from paid experts.

            “It's not a good situation, and there are many more Lamar Johnsons languishing in Missouri prisons and across the country,” Rogers said.

            It was Johnson's case that spurred the new Missouri law.

            Democratic St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner reviewed Johnson's innocence claims and believed them. But the Missouri Supreme Court refused to grant a new trial in March 2021. The court said its ruling wasn’t about whether Johnson was innocent but only addressed if prosecutors could seek a new trial years after the initial conviction.

            Struck by the fact that potentially innocent people could be imprisoned on a technicality, lawmakers passed the new law giving prosecutors an avenue to address potential wrongful convictions.

            Legal experts agree the process is complicated and can't be rushed. 

            “These cases are not easy, and they shouldn’t be,” Mason said in his ruling.

            Prosecutors in Missouri's three largest jurisdictions — Gardner, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell and Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Jean Peters Baker in Kansas City — have created conviction integrity units to examine possible wrongful conviction cases. All three are Democrats.

            Gardner said her investigators receive hundreds of requests annually from inmates and their relatives. 

            “We will continue to fight to bring these cases to light and deliver justice,” she said in a statement.

            Michael Mansur, a spokesperson for Peters Baker, said Jackson County investigators constantly review applications but have so far filed only in the Strickland case.

            Bell said his review team has 130 open applications they're currently looking at. 

            “Like every aspect and dimension of criminal justice, conviction integrity review proceeds very deliberately - often, too slowly for advocates working outside of the system,” he said in a statement.

            
                Bell examined the innocence claim from a Missouri death row inmate, Raheem Taylor, before determining in January that “the facts are not there to support a credible case of innocence.” The decision disappointed racial justice advocates. Taylor was executed Feb. 7 for killing his girlfriend and her three young children.

            Peters Baker was the first to use the new law, doing so on behalf of Strickland, who maintained that he was home watching TV when the crimes were committed. In November 2021, Judge James Welsh ordered Strickland freed, citing “clear and convincing evidence"" in his favor.

            Then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt had fought to keep Strickland incarcerated. Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in November. Gov. Mike Parson appointed Andrew Bailey as the new attorney general. Schmitt, Parson and Bailey are all Republicans.

            Lawyers from the attorney general's office also argued against freeing Johnson. Chapel said the NAACP was “disappointed” the attorney general's office opposed Johnson's release “despite the overwhelming evidence of his innocence.”

            Madeline Sieren, a spokesperson for Bailey, said in a statement that the office “defended the rule of law and worked to uphold the original verdict that a jury of Johnson’s peers deemed to be appropriate based on the facts presented at trial.”

            Johnson's legal team said justice was eventually served, but the system needs improvement.

            “It took an innocence organization, three law firms, the Circuit Attorney, both chambers of Missouri’s legislature and the Governor’s signature on a law passed for him, to free Lamar Johnson,"" Johnson's lawyers said in a statement.

            Forbes was arrested at 5 a.m. Wednesday at a residence in north-central San Antonio. He was taken to the Bexar County Jail, where bail had not been set.











            Jail records don't list a lawyer who can speak on Forbes' behalf.

            According to a police report, Forbes had an argument with a woman he is dating. Forbes struck the woman several times after the couple arrived home, according to the report. The San Antonio Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services responded to assist the woman.

            The case remains under investigation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811617,Serbian right-wingers rally against Western plan for Kosovo,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of Serbian nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Wednesday, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan to normalize ties with breakaway Kosovo and pulls out of negotiations.

            Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building in central Belgrade. The protesters are also strongly pro-Russian, and one banner read: “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”

            Serbian media reported that one group pushed though metal fences toward the entrance at the end of the rally but was prevented by riot police from reaching the door.











            The protest comes amid efforts by U.S. and European Union officials to mediate a solution for the long-standing dispute between Serbia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade does not recognize.

            Serbia has relied on Russia and China in its refusal to acknowledge Kosovo’s independence, which is backed by Washington and most EU countries. Western officials fear Russia could use simmering tensions in Kosovo to try to destabilize the Balkans and avert some attention from the invasion of Ukraine.

            Serbia’s populist president Vucic has said he was ready to consider the Western plan. Its provisions have not been published but it reportedly stipulates that Serbia would not object to Kosovo’s membership in international institutions, including the United Nations.

            In Kosovo's capital Pristina late Wednesday, scores of students protested peacefully against aspects of the proposed agreement with Serbia.

            In Serbia, pro-Russian right-wing groups have demanded that Belgrade stop all negotiations over Kosovo and publish the Western plan. Vucic has said this would mean the end of Serbia’s integration into the EU and the country’s international isolation.

            Serbia formally seeks EU entry but Vucic has also nurtured close ties with Moscow. Serbia remains the only country in Europe that has not joined sanctions against Russia, though it has condemned the invasion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811618,California debates what to do with water from recent storms,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Weeks after powerful storms dumped 32 trillion gallons of rain and snow on California, state officials and environmental groups in the drought-ravaged state are grappling with what to do with all of that water.

            State rules say when it rains and snows a lot in California, much of that water must stay in the rivers to act as a conveyer belt to carry tens of thousands of endangered baby salmon into the Pacific Ocean.

            But this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked state regulators to temporarily change those rules. He says the drought has been so severe it would be foolish to let all of that water flow into the ocean and that there's plenty of water for the state to take more than the rules allow while still protecting threatened fish species.











            If Newsom gets his way, the state would stop about 300,000 acre feet (370 million cubic meters) of water from flowing through the rivers. One acre foot of water is generally enough water to supply two households for one year.

            Environmental group say pulling that much water out of the rivers would be a death sentence for the salmon and other threatened fish species that depend on strong, cool flows in the rivers to survive. They're furious with Newsom, whom they view as a hypocrite for touting himself as a champion of the environment while disregarding the laws designed to protect it.

            “This governor is the most anti-environmental governor, with respect to endangered species and California water, that we've had in my lifetime,” said Jon Rosenfield, senior scientist for the San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental group that focuses on the San Francisco Bay and its watershed.

            It's one of the oldest disputes in California, a state that for more than a century has manipulated the natural flow of rivers and streams to transform the Central Valley into one of the most fertile stretches of farmland on Earth while also supplying some of the nation's most populous coastal cities.

            Those demands have threatened the delicate environmental balance of the San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, one of the largest estuaries in the country. That has put multiple fish species at risk, including the Delta smelt, longfin smelt, Central Valley steelhead, spring-run Chinook salmon, winter-run Chinook salmon and the green sturgeon, according to Rosenfield.

            Those rules protect more than just fish, including host of other rare and endangered species while also benefiting commercial and recreational fishing and other recreational pursuits.

            The Newsom administration says a changing climate requires new rules. Historically, rain has been spread fairly evenly through the winter months. More water is typically left in the rivers when it rains because there's an assumption that more rain will follow.

            That's not happening now. Scientists say climate change is contributing to so-called “ weather whiplash,"" when periods of intense rain are followed by extreme dryness. Newsom fears California's intense January storms will be followed by an unusually dry spring.

            That makes it more difficult to manage the state's sparse water supply, especially “this early in the season before we’ve really had a sense of exactly how the water year is going to turn out,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.

            Jennifer Pierre, general manager for the State Water Contractors — a nonprofit association representing 27 public water agencies — said the proposed rule changes are an “appropriate action to help realign California’s water management decision making with the latest and most relevant science and the current hydrology.”

            “California is still recovering from years of drought and water cutbacks,"" she said. “We must be nimble in ensuring responsible water management for both water supply and the environment.”

            If the state doesn’t change the rules, Nemeth warned that would mean the state has far less water to make available in the spring and summer for farmers and major cities such as Los Angeles.

            Nemeth said there's plenty of water in the rivers to support fish, though the Newsom administration acknowledged in its proposal that it could lead to more deaths of baby salmon. The state would monitor the fish and “quickly respond,"" if needed. For example, Nemeth said if state officials detect fish near the pumps in the river, they can turn the pumps down so as not to harm them.

            “That’s protective enough of the species,” she said.

            Environmental groups argue that the administration's plan for fish is not enough. Last year, the survival of winter-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River was the lowest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Once state officials see fish near the pumps, that means many more have already been swept away, said John McManus, president of the Golden State Salmon Association.

            Most of the state's reservoirs — including the two biggest ones at Oroville and Shasta — are at or near their historic averages. Plus, the amount of snow in the mountains is nearly double what it has been historically for this time of year. That's why McManus says Newsom is acting too soon to change the rules to store more water.

            “The only real emergency that we're facing is the collapse of our salmon runs in California and the family income jobs all up and down the coast and inland California tied to our salmon fishery,” he said.SACRAMENTO, Calif.

They're furious with Newsom, whom they view as a hypocrite for touting himself as a champion of the environment while disregarding the laws designed to protect it.“This governor is the most anti-environmental governor, with respect to endangered species and California water, that we've had in my lifetime,” said Jon Rosenfield, senior scientist for the San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental group that focuses on the San Francisco Bay and its watershed.It's one of the oldest disputes in California, a state that for more than a century has manipulated the natural flow of rivers and streams to transform the Central Valley into one of the most fertile stretches of farmland on Earth while also supplying some of the nation's most populous coastal cities.Those demands have threatened the delicate environmental balance of the San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, one of the largest estuaries in the country. That has put multiple fish species at risk, including the Delta smelt, longfin smelt, Central Valley steelhead, spring-run Chinook salmon, winter-run Chinook salmon and the green sturgeon, according to Rosenfield.Those rules protect more than just fish, including host of other rare and endangered species while also benefiting commercial and recreational fishing and other recreational pursuits.The Newsom administration says a changing climate requires new rules. Historically, rain has been spread fairly evenly through the winter months. More water is typically left in the rivers when it rains because there's an assumption that more rain will follow.That's not happening now. Scientists say climate change is contributing to so-called “ weather whiplash,"" when periods of intense rain are followed by extreme dryness. Newsom fears California's intense January storms will be followed by an unusually dry spring.That makes it more difficult to manage the state's sparse water supply, especially “this early in the season before we’ve really had a sense of exactly how the water year is going to turn out,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.Jennifer Pierre, general manager for the State Water Contractors — a nonprofit association representing 27 public water agencies — said the proposed rule changes are an “appropriate action to help realign California’s water management decision making with the latest and most relevant science and the current hydrology.”“California is still recovering from years of drought and water cutbacks,"" she said. “We must be nimble in ensuring responsible water management for both water supply and the environment.”If the state doesn’t change the rules, Nemeth warned that would mean the state has far less water to make available in the spring and summer for farmers and major cities such as Los Angeles.Nemeth said there's plenty of water in the rivers to support fish, though the Newsom administration acknowledged in its proposal that it could lead to more deaths of baby salmon. The state would monitor the fish and “quickly respond,"" if needed. For example, Nemeth said if state officials detect fish near the pumps in the river, they can turn the pumps down so as not to harm them.“That’s protective enough of the species,” she said.Environmental groups argue that the administration's plan for fish is not enough. Last year, the survival of winter-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River was the lowest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Once state officials see fish near the pumps, that means many more have already been swept away, said John McManus, president of the Golden State Salmon Association.Most of the state's reservoirs — including the two biggest ones at Oroville and Shasta — are at or near their historic averages. Plus, the amount of snow in the mountains is nearly double what it has been historically for this time of year. That's why McManus says Newsom is acting too soon to change the rules to store more water.“The only real emergency that we're facing is the collapse of our salmon runs in California and the family income jobs all up and down the coast and inland California tied to our salmon fishery,” he said.",2023/2/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811620,2 charged in Florida mass shooting that left 11 wounded,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Two men have been charged with gun-related crimes in connection to a central Florida drive-by shooting that left 11 people wounded last month.

            Nicholas Quinton Hanson, 32, was arrested Friday and charged with possessing ammunition as a convicted felon, and Marcus Dewonn Mobley Jr., 22, was arrested Monday and charged with possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon, according to court records. If convicted, they each could spend up to 15 years in federal prison.

            According to a criminal complaint, Hanson, Mobley and others fired guns at a gathering of people from a blue Nissan Altima on Jan. 30 while traveling through a neighborhood near downtown Lakeland, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Tampa. The victims all survived. Officials haven't released specifics about a motive for the shooting but have previously called it a “targeted attack.”











            The vehicle sped away after the shooting but was recovered by police the next day following a tip from the public. Police said DNA collected from shell casings and the recovered car led them to Hanson and Mobley. Officers later seized a loaded, 9 mm handgun from Hanson’s home, officials said. 

            A third man connected to the shooting, 21-year-old Alex Greene, was shot by police in Winter Haven, just east of Lakeland, on Feb. 6 following a long chase and a carjacking, authorities said. Greene had 10 previous felony charges dating back to 2013 and an outstanding warrant for burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary, authorities said. During a search of Greene's vehicle, officers reported finding cocaine, marijuana, a handgun and thousands of dollars in cash.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811621,Hollywood sex symbol Raquel Welch dies at 82,"NEW YORK (AP) — Raquel Welch, whose emergence from the sea in a skimpy, furry bikini in the film “One Million Years B.C.” would propel her to international sex symbol status throughout the 1960s and '70s, has died. She was 82.

            Welch died early Wednesday after a brief illness, according to her agent, Stephen LaManna of the talent agency Innovative Artists.

            Welch’s breakthrough came in 1966's campy prehistoric flick “One Million Years B.C.,” despite having a grand total of three lines. Clad in a brown doeskin bikini, she successfully evaded pterodactyls but not the notice of the public.











            ""I just thought it was a goofy dinosaur epic we'd be able to sweep under the carpet one day,"" she told The Associated Press in 1981. ""Wrong. It turned out that I was the Bo Derek of the season, the lady in the loin cloth about whom everyone said, 'My God, what a bod' and they expected to disappear overnight.""

            She did not, playing Lust for the comedy team of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in their film “Bedazzled” in 1967 and playing a secret agent in the sexy spy spoof “Fathom” that same year.

            Her curves and beauty captured pop culture attention, with Playboy crowning her the ""most desired woman"" of the '70s, despite never being completely naked in the magazine. In 2013, she graced the No. 2 spot on Men's Health's “Hottest Women of All Time” list. In the film “The Shawshank Redemption,” a poster of Welch covers an escape tunnel — the last of three that character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) used after Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe.

            Admirers took to Twitter to mourn the star, including TV host Rosie O’Donnell, actor Chris Meloni and writer-director Paul Feig, who worked with Welch on “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” and called her “Kind, funny and a true superstar whom I was pretty much in love with for most of my childhood. We’ve lost a true icon.”

            In addition to acting, Welch was a singer and dancer. She surprised many critics — and won positive reviews — when she starred in the 1981 musical ""Woman of the Year"" on Broadway, replacing a vacationing Lauren Bacall. She returned to the Great White Way in 1997 in “Victor/Victoria.”

            She knew that some people didn’t take her seriously because of her glamorous image. ""I'm not Penny Marshall or Barbra Streisand,"" she told the AP in 1993. ""They'll say, 'Raquel Welch wants to direct? Give me a break.""'

            Welch was born Jo-Raquel Tejada in Chicago and raised in La Jolla, California. (The Jo in her name was from her mother, Josephine). Welch was a divorced mother when she met ex-actor turned press agent, Patrick Curtis.

            “The irony of it all is that even though people thought of me as a sex symbol, in reality I was a single mother of two small children!” she wrote in her autobiography, “Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage.”

            Curtis became her manager and second husband and helped shape her into a glamor-girl with hundreds of magazine covers and a string of movies, plus exercise videos and books like ""The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program.""

            Though she would appear in exploitative films, she also surprised many in the industry with fine performances, including in Richard Lester's ""The Three Musketeers,"" which earned her a Golden Globe, and opposite James Coco in ""Wild Party."" She was also nominated for a Globe in 1988 for the TV movie “Right to Die.” She played herself and mocked divas in an episode of “Seinfeld,” memorably attacking Elaine and rattling Kramer.

            Married and divorced four times, she is survived by two children, Damon Welch and Tahnee Welch, who also became an actress, including landing a featured role in 1985’s “Cocoon.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811622,Students 'no longer members' of school after racist video,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — 

            A Catholic high school in Philadelphia says students responsible for a racist video that showed teenage white girls in blackface are “no longer members of this school community.""

            The video circulated on social media and sparked a protest a week ago at St. Hubert Catholic High School for Girls. The protesters included parents of two former students who told The Philadelphia Inquirer their children faced a hostile and unwelcoming climate because they were Black. 











            The video showed several white teen girls, with one spray-painting the face of another with a dark color and yelling “Know your roots!” and “It’s February!” and “You’re nothing but a slave.” The girl with the blackface then declares: “I’m Black and I’m proud!” Other girls present laugh throughout the video.

            “The severity of the situation at hand demanded and the repugnant nature of the behavior on the part of some of our students demanded that we swiftly conduct a thorough investigation,” St. Hubert’s officials said in a statement. “As a result, the young women ... responsible for this situation have been identified and they are no longer members of this school community.” 

            Officials at the school and the archdiocese of Philadelphia didn't say whether the students had been expelled or were asked to withdraw. Those identified as participating did face suspensions before the investigation concluded, archdiocese spokesperson Ken Gavin told the Inquirer.

            The school had said earlier that two girls were “no longer present” at the school and were being disciplined. The school switched last week to flexible instruction, with students completing coursework at home, after unspecified threats and canceled extracurricular activities. Students returned to in-person instruction Monday.

            St. Hubert's plans schoolwide anti-bias workshops with the Anti-Defamation League and says it will also work with the Office for Black Catholics and the Archbishop’s Commission on Racial Healing to create new school programs focused on “dialogue and prayer to address racism and provide restorative resources,” the Inquirer said.PHILADELPHIA (AP) —A Catholic high school in Philadelphia says students responsible for a racist video that showed teenage white girls in blackface are “no longer members of this school community.""The video circulated on social media and sparked a protest a week ago at St. Hubert Catholic High School for Girls.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811623,Wildlife bridges planned for Vegas-California rail line,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A passenger rail company and two California state departments have agreed to build three wildlife overcrossings along the route of a planned high-speed rail line that would connect Las Vegas and Southern California, the parties said Wednesday.

            The agreement was announced in a joint statement by Brightline West and California's Department of Transportation and Department of Fish and Wildlife.

            A rail line giving Southern Californians a new option to reach the gambling and entertainment destination in southern Nevada has been discussed for years. 











            Brightline West is planning a 218-mile route across the Mojave Desert with tracks in the median between the north- and southbound lanes of Interstate 15, the highway that is often jammed with weekend Vegas traffic.

            The three wildlife crossings would allow animals, especially bighorn sheep, to safely cross over the highway and railway, the statement said. 

            The statement quoted Gov. Gavin Newsom as saying the project will protect the desert's wildlife as well as safely and efficiently move people between Las Vegas and Southern California.

            “Roadways and rail lines must be designed to connect, not divide,"" Newsom said. 

            The three locations identified for the overcrossings are in San Bernardino County, northeast of Los Angeles. Funding sources will include the two state departments and Brightline West capital resources. Federal funds will also be sought. 

            The agreement also calls for Brightline West to maintain or improve hundreds of existing culverts and large-scale crossings underneath Interstate 15 and to restore or install fencing that keeps desert tortoises off the roadway.

            Brightline currently operates intercity passenger rail service in Florida. 

            Its line serving Las Vegas would not extend into Los Angeles. The plan calls for stations in the high desert cities of Hesperia and Apple Valley and in Rancho Cucamonga, where Southern California's Metrolink rail system has a station.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811624,Starbucks' Schultz declines to appear before Senate panel,"Starbucks’ interim CEO Howard Schutz has declined a request to appear before a Senate committee seeking to question him about the coffee chain's response to an ongoing unionization campaign at the company's U.S. stores.

            In declining the call from the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Shultz earned a stern rebuke from the committee’s chairman, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

            “Apparently, it is easier for Mr. Schultz to fire workers who are exercising their constitutional right to form unions and to intimidate others who may be interested in joining a union than to answer questions from elected officials,” Sanders, a Vermont Independent, said Wednesday in a statement.











            The Vermont Independent sent a letter to Schultz earlier this month asking him to appear March 9 for a hearing about the unionization campaign and Starbucks' “compliance with federal labor law.” The letter was signed by the committee’s 10 Democrats.

            At least 286 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Starbucks doesn’t support the effort, and the process has been contentious. Regional officers for the National Labor Relations Board have filed 76 complaints against the company for various issues, including failure to bargain. Starbucks, meanwhile, has filed 86 unfair labor practice charges against the union, Starbucks Workers United.

            In its own letter sent to the committee on Tuesday, Starbucks noted that Schultz __ a longtime Starbucks CEO who came out of retirement last year to assume the interim CEO job __ will be transitioning out of that role at the end of March. Laxman Narasimhan, a former PepsiCo executive, will become Starbucks’ new CEO on April 1. Schultz will remain on the company’s board.

            Seattle-based Starbucks said AJ Jones II, Starbucks’ chief public affairs officer, would be better suited to discussing the unionization campaign since he has been more closely involved. The company also said it has been bargaining to reach a contract agreement at more than 200 stores that have voted to unionize.

            It’s unclear how the committee will proceed. In his statement Wednesday, Sanders said he intended to “hold Mr. Schultz and Starbucks accountable for their unacceptable behavior and look forward to seeing him before our committee.”

            The committee has the power to subpoena Schultz, but it’s not yet clear if it will use it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811625,Hamlin: I meant no religious disrespect for wearing jacket,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin said Wednesday he never intended to offend anyone for attending the Super Bowl wearing a jacket that critics deemed to feature an offensive depiction of Jesus.

            “After talking with my parents I understand how my coat could have offended some people,” Hamlin wrote in a note posted on his Twitter account. “It was never my intentions to hurt or disrespect anyone, the coat is abstract art to me.”

            Hamlin closed his two-post thread by saying he will continue to learn from the situation while adding: “My beliefs and Relationship with God is not tied to symbolic images.”











            The second-year player continues recovering after having to be resuscitated on the field after going into cardiac arrest during a game in Cincinnati six weeks ago created a stir for being pictured wearing a Kanye West Eternal Saint blue varsity jacket during pregame ceremonies and sitting in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s box at the Super Bowl in Arizona on Sunday.

            The back of the jacket featured an abstract illustration of Jesus on the cross under the word “ETERNAL.” The front featured an abstract depiction of Jesus' face and appears to reference a Bible verse that reads: “Without end or beginning there is no day and no night.""

            Among the critics were former NFL running back Adrian Peterson, who referred to the jacket as “blasphemy” on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811626,Serbian right-wingers rally against Western plan for Kosovo,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of Serbian nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Wednesday, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan to normalize ties with breakaway Kosovo and pulls out of negotiations.

            Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building in central Belgrade. The protesters are also strongly pro-Russian, and one banner read: “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”

            Serbian media reported that one group pushed though metal fences toward the entrance at the end of the rally but were prevented by riot police from reaching the door.











            The protest comes amid efforts by U.S. and European Union officials to mediate a solution for the long-standing dispute between Serbia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade does not recognize.

            Serbia has relied on Russia and China in its refusal to acknowledge Kosovo's independence, which is backed by Washington and most EU countries. Western officials fear Russia could use simmering tensions in Kosovo to try to destabilize the Balkans and avert some attention from the invasion of Ukraine.

            Serbia's populist president Vucic has said he was ready to consider the Western plan. Its provisions have not been published but it reportedly stipulates that Serbia would not object to Kosovo's membership in international institutions, including the United Nations.

            Pro-Russian right-wing groups in Serbia have demanded that Belgrade stop all negotiations over Kosovo and publish the plan. Vucic has said this would mean the end of Serbia's integration into the EU and the country's international isolation.

            Serbia formally seeks EU entry but Vucic has also nurtured close ties with Moscow. Serbia remains the only country in Europe that has not joined sanctions against Russia, though it has condemned the invasion. 

            Kosovo declared independence after a war in 1998-99 that killed around 13,000 people. Following an armed uprising by ethnic Albanian separatists, Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown that ended after a NATO bombing campaign.BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of Serbian nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Wednesday, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan to normalize ties with breakaway Kosovo and pulls out of negotiations.Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building in central Belgrade.

            The regional carrier operated 21 routes in Mexico and flew to McAllen and Laredo in Texas and Havana, Cuba. It specialized in flying routes between Mexico City and beach resorts. 

            Aeromar said in a statement that it had not been able to recover from financial difficulties stemming from the global downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020. 











            The Mexico City international airport said in a statement that Aeromar owed about $27.5 million in fees, services and other debts. 

            The airline did not say what options would be available to travelers who already purchased tickets. It was also unclear what would happen to the company's nearly 700 employees.

            The Labor Department said it was working to see if other airlines could hire the Aeromar staff.

            The airline was founded in 1987 with a fleet of about ten ATR turboprop airplanes. It was the second Mexican carrier to go broke as a result of pandemic. In December of 2020, the low-cost carrier Interjet ceased operations.

            Aeromar's announcement left Mexico with only three main domestic carriers: Aeromexico and the low-cost airlines Volaris and Viva Aerobus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811628,U-Haul driver must undergo mental evaluation in NYC attack,"NEW YORK (AP) — The driver of a U-Haul truck that barreled through a New York City neighborhood, killing a food delivery worker and injuring eight other people, will have to undergo a psychiatric evaluation while in custody, a judge ordered Wednesday.

            Weng Sor, who was charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with Monday’s deadly rampage, made his first court appearance in Brooklyn. The judge ordered him to remain in custody without bail.

            Police have said he was suffering from an apparent mental health crisis when he mowed down bicyclists, moped riders and at least one pedestrian over 48 minutes.











            Police said Sor, 62, referred to an “invisible object” that came at him, prompting him to go careening through streets before a police cruiser pinned the truck against a building near the entrance to a tunnel leading from Brooklyn to Manhattan.

            After his arrest, Sor told police he believed it was “judgment day” and was aiming the truck at “the people that disturbed him the most,” Assistant District Attorney David Ingle said at the court hearing. He said Sor told the officers, “I wanted to end by taking out enemies. Shoot me, I will not give in.”

            Sor is expected to be back in court on March 16.

            The U-Haul struck three people on mopeds, three people on bicycles, one person on an e-bike and one person who was on foot as the truck moved through a busy section of Brooklyn, just north of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge along New York Harbor, police said. The victims ranged in age from 30 to 66.

            The truck also rammed a police car, injuring the officer inside.

            Sor’s son told The Associated Press earlier this week that his father had a history of mental illness. Records show he was convicted and served time for multiple acts of violence, including stabbing his own brother.

            Sor, who lived in Las Vegas with his mother, came to New York last week after spending time in Florida and was pulled over twice in the U-Haul in the days prior to the attack, police said. 

            Sor’s criminal history includes stabbing his brother in Las Vegas, for which he served time in a Nevada prison, according to court and prison records.NEW YORK (AP) — The driver of a U-Haul truck that barreled through a New York City neighborhood, killing a food delivery worker and injuring eight other people, will have to undergo a psychiatric evaluation while in custody, a judge ordered Wednesday.Weng Sor, who was charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with Monday’s deadly rampage, made his first court appearance in Brooklyn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811629,Split Pennsylvania House set for raucous return next week,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania's top House Republican on Wednesday warned of chaos when legislators reconvene next week, six weeks after representatives elected a Democrat as House speaker and left Harrisburg without conducting any other business.

            Republican Minority Leader Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County said the chamber's 102-101 Democratic majority may not be able to solve the gridlock that has so far prevented lawmakers from so much as adopting operating rules for the 2023-24 session. Cutler himself served as House speaker before deciding in November not to seek the leadership post again. 

            Cutler spoke to reporters in the Rotunda Wednesday, down the corridor from a lengthy, closed-door meeting about the rules being held among Democratic House members. By sweeping three special elections last week, Democrats cemented a tiny majority, their first in 12 years. Republicans had kept a tight grip on the chamber for more than a decade, with rules that largely prevented Democrats from changing GOP bills or advancing their own priorities. 











            “Without copies of rules in advance, what will we really be doing?"" Cutler said. ""If the Democrats are ready to lead, let's see what they want to do. Let's see the rules. Let's get the House operating an agenda that works on behalf of all Pennsylvania. So far, we've seen very little, and that should concern every single taxpayer in this commonwealth.”

            The House convened Jan. 3 and elected Rep. Mark Rozzi of Berks County as speaker after the two caucuses' first choices, Rep. Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, and Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar, R-Somerset, failed to garner majority support. 

            All Republican leaders and a few other GOP representatives voted with all Democrats to elevate Rozzi. But in the weeks of legislative inaction that have ensued, Republicans have generally soured on the new speaker, accusing him of falling short his commitment to be an independent leader. Rozzi did not return messages left Tuesday and Wednesday.

            “The speaker hijacked the chamber with broken promises and he has held the will of Pennsylvanians hostage ever since,” Cutler said.

            Few bills are usually voted on by the full House early in a legislative session, but even preliminary work has been frozen because operating rules also determine the partisan makeup of committees.

            Since early January, Rozzi has been holding public meetings with six state representatives, three from each party, that he assembled to develop what he calls the “Rozzi rules.” Nothing has been made public and it's unclear whether he will be able to wrangle a majority to adopt his rules next week.

            It's also unclear if other Democrats or Republicans will have the votes to adopt their own rules, or even replace Rozzi at the speaker's rostrum.

            The current one-vote majority is so small that if even a single state representative departs — which could occur repeatedly in the next two years — it will cause problems.

            “There will be people on both sides of the aisle running for different offices and having to resign their positions,” Rep. Josh Kail of Beaver County, the Republicans' policy chairman, said at the news conference. “Every time that happens we’re going to have to shut down the House because some side doesn’t like the numbers that the other side has at that point in time. It’s ridiculous. This body has work to do.”

            Rozzi has said the House won't take up other legislation until lawmakers pass his signature issue: a two-year “window” to let victims of child sexual abuse sue for otherwise outdated claims. 

            Rozzi has said publicly that a now-deceased Roman Catholic priest molested him when Rozzi was a boy, and that he received a settlement over abuse from the Allentown Diocese. He has long been a leader in the campaign for other victims to be compensated. 

            Outside the House Democrats' caucus room Wednesday, Rep. Mike Schlossberg of Lehigh County said members were reviewing rules with a large freshman class and soliciting ideas about how to to establish ""a more just and a more fair system.""

            “We are having conversations about basically the gamut of potential proposals,” Schlossberg said. “What I don't know is the specifics yet, because it's really tough to say.""HARRISBURG, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811630,Park Service clears homeless encampment near White House,"WASHINGTON (AP) — National Park Service employees on Wednesday swept through a large homeless encampment three blocks from the White House, tearing down dozens of tents and warning that people who resisted would be subject to arrest. 

            Workers in white jumpsuits used rakes, shovels and pitchforks to clear McPherson Square, tossing the remnants of the tent city into a pair of garbage trucks. 

            The action was the latest development in a long-running saga involving the District of Columbia government, the Park Service and homeless people, whose advocates claim the city hasn't done enough to help them find safe shelter. 











            “There are people living here who don’t know where they’re going to sleep tonight. The entire purpose of this is to displace people and to ‘invisiblize’ and criminalize homelessness,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, of Miriam’s Kitchen, one of a collection of charitable organizations that has been working with those who have made the park their home.

            The encampment in McPherson Square has grown steadily over the past year, to about 50 tents as of Wednesday. Many people said they came after encampments in other parts of downtown were cleared by either the federal agency or the city government.

            “Any time people were forced out of somewhere else, they would see the tents here and figure it was safe for a while,” said Daniel Kingery, who has lived in the park for three years. While the majority of the estimated 70 people live in the park complied without incident, Kingery, 61, cheerfully said authorities “would have to carry or drag me away.” 

            The National Park Service, which has jurisdiction over McPherson Square and large swaths of other green space across the city, had originally announced plans to clear the square in April. But the deputy mayor for health and human services, Wayne Turnage, requested that the date be moved up by two months, saying the encampment was an imminent public health hazard. 

            NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said that despite the accelerated timeline, there still was notice of about two weeks. “The District’s social service providers intensified their efforts to connect people with housing and other services,” he said.

            In the morning, police sealed off the park and repeatedly announced over a loudspeaker that the space would be closed down and those who refused to leave would risk arrest. As the 10 a.m. deadline approached, a group of representatives from a coalition of charitable groups helped to gather up and label people's belongings and haul them off in a rental truck. 

            Representatives from Pathways to Housing, a charity that contracts with the D.C. government as a liaison to the downtown unhoused population, went tent to tent, making sure each person was aware of what was coming. 

            “Brandon, they are going to come here and take this down,” one worker shouted outside a closed tent. ""They're coming, you have about 10 minutes!""

            The issue of Washington's robust homeless population has been a long-term puzzle for Mayor Muriel Bowser's government. The tent clusters frequently move between city and Park Service land to take advantage of the district's specific jurisdictional complexities. 

            City officials say they have offered consistent outreach services and shelter for all who were willing to engage with the system. But those who live in the park dismissed the short-term shelter system as unsafe and undignified. 

            “The shelters are infested with mice and there's mold on the walls. And they're not safe,” said a woman named Umi, who declined to give her last name. She said Bowser and Turnage “need to go sleep one night in one of these shelters and see what we experience.” 

            Housing activists say most of those who are unhoused would happily take part in a government program that offers vouchers for subsidized apartments. But that program has been plagued by delays and a bottleneck partially caused by staffing shortages. 

            “One of the things that makes this so appalling is that the city does have ample resources,” said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, whose office overlooks the park.

            Yentel said case workers “needed more time” to work with the McPherson Square residents, but those efforts were cut short when the federal government agreed to accelerate the deadline.WASHINGTON (AP) — National Park Service employees on Wednesday swept through a large homeless encampment three blocks from the White House, tearing down dozens of tents and warning that people who resisted would be subject to arrest.Workers in white jumpsuits used rakes, shovels and pitchforks to clear McPherson Square, tossing the remnants of the tent city into a pair of garbage trucks.The action was the latest development in a long-running saga involving the District of Columbia government, the Park Service and homeless people, whose advocates claim the city hasn't done enough to help them find safe shelter.“There are people living here who don’t know where they’re going to sleep tonight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811633,Maine lawmakers target Whole Foods for blacklisting lobster,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Maine are going after Whole Foods for its rebuke of the state's signature seafood — Maine lobster.

            Whole Foods stopped selling Gulf of Maine lobster at hundreds of its stores last year after a pair of sustainability organizations suspended lobster certifications over concerns the fishing gear could hurt endangered whales.

            Maine officials have decried those actions — pointing out that no deaths of North Atlantic right whales have been linked to lobster gear.











            Maine's Senate Republican leader is now sponsoring a bill to strip Whole Foods from participation in the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement program, which provided the grocer's only store in Maine with a $36,671 reimbursement for 2021.

            Sen. Trey Stewart accused Whole Foods of blindly following “incorrect science” and giving Maine's $1.7 billion lobster industry a “black eye.”

            Whole Foods had no immediate comment.

            The bill targets businesses that restrict or prevent the sale or distribution of any product that is legally produced, harvested or grown in Maine based on third-party certifications, bans or boycotts.

            There's bipartisan support for the bill. But the associate commissioner for tax policy told the Taxation Committee on Tuesday that he opposed the bill for several reasons, including concerns about its constitutionality.

            The House Republican leader, Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham, himself a lobster fisherman, called the attacks on lobster “an absolute joke.” 

            He said lobster fishermen over generations have set “the gold standard of sustainability on the planet, as far as I’m concerned.”

            But the certifications were removed not because of the health of lobster but because the concern over right whales, which number about 340. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with ships.AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Maine are going after Whole Foods for its rebuke of the state's signature seafood — Maine lobster.Whole Foods stopped selling Gulf of Maine lobster at hundreds of its stores last year after a pair of sustainability organizations suspended lobster certifications over concerns the fishing gear could hurt endangered whales.Maine officials have decried those actions — pointing out that no deaths of North Atlantic right whales have been linked to lobster gear.Maine's Senate Republican leader is now sponsoring a bill to strip Whole Foods from participation in the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement program, which provided the grocer's only store in Maine with a $36,671 reimbursement for 2021.Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811634,Red states join push to legalize magic mushrooms for therapy,"SANDY, Utah (AP) — Shawn Blymiller spent 10 years of feeling mostly numbed while prescribed traditional anti-depressants, trudging through his day-to-day life as a suburban Salt Lake City father of two kids balancing the obligations of family and work selling technology software.

            When his son was diagnosed as having special needs a few years later, the stress became increasingly difficult to endure. So like many with treatment-resistant depression, Blymiller, 39, sought out alternatives and found one he said worked: Psychedelic mushrooms.

            Under a therapist's supervision, Blymiller took psilocybin — the most popular of the hallucinogens known broadly as “magic mushrooms” — and for several hours, was able to confront past traumas, work through mental illness and ultimately become a better father, husband and friend, he said.











            “It’s almost revealing. These curtains in your psyche are being opened and you feel like, ’Oh my gosh, this is how I operate; this is how I present myself,' ” he said after a sunrise mountain hike in the Salt Lake City suburb where he lives.

            A group of patients like Blymiller would be able to use them legally for their ailments under a new Utah proposal that would create a pilot program for the medical and therapeutic use of magic mushrooms. Currently, magic mushrooms are illegal under federal law, and therapists who guide patients like Blymiller through trips typically require they find them on their own out of fear of jeopardizing their licenses. Blymiller declined to say how he procured them. He said like a lot of plant-based medicine, it wasn’t difficult to find.

            Amid growing acceptance of psychedelics, advocates in blue states like Colorado and Oregon began their pushes with ballot measures proposing to decriminalize psychedelics like magic mushrooms. Advocates in red states like Utah and Missouri are starting in a different way, proposing studying them or first making them legal for medical use — a strategy that mirrors how many states including Utah have handled marijuana legalization.

            Last year, lawmakers in Utah's Republican-supermajority statehouse commissioned a study on the benefits and liabilities associated with psychedelic mushrooms. And this year, state Sen. Luz Escamilla, a Salt Lake City Democrat, wants to create a pathway to legalization and allowing patients to consume magic mushrooms for therapeutic benefits. Her primary motivation is confronting a ballooning mental health epidemic, she said.

            “This is an opportunity to add to the toolbox for our massive mental health crisis,” Escamilla said. “The policy question as a lawmaker is: Do we have 10 more years to wait for people to get access to mental health care when they need it?”

            Utah, a conservative state where culture and politics are dominated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has become a global hotspot for psychedelics, attracting spirituality-seeking individuals leaving traditional religion as well as outdoor hobbyists looking to use hallucinogens recreationally in places like the red rock deserts of Moab.

            As psychedelics become less counterculture and more mainstream, they are also drawing interests from suburban dads like Blymiller struggling with mental health and disillusioned after years of taking anti-depressants.

            A series of studies from Johns Hopkins University’s psychedelics research unit found that magic mushroom-assisted therapy can reduce depression symptoms for up to a year and be effective for individuals for whom other treatments haven’t worked.

            In Utah, which has among the highest suicide rates in the United States, all 29 counties have a shortage of mental health professionals. Blymiller hopes lawmakers consider legalizing magic mushrooms for therapeutic use this year so more people like him — whether struggling with post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression — can pursue treatment without fear of breaking drug laws.

            The push would follow successful efforts in Oregon, but make Utah among the first states to create a legal framework for medical magic mushrooms. After successfully decriminalizing psychedelic mushrooms, Oregon voters approved measures to decriminalize all drugs and legalize psilocybin for use in controlled circumstances. Oregon will soon issue licenses for professionals to facilitate therapeutic use.

            “I don’t think Republican legislators would ever favor a decriminalization model that says ‘Live and let live, have fun and you won’t go to jail,' ” Connor Boyack, a lobbyist with the libertarian-leaning Libertas Institute, said, comparing Utah to Oregon and Colorado. “The arguments that work in a Republican Legislature are oversight, control and regulation — to ensure safety and that youth and the wrong people don’t get it.""

            Sen. Evan Vickers, a Republican pharmacist, said based on the studies he was intrigued by the prospect of legalizing psychedelic mushrooms for medical use and believes many feel confident in the way Utah regulates medical marijuana.

            “The challenge always, with a substance like this, is you have the positive nature of it, but you also have the abusive potential,” he said.

            Legislation to allow research on the therapeutic benefits psilocybin is under consideration in states across the political spectrum this year, including in Arizona, Hawaii and Oklahoma. Legislation to legalize therapeutic use or create pilot programs is under consideration in states including California, Connecticut, New York, Utah, and Washington. In Virginia, two magic mushroom-related bills failed to advance this year in the politically divided General Assembly.

            In most states, legalization efforts face opponents who argue potentially opening a door to widespread and debilitating drug use outweighs the benefits therapy could have for the few who can afford to pursue it. Doctors' lobbies, including the Utah Medical Association, tend to oppose legalization efforts.

            “While there may be some limited benefit to using appropriately controlled and appropriately implemented psychedelic medications in mental health that have gone through the FDA approval process, we do not believe Utah should create a program to grow, process, produce and distribute psychedelics. These are psychoactive substances that cause hallucinations,” Michelle McOmber, the association's CEO, said in a statement.

            Desiree Hennessy, the executive director of the Utah Patients Coalition, understands the idea of magic mushrooms may not be something many — including lawmakers — want to pursue personally. But she's hopeful, regardless of their partisan leanings, that the way most people have close ties to someone struggling with mental health will lead them to seriously consider legalizing therapeutic use.

            ""You talk to the legislators, families or anybody on the street and they will tell you that they know somebody that has committed suicide or is struggling with anxiety, depression or PTSD so severely that they are incapable of living their life. Everybody can find somebody that they know or as close to them that has had these experiences,"" she said.SANDY, Utah (AP) — Shawn Blymiller spent 10 years of feeling mostly numbed while prescribed traditional anti-depressants, trudging through his day-to-day life as a suburban Salt Lake City father of two kids balancing the obligations of family and work selling technology software.When his son was diagnosed as having special needs a few years later, the stress became increasingly difficult to endure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811637,Blinken off to Europe amid soaring tensions with China,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Soaring U.S. tensions with China, fears of a new Russian offensive against Ukraine and a stalemate with Turkey over NATO expansion will top Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s agenda as he heads to Europe this week. 

            Blinken will leave Washington on Thursday for nearly a week of meetings in Germany, Turkey and Greece, the State Department said Wednesday. 

            He starts his six-day trip at the Munich Security Conference, where he will join Vice President Kamala Harris in representing the Biden administration. 











            Speculation is high that Blinken might use the opportunity to meet top Chinese foreign policy official Wang Yi who will also be attending the Munich conference. No such meeting is yet scheduled but if one takes place it would be the first high-level discussion with China since Blinken postponed a trip to China last week over its suspected spy balloon.

            A wide array of other senior foreign officials will also be at the Munich conference and apart from increasing worries over Chinese surveillance activities, the situation in Ukraine ahead of an anticipated Spring offensive by Russia is expected to be a prime concern.

            The conference is taking place on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and last year's iteration was dominated by warnings from the U.S. and its NATO allies that a war was imminent.

            From Munich, Blinken will travel to Turkey, where he will stop first at Incirlik Air Base to look at relief and recovery operations for the victims of last week's devastating earthquake, before going on to Ankara for expected talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other senior officials.

            One of his priorities in Ankara will be trying to unblock Turkey's objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO. Erdogan has complained that the Finns and, more particularly the Swedes, are too lenient toward groups it deems terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups.

            Unanimity among the alliance is needed to accept new members and all 30 current allies except Turkey have either ratified or signaled their intent to ratify Finland and Sweden's entry.

            At the same time, Washington has other issues with Ankara, including Turkey's persistent desire to purchase advanced U.S. fighter jets, something that a number of powerful lawmakers are opposed to on human rights grounds.

            Blinken will wrap up his trip in Athens, where he will discuss festering Greek-Turkish tensions, and other issues, including energy security in the eastern Mediterranean and defense cooperation.WASHINGTON (AP) — Soaring U.S. tensions with China, fears of a new Russian offensive against Ukraine and a stalemate with Turkey over NATO expansion will top Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s agenda as he heads to Europe this week.Blinken will leave Washington on Thursday for nearly a week of meetings in Germany, Turkey and Greece, the State Department said Wednesday.He starts his six-day trip at the Munich Security Conference, where he will join Vice President Kamala Harris in representing the Biden administration.Speculation is high that Blinken might use the opportunity to meet top Chinese foreign policy official Wang Yi who will also be attending the Munich conference.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811639,"Johnson, Pastrana land spots in Daytona 500 as Daly breaks","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Conor Daly’s first call after getting offered a chance to race his way into the Daytona 500 was to a guy named AJ.

            It was supposed to be Allmendinger. He accidentally dialed up Foyt.

            Daly panicked and hung up before the four-time Indy 500 champion and 1972 Daytona 500 winner could answer.











            “It would have been an interesting call,” Daly said.

            Probably would have been informative, too, since Foyt is one of two open-wheel regulars (along with Mario Andretti) to win the two most prestigious races in North America — the Indy 500 and the Daytona 500.

            Nonetheless, Daly, an IndyCar regular, has been trying to glean knowledge from anyone and everyone (besides Foyt) about how to efficiently and effectively get around Daytona International Speedway.

            Daly ended up having to wait a day to get on track after an electrical issue burned a hole in an oil line, which couldn't get repaired in time for single-lap qualifying runs Wednesday night. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson and action sports star Travis Pastrana had no issues and were the fastest of the six drivers vying for the final four spots.

            Johnson and Pastrana landed starting spots and joined the 36 drivers already locked into the 40-car field based on NASCAR’s charter system. Daly and youngsters Austin Hill, Chandler Smith and Zane Smith will vie for the final two coveted spots in twin qualifying races Thursday.

            Daly considered himself a long shot to make the race on speed in his No. 50 Chevrolet for The Money Team, mostly because he has so little experience at Daytona. And he's right: FanDuel Sportsbook listed his odds at winning the race at 200-1. 

            Daly raced go-karts at a smaller track inside Daytona as a teenager and twice ran the road course as part of the Rolex 24. But Daly has yet to turn laps on the high-banked, high-speed superspeedway in a Cup car.

            “Spent a lot of time here growing up and just excited for the chance just to take in a lot of learning at a very high rate of speed,” Daly said. “It’s going to be tough. It’s the biggest uphill battle that I’ve ever had to make a race.”

            He turned to Allmendinger, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kurt Busch, Ryan Blaney, Corey LaJoie and Chase Briscoe for help. He even listened to three-time Daytona 500 champ Denny Hamlin’s podcast for insight.

            “Everyone said the same thing: ‘It’s going to be hard, but why not try?’” Daly said.

            Daly spent two hours in Chevy’s NASCAR simulator last week, all of it trying to hone shift points and how to get on and off pit road. As for everything else?

            “It’s impossible to simulate,” he said.

            Johnson actually might have similar issues even though the two-time Daytona 500 winner knows the track as well as anyone entered in the event. He hasn’t raced in the latest iteration of the Cup Series car but does have two test sessions in it, including one at Daytona.

            As co-owner at Legacy Motor Club, Johnson has been peppering both his drivers, Erik Jones and Noah Gragson, with questions about the car. He compared the situation to 2002, when he had to race his way into the Daytona 500 as a rookie at Hendrick Motorsports.

            “I think on paper it’s similar,” Johnson said. “There’s a lot at stake here for me, I would say. But personally between (the) two years, man, I’m sitting here with seven championships and 83 wins. Yes, it would absolutely suck to not make the race.

            “But the pressure I had on myself in 2002, life would have seemed like it ended if I didn’t make that race. I am in a different place, although this is the first step for me as a part-owner of this car.”

            Johnson actually started on the pole for that first Daytona.

            “Maybe lightning will strike twice,” he added.

            Pastrana might be considered the biggest wild card of the six even though he’s driving for 23XI Racing. He last raced at Daytona a decade ago. But he and Daly have been talking about racing at Daytona for several years.

            Like Allmendinger (or Foyt, really), Pastrana was one of the first ones Daly called when his deal came together this month.

            “I finally got the green light and I’m like, ‘Dude, I’m going to do it,’” Pastrana said. “He was like, ‘That’s so cool.’ And then he called me just a couple weeks ago and he’s like, ‘I’m in!’

            “I wanted to punch him through the phone, like, ‘Doggone it, what are you doing?’ He’s a good friend. … Someone asked me what would you be willing to give up to win the Daytona 500. I said, ‘All my friends that are racing on that track.’”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811640,Activists rally behind Missouri lawmaker cut off in debate,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri faith leaders, activists and elected officials on Wednesday decried the Republican-led House for shutting down a Black lawmaker’s speech and passing a bill that could strip power from the Black woman elected as St. Louis prosecutor. 

            “You may have silenced our representatives for a minute,” the Rev. Darryl Gray told dozens of fellow racial justice activists during a rally outside the Capitol. “But what you ended up doing (is) you forced our voice to get louder. You forced us to show up.”

            The House last week passed legislation to allow Republican Gov. Mike Parson to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crimes in areas with high homicide rates, such as St. Louis. The bill is part of a Republican push for anti-crime legislation this session. 











            State Rep. Kevin Windham, a Black Democrat from St. Louis County, was reading aloud a news article about similar legislation in Mississippi during the House debate when some white Republican lawmakers objected that his speech had nothing to do with Missouri. 

            House Speaker Dean Plocher ruled Windham out of order, halting his speech. Windham’s microphone was turned off. House Majority Leader Jon Patterson then made a motion to shut off debate on the bill, which the Republican majority voted to do — leaving other Black Democrats standing without having a turn to speak. 

            Patterson last week defended his role in halting the debate, saying the “conversation was devolving” and that race ""did not play a role in me deciding that it was time to have a vote on the bill.”

            The office of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner issued a statement calling the legislation “a political stunt.”

            The discord in the Missouri House came just days after a similar upset in Mississippi, where Black lawmakers denounced the majority-white, Republican-led Legislature for voting to take power away from local leaders in the predominantly Black city of Jackson. 

            Like in Mississippi, Missouri’s legislature has a largely white Republican majority. Most of the Black lawmakers represent the state’s two largest urban areas of St. Louis and Kansas City. 

            At the time of the rally, many lawmakers had already left the Capitol to go to Kansas City to celebrate the Chiefs’ second Super Bowl championship in four NFL seasons.JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811641,Party foul: Dem-led NY Senate rejects gov’s top judge pick,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York's Senate rejected Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nominee to be the state's chief judge Wednesday, an extraordinary defeat for the state's top Democrat delivered by legislative leaders in her own party.

            The vote rejecting Judge Hector LaSalle as the head the state Court of Appeals and overseer of New York’s judicial system came after opposition from liberals, who wanted Hochul to pick a judge with a progressive record.

            Opponents questioned LaSalle's decisions as a judge on a midlevel appeals court. Supporters said he was being unfairly targeted by the left and that his judicial opinions were being misconstrued.











            Initially, the full Senate had appeared unlikely to even give LaSalle a vote, but its leaders reversed course after a lawsuit filed by a Republican demanded a full vote in the chamber.

            Hochul called LaSalle “an overwhelmingly qualified and talented jurist.” But she said she would make a new nomination.

            “I remain committed to selecting a qualified candidate to lead the court and deliver justice. That is what New Yorkers deserve,” she said in a statement.

            Senate leaders maintain they fulfilled their legal duty with a panel's vote last month rejecting LaSalle. But they said they went ahead with a full floor vote to remove an unwanted distraction as they negotiate a $227 billion budget with the governor. 

            “We have a budget to enact. We have a top court that needs to be fully constituted. And we are taking this matter to the floor today to resolve this crisis,” Democratic Sen. Michael Gianaris said on the Senate floor.

            With LaSalle looking on from a gallery, the Senate rejected his nomination by a vote of 20-39. Democrats overwhelmingly voted against LaSalle. Earlier in the day, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to consider the judge's nomination for a second time, this time sending it to the full Senate. 

            A lawsuit filed last week by the ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. Anthony Palumbo, claims the state constitution doesn’t give the panel the last word. The lawsuit sought to force a floor vote on the judge.

            Palumbo on the floor Wednesday accused Democrats of gamesmanship in trying to render the court case moot. He said he would press on with the lawsuit, which was to be argued on Friday. Palumbo later said he hoped the lawsuit sets a court precedent that “regardless of what party is in power, nominations need to go to the floor.” 

            LaSalle, who presides over one of four state appellate districts, was tapped by Hochul to be the first Latino to lead the seven-member high court. 

            Progressive activists, labor leaders and liberal senators claimed his record as an appellate judge is too conservative for such an influential position. Supporters of LaSalle accuse his critics of unfairly characterizing his views based on a handful of cases to usher in a more liberal judge.

            “They don’t want somebody who’s going to follow the law. They want somebody who is going to interpret the law the way they want the law interpreted. That’s not what a judge is supposed to do,” Republican Sen. Steven Rhoads argued during the debate.

            Palumbo told senators that LaSalle was “a plain-old liberal Democrat.”

            Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said she had a good talk on the phone with Hochul before the vote, and that Democrats are committed to working with the governor on the next nominee.

            “I think we have come to the conclusion that we can find a better nominee that can lead this court,” Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said on the floor, ""and we need to do it ASAP.”

The lawsuit sought to force a floor vote on the judge.Palumbo on the floor Wednesday accused Democrats of gamesmanship in trying to render the court case moot. He said he would press on with the lawsuit, which was to be argued on Friday. Palumbo later said he hoped the lawsuit sets a court precedent that “regardless of what party is in power, nominations need to go to the floor.”LaSalle, who presides over one of four state appellate districts, was tapped by Hochul to be the first Latino to lead the seven-member high court.Progressive activists, labor leaders and liberal senators claimed his record as an appellate judge is too conservative for such an influential position. Supporters of LaSalle accuse his critics of unfairly characterizing his views based on a handful of cases to usher in a more liberal judge.“They don’t want somebody who’s going to follow the law. They want somebody who is going to interpret the law the way they want the law interpreted. That’s not what a judge is supposed to do,” Republican Sen. Steven Rhoads argued during the debate.Palumbo told senators that LaSalle was “a plain-old liberal Democrat.”Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said she had a good talk on the phone with Hochul before the vote, and that Democrats are committed to working with the governor on the next nominee.“I think we have come to the conclusion that we can find a better nominee that can lead this court,” Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said on the floor, ""and we need to do it ASAP.”___Associated Press writer Maysoon Khan contributed from Albany, New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811642,Town can't refuse Amazon offer despite Duvall opposition,"Actor Robert Duvall was one of more than 100 speakers at a northern Virginia town's council meeting opposing a proposed $550 million data center from Amazon.

            The Town of Warrenton voted 4-3 early Wednesday morning to approve a special use permit for Amazon, despite Duvall's opposition.

            The 92-year-old “The Godfather” and “The Great Santini” actor lives on a farm in Fauquier County, which surrounds the town.











            “We must all work to preserve the character of this town,” Duvall said. “The vast majority of town and county residents agree that this is a bad use of this site.”

            He received a standing ovation from attendees at the meeting in Fauquier High School at the conclusion of his remarks.

            The northern Virginia region outside the nation's capital is home to the world's largest concentration of data centers, which house the computer servers and hardware required to support modern internet use, As data centers have expanded, community opposition has increased, and neighbors have expressed concern over noise from the fans required to keep the machines cool.

            Others express concerns about the data centers' need for electricity and the requirement to build high-voltage transmission lines to support them.

            Data centers have also been a revenue boon to local governments, and last month Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a plan for Amazon Web Services to invest $35 billion in new data centers across the state.

            In Warrenton, Amazon projects that about 50 workers will be employed at the data center. Supporters said the data center will generate about $900,000 in tax revenue for the town annually. 

            The permit approved by the town includes noise restrictions and bans construction of an electric substation on the site. Distribution lines from the off-site substation that will serve the data center must be constructed underground, according to the permit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811643,Serbian right-wingers rally against Western plan for Kosovo,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of Serbian nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Wednesday, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan to normalize ties with breakaway Kosovo and pulls out of negotiations.

            Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building in central Belgrade. The protesters are also strongly pro-Russian, and one banner read: “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”

            Serbian media reported that one group pushed though metal fences toward the entrance at the end of the rally but were prevented by riot police from reaching the door.











            The protest comes amid efforts by U.S. and European Union officials to mediate a solution for the long-standing dispute between Serbia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade does not recognize.

            Serbia has relied on Russia and China in its refusal to acknowledge Kosovo's independence, which is backed by Washington and most EU countries. Western officials fear Russia could use simmering tensions in Kosovo to try to destabilize the Balkans and avert some attention from the invasion of Ukraine.

            Serbia's populist president Vucic has said he was ready to consider the Western plan. Its provisions have not been published but it reportedly stipulates that Serbia would not object to Kosovo's membership in international institutions, including the United Nations.

            Pro-Russian right-wing groups in Serbia have demanded that Belgrade stop all negotiations over Kosovo and publish the plan. Vucic has said this would mean the end of Serbia's integration into the EU and the country's international isolation.

            Serbia formally seeks EU entry but Vucic has also nurtured close ties with Moscow. Serbia remains the only country in Europe that has not joined sanctions against Russia, though it has condemned the invasion. 

            Kosovo declared independence after a war in 1998-99 that killed around 13,000 people. Following an armed uprising by ethnic Albanian separatists, Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown that ended after a NATO bombing campaign.BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of Serbian nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Wednesday, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan to normalize ties with breakaway Kosovo and pulls out of negotiations.Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building in central Belgrade.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811644,Trump pick Malpass stepping down as head of the World Bank,"WASHINGTON (AP) — David Malpass is stepping down as president of the World Bank, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump nominated him to run the 189-nation agency.

            The anti-poverty lender said Wednesday that Malpass would be leaving by June 30. His five-year term was due to expire in April 2024.

            Malpass, an economist who earlier served as U.S. under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said in a statement that he had decided to pursue new challenges. 











            “With developing countries facing unprecedented crises, I’m proud that the Bank Group has responded with speed, scale, innovation, and impact,” he said. “The last four years have been some of the most meaningful of my career.”

            When he got the job, Malpass had been a critic of the World Bank, arguing that it had focused too much on its own expansion and not enough on its core mission of fighting poverty.

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen thanked Malpass for his service.

            “The world has benefited from his strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion, his vital work to assist the Afghan people, and his commitment to helping low-income countries'' reduce their debt burden. Yellen said in a statement. President Joe Biden can now nominate Malpass' successor. 

            Clemence Landers, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said Malpass focused considerable energy on helping developing countries’ deal with debts. 

            But under his leadership, she said, the bank “ceded a lot of space’’ to its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, and to regional development agencies. 

            “There are just a lot of things that the World Bank slightly missed the boat on,’’ she said, noting criticism that it had not been aggressive enough in backing projects to fight climate change or to help poor countries get access to COVID-19 vaccines.

            Malpass ran into criticism last year for seeming, in comments at a conference, to doubt the science that says the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming. He later apologized and said he had misspoken, noting that the bank routinely relies on climate science.WASHINGTON (AP) — David Malpass is stepping down as president of the World Bank, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump nominated him to run the 189-nation agency.The anti-poverty lender said Wednesday that Malpass would be leaving by June 30.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811646,"NJ's green goals for housing, cars, economy get pushback","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey aims to have its entire economy powered by clean energy, end the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and greatly accelerate a switch to electric heating of buildings by 2035 under a series of environmental initiatives announced Wednesday that are designed to make the state a national leader in clean energy.

            But the ambitious plans presented by Gov. Phil Murphy quickly drew pushback — not only from business groups who called them costly and ill-defined, but from some environmentalists who said they don’t move the state away from fossil fuel use quickly enough.

            During a speech at Rutgers University, the Democratic governor outlined six steps he said are necessary for the state to become “the next New Jersey.”











            They include moving up a goal to have the state's economy be 100% powered by clean energy by 2035 instead of the current target of 2050. Other measures aim to end the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles within that same time frame; install zero-carbon-emission heating and cooling systems in 400,000 homes and 20,000 businesses; and make 10% of all low-to-moderate income properties ready for electric heating and cooling by 2030.

            New Jersey would join California, New York and the European Union in ending gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

            “We are ready to take the next six big steps in our fight against climate change,” Murphy said, before quickly addressing the criticism he predicted would come. “Now, let me make one thing perfectly clear at the outset before the right-wing meme-makers go off: No one is coming for anyone’s gas stove. No one is walking into anyone’s kitchen. No one is going to be forced to do anything, in any way.”

            Murphy said the moves are about “giving consumers more choices and more chances to join us in creating a cleaner, more sustainable, and more affordable energy future.”

            They also include convening a study on the future of natural gas utilities with utilities regulators and others who would be affected; spending $70 million toward lowering consumer costs for medium- and heavy-duty electrified vehicles; and proposing new flood protection rules along rivers and coastlines.

            Critics wasted little time objecting to the proposals.

            The New Jersey Business and Industry Association said that requiring all electric vehicle sales within 12 years “seems impractical, if not impossible, when you consider the lack of charging infrastructure and planning for it.”

            “Such a policy also begs the obvious question of where all this increased power will be sourced from,” the association said in a written statement.

            The group also called natural gas “an essential fuel for both heating and electricity production.""

            ""It cannot simply be willed into non-existence, especially under expedited and arbitrary deadlines,” the statement said. 

            Several environmental groups also took issue with the proposals, saying New Jersey is not moving quickly or ambitiously enough to combat climate change and end fossil fuel use.

            Matt Smith of Food & Water Watch New Jersey said Murphy is not using his authority to stop new fossil fuel projects, with six recently approved and seven more pending.

            “You cannot tout your clean energy goals and build new sources of dirty energy at the same time,"" he said.

            Jeff Tittel, retired head of the New Jersey Sierra Club said the governor won't stop fossil fuel projects, “so this is just more hot air.""

            ""This proposal is more about public relations and his national political ambitions than it is about climate change,” Tittel said. 

            Amy Goldsmith, state director of Clean Water Action, said if the governor truly wants to become a national leader in clean energy, he needs to “stop advancing fossil fuel projects and move even faster towards comprehensive rule adoptions and a truly equitable green economy future.""

            Activists and residents of largely minority areas in Newark, Kearny and Woodbridge are battling proposed gas-fired power plants in their areas, and waiting for the state's environmental justice law to take full effect. Murphy said Wednesday the law could go into effect in April, a day after the state environmental protection agency set June as the implementation date.

            The initiatives also drew support from some environmental groups and solar panel providers.

            “Cars and trucks will be cleaner and more affordable, and many of the measures announced today will be supercharged by the Biden administration’s landmark clean energy plan,"" said Mary Barber, state director for the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Gov. Murphy sees the road ahead and is entrusting Garden State residents to make climate-friendly choices and put pedal to the metal in the 21st century economy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811649,Sharpton to DeSantis: Stop censoring Black history,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The Rev. Al Sharpton led a march to the Florida Capitol on Wednesday to protest Gov. Ron DeSantis' rejection of a high school African American history course, accusing the Republican of censoring a fundamental chapter of the nation's past.

            The civil rights leader walked through Tallahassee to the Statehouse with dozens of supporters who criticized the state's blocking of the Advanced Placement pilot course. 

            “Our children need to know the whole story. Not to not only know how bad you were, but to know how strong they are,"" Sharpton told the crowd, adding, “If you would study history, governor, you would have known to mess with us and education always ends in your defeat.”











            Ahead of an expected White House run, DeSantis has continued to focus on eliminating what he calls “woke” ideology in education, seizing on national flashpoints around what children learn about race, gender identity and history.

            Sharpton's appearance in Tallahassee signaled an elevation of the national scrutiny that has followed DeSantis during his time as governor and that has increased as he stakes out his position as a firebrand willing to lean into cultural divides. 

            
                The dispute began last month when Florida announced it was rejecting the College Board's course, saying it violated state law and was historically inaccurate. 

            The state argued that it promotes the idea that modern American society oppresses Black people, other minorities and women; includes a chapter on Black Queer Studies that the administration finds inappropriate; and uses articles by critics of capitalism.

            The College Board released a revised curriculum downplaying some components that had drawn criticism, a move that drew the ire of scholars and advocates on the left. The organization has since maintained that the changes were substantially complete before DeSantis made his objections. 

            The spat continued when the board issued a set of statements days apart that heavily criticized the DeSantis administration and apologized for not taking a stronger stance. The board has also said it is still awaiting clarification on exactly how the course violates Florida law. 

            “We deeply regret not immediately denouncing the Florida Department of Education’s slander, magnified by the DeSantis administration’s subsequent comments, that African American Studies 'lacks educational value.' Our failure to raise our voice betrayed Black scholars everywhere and those who have long toiled to build this remarkable field,” the board said in a statement. 

            A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education said Wednesday that the College Board had not yet submitted the official course framework for additional review. 

            DeSantis has begun suggesting this week that the state break away from the College Board and its Advanced Placement courses and instead contract with other educational organizations that maintain programs for high schoolers to gain college credit. 

            “Florida students are going to have that ability that is not going to be diminished, in fact we’re going to continue to work to expand it,"" DeSantis said, ""but it’s not clear to me that this particular operator is the one that’s going to need to be used in the future.”

            The rejection of the course has drawn national attention and led Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to announce that his state would expand the pilot course from one school to 26. 

            Like other Republicans and potential presidential candidates, DeSantis has taken an aggressive stance on education policy and moved to increase government control over what is taught in the classroom.

            Over the last year, he has signed a law critics call “ Don't Say Gay,” which bars lessons on sexual orientation or gender identity through the third grade as well as instruction deemed inappropriate, and also has approved what is known as the Stop WOKE Act, to restrict certain race-based conversations and analysis in schools and businesses. 

            More recently the governor announced plans to block state colleges from having programs on diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory. 

            He has also moved to reshape the once progressive New College of Florida, appointing six new trustees who are tasked with transforming it into a classical liberal arts school modeled after conservative favorite Hillsdale College in Michigan.

            Florida is weeks away from its regular legislative session, in which a Republican supermajority stands ready to deliver on the governor's conservative agenda. DeSantis is expected to use the session to stack up political victories that will form the platform for his potential 2024 presidential bid.TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The Rev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811650,Pence says he will fight subpoena as far as Supreme Court,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that he will challenge a subpoena by the special counsel overseeing Trump investigations to compel his testimony before a grand jury — pursuing it to the Supreme Court if necessary.

            Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by the Justice Department, is investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump spent the days before Jan. 6, 2021, aggressively pressuring Pence to reject the outcome, even though Pence had no power to do so. Pence was at the U.S. Capitol presiding over a joint session of Congress as Trump's supporters violently stormed the building that day.

            “Let me first be clear: I’m going to fight the Biden DOJ subpoena for me to appear before the grand jury because I believe it’s unconstitutional and it’s unprecedented,"" Pence told reporters in Iowa, the state that will hold the first contest of the 2024 nominating sequence. 











            “Never before in American history has a vice president been summoned to appear in court to testify against the president with whom they serve,"" he said. 

            Pence said he was prepared to take the case “as far as it needs to go, if needs be to the Supreme Court of the United States.”

            The posture marks an aggressive turn for Pence, who has been laying the groundwork for a likely presidential run. While it remains unclear whether Pence will succeed in delaying or limiting the scope of his testimony, the posture gives the former vice president a new opening to attack the Justice Department, which has become increasingly unpopular among conservatives, in part due to Trump's constant attacks.

            Indeed, Pence repeatedly criticized the department Wednesday, complaining of a ""two-tiered justice system that Republicans have been dealing with throughout the Biden administration.”

            The Associated Press previously reported that Pence was ready to contest Smith's demand for his appearance on constitutional grounds. He argues that because he was serving in his role as president of the Senate on Jan. 6, he is protected under the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause from being forced to testify. That provision is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts.

            A spokesman for Smith declined to comment. The Justice Department, which had earlier declined to comment on Pence’s subpoena, is expected to oppose the former vice president's efforts and make the case that his cooperation is essential.

            Pence noted during an earlier stop in Minneapolis that he had written and spoken extensively about Trump's efforts to pressure him to overturn the results of the election — something he did not have power to do — and has repeatedly denounced Trump's efforts as ""reckless"" and “dangerous.”

            “I have nothing to hide and I’m proud of what we accomplished. But for me, this is a moment where you have to decide where you stand, and I stand on the Constitution of the United States,” he said.

            He added that he expects Trump to try to assert executive privilege to block his own testimony. ""That’s not my fight. My fight is on the separation of powers,” Pence said. 

            Pence made his remarks after headlining events in Minneapolis and Cedar Rapids aimed at rallying conservative parents opposed to transgender-affirming policies in public schools. The events came as a federal appeals court was expected to hear oral arguments in St. Paul, Minnesota, in a case brought last summer by a national group representing parents of students in Linn-Mar Community School District in Marion, Iowa, near Cedar Rapids. 

            Parents Defending Education is trying to overturn a policy adopted by the school board last year allowing transgender students to request a gender support plan to begin socially transitioning at school without the permission of their parents. Pence’s advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, has filed an amicus brief in the case, as have dozens of mostly conservative groups and several conservative states.

            “Across the country, parents' rights are being trampled by a politically correct nanny state that’s ruining our schools and telling our parents that they have no role in their children’s most important decisions,” Pence said in Minneapolis, where he argued that parents must be informed of such decisions. “You do not craft a gender transition plan for my child without my knowledge or consent,"" he said.

            Though Pence says he has yet to make a decision about 2024, he has visited leadoff Iowa several times since the 2020 election. And his Wednesday event had the look and feel of a campaign stop, held in a pizza restaurant where candidates commonly hold court with voters.

            Pence is hoping to draw the support of social and religious conservatives in what could be a crowded primary contest that already includes Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who formally launched her campaign Wednesday.

            To that end, Pence's advocacy group launched a new campaign last week on the schools issue, a flashpoint for many on the right, as Haley and other presidential prospects, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, prepare for their own visits to the state this month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811651,Man City beats Arsenal to seize momentum in EPL title race,"LONDON (AP) — Manchester City seized the momentum in the Premier League title race after Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland scored second-half goals to secure a 3-1 win at Arsenal on Wednesday.

            Having trailed Arsenal by as much as eight points just weeks ago, City suddenly finds itself atop the table after the defending champions extended their recent dominance over the Gunners and showed they won’t relinquish the title easily.

            The win puts City in first place ahead of Arsenal on goal difference, although the Gunners still have a game in hand. More importantly, perhaps, it maintained a psychological edge over its title rival as City has now beaten Arsenal in 11 straight league matches.











            “We can all agree that (Arsenal) has been the best team this season, so to come to their place and play against them is not easy,"" Haaland said. “But we played an amazing game and we got the three really important points, and we’re in it again.”

            In a game that lived up to the billing of the biggest Premier League match of the season so far with moments of end-to-end action, City took the lead when Kevin de Bruyne capitalized on a defensive error in the 24th minute, before Bukayo Saka equalized from the penalty spot in the 42nd.

            Arsenal made a bright start but gave away the lead cheaply after City goalkeeper Ederson booted the ball up the field. Right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu tried to pass the ball back to Aaron Ramsdale but only hit it into the path of De Bruyne, who curled a lob over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the empty net.

            “I’ve never seen Tomiyasu make that pass back in seven years but he did it today,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.

            Minutes earlier, Eddie Nketiah had spurned the best chance of the game so far when Oleksandr Zinchenko picked him out in the box with a cross but the striker headed wide.

            But Arsenal kept pushing forward and the host’s pressure paid off when it was awarded a penalty for a foul by Ederson on Eddie Nketiah as the striker tried to shoot from a difficult angle. Saka calmly rolled the spot kick into the left corner after sending Ederson the wrong way.

            City improved after the break and thought it had a penalty early in the second half when Gabriel clumsily pulled down Haaland in the area, but the decision was overturned for an offside on the Norway striker.

            But City still retook the lead after another mistake by Gabriel, who turned the ball over in his own half. The visitors countered quickly and Ilkay Gundogan squared the ball for Grealish, who beat Ramsdale with a low shot that took a deflection off Tomiyasu.

            Haaland was fit to start after picking up a knock in the previous game against Aston Villa on Sunday and took his tally to 26 league goals this season when De Bruyne cut the ball back for the striker, who took one touch before slotting a shot into the far corner.

            Nketiah sent another header wide late on but that was the closest Arsenal came to pulling a goal back.

            “In the first half, they were much better than us. Second half, we were much, much better,"" City manager Pep Guardiola said. ""At halftime, we said we were not playing, just defending because they were so good, but we should be more active and the second half was excellent.”

            Arsenal has now gone three straight league games without a victory — losing two of those — after racking up 16 wins in the first 19 rounds of the season. The Gunners have dropped more points in those three games (8) than they did in the first 19 (7).

            Arteta said the defeat was largely self-inflicted.

            “It was an incredible battle between two teams and we just gave them the goals, absolutely gave them the goals and against this team, they’re going to destroy you,"" Arteta said. “On the other hand, we had three big, big chances and we didn’t put them away. That was the difference.”

            The game had originally been scheduled for October but was postponed because of a schedule reshuffling in the wake of the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811656,Dortmund’s Adeyemi gives Chelsea a lesson in finishing,"Borussia Dortmund will take a 1-0 lead to London for the second instalment of this intriguing contest in the last 16 of the Champions League. Chelsea’s first taste of the Westfalenstadion cauldron ended with a sense of bemusement that for all the glorious chances they created the victory was ultimately Dortmund’s.Edin Terzic’s side came into this game with a record of six wins from six in 2023 and that confidence ran through the team as the hosts dictated the tempo of the first half – even if they failed to convert that dominance into clearcut chances. The closest they came was when Sebastien Haller, spotted by captain Jude Bellingham, rippled the side-netting.Chelsea by contrast have won only once since the turn of the year but it was they who crafted the best chances, with most of them falling to Joao Felix. The Portuguese spurned two big chances before the break, striking the bar with the latter as a goal seemed certain. If the Atletico Madrid loanee could only add more goals to his game, he’d be one of the most feared forwards around.With Chelsea misfiring, the game was there to be won. It was time for a hero: step forward, Karim Adeyemi. The 21-year-old German had already rattled elite Premier League opposition this season, giving Joao Cancelo such a headache when Manchester City visited Dortmund in October that the now-Bayern Munich defender was put out of his misery at halftime by Pep Guardiola. Adeyemi didn’t score that night but the dye was cast.Fittingly, this game’s only goal followed a near miss at the other end, with Kai Havertz sending a glancing header flashing across goal from a Chelsea corner. Dortmund sensed their chance and broke at speed, Raphael Guerreiro found the jet-heeled Adeyemi, whose touch and searing pace left Chelsea's record signing Enzo Fernandez in his wake. He expertly rounded Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, and serenely slotted home. All in front of Germany coach Hansi Flick.It was a moment that showcased the best of Adeyemi’s skillset and the flash of attacking quality that this compelling game deserved. It also felt like a breakout moment for Adeyemi, who has struggled to adapt at Dortmund but has now scored in three straight games for the first time since making the switch from RB Salzburg last year. Bellingham noted his teammate’s ascent.“We’re really confident when it gets the ball one-on-one. When he really gets going there aren’t many people that can stop him,"" Dortmund captain Bellingham said about Adeyemi’s goal. ""He had a difficult start here but now he’s flying.""Chelsea coach Graham Potter seemed further than ever from becoming the first English coach to win in Germany since Bobby Robson led Newcastle to victory in Leverkusen in 2003. The Blues continued to push and Kalidou Koulibaly had a shot cleared off the line by Emre Can, but this felt like a night when Chelsea would never score as Dortmund demonstrated a resilience that has been missing in previous seasons, with Nico Schlotterbeck and Niklas Süle holding firm and goalkeeper Gregor Kobel singled out for praise post-match by Terzic for his commanding display.Chelsea could flip things back in their favor on March 7 but this should have been a night that they celebrated a Felix-inspired victory. Instead, it was about Dortmund’s spirit and Adeyemi’s cool head.",2023/2/15,,

I swear to you, we are ready for more than that,"" Damjan Knezevic of the ultranationalist People's Patrol said. Knezevic has admitted to having ties to Russia's Wagner mercenary group.Protesters went on to gather outside of a Belgrade police station to demand the release of those who had allegedly been detained in the protests, according to N1.Vucic accused protesters of receiving money and support from ""a foreign country"" in an interview for Serbia's Pink broadcaster.""I don't know whether they're pro-Russian, but I know that they're anti-Serbian,"" Vucic said of the protesters.""I don't need Wagner to tap me on the shoulder and tell me what I can and can't do,"" he said.Serbia has not heeded Western calls to formally impose sanctions on Moscow, but has condemned the invasion of Ukraine in multiple UN votes. On Friday, Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said that Belgrade's alignment with the European Union's foreign and defense policies is a ""condition above all conditions"" for joining the bloc.The demonstrations come amid Western efforts to resolve the status of Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Belgrade considers Kosovo to be part of its own territory.Vucic has said he was ready to consider the Western plan, which reportedly stipulates that Serbia would not object to Kosovo's membership in international institutions.Nationalist groups in Serbia demand the government end negotiations over Kosovo and publish the plan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811660,Messages: Officer often fed information to Proud Boys leader,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A police officer frequently provided Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio with internal information about law enforcement operations in the weeks before other members of his far-right extremist group stormed the U.S. Capitol, according to messages shown Wednesday at the trial of Tarrio and four associates.

            A federal prosecutor showed jurors a string of messages that Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond and Tarrio privately exchanged in the run-up to a mob's attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Lamond, an intelligence officer for the city’s police department, was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington for protests.

            Less than three weeks before the Jan. 6 riot, Lamond warned Tarrio that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service were “all spun up” over talk on an Infowars internet show that the Proud Boys planned to dress up as supporters of President Joe Biden on the Democrat's inauguration day.











            Justice Department prosecutor Conor Mulroe asked a government witness, FBI Special Agent Peter Dubrowski, how common it is for law enforcement to disclose internal information in that fashion.

            “I've never heard of it,” Dubrowski said.

            Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Capitol attack and charged with burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a historic Black church during a protest in December 2020. He was released from jail before the riot and wasn’t in Washington on Jan. 6.

            In a message to Tarrio on Dec. 25, 2020, Lamond said Metropolitan Police Department investigators had asked him to identify Tarrio from a photograph. He warned Tarrio that police may be seeking a warrant for his arrest.

            Later, on the day of his arrest, Tarrio posted a message to other Proud Boys leaders that said, “The warrant was just signed.”

            Before the trial started in January, Tarrio's attorneys said Lamond's testimony would be crucial for his defense, supporting Tarrio’s claims that he was looking to avoid violence. Mulroe said Lamond has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

            Tarrio's attorneys have accused prosecutors of bullying Lamond into keeping quiet by warning the officer he could be charged with obstructing the investigation into Tarrio, a Miami resident who was national chairman of the Proud Boys. Prosecutors deny that claim.

            Sabino Jauregui, one of Tarrio's attorneys, said other messages show Tarrio routinely cooperated with police and had provided Lamond with useful information. Jauregui said prosecutors “dragged (Lamond's) name through the mud” and falsely insinuated he is a “dirty cop"" who had an inappropriate relationship with Tarrio.

            “That was their theme over and over again,” Jauregui told U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly during a break in testimony.

            Lamond was placed on administrative leave by the police force in February 2022, according to Mark Schamel, an attorney for the officer. Schamel said Lamond aided in Tarrio's arrest for burning the Black Lives Matter banner. 

            In a statement Wednesday, Schamel said Lamond's job required him to communicate with a variety of groups protesting in Washington and his conduct “was appropriate and always focused on the protection of the citizens of Washington, DC.” 

            “At no time did Lt. Lamond ever assist or support the hateful and divisive agenda of any of the various groups that came to DC to protest,” Schamel said. “More importantly, Lt. Lamond is a decorated official who does not condone the hateful rhetoric or the illegal conduct on January 6th and was only communicating with these individuals because the mission required it.” 

            Tarrio and his four lieutenants are charged with seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said was a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power and keep former President Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 presidential election. Thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, disrupting a joint session of Congress for certifying the Electoral College vote.

            Proud Boys members describe the group as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” They often brawled with antifascist activists at rallies and protests for years before the Capitol attack. 

            In a message to Tarrio on Dec. 18, 2020, Lamond said other police investigators had asked him if the Proud Boys are racist. The officer said he told them that the group had Black and Latino members, “so not a racist thing.”

            “It's not being investigated by the FBI, though. Just us,” Lamond added.

            “Awesome,” Tarrio replied.

            In another exchange that day, Lamond asked Tarrio if he had called in an anonymous tip claiming responsibility for the flag burning.

            “I did more than that,” Tarrio responded. “It's on my social media.”

            In a message to Tarrio on Dec. 11, 2020, Lamond told him about the whereabouts of antifascist activists. The officer asked Tarrio if he should share that information with uniformed police officers or keep it to himself.

            Two days later, Tarrio asked Lamond what the police department's “general consensus” was about the Proud Boys.

            “That's too complicated for a text answer,"" Lamond replied. ""That's an in-person conversation over a beer.”

            Tarrio's co-defendants are Proud Boys chapter leader Ethan Nordean, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, a self-described Proud Boys organizer; Zachary Rehl, who led a Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia; and Dominic Pezzola, a group member from Rochester, New York.

            They are among a slew of Proud Boys members facing charges in the riot. In a separate case this week, the president of a West Virginia chapter of the group, Jeffrey Finley, was sentenced to 75 days behind bars after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor illegal entry charge. The Associated Press sent an email to Finley’s attorney seeking comment Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811661,Dortmund beats slumping Chelsea 1-0 in Champions League,"DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Lots of talent, but not the results to match. It's becoming a familiar story for Chelsea.

            Despite spending record sums on new signings, Chelsea fell short once again in a 1-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday and will need to improve in the second leg to avoid elimination in the Champions League round of 16.

            Karim Adeyemi sprinted the length of the field to score the only goal on a lightning counterattack after Chelsea created — and missed — many of the best chances.











            After Chelsea's João Félix missed a headed chance on a corner, the German team launched into the counter as Adeyemi surged down the field, beating Enzo Fernández before rounding goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and scoring into the empty net.

            Starting from the edge of his own penalty area, Adeyemi picked up the ball from a clearance and needed fewer than nine seconds to score at the other end. He celebrated with a backflip.

            Kalidou Koulibaly was at the heart of the Chelsea defense but nearly rescued a draw for his team at the other end. Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel couldn't hold Koulibaly's low shot in the 78th minute and the ball rolled onto the goal line before Emre Can hooked it away to keep Dortmund ahead.

            Fernández — Chelsea's expensive signing last month — nearly scored a last-gasp equalizer in stoppage time but the World Cup winner from Argentina saw his curling shot saved by Kobel.

            ""There was a bit of luck in there for us and a good performance from our goalkeeper,” Dortmund coach Edin Terzic told DAZN.

            It was Dortmund's seventh win in a row, while Chelsea has one victory from nine games overall in 2023 as manager Graham Potter tries to integrate new faces.

            ""It was a very strong performance from us, especially in the second half. Overall, we created a lot of chances, had a lot of efforts on goal,"" Potter told broadcaster BT Sport.

            “Of course we’re disappointed with the goal we conceded but I thought we were the dominant team in the second half. We need to regroup and attack the game at Stamford Bridge.""

            Chelsea was allowed to add only three of its nine January arrivals to its Champions League squad, but Félix, Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk were all in the starting lineup and all posed a threat.

            With Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly watching from the stands, Félix had the two best chances of a first half in which neither team had a shot on target. Thiago Silva put the ball into the net for Chelsea early on but used his hand to do it.

            Félix hit one chance over the goal and smashed another shot against the bar. Chelsea’s pace and danger on the counter had been clear since the second minute, when only a perfectly timed tackle from Nico Schlotterbeck stopped Mudryk going through on goal. Chelsea piled on more pressure early in the second half before Adeyemi's goal on the counter changed the game.

            Dortmund — captained by 19-year-old Jude Bellingham — was busy too, with Julian Brandt and then Adeyemi getting into good positions only to hesitate, allowing Chelsea defenders to block the shots.

            Sébastien Haller, making his European debut for Dortmund after missing all of the first half of the season while being treated for testicular cancer, struggled to make an impact against the Chelsea defense and hit his best chance against the side netting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811662,"Substances fuel record homeless deaths in Portland, Oregon","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A record 193 homeless people died in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, in 2021, a 53% increase compared with the previous year, according to a new county report released Wednesday.

            Substances contributed to about 60% of those deaths, the report found, mirroring trends seen across the country. 

            Similar to 2020, methamphetamine was the most common drug noted in the county's fatalities. But the number of deaths involving fentanyl, and a combination of opioids and meth, saw the biggest increases.











            “Polysubstance, meth and fentanyl are the key takeaways,” said county health officer Jennifer Vines, adding that fentanyl use exploded during the pandemic.

            “For a long time, we imagined that fentanyl was sort of a drug contaminant that people would kind of stumble upon accidentally, and it would be something that might move through the drug supply,” she said during a news conference. “What we weren't prepared for was simply the use of fentanyl as a drug that became cheap, that became highly available, and that is so potent and short-acting that people actually develop an addiction and seek out the drug itself.”

            Compared with 2020, the number of homeless deaths involving fentanyl jumped more than eightfold, from four to 36. Those stemming from combined opioid and meth use jumped from 27 to 47.

            Meth, however, remained the deadliest drug overall. It was involved in 93 deaths — 82% of substance fatalities — continuing the trend from 2020.

            County health officials said they have had difficulty responding to the spike in meth use because there is no medication that can reverse a meth overdose, the way that naloxone can reverse an opioid overdose.

            “It's been really hard and really scary,” said Haven Wheelock, program supervisor at Outside In, a Portland-based nonprofit that provides addiction and homelessness services. “For many years, it's been an uphill battle to have these conversations and to talk about overdose deaths as the public health crisis that it is, and homelessness as the crisis that it is.”

            The report relied on the findings of medical examiners, who tend to investigate non-natural deaths including those caused by suspicious or unknown circumstances, such as homicide and suicide, and those caused by injuries and accidents, such as overdoses. For that reason, the deaths in the report are likely an undercount, county health officials said.

            The number of homeless people who died by homicide more than doubled from 2020 to reach a new high of 18, accounting for nearly 10% of all homeless deaths. The majority involved guns. The increase tracks with a citywide trend in Portland, which has reported record homicides for the last two years amid a surge in gun violence.

            Extreme weather events were another notable factor in homeless deaths, the report found. Four people died during the devastating summer 2021 “heat dome,"" and eight people died of hypothermia during the winter months.

            Although 2021 was the first full year of the pandemic, only two homeless deaths were identified as being caused by COVID-19. But the report says this figure is likely an undercount, as medical examiners don't investigate the deaths of people hospitalized for more than 24 hours prior to a natural death. No COVID-19 deaths were identified by medical examiners in 2020.PORTLAND, Ore.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811663,FTX founder's bail signatories include 2 family friends,"NEW YORK (AP) — Two Stanford University academics signed on to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s $250 million bail package, enabling him to live with his parents while awaiting trial on fraud charges, court papers revealed Wednesday.

            Unsealed papers in Manhattan federal court showed that Larry Kramer, dean emeritus of Stanford Law School, and Andreas Paepcke, a senior research scientist at Stanford, pledged to pay a total of $700,000 if Bankman-Fried flees before facing trial on charges that he defrauded investors in his cryptocurrency trading platform.

            Kramer is on the hook for $500,000 while Paepcke has agreed to pay $200,000, court records show. Neither was required to post collateral for the “personal recognizance bond.” The names were ordered unsealed Wednesday by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan at the request of news organizations, including The Associated Press.











            Lawyers for Bankman-Fried had opposed the release of the names on the grounds that supporters of Bankman-Fried, including his parents, were likely to face threats.

            Bankman-Fried, 30, must return to court Thursday to satisfy Kaplan that he will not communicate with anyone or access any internet sites that cannot be monitored by federal prosecutors.

            The judge called a hearing about the bail package for the second week in a row. This time, Kaplan scheduled the hearing after prosecutors complained that Bankman-Fried had twice accessed an internet site that prevented the government from knowing exactly what he had done online.

            His lawyers, though, dismissed the venture onto a virtual private network as a step their client had taken to access two NFL championship games on Jan. 29 and Sunday's Super Bowl game.

Neither was required to post collateral for the “personal recognizance bond.” The names were ordered unsealed Wednesday by Judge Lewis A.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811664,FTX bankruptcy judge denies request for independent examiner,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — The judge presiding over the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has denied a request by the U.S. bankruptcy trustee to appoint an independent examiner in the case.

            The trustee, who serves as a government watchdog in Chapter 11 reorganizations, argued that the company’s financial affairs and business operations, including allegations of unprecedented fraud leading to its collapse, should be reviewed by a disinterested person, not left to an internal investigation. 

            But Judge John Dorsey rejected the request on Wednesday. He agreed with FTX and its official committee of unsecured creditors that an examiner’s work would be too costly and would duplicate investigations already under way by FTX’s new leadership, the creditors committee and several federal agencies.











            “There is no question that if an examiner is appointed, the cost of the examination, given the scope suggested by the trustee at the hearing, would be in the tens of millions of dollars and would likely exceed 100 million dollars,” Dorsey said.

            The judge noted that the goal of the bankruptcy is to return as much value as possible to FTX creditors and customers. “Every dollar spent in these cases on administrative expense is a dollar less to creditors,” he said.

            Dorsey also indicated that he has confidence in John Ray III, who replaced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried as CEO on the same day the company sought bankruptcy protection in November.

            “There is no question that Mr. Ray is completely independent of prior management and the companies he was appointed to lead,” Dorsey said, describing Ray as “highly qualified” and “a consummate professional.” The judge similarly expressed confidence in the independent directors appointed by Ray to oversee four silos of FTX business units during the bankruptcy.

            Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear in a New York courtroom on Thursday for a review of his bail conditions. Prosecutors have expressed concerns about Bankman-Fried accessing the internet using a virtual private network. They acknowledge that VPNs can be used for benign purposes but note that they also can be used to disguise data transfers and the use of international cryptocurrency exchanges.

            Bankman-Fried, 30, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he illegally diverted massive amounts of customer money from FTX to Alameda Research, his cryptocurrency hedge fund trading firm. He has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, after being released on a $250 million personal recognizance bond.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811665,"DeSantis signs migrant relocation, election fraud bills","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday signed bills to expand his migrant relocation program and enhance the prosecutorial power of his election police unit, furthering key components of his conservative agenda ahead of his expected White House run.

            Republican lawmakers in the GOP-dominated Legislature voted to approve the bills during a special session last week that centered on some of what have become signature priorities of the Republican governor. 

            One of the new laws creates a dedicated program in the governor’s office for migrant relocations and specifies that the state can transport migrants located anywhere in the country.











            The legislation is meant to quell legal questions that have surrounded a flight last year that the governor’s administration used to relocate a group of South American migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The trip was paid for using money legally intended to move migrants who were located in Florida, not any other states.

            The program is almost certain to facilitate future migrant flights as DeSantis continues a focus on cultural flashpoints such as immigration, as well as near constant criticism of the policies of Democratic President Joe Biden, on his way to an anticipated presidential bid.

            “Florida is using all tools available to protect our citizens from Biden’s open border policies,” DeSantis wrote on Twitter. “I am glad to have signed legislation to continue the program of transporting illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions. I thank the legislature for maintaining this valuable tool.”

            Republicans have argued the program would help migrants by taking them to sanctuary cities. Democrats slammed it as a political stunt meant to serve the governor’s national political ambitions.

            The other bill signed by the governor clarifies that the statewide prosecutor has authority to prosecute election crimes in federal and state races, a move aimed at strengthening DeSantis' election police unit. 

            DeSantis pushed for the creation of the election police unit last year to address Republican concerns about voter fraud, which have proliferated among conservatives following former President Donald Trump’s false claims that his reelection was stolen. The unit is housed in the governor’s department of state and reviews fraud allegations and conducts preliminary investigations, with a special group of state police officers who pursue violations. 

            Since its establishment, some of the voter fraud cases tied to the unit have been dismissed by judges who said the statewide prosecutor did not have jurisdiction to bring charges. 

            Democrats, the minority party in the statehouse, have said the election police unit could dissuade people from voting and is unnecessary given that local authorities can investigate such crimes.TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

(AP) — New Hampshire has reached its first settlement with someone who was physically and sexually assaulted at the state’s youth detention center, attorneys for the victim said Wednesday. 

            The state faces more than 700 lawsuits alleging abuse stretching back six decades at the Sununu Youth Services Center, formerly called the Youth Development Center. As an alternative to litigation, lawmakers established a $100 million settlement fund with a two-year application period that started last month.

            Attorneys at the Shaheen & Gordon law firm said Wednesday they have settled one claim so far on behalf of a male client who was abused at the Manchester facility in the 1970s. Noting that litigation could take years, they said they plan to withdraw their 39 other lawsuits and pursue claims through the settlement fund instead.











            “We look forward to helping obtain many more recoveries for these victims who have waited far too long for justice,” said attorney Anthony Carr.

            Under the settlement fund, victims of sexual assault are eligible for base awards ranging from $25,000 to $200,000 that can be increased based on the frequency of abuse plus nearly a dozen aggravating factors, including abuse that resulted in pregnancy, perpetration by multiple people or continued abuse for more than two years. Individual payments for sexual abuse will be limited to $1.5 million, while payments for physical abuse will be limited to $150,000.

            
                Ten men were charged in April 2021 with either sexually assaulting or acting as accomplices to the assault of more than a dozen teenagers from 1994 to 2007, while an 11th man faces charges related to a pre-trial facility in Concord.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s consumers rebounded last month from a weak holiday shopping season by boosting their spending at stores and restaurants at the fastest pace in almost two years, underscoring the economy’s resilience in the face of higher prices and multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Retail sales jumped 3% in January, after having sunk the previous two months. It was the largest one-month increase since March 2021. Driving the gain was a jump in car sales, along with healthy spending at restaurants, electronics stores and furniture outlets. Some of the supply shortages that had slowed auto production have eased, and more cars are gradually moving onto dealer lots.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health advisers say the overdose-reversal drug naloxone should be made available over the counter. It’s the latest government proposal to increase use of the medication against the opioid overdose crisis. The nasal spray version, Narcan, is already available without a prescription in all 50 states. But switching it to over-the-counter status would allow it to be sold in vending machines, supermarkets and other locations. The positive vote by an Food and Drug Administration advisory panel came despite difficulties understanding how to use the drug in a company study. FDA will make a final decision on the drug in coming weeks.

            McPlant Nuggets __ made from peas, corn and wheat with a tempura batter __ are the second product McDonald’s has co-developed with Beyond Meat, an El Segundo, California-based maker of plant-based meats. McDonald’s has been selling a McPlant burger since 2021.











            McDonald’s said the nationwide nugget rollout to more than 1,400 restaurants in Germany follows a limited-time test at nine restaurants in the Stuttgart area in August. McDonald’s will also start selling the McPlant burger in Germany next week.

            Availability of the McPlant nuggets and burger in future markets will depend on customer demand, McDonald’s said.

            European customers have generally been more receptive to McDonald’s plant-based meat products than those in the U.S. The McPlant burger is now a permanent menu item in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Austria and the Netherlands. Last month, McDonald's rolled out the Double McPlant burger in the U.K. and Ireland.

            But in the U.S., McDonald’s ended a test of the McPlant burger last summer without announcing any future plans for its sale.

            Beyond Meat began selling plant-based chicken in U.S. groceries in 2021. It has also co-developed plant-based tenders and nuggets with other chains, including KFC and Panda Express.McDonald’s McNuggets are going fowl-free.The Chicago-based fast food giant is introducing plant-based McNuggets next week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811670,Bears buy property for potential Arlington Heights stadium,"ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears on Wednesday bought the property that they’ve been sizing up for a new enclosed stadium in suburban Arlington Heights. 

            The Bears announced that they paid $197.2 million for the 326-acre plot.

            The team cautioned, however, that the purchase doesn’t mean plans for a new stadium and an entertainment district will come to fruition.











            ""There is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible,"" the Bears said in a statement.

            Soldier Field on Chicago's lakefront has been the Bears’ home since 1971. The team played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970, and if a new stadium is constructed, the franchise would have its name on the mortgage for the first time since arriving in Chicago.

            Economic analysts have said building a Bears entertainment district would create more than 48,000 jobs and generate $9.4 billion for the local economy.

            “The Bears will continue to work closely alongside the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding municipalities and their residents to solicit extensive feedback on how we can best benefit local communities and Bears fans across Illinois,” the statement said. “This planning will include a robust diversity, equity and inclusion program that prioritizes local hiring throughout every stage of the development.”

            The Bears envision restaurants, retail and more on the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field — all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.

            The Bears plan to pay for their stadium, but want taxpayer dollars to cover infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers.

            The city of Chicago proposed last summer enclosing Soldier Field and increasing its capacity from a league-low 61,500. But the Bears have insisted the only possibilities they were considering were for the Arlington Heights site.

            It will be up to new president and CEO Kevin Warren to help the Bears' vision for a new home become a reality. He was hired last month after spending three years as commissioner of the Big Ten.

            Warren, who's replacing the retiring Ted Phillips, worked in the NFL for more than two decades. He was part of Minnesota's front office from 2005-19, ascending to chief operating officer in 2015, and played a big role in the Vikings' construction of U.S. Bank Stadium.

            The Bears see that stadium, which opened in 2016, as a model for their potential new home, with its translucent roof and massive glass panels letting in enough light and air to make fans feel as if they’re outdoors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811671,Feds open civil rights probe after deputies shoot Black man,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it is investigating possible civil rights violations by a Mississippi sheriff’s department after a drug raid last month left a Black man with a bullet wound to the face. 

            There is a stark discrepancy in how police say the Jan. 24 incident unfolded and what lawyers for the family of Michael Corey Jenkins say occurred. The lawyers claim it was a racially motivated attack while police say the shooting occurred after someone pointed a gun at deputies during the late-night raid at a home in Rankin County, just east of the state capital of Jackson. 

            Attorneys for Jenkins, 32, say he was critically injured by Rankin County deputies. Jenkins was released from the hospital Tuesday and attended a news conference Wednesday, where he nodded affirmatively when his lawyer, Malik Shabazz, asked if deputies had beaten him and shot him in the mouth. 











            “This is deliberate. This is drawn out. This is unheard of,” Shabazz told reporters. 

            According to Shabazz, deputies never presented a warrant before forcing their way into the home. The deputies immediately subdued Jenkins and another man, Eddie Terrell Parker, who counted six officers and described all of them as white. Neither Jenkins nor Parker resisted, he said. 

            Parker said he was sitting in his bedroom at about 10 p.m. that night when he heard loud talking coming from the home’s living room. He said he opened his door and saw deputies in the hallway, and they immediately ordered him to get down on the floor.

            Over the course of 90 minutes, Parker and Jenkins said, they were beaten, shocked with Tasers and ordered to lie on their backs as deputies poured milk over their faces. Parker said he struggled “to keep breathing and keep from drowning at the same time.”

            “There was milk coming out of my nose, my mouth,” Parker told The Associated Press in an interview. “I’ve never been in that position and felt the way that I felt that night.”

            Jenkins, who has trouble speaking because of his injuries, told AP that he was on his knees at the end of the ordeal when one of the deputies stood over him. Shabazz said the deputy placed the barrel of a gun in Jenkins' mouth, it fired and the bullet exited behind one of Jenkins' ears.

            The Justice Department released a statement following the news conference, saying its civil rights division, along with local FBI agents and federal prosecutors in Mississippi, have opened a federal civil rights investigation. 

            Bailey Martin, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, said the state agency also is investigating the shooting. She declined further comment.

            In a news release on Jan. 25, the bureau said the deputies were conducting a narcotics investigation when they entered the home. The bureau said the shooting occurred after someone pointed a gun toward the deputies. The statement does not say whether a weapon was recovered at the scene. 

            Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey said in a statement that he immediately sought a state investigation. The sheriff’s office gave few details but said Jenkins was charged with assaulting an officer and drug possession. Parker has been charged with possession of paraphernalia and disorderly conduct. 

            ""Rest assured, if any deputy or suspect involved in this incident is found to have broken the law, he will be held accountable in accordance with the law,” the sheriff said. 

            Bailey did not respond to written questions about whether deputies had a warrant or if the deputies involved had been placed on administrative leave.JACKSON, Miss.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811672,2nd Amendment sanctuary measure overturned in Oregon,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Local governments in Oregon can’t declare themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries and ban police from enforcing certain gun laws, a state appeals court decided Wednesday, in the first court case filed over a concept that hundreds of U.S. counties have adopted in recent years. 

            The measure in question, which was approved in Columbia County, forbids local officials from enforcing most federal and state gun laws and would impose thousands of dollars in fines on those who try. 

            The state Court of Appeals ruled that it violates a law giving the state the power to regulate firearms. The ordinance would effectively, it found, “create a ‘patchwork quilt’ of firearms laws in Oregon, where firearms regulations that applied in some counties would not apply in Columbia County,” something lawmakers specifically wanted to avoid. 











            Second Amendment sanctuary resolutions have been adopted by some 1,200 local governments around the U.S., including in Virginia, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Illinois and Florida, experts say. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force like the one in Columbia County, a conservative, rural logging area in deep-blue Oregon. 

            The sanctuary movement took off around 2018 as states considered stricter gun laws in the wake of mass shootings, but it had not previously faced a major legal challenge. 

            The Oregon case was filed in 2021 under a provision in state law that allows a judge to examine a measure before it goes into effect. A trial court judge originally declined to rule, a decision that was appealed to the higher court. 

            The ordinance's supporters included the Oregon Firearms Federation, which said in a statement Wednesday that the ruling “calls into question the legitimacy of the court and the likelihood of getting fair rulings from it.” 

            Opponents included the legal arm of the group Everytown for Gun Safety, which had argued that the ordinance violated the U.S. Constitution. Eric Tirschwell, executive director of Everytown Law, called the court's decision “a win for public safety and the rule of law.”

            “Opponents of gun safety laws have every right to advocate for change at the ballot box, statehouse, or Congress, but claiming to nullify them at the local level is both unconstitutional and dangerous,” Tirschwell said. 

            State Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who has also sued two other Second Amendment sanctuary counties, also applauded the ruling. 

            “Today’s opinion by the Court of Appeals makes it clear that common sense requirements like safe storage and background checks apply throughout Oregon,” Rosenblum said. “Hopefully, other counties with similar measures on the books will see the writing on the wall.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811676,Benfica beats Brugge to extend Champions League unbeaten run,"BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) — Benfica remains a dangerous attacking team despite losing Enzo Fernández to Chelsea.

            João Mário scored from the penalty spot and substitute David Neres added a second goal with two minutes left Wednesday as Benfica took a step toward the Champions League quarterfinals with a 2-0 victory over Club Brugge in the first leg of their last 16 tie.

            Benfica players’ superior technical skills were on display throughout the evening and they made the most of nearly every possession to create danger. They could have left the Flanders city with even more room to breathe, but a bit of clumsiness up front cost them extra goals.











            João Mário put the visitors in the lead after 51 minutes and Neres made the most of a defensive error to make it 2-0 with a low finish.

            “When you play the first leg of a tie away from home and win, it’s a very good first step,"" Benfica coach Roger Schmidt said.

            Benfica is now unbeaten in its last eight games in the Champions League, with five wins and three draws. The victory over the Belgian champions marked the first time since the 2005-06 season that the Lisbon club has won three games in a row in the European competition.

            Brugge coach Scott Parker had included six players with a defensive profile in his starting XI, including the experienced Denis Odoi to add a calm presence in midfield.

            Odoi, however, was booked after just nine minutes for a reckless tackle, and his starting role did not prevent Benfica from creating the first chance. Brugge’s slack defending gave Nicolas Otamendi too much space in the box from a corner and Gonçalo Ramos followed up with a header from close range that was stopped by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet.

            Brugge did not panic and tried to respond with an aggressive pressing. The hosts were dangerous on the break and built confidence with a series of fine attacking moves.

            That was not enough to destabilize Benfica, though, and after 20 minutes the Portuguese team was in control.

            Schmidt’s players, however, wasted many good chances. First from close range, as Fredrik Aursnes missed the target after a good build-up and Antonio Silva headed the ball over the bar in the 26th. Rafa Silva then came close near the half-hour mark when he connected with a lofted ball in the back of Brugge defenders, hitting the post.

            Brugge thought it took the lead from a set piece in the 45th minute when Odoi’s header took a deflection and went in, but the goal was disallowed for an offside position.

            Benfica finally broke the deadlock after defender Jack Hendry fouled Ramos in the box. Joao Mario took the kick and found the net despite Mignolet’s effort to get his hands to the ball, which hit the bar before going in.

            “To be honest, I got lucky but it’s part of football,"" said João Mário, who has 17 goals so far this season in all competitions.

            The hosts’ reaction was not strong enough and the two-time European champions controlled the remainder of the game without getting threatened. Neres stole the ball from Bjorn Meijer in the closing stages and broke away to score from inside the box.

            Brugge, after qualifying from a tough group that included Porto, Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid, has won just one of its past 11 matches in all competitions.

            Brugge will travel to Lisbon for the return leg on March 7.

            “This kind of game is decided on details. As soon as you make a mistake, you pay for it,"" Brugge defender Clinton Mata said. “We must not throw everything away, we must remain positive, everything is possible in soccer.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811677,Michael Kors channels '70s New York chic for latest line,"NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Kors channeled classic '70s style for his latest collection, drawing inspiration from powerful women of the era like Tina Turner, Jane Fonda, Gloria Steinem and even his mother.

            Steinem sat front row Wednesday during Kors’ New York Fashion Week show, which featured models sporting a variety of classic New York looks from the decade, including overcoats and thick leather belts and bell sleeves and dramatic bell bottom trousers, oversized sunglasses, suede boots and fringe.

            “They never gave up on looking fabulous,” the designer said of his mother and Steinem. “That’s timeless.”











            The show was packed with elite guests: actors Mindy Kaling, Katie Holmes, Kate Hudson sat front row, as did New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour.

            “West Side Story” star Rachel Zegler said the show’s appeal was obvious because “nobody dresses women like Michael Kors.” 

            Keeping with his love of New York city style, Kors relied on neutral colors while still incorporating his signature black and adding brown tones. 

            Fringe was woven throughout the pieces onto scarfs, clutches and mini dresses. Kors also drew inspiration from Greenwich Village and what the designer called its “blend of the urban and bohemian.""

            “There is this polish that is a very big city but then definitely a warmth and earthiness,” he said.

            Kors’ looks weren’t just on the runway. Actor and dancer Maddie Ziegler wore a Kors suit — one of several stars wearing Kors pieces — and said the designer had a knack for designing a power suit tailor-made for women. 

            “It’s so sexy when a woman wears a suit,” she said.

            This collection, Kors took a twist with the women’s blazer by adding slits to the sides of each arm, giving the jacket sleeves more movement. 

            Kors didn’t shy away from adding sparkle despite the neutral tones throughout the collection. He balanced a sparkly silver bell bottom jumpsuit with a grey overcoat that hung off the shoulders. 

            The designer closed the show with an eye-catching shimmering black cape that actor Molly Ringwald adored. Ringwald said she appreciated how Kors’ clothes could be worn by any body type. 

            “I really feel like it’s really classic American in the best way,” she said of his collection.

Kathy Hochul and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour.“West Side Story” star Rachel Zegler said the show’s appeal was obvious because “nobody dresses women like Michael Kors.”Keeping with his love of New York city style, Kors relied on neutral colors while still incorporating his signature black and adding brown tones.Fringe was woven throughout the pieces onto scarfs, clutches and mini dresses. Kors also drew inspiration from Greenwich Village and what the designer called its “blend of the urban and bohemian.""“There is this polish that is a very big city but then definitely a warmth and earthiness,” he said.Kors’ looks weren’t just on the runway. Actor and dancer Maddie Ziegler wore a Kors suit — one of several stars wearing Kors pieces — and said the designer had a knack for designing a power suit tailor-made for women.“It’s so sexy when a woman wears a suit,” she said.This collection, Kors took a twist with the women’s blazer by adding slits to the sides of each arm, giving the jacket sleeves more movement.Kors didn’t shy away from adding sparkle despite the neutral tones throughout the collection. He balanced a sparkly silver bell bottom jumpsuit with a grey overcoat that hung off the shoulders.The designer closed the show with an eye-catching shimmering black cape that actor Molly Ringwald adored. Ringwald said she appreciated how Kors’ clothes could be worn by any body type.“I really feel like it’s really classic American in the best way,” she said of his collection.___Associated Press journalist Brooke Lefferts contributed to this report.",2023/2/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811679,Alabama 'close' to finishing nitrogen execution protocol,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — The head of Alabama's prison system said Wednesday that a protocol for using nitrogen gas to carry out executions should be finished this year.

            “We're close. We're close,” Alabama Commissioner John Hamm said of the new execution method that the state has been working to develop for several years. 

            He said the protocol “should be” finished by the end of the year. Hamm made the comment in response to a question from The Associated Press about the status of the new execution method. Once the protocol is finished, there would be litigation over the untested execution method before the state attempts to use it. 











            Nitrogen hypoxia is a proposed execution method in which death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, thereby depriving them of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions. Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi have authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia, but it has never been used to carry out a death sentence.

            Alabama lawmakers in 2018 approved legislation that authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an alternate execution method. Supporters said the state needed a new method as lethal injection drugs became difficult to obtain. Lawmakers theorized that death by nitrogen hypoxia could be a simpler and more humane execution method. But critics have likened the untested method to human experimentation.

            The state has disclosed little information about the new execution method. The Alabama Department of Corrections told a federal judge in 2021 that it had completed a “system” to use nitrogen gas but did not describe it.

            Although lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out death sentences, the legislation gave inmates a brief window to select nitrogen as their execution method. A number of inmates selected nitrogen.

            Hamm also said a review of the state's execution procedures should be completed, “probably within the next month.” 

            Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey requested a pause in executions to review procedures after lethal injections were halted. Ivey cited concerns for the victims and their families in ordering the review in Alabama. 

            “For the sake of the victims and their families, we’ve got to get this right,” Ivey said.

            A group of faith leaders last week urged Ivey to authorize an independent review of execution procedures, as Oklahoma and Tennessee did after a series of failed lethal injections in those states.MONTGOMERY, Ala.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811681,Native Americans grapple with Chiefs Super Bowl celebrations,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Moontee Sinquah spent only one minute onstage inside the Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix during the NFL's Super Bowl Opening Night. But it's a minute that will remain unforgettable.

            The Native American hoop dancer had never been that close to football players and coaches about to compete in the league's biggest game. As he and other Indigenous performers sang and danced, they heard elated whoops from Indigenous people in the audience.

            It gave Sinquah chills.











            “I’m just really grateful that they did highlight our people because I think it’s really important,"" said Sinquah, who is a member of the Hopi-Tewa and Choctaw nations. But when he thinks of that inclusion coupled with Super Bowl cameras panning to Kansas City Chiefs fans doing the maligned “tomahawk chop,” Sinquah says that juxtaposition leaves him “perplexed.”

            “I think that’s the only thing that really bothers me about that whole thing is that, and I don’t know where it came from. And I don’t really fully understand it, but it is almost like a mockery,” Sinquah said.

            The Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs embarked on their victory lap Wednesday, with players and fans alike doing the “chop” during a raucous parade and rally. Indigenous people are grappling with the national spotlight once again falling on the team’s mascot and fan “war chant” — which they deem racist. This past week in Arizona, where at least a quarter of the land base is tribal reservations, there's been a complicated mix of delight for the NFL involving Native and Indigenous cultures but disdain for those cultures being appropriated. 

            Fans of the Chiefs long ago adopted the chanting and arm movement symbolizing the brandishing of a tomahawk that began at Florida State University in the 1980s — though the school has an agreement with the Seminole tribe to use the moniker and tribal imagery. In 2020, the Chiefs banned headdresses and war paint in the stadium and pushed for cheerleaders to do the “chop” with a closed fist instead of an open hand. 

            There were plenty performing the chop in a red sea of fans in Chiefs gear along the parade route and in front of Kansas City's Union Station, where the parade ended. The team then closed out the rally by doing the “chop” in unison in a slurry of confetti. 

            Andrea Robinson, an 18-year-old psychology major at the University of Kansas, hollered while doing the open-handed chop with the crowd. 

            “I think we should keep it,” Robinson said. “I mean we need to be respectful about it. I understand but I mean it's a tradition.”

            David Cordray, a 38-year-old heating, cooling and refrigeration technician from Kansas City, Missouri, said he doesn't see the harm in the gesture or the mascot. He also pointed to changes such as the retirement of the live mascot, a horse named “Warpaint"" that a cheerleader would ride in the stadium after the team scored. Previously, a man donning a Native headdress rode the horse.

            “If they don’t think it is OK to do then maybe we should stop. But the Native Americans I’ve come in contact with have said that they didn’t have any issues with it. Basically it is all opinion-based,"" Cordray said. “We’ve gone a long way to make sure that we are respectful of everybody’s culture and being vigilant about it.”

            The origin of the Chiefs nickname may have more to do with the mayor who helped lure the franchise from Dallas in 1963 than any connection to Native Americans.

            Mayor H. Roe Bartle was a large man known as “The Chief” for his many years of leadership in the Boy Scouts. Team owner Lamar Hunt reportedly named the team the Chiefs in honor of Bartle.

            Even the connection with Bartle has undertones that some find offensive. Though he was white, Bartle started the “Mic-O-Say Tribe,” a youth camping organization that remains active and continues to use Native American attire and language. Young participants are “braves,” and the top leader is the “chief.”

            
                Chiefs President Mark Donovan said last week that Bartle obtained permission from the Northern Arapaho Tribe to use the term “chief."" Rhonda LeValdo, founder of the Kansas City-based Indigenous activist group Not In Our Honor, disputed that narrative.

            James Simermeyer, a member of the Coharie Tribe based in North Carolina, watched most of the game from his home in Baltimore. He appreciated the involvement of Sinquah's dance troupe and a University of Arizona student who is Navajo and deaf using Native American sign language during “America the Beautiful"" before the game. At the same time, it felt like “one step forward two steps back” when he heard the chant Kansas City fans do during the chop. 

            With the publicity around the Chiefs' win, Simermeyer said it's like an implicit condoning of all the things Native and Indigenous people find hurtful.

            “There’s no positive reason to support it. But it just kind of affirms the negative behavior that Kansas City fans are doing,” Simermeyer said. “I can’t imagine how many other people are out there and having the conversation with their non-Native colleagues about whether or not they’re offended by this.”KANSAS CITY, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811682,West Virginia advances campus gun bill despite student alarm,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia lawmakers voted Wednesday to advance a bill that would allow people with concealed carry permits to bring firearms on state college and university campuses, despite overwhelming opposition from frustrated students who came to the Capitol to testify against it. 

            Some higher education students traveled hours to Charleston to speak against the bill at a public hearing hosted by the House Judiciary Committee, which took place before lawmakers voted to advance the proposal to the full House. The bill was passed by the Senate last month, and has been publicly opposed by the leadership of the state's largest universities. 

            The bill advanced just two days after a shooting hundreds of miles away at Michigan State University that killed three people and wounded five others. The tragedy loomed over West Virginia's Capitol as lawmakers gathered to listen to the public hearing.











            Marshall University student E.T. Bowen said students are already “terrified on campus as it is.”

            “We don’t need more guns to exacerbate that. This bill is like throwing kerosene on the wildfire, and it is appalling that we even need to say that while there’s still blood on the ground at Michigan State,” Bowen said.

            Bowen told lawmakers, students will not forget “how casually you all have disregarded our safety and well-being in favor of profit and political gain.”

            Around 40 people — many of them students or faculty members — came to speak at the hearing against the proposal, which would allow people with a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver to bring the weapon on campus. The two people who spoke in support both represented organizations that advocate for gun owner rights. 

            The bill strictly prohibits the open carry of a firearm on a college or university campus, and allows institutions of higher learning to implement exceptions. It also prohibits people from bringing guns into areas with a capacity of more than 1,000 spectators — stadiums for football games, for example — or to on-campus daycare centers.

            Similar legislation has already passed in 11 other states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and Oregon.

            Before speaking against the bill, Dr. Jim McJunkin, a physician representing the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said his thoughts were with the Michigan State victims and their families. He expressed concern that having access to firearms on campus could increase students' suicide risk.

            Bella Mitchell, a senior at West Virginia University and a member of the Student Government Association, said the prospect of having guns allowed on campus “fosters an environment of mistrust, uncertainty and anxiety.”

            “We feel as though it’s completely unnecessary,” she said.

            Keeley Wildman read a statement for her sister, who was a freshman at Philip Barbour High School in the small West Virginia town of Philippi, where a 14-year-old boy, armed with a handgun, took a teacher and several classmates hostage in 2015.

            She described seeing law enforcement surround the school and hiding in a closet with strangers as they received texts and calls from family members.

            “In the following years, which were supposed to be the best of my life, I never felt safe at school,” Wildman said, at one point wiping tears from her eyes as she read her sister’s account. “I experienced panic attacks, nightmares and increased anxiety.” 

            But supporters of the legislation said they're worried about gun violence on campus, too, and they think allowing people with concealed carry permits to carry weapons would help. 

            Art Thomm, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, told lawmakers the shooting at Michigan State is exactly why people with concealed carry permits should be permitted to have guns on campus. The Michigan shooting was perpetrated in an area where guns are not allowed by a person who was not connected with the university and obtained the weapon illegally, he said.

            “Our loved ones deserve the right to defend themselves from a deadly attack in a gun-free zone without having to make the choice of employment, education or their life,"" he said. 

            Before voting to advance the bill, supporter Republican Del. Mike Honaker spoke about his experience responding to the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech as a former Virginia State Police officer. With two other officers, the Marine Corps veteran was responsible for making half of the death notifications to the 32 families who lost loved ones.

            “I know we have to be careful about this issue,” he said. “But there’s no way that I, as someone who has lived through this and seen it with my own eyes, could forbid another free law-abiding American citizen from carrying a firearm and retaining the ability and the capacity to defend yourself or others, God forbid they ever be put in a position to do it.”

            The bill would allow exceptions in rooms where a student or employee disciplinary proceeding is being held, and says guns can be restricted in specifically designated areas where patient care or mental health counseling is being provided.

            Schools would be permitted to regulate firearms in residence halls, but not in common areas, including lounges, dining areas and study areas. The bill requires colleges and universities to provide either a secure location for storage of a pistol or revolver in at least one on-campus residence hall — or to make safes available in residence rooms, which could come with a fee.CHARLESTON, W.Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811684,Tiger Woods had a tough time at Riviera even when healthy,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods made it through 16 holes of his pro-am Wednesday at the Genesis Invitational on a bitterly cold morning with occasional 25 mph gusts that made the temperature feel like the upper 30s.

            What mattered, at least for now, was how he finished. He didn't play the last two holes at Riviera, but after shaking hands with his amateur partners, he had no trouble climbing the 52 steps that lead to the clubhouse.

            There will be no stopping on Thursday when Woods competes against a full field of the world's best players for the first time since missing the cut at St. Andrews in the British Open.











            The plantar fasciitis that kept him from playing in the Bahamas in December is doing better. He said his ankle, badly injured from his February 2021 car crash outside Los Angeles, is his biggest concern. There's also that matter of rust.

            “But I've come off a rusty situation before and I've done well,” Woods said Tuesday during his news conference.

            He returned from knee surgery at the end of 2002 and won in his first start at Torrey Pines. He once took 10 weeks off after the 2007 tour season ended and won his World Challenge by seven shots.

            He was younger, healthier and in his prime. His swing looks as efficient as ever, particularly with his irons. For Woods, it's about getting to the next shot on a pair of legs that have been battered over the years.

            And then there's the matter of the golf course.

            Riviera is among his favorite designs, but the love affair ends there. Woods stopped playing this tournament after 2006, primarily because he rarely had good results. He alluded to that when he talked about his preparation for the Genesis Invitational.

            “Plus, I know this golf course,” he said, pausing to smile before adding, “I know I haven't had a lot of success on this golf course. But I knew what to practice for, shots to hit at home getting ready.”

            It really is a mystery.

            Woods has never played more times on a PGA Tour course without winning — 11 appearances at Riviera as a pro, with only one chance at winning. That was in 1999, when he tied for second, two shots behind Ernie Els.

            Most telling was his greatest stretch in golf. From the end of August 1999 through March the following year, Woods either won or finished second in 10 out of the 11 PGA Tour events he played.

            The exception? He tied for 18th at Riviera.

            “This may be an anomaly, and the only one in his whole career maybe,” said Adam Scott, who has two wins and two runner-up finishes at Riviera. ""It's a little bit unexplainable. I don't know what to say about that. Over his career, there's been only strengths, really. This course is quite demanding from the second shot in, and he's certainly capable of handling it.

            “I don't know if he just doesn’t feel it here or what it is,” Scott added. “But I’ll share some tips with him if he shares some tips on how to win a few majors with me.”

            The issue for everyone Wednesday was the cold and wind, though that might be the worst of it. It was gusting to 25 mph (40 kph) in the morning. Woods hit driver and a fairway metal into the frigid wind on the 458-yard ninth hole and plugged in a front bunker, some 10 yards short of reaching the green.

            That elicited little more than laugh, and another one followed when he blasted out right as a ball from one of his amateurs zipped near his legs and into the bunker.

            “Lot going on here,” Woods said with a chuckle.

            The field is the strongest of the year to date with a $20 million purse, though Riviera is so pure it always attracted the best players. Nineteen of the top 20 in the world ranking are playing (Woods is No. 1,294), the exception being Cameron Smith, who is suspended for signing with the Saudi-funded rival league at LIV Golf.

            Also missing is Joaquin Niemann, the defending champion, who joined LIV Golf in August. Woods is the tournament host of the Genesis Invitational and presented Niemann with the trophy last year.

            He would like to take home the trophy himself, even against such long odds.

            Max Homa received the trophy from Woods two years ago, one of the best memories he's ever had as a guy who grew up in the LA area and who grew up idolizing Woods.

            How to explain Woods not winning at Riviera given his sublime iron play? Homa found himself trying to answer that while playing the course Wednesday.

            “It makes absolutely no sense,” Homa said.

            He thought about courses Woods has dominated, such as Bay Hill, where the second shot is so critical, like at Riviera.

            “So when you come here ... I would have thought he won 10 times,” Homa said. “That one's a mystery to me. This seems like it would be a playground to him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811686,Braves' Acuña gets quick start to year of high expectations,"Atlanta Braves right fielder Ronald Acuña Jr. has been cleared to play in the World Baseball Classic and was taking swings at the team's spring training camp on Wednesday, getting an early start on a season with high expectations.

            Acuña hit .266 with 15 homers and drove in 50 runs in 119 games in 2022 after sustaining a season-ending torn ligament in his right knee on July 10, 2021. Acuña played through knee pain last season and at times was used as the team's designated hitter.

            Now the Braves' three-time All-Star is looking forward to a pain-free season with hopes of returning to his 2019 peak form, when he .280 with 41 homers and 101 RBIs and led the NL with 37 stolen bases.











            “I’m just beyond excited and happy,” Acuña said through a translator last month at the Braves Fest fan event at Truist Park. “I think my face says it all. I think it’s beyond two years at this point since I’ve felt completely healthy, so I’m beyond excited.”

            The Braves at first planned to keep Acuña out of the WBC. The team was persuaded there's no reason he can't take a break from his normal spring training schedule to represent his native Venezuela in the WBC, assuming he has no setbacks. 

            “Me personally, I’ve always wanted to represent my team and play in the Classic,” Acuña said.

            A healthy Acuña is especially important as the five-time defending NL East champion Braves look to replace Dansby Swanson at shortstop and search for a starter in left field.

            “I expect him to be better than the 2019 Ronald,” said second baseman Ozzie Albies. “When he went all off. I think he’s going to have a big year this year. ... Last year he came back kind of still playing not 100%. We talked to him and he said he feels better. He’s going to have a crazy year.”

            Among other Atlanta position players reporting to camp early: Albies, 1B Matt Olson, 3B Austin Riley, CF Michael Harris II and OFs Sam Hilliard, Kevin Pillar and Eli White.

            SHOOTING FOR THE STARS

            New York manager Aaron Boone said it is too early to say if the Yankees have closed the gap with the World Series champion Houston Astros.

            The Yankees kept slugger Aaron Judge, signing him to a $360 million, nine-year contract, and added free agent left-hander Carlos Rodón with a $162 million, six-year deal. Infielder DJ LeMahieu, who missed the 2022 postseason with a right toe injury, is expected to be ready for opening day.

            Houston swept New York in last year's American League Championship Series, the third time since 2017 the Astros advanced to the World Series by defeating the Yankees.

            “We can talk about closing the gap but right now that’s all talk,” Boone said. “We’ll see. We’re in February. We’ve got a long way to go to even get that opportunity to find out if we get to play in the playoffs and have that crack again. We feel like that’s our expectation.”

            The Yankees haven’t won the World Series since 2009.

            “I feel like every year that I’ve been here we’ve gone in with the ideal that we want to be a championship team,” Boone said. “Feel like it was a reasonable goal, but obviously we haven’t done it yet There’s been some teams, namely the Astros, that have been a nemesis that have knocked us off a couple times, and they’ve kind of set the standard right now certainly in the American League.”

            Boone said the Astros last year had “probably as good a pitching staff as we’ve faced in any run that we’ve had in the playoffs.”

            SETBACK FOR STRASBURG

            Washington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg, a three-time All-Star and 2019 World Series MVP, did not report with other pitchers following a recent setback in his comeback from a 2021 operation to correct thoracic outlet syndrome.

            Strasburg, 34, had a nerve-related setback in a recent bullpen session, MLB.com reported. He made only one start in 2022, giving up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings in a loss at Miami on June 9. His history of health problems created an uncertain outlook for his chances to return to the rotation in 2023.

            Strasburg has thrown a total of 31 1/3 innings across just eight starts over the past three seasons. He had carpal tunnel surgery in 2020.

            SORENESS FOR DEGROM

            New Texas Rangers ace Jacob deGrom already has experienced his first physical setback with the team. On a cool day at the team's first day of camp in Arizona, deGrom was held back after experiencing soreness in his left side. 

            General manager Chris Young said deGrom experienced the discomfort two days ago and said the decision to hold back the right-hander a day or two was precautionary. Even so, the development caused concern as deGrom's last two seasons with the New York Mets were substantially shortened by injuries.

            The Rangers signed deGrom to a $185 million, five-year deal on Dec. 3.

            TEAM RUBIO STYLE

            Mets closer Edwin Díaz reported to camp ready to represent Puerto Rico in the WBC. In honor of “Team Rubio,” Díaz has his hair dyed blond for the Classic.

The team was persuaded there's no reason he can't take a break from his normal spring training schedule to represent his native Venezuela in the WBC, assuming he has no setbacks.“Me personally, I’ve always wanted to represent my team and play in the Classic,” Acuña said.A healthy Acuña is especially important as the five-time defending NL East champion Braves look to replace Dansby Swanson at shortstop and search for a starter in left field.“I expect him to be better than the 2019 Ronald,” said second baseman Ozzie Albies. “When he went all off. I think he’s going to have a big year this year. ... Last year he came back kind of still playing not 100%. We talked to him and he said he feels better. He’s going to have a crazy year.”Among other Atlanta position players reporting to camp early: Albies, 1B Matt Olson, 3B Austin Riley, CF Michael Harris II and OFs Sam Hilliard, Kevin Pillar and Eli White.SHOOTING FOR THE STARSNew York manager Aaron Boone said it is too early to say if the Yankees have closed the gap with the World Series champion Houston Astros.The Yankees kept slugger Aaron Judge, signing him to a $360 million, nine-year contract, and added free agent left-hander Carlos Rodón with a $162 million, six-year deal. Infielder DJ LeMahieu, who missed the 2022 postseason with a right toe injury, is expected to be ready for opening day.Houston swept New York in last year's American League Championship Series, the third time since 2017 the Astros advanced to the World Series by defeating the Yankees.“We can talk about closing the gap but right now that’s all talk,” Boone said. “We’ll see. We’re in February. We’ve got a long way to go to even get that opportunity to find out if we get to play in the playoffs and have that crack again. We feel like that’s our expectation.”The Yankees haven’t won the World Series since 2009.“I feel like every year that I’ve been here we’ve gone in with the ideal that we want to be a championship team,” Boone said. “Feel like it was a reasonable goal, but obviously we haven’t done it yet There’s been some teams, namely the Astros, that have been a nemesis that have knocked us off a couple times, and they’ve kind of set the standard right now certainly in the American League.”Boone said the Astros last year had “probably as good a pitching staff as we’ve faced in any run that we’ve had in the playoffs.”SETBACK FOR STRASBURGWashington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg, a three-time All-Star and 2019 World Series MVP, did not report with other pitchers following a recent setback in his comeback from a 2021 operation to correct thoracic outlet syndrome.Strasburg, 34, had a nerve-related setback in a recent bullpen session, MLB.com reported. He made only one start in 2022, giving up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings in a loss at Miami on June 9. His history of health problems created an uncertain outlook for his chances to return to the rotation in 2023.Strasburg has thrown a total of 31 1/3 innings across just eight starts over the past three seasons. He had carpal tunnel surgery in 2020.SORENESS FOR DEGROMNew Texas Rangers ace Jacob deGrom already has experienced his first physical setback with the team. On a cool day at the team's first day of camp in Arizona, deGrom was held back after experiencing soreness in his left side.General manager Chris Young said deGrom experienced the discomfort two days ago and said the decision to hold back the right-hander a day or two was precautionary. Even so, the development caused concern as deGrom's last two seasons with the New York Mets were substantially shortened by injuries.The Rangers signed deGrom to a $185 million, five-year deal on Dec. 3.TEAM RUBIO STYLEMets closer Edwin Díaz reported to camp ready to represent Puerto Rico in the WBC. In honor of “Team Rubio,” Díaz has his hair dyed blond for the Classic.___AP Freelance Writer Mark Didtler contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811687,"Review: 'Marlowe,' with Neeson, resurrects a vintage gumshoe","The richly hard-boiled terrain of detective Philip Marlowe has always been, to quote Raymond Chandler, “a nice neighborhood to have bad habits in.”

            Chandler's Los Angeles gumshoe has stretched across some of the most fertile decades of American cinema, from Howard Hawks' seductively cryptic “The Big Sleep” (1946) to Robert Altman's “The Long Goodbye” (1973). Having been played by Humphrey Bogart, Dick Powell, Robert Mitchum and Elliot Gould, among others, he's less a character than a legacy to be passed down, like a cherished dark fedora.

            But it’s been a long time, almost half a century, since Marlowe was notably portrayed on the big screen. “Marlowe,” with Liam Neeson as the private eye, is a reclamation project, a bid to recapture some old-school, tough-talking movie magic. And, intriguingly, “Marlowe” is not taken directly from Chandler. It’s instead an original (albeit deeply faithful) interpretation of the character penned by William Monahan (screenwriter of “The Departed”), adapted from John Banville's 2014 book, “The Black-Eyed Blonde: A Philip Marlowe Novel.""











            The urge for imitation is an understandably strong one. Who wouldn't want to write sentences like: “She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.” And “Marlowe” seemingly has all the requisite trappings. Venetian blinds. Femme fatales. The sinister underbelly of polite society. So why does — to paraphrase Chandler again — “Marlowe” mostly just kill time and die hard?

            The film, which opens Friday in theaters, is a handsomely made period piece crafted with obvious affection for film noir by the veteran director Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game""), plus a top flight cast including Neeson, Diane Kruger, Jessica Lange, Danny Huston and Alan Cumming. Yet “Marlowe,” enveloped with a strong smell of mothballs, feels like an old pinstripe suit that's been taken out of the closet for no apparent reason. Neeson's Marlowe punches harder, but that's about all that distinguishes the film, which has made surprisingly little effort to reconsider Marlowe from a new perspective. Marlowe feels more like a mummy purposelessly raised from the dead.

            The year is 1939, which happens to be when Chandler's flatfoot debuted on the page, in “The Big Sleep.” We're back in early Los Angeles, a still deeply intoxicating moment in pre-freeway California. Unfortunately, as delicious as some settings here can be — iced tea sipping on a veranda, a lush neon-signed nightclub — “Marlowe” was largely shot in Dublin and Barcelona, robbing the tale of possibly its most important character: Los Angeles.

            Like countless private eye tales before it, “Marlowe” opens with a mysterious woman — Clare Cavendish, an Irish-American heiress — enlisting a detective (Marlowe, naturally) for a job. She wants him to find her lost lover (François Arnaud), a search that leads Marlowe to an exclusive members' club that has some very vicious things going on behind closed doors. It's overseen by the wide-smiling Floyd Hanson (a brightly brutish Huston), whose toothy grin barely disguises his underlying menace. Like Marlowe, he's a veteran of the war, and if anything sticks in this stale tale, it's the way he shrugs off past horrors while carrying them into daily life. “We're alive and others are not, and it's a pleasant morning,” he neatly summarizes to Marlowe. 

            What else works? Lange gets a few fine scenes as Cavendish's mother, Dorothy Quincannon, a former Hollywood star whose daughter was played in the papers as her niece, so as not to age her. There are some hints of a potentially absorbing mother-daughter femme fatale twist. But “Marlowe” lacks both a meaningful mystery for Marlowe or a narrative as lusciously oblique as “The Big Sleep.” There are some decent stabs at visual poetry by cinematographer Xavi Gimenez but they blend into the film's sepia wash of yellow. The language occasionally pops — Cumming's gangster quotes from “The Elements of Style” — but those attempts feel forced. 

            And as much as Neeson might seem to have the special set of skills required to play Marlowe, his detective feels hollow and maybe a little too tired. Neeson can be a man of rugged force on screen, of course, but his thin growl is less suited to hard-boiled poetry than you would think. No, the best Marlowe is still the first: Dick Powell in 1944's “Murder, My Sweet,” adapted from Chandler's “Farewell, My Lovely.” It takes a droller detective to make Marlowe sing in lines like: “I caught the blackjack right behind my ear. A black pool opened up at my feet. I dived in. It had no bottom. I felt pretty good — like an amputated leg.”

            ""Marlowe,” a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, violent content, some sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 110 minutes. Two stars out of four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811689,GOP subpoenas tech CEOs as part of probe into censorship,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Subpoenas were sent to the chief executives of the five largest tech companies on Wednesday as congressional Republicans moved to investigate what they assert is widespread corporate censorship of conservative voices.

            Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, issued the subpoenas as the latest in a series of escalations by a party that has long promised to investigate Big Tech's content moderation, especially when it came to COVID-19. 

            The letters were sent to Mark Zuckerberg of Meta; Sundar Pichai of Alphabet; Satya Nadella of Microsoft; Tim Cook of Apple; and Andy Jassy of Amazon.com. 











            And in them, Jordan outlined the committee's objective to ""understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and their intermediaries to censor speech.” 

            Spokespeople for Microsoft and Meta said Wednesday that they have already begun producing documents. Requests for comment from Apple, Alphabet and Amazon was not immediately returned. 

            The committee asked the companies to produce documents and communications by March 23 that show any communication between them and the executive branch of the U.S. government relating to moderation, deletion, suppression or reduced circulation of content.

            Notably missing from the list of companies subpoenaed is Twitter. The new owner, Tesla founder Elon Musk, has proven to be more sympathetic to conservatives than Twitter's previous administration.

            Just last week, three former Twitter executives appeared before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee to testify about the company’s decision to initially block a New York Post article in October 2020 about the contents of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. 

            The former employees conceded in that hearing that they made a mistake by blocking a story about the president’s son, from the social media platform in the run-up to the 2020 election, but adamantly denied GOP assertions they were pressured by Democrats and law enforcement to suppress the story.

            In Wednesday's letter, Jordan outlined how Musk’s decision last year to release a slew of company information to independent journalists “have exposed how Big Tech and the federal government have worked hand ways that undermine First Amendment principles.”

            The documents and data, titled “the Twitter Files,” largely show internal debates among employees over the decision to temporarily censor links to the Hunter Biden story. The tweet threads lacked substantial evidence of a targeted influence campaign from Democrats or the FBI, which has denied any involvement in Twitter’s decision-making.

            The hearing and subsequent subpoenas this month continue a yearslong trend of GOP leaders calling tech company leaders to testify about alleged political bias. Democrats, meanwhile, have pressed the companies on the spread of hate speech and misinformation on their platforms.WASHINGTON (AP) — Subpoenas were sent to the chief executives of the five largest tech companies on Wednesday as congressional Republicans moved to investigate what they assert is widespread corporate censorship of conservative voices.Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811692,Texas prosecutor drops domestic violence case against Beard,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A Texas prosecutor on Wednesday moved to dismiss a felony domestic violence case against former Texas basketball coach Chris Beard, in part because of the alleged victim’s wishes not to prosecute. 

            Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza said that “after a careful and thorough review of the evidence” and considering the wishes of Randi Trew, Beard's fiancée, his office determined the charge of assault by strangulation/suffocation-family violence could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

            Beard was arrested Dec. 12 after Trew called 911 and told officers that Beard strangled, bit and hit her during a confrontation in his home. She later said Beard didn't choke her, and that he defended himself from her. She added that she never intended him to be arrested and prosecuted.











            “Everyone knows that Coach Beard has maintained his absolute innocence since the moment he was arrested,” said Perry Minton, Beard's attorney. “Additionally, this district attorney has a well-earned reputation for being very tough regarding domestic violence cases. The fact that Mr. Garza’s review resulted in this determination so quickly says a lot. We are very pleased.”

            The Associated Press does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual abuse or domestic violence, but Trew issued a public statement on Dec. 23 about Beard's arrest and their fight that night, disputing several elements of the initial police account. 

            The third-degree felony charge carried a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison if prosecutors had pressed the case to conviction. 

            “Our office takes all domestic abuse cases seriously to ensure justice for the victims,” Garza said. “In every case, we are obligated to evaluate the facts and evidence and do our best to reach an outcome that will keep the victim and our community safe.”

            Garza also defended his office's record of pursuing domestic violence cases, noting his office has secured more than 1,000 convictions in family violence cases since 2021, with more than 200 people going to prison.

            According to the police affidavit in support of Beard’s arrest, Trew initially told officers he strangled her from behind to the point where she couldn’t breathe for several seconds. The affidavit listed several visible signs of an altercation, including bite marks on her arm and abrasions on her face and leg.

            According to the affidavit, Trew initally told police “he choked me, bit me, bruises all over my leg, throwing me around and going nuts.” Her later statement did not address why she called 911 or several of the physical injuries described in the police report.

            Texas suspended Beard without pay the day he was arrested. He was fired on Jan. 5 when Texas officials told Beard's attorney he was “unfit” to lead the program.

            
                Texas has been led by interim coach Rodney Terry since Dec. 12. The Longhorns are ranked No. 6 and share first place in the Big 12.

            A University of Texas spokesman declined comment Wednesday.

            Beard had five years left on a seven-year guaranteed contract that included a provision saying he could be fired for cause if he was charged with a felony or committed other behavior unbecoming of his position or that reflected poorly on the university.

            The university’s vice president of legal affairs, Jim Davis, wrote in a letter to Beard’s attorney on the day the coach was fired that Beard engaged in “unacceptable behavior that makes him unfit to serve as head coach at our university.”

            Whether prosecutors continue with the case does not determine whether Beard engaged in conduct unbecoming of the school, Davis wrote.

The affidavit listed several visible signs of an altercation, including bite marks on her arm and abrasions on her face and leg.According to the affidavit, Trew initally told police “he choked me, bit me, bruises all over my leg, throwing me around and going nuts.” Her later statement did not address why she called 911 or several of the physical injuries described in the police report.Texas suspended Beard without pay the day he was arrested. He was fired on Jan. 5 when Texas officials told Beard's attorney he was “unfit” to lead the program.Texas has been led by interim coach Rodney Terry since Dec. 12. The Longhorns are ranked No. 6 and share first place in the Big 12.A University of Texas spokesman declined comment Wednesday.Beard had five years left on a seven-year guaranteed contract that included a provision saying he could be fired for cause if he was charged with a felony or committed other behavior unbecoming of his position or that reflected poorly on the university.The university’s vice president of legal affairs, Jim Davis, wrote in a letter to Beard’s attorney on the day the coach was fired that Beard engaged in “unacceptable behavior that makes him unfit to serve as head coach at our university.”Whether prosecutors continue with the case does not determine whether Beard engaged in conduct unbecoming of the school, Davis wrote.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/2/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811693,Benzema surpasses Raúl as Madrid beats last-place Elche,"MADRID (AP) — Karim Benzema converted two first-half penalty kicks in Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Elche on Wednesday and became the team’s second-highest scorer in the Spanish league with 230 goals.

            Marco Asensio and Luka Modric also scored as Madrid won at home to get back within eight points of Barcelona in a game postponed because of the Club World Cup.

            Madrid won its eighth world club title last weekend in Morocco. Barcelona had increased its league lead with a 1-0 win at Villarreal on Sunday.











            The 35-year-old Benzema entered the match even with Madrid great Raúl with 228 league goals — second to Cristiano Ronaldo’s 311.

            “Benzema is much more than just a striker,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “He is a very complete player. He has a fantastic career and hopefully he will keep adding to it.""

            It was Benzema's fifth goal in his last six matches. He had also scored in the Club World Cup final against Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal after being out for a brief period because of an injury.

            The Club World Cup trophy was displayed to the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium before Wednesday’s match and Elche's players did the guard of honor for Madrid's squad.

            Madrid had won only one of its last three league matches and was coming off a loss at Mallorca before traveling to Morocco.

            “We knew we had to win, it was important to keep pace with Barcelona,” Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos said. “Eight points in not an insurmountable gap. This team will keep fighting until the last match.”

            Madrid got the win despite playing without several regular starters. Forward Vinícius Júnior was out because of a suspension on accumulation of yellow cards. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, midfielder Toni Kroos, forward Eden Hazard and defender Ferland Mendy were all out injured.

            Asensio opened the scoring in the eighth minute before Benzema got his goals from the penalty spot in the 31st and in the first minute of first-half stoppage time. Modric closed the scoring with a shot into the top corner from inside the area in the 80th.

            Last-place Elche arrived 12 points from safety but was boosted by its first league win of the season against Villarreal on Saturday. It has nine points from 21 matches.

            Madrid next visits ninth-place Osasuna on Saturday, while Elche hosts 17th-place Espanyol on Sunday.
