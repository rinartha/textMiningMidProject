https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850699,Hitman in New Jersey murder-for-hire sentenced to 16 years,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A career criminal whose rap sheet includes bank robberies and a murder conspiracy was sentenced Wednesday to 16 years in prison for killing a New Jersey political consultant in exchange for money in 2014.George Bratsenis, 74, pleaded guilty a year ago to a charge that he and another man accepted thousands of dollars from another political consultant, Sean Caddle, in exchange for killing Michael Galdieri. Galdieri was stabbed to death in his Jersey City apartment, which was then set on fire.U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez imposed the 16-year sentence plus five years of supervised release on Wednesday in federal court in Newark.A man who served time in a New Jersey prison with Bratsenis in the early 2000s, Bomani Africa, also pleaded guilty in the killing and was sentenced last month to 20 years. He named Bratsenis as the accomplice who helped kill Galdieri.Revelations about Galdieri’s killing jolted political circles in a state infamous for dozens of political corruption convictions in recent decades and trickery like the 2013 “Bridgegate” scandal, which involved traffic jams purposely created near the busy George Washington Bridge for political retribution.Caddle was well-known in northern New Jersey politics. His one-time clients included current Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and former Democratic state senator and gubernatorial candidate Raymond Lesniak.Caddle’s plea agreement referred briefly and opaquely to him providing investigators with information, but didn’t say what. He pleaded to conspiring to commit murder-for-hire in January 2022 and hasn't been sentenced yet..The U.S. attorney’s office has declined comment, as has an attorney for Bratsenis.Questions still surround the case over why the plot was put in motion, how Caddle was linked to the two ex-convicts, and why federal prosecutors have said so little about the crime.Less mysterious is the depth and breadth of Bratsenis’s criminal past.Bratsenis served in the Marines from 1968 to 1974, and then began racking up convictions in Connecticut and New Jersey for drug, robbery and weapons offenses.In the summer of 1980, according to Connecticut authorities, Bratsenis conspired with a former Stamford police lieutenant and two other men to murder a reputed drug courier, David Avnayim, whose body was found in the trunk of a car west of New Haven.Bratsenis wasn’t charged until four years later, but eventually pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy.By the time he was charged with Avnayim’s murder, Bratsenis was already behind bars, the result of a conviction for robbing a jewelry store in Little Falls, New Jersey, in 1983.While behind bars in New Jersey, he plotted an escape attempt in which he planned to hide a bag of drugs in his rectum and explode it during a court appearance, forcing authorities to take him to a hospital where gunmen would spring him, according to published reports at the time.The plot was foiled and Bratsenis eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy.By the late 2000s, Bratsenis was in Northern State Prison in Newark, New Jersey, having spent more than 25 years behind bars. It was there, authorities in Connecticut alleged in court filings, that he befriended Africa, from Philadelphia, and the two began planning to rob banks when they were paroled.Also housed at the prison during that time period was James Caddle, Sean Caddle’s brother, although it’s not known whether he knew Bratsenis or Africa. James Caddle died in 2016, according to an obituary posted online.After being released from prison, authorities said Africa and Bratsenis robbed two Connecticut banks in Darien and Trumbull in 2014, including one weeks before Galdieri’s killing. Africa robbed a third bank with another man in Stratford later in 2014, prosecutors said. Both Bratsenis and Africa pleaded guilty and were sentenced to eight and 10 years in prison for the robberies, respectively.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850700,"NFL hits highs in diverse executives, lacks in head coaches","PHOENIX (AP) — The NFL took another step at the owners meetings to increase diversity throughout the league while continuing to face criticism and a lawsuit for lack of representation among head coaches.Each team is now required to have a person in charge of diversity, equity and inclusion. Currently, 15 clubs have a DEI head and two others have someone leading that department and another one.“They actually have to have specific roles and deliverables that are in their job description so that is a big thing,” NFL executive Jonathan Beane said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The reason why that’s so important is we have to have a single point of accountability at the clubs where they are focused on driving it throughout their organization, in football operations and coaching, in business operations, engaging with ownership to make sure that this is a priority throughout the whole ecosystem of a club.”The league has reached milestone points in diverse hirings in the front office, but critics point to the sidelines where there are only three Black head coaches in a sport that had 56.4% Black players in 2022.The NFL now has seven minority team presidents, including five who are Black and three women, and nine general managers, including eight Black men.But there are six minority head coaches overall. Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers), Todd Bowles (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) and DeMeco Ryans (Houston Texans) give the league three Black head coaches entering a season for the fifth year in a row.“While increased diversity in executive roles could lead to increased diversity on the sidelines, progress on this front has remained stagnant for years,” said Devan Rawlings, the author of Revelio Labs’ NFL report. “The NFL has a significant disparity between the diversity of its players and that of its coaching staff — the largest among men’s major leagues — and this has not changed despite a large pool of diverse former players that could meet a demand for coaching talent.”Brian Flores, the former Miami Dolphins head coach, sued the league and three teams last year, saying the NFL was “rife with racism,” particularly in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches. Flores was an assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers last season and is the new defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings.“I will acknowledge our representation of diverse head coaches, in particular Black head coaches, is certainly below our expectation and is not where anyone wants it to be or knows it needs to be,” said Beane, the senior vice president, chief diversity and inclusion officer for the NFL.“We have way too much talent out there to have the representation among the head coaches that we have. However, I think it’s really, really important to look at other areas that are CEO-type positions, that are critical positions to the success or failure.”The number of minority presidents and GMs are the most in NFL history. The league didn’t even have its first Black president until the Washington Commanders hired Jason Wright in August 2020. Kevin Warren (Chicago Bears), Sashi Brown (Baltimore Ravens), Sandra Douglass Morgan (Las Vegas Raiders) and Damani Leech (Denver Broncos) have joined him in the past two years.Just four years ago, Miami’s Chris Grier was the only Black GM in the NFL. Kwesi Adolfo-Mensah (Minnesota Vikings), Ryan Poles (Chicago Bears), Andrew Berry (Cleveland Browns), Martin Mayhew (Washington Commanders), Brad Holmes (Detroit Lions), Terry Fontenot (Atlanta Falcons) and Ran Carthon (Tennessee Titans) have joined him.“And we know we still can do better,” Beane said. “Those are roles that are extremely vital. There is no role that is less important than the other. Head coach is vital, but GM is just as important. President is just as important. They all drive to the success of the organization and you need all three of those thriving in order to be successful. And so when we look at whether we’re making progress, we have to look at all of the roles in an organization, especially in senior roles. So it’s not just head coach. All of these other roles are vital and determine the success and failure of a club.”NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell agrees there’s room for improvement.“We still feel like there’s better work and more work ahead of us,” Goodell said last month. “There’s progress, and we’re pleased to see progress, but it’s never enough. We always look to sort of say, ‘How can we do better?’”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850701,Murdaugh judge Newman not surprised by jury's quick verdict,"The judge who presided over Alex Murdaugh's murder trial in South Carolina told his law school he wasn't surprised the jury came back with a guilty verdict in three hours.Judge Clifton Newman returned to Cleveland State University where he earned his law degree in 1976 to discuss his career and the topic on everyone's minds — the six-week trial that ended in Murdaugh's murder convictions for killing his wife and son and life sentence.The three hours of deliberation after hearing from 75 witnesses was about normal, considering they were paying close attention for so long.“When they go back to deliberate, they don’t want to look at those 800 exhibits. They don’t want to spend their time combing through everything they have laboriously sat there and listened to for that period of time,” Newman said Tuesday.Newman was born in South Carolina, but moved to Cleveland for college and law school after graduating as valedictorian at his racially segregated high school. Newman, who is Black, returned to South Carolina with his wife after they started a family and worried about forced busing of students out of neighborhood schools.Cleveland State University plans to further honor Newman in November by inducting him into the law school's hall of fame.“You showed the world an example of what the judiciary at its best can be through your calm and deliberate demeanor through this lengthy and complex case,” said Judge Brendan Sheehan who presides in Cuyahoga County.Prosecutors said Murdaugh killed his wife and son at their home in June 2021, shooting them with two different weapons, cleaning up the scene, then driving to visit his ailing mother before calling 911 and saying he discovered the bodies.Newman was asked about his decision to allow extensive testimony on dozens of financial crimes for which Murdaugh is awaiting trial. Defense attorneys said it unfairly turned jurors against him and compelled Murdaugh to think he had to testify in his own defense.Newman said he can't give opinions, like whether he thought Murdaugh should have testified or was believable on the stand, because the defense is appealing the murder convictions.“Once the defendant takes the stand and testifies almost everything is fair game at that point. We’ll see where it goes,” the judge said.Newman said the Murdaugh case continued a mystery that has transfixed him throughout his 23 years on the bench: why human beings do what they do to each other. The judge said he has no doubt Murdaugh loved his wife and son. And that belief led to the judge's often-quoted comment during sentencing, that he suspects the final things they saw before they died will stay with Murdaugh every day.“I'm told the person who is killed will haunt, will come back, and they’ll never be able to get over the moment in time that they took that person's life,” Newman said, adding he doesn't know “whether that is a spiritual belief or just my view of the world.”The judge also discussed some other high-profile cases, including the state trial of white police officer Michael Slager, charged with murder in the shooting of an unarmed Black man trying to run away from a traffic stop in North Charleston in 2015.North Charleston was one-third African American and Newman said he was determined to make sure the pool of potential jurors matched the community. He sent deputies and bailiffs to personally deliver every jury duty notice and met his goal. But in the end, just one Black man made it onto the jury after others had hardships.“The best I could do was appoint that Black guy the foreperson of the jury, so that if there is another not guilty verdict here, he had to sign that verdict form,” Newman said.The case ended in a hung jury before Slager pleaded guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.There were lighthearted moments too. Newman recounted how he met his wife at Cleveland State, driving her and friends home in a near blizzard. He was also asked who he thinks should play him if a movie is made of the Murdaugh case.Newman acknowledged he heard suggestions he could play himself and pointed out he is approaching the mandatory retirement age for judges in South Carolina.“I turn 72 in November, so I’ll be looking at something else to do,"" Newman said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850702,Trump grand jury poised to take pre-planned break from case,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Manhattan grand jury investigating hush money paid on Donald Trump’s behalf is scheduled to consider other matters next week before taking a previously scheduled two-week hiatus, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. That means a vote on whether or not to indict the former president likely wouldn't come until late April at the earliest.The break, which was scheduled in advance when the panel was convened in January, coincides with Passover, Easter and spring break for the New York City public school system.The person who confirmed the grand jury’s schedule was not authorized to speak publicly about secretive grand jury proceedings and did so on condition of anonymity. A message left with the district attorney’s office was not immediately returned.In a statement released through a lawyer, Trump said: “I HAVE GAINED SO MUCH RESPECT FOR THIS GRAND JURY.”The grand jury has been meeting regularly Monday and Wednesday afternoons, though its Wednesday sessions were called off this week and last. It met Monday, when a longtime Trump friend and potential key witness in the investigation was seen leaving the building where the grand jury has been meeting.News earlier this month that Trump had been invited to appear before the grand jury fueled widespread speculation that a vote on an indictment would soon be forthcoming. Trump himself added to that anticipation with a post on his social media platform saying that he expected to be arrested soon, though his representatives later said that they had not received any such indication from prosecutors.The district attorney's office is legally prohibited from publicly discussing the grand jury process, but witnesses and their attorneys aren't bound by the same secrecy rules, and some have spoken out. On March 20, the grand jury heard from a witness favorable to Trump.People familiar with how grand jury processes typically unfold cautioned that the schedule could change and that prosecutors could still ask jurors to consider charges or vote on an indictment on one of the days they’re expected to meet on other matters.Few people — Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the prosecutors in charge of the grand jury investigation — know precisely how the grand jury investigation is proceeding and at what pace. They control when witnesses are called to testify and decide whether, and when, to seek an indictment.It's not uncommon for grand juries to take breaks for holidays. But it's unclear why the panel isn't hearing testimony on the Trump probe on some of its other customary days — and what the grand jurors will make of that, said Touro Law Center criminal law professor Richard Klein.“Even in a situation where there’s an investigative grand jury, usually the prosecutor doesn't start the process until they’re ready to move forward with it,” said Klein, a former public defender in Manhattan. In general, he said, prosecutors like to keep proceeding steadily so that grand jurors don't lose the thread of what they've heard, or speculate about why there are hiatuses.Since Trump’s March 18 post, authorities ratcheted up security, deploying additional police officers, lining the streets around the courthouse with barricades and dispatching bomb-sniffing dogs.They’ve also had to respond to myriad threats, including bomb and death threats, a suspicious powder scare and a protester who was arrested Tuesday after witnesses say she pulling a knife on passersby outside the courthouse.The grand jury is investigating money paid during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to two women who alleged that they had extramarital sexual encounters with him. Trump has denied the allegations.Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who has testified as a key prosecution witness, paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 through a shell company he set up and was then reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer, which squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”Meanwhile, other Trump investigations have been busily proceeding with crucial wins for prosecutors.A Trump lawyer appeared last week before a federal grand jury in Washington investigating Trump’s possible mishandling of classified documents after prosecutors were able to persuade a judge they had evidence that the former president was using his legal representation in furtherance of a crime.And a judge has also ruled that former Vice President Mike Pence must provide some grand jury testimony in a separate investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election.If the Manhattan grand jury’s schedule holds, that panel wouldn’t return to the Trump matter until April 24. That’s five days after Trump’s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg is slated to be released from jail for his role in a unrelated tax fraud scheme involving fringe benefits from Trump’s company.Weisselberg made key decisions in how Trump and his Trump Organization kept their books, and Cohen alleges he was involved in the hush-money arrangements, but Weisselberg does not appear to be cooperating with the grand jury investigation.Meanwhile, a former magazine columnist’s rape lawsuit against Trump is set to go to trial April 25 at a federal courthouse steps away from where the hush-money grand jury has been meeting. Both Trump and rape accuser E. Jean Carroll are expected to testify in the civil trial.She alleges he raped her in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. He denies it and says he had no idea who she was before she went public with the allegation in 2019.The AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly.___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz in New York and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850703,"Mel King, who helped ease Boston's racial strife, dies at 94","BOSTON (AP) — Longtime Boston civil rights activist Mel King, whose 1983 campaign for mayor helped the city begin to repair some of the racial divisions sparked during the school busing crisis, has died. He was 94.King served in the state Legislature for nearly a decade before becoming the first Black man to reach a Boston general mayoral contest, facing off against a fellow state representative, Ray Flynn.Gov. Maura Healey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at all state buildings Wednesday, acknowledging the death of King, whom she described as a “dedicated public servant and civil rights champion.”The election was a test for the city, which had undergone years of strife following the court-ordered desegregation of the public schools in the mid-1970s. Flynn, who represented the predominantly white, Irish neighborhood of South Boston, was an opponent of busing.But instead of reigniting the discord, the race had the opposite effect, being seen as respectful, even friendly at times.King brought in support from a range of racial groups, dubbing his movement the “Rainbow Coalition” — a name adopted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson during his presidential campaigns.“What I believe people want more than anything else is a sense of a vision that’s inclusive and respectful and appreciative of who they are. What the Rainbow Coalition did was to put that right up front because everybody could be a member,"" King said in a 1993 interview with The Boston Globe.Mayor Michelle Wu, the first woman and first person of color elected to lead Boston, offered condolences to the family of King, saying “his transformative ideas have shaped generations of organizers and leaders.”Flynn said he first met King, who grew up in the city's racially mixed South End, when the two played basketball as teenagers.He said he felt an affinity for King, noting their shared working class roots and collaborative work as state lawmakers.“Mel King would be fighting for affordable housing for the people of the South End and Roxbury, and I would be doing the same for the people of South Boston,” Flynn said. “We were just two kids from the neighborhood who fought hard for our constituents.”King would go on to lose to Flynn by 30 points. But the race came to be seen as a turning point in a city once described as a collection of ethnic enclaves.Those divisions boiled over during the busing crisis, with South Boston High School becoming the center of racial strife as Black students were bused to the school under a court-ordered desegregation plan.During the height of the crisis, crowds sometimes threw stones at buses carrying Black students, and police were stationed on rooftops near the school.“The city was polarized. It was divided,"" Flynn said. ""Busing really brought out the worst in the city of Boston. The election brought out the best. People all felt they were part of new opportunities.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850704,Investigators examine pipeline in chocolate factory blast,"WEST READING, Pa. (AP) — Federal safety investigators are examining a natural gas pipeline for fractures and other damage as they gather evidence on the cause of last week's deadly explosion at a Pennsylvania chocolate factory, a spokesperson said Wednesday.The National Transportation Safety Board opened a probe into Friday's blast at R.M. Palmer Co. that killed seven people, wounded several others and leveled the building in West Reading, a small town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia. The agency has called it a natural gas explosion and fire.“NTSB is continuing to gather evidence about how the building was supplied with natural gas and point of ignition, interview witnesses, examine the pipeline for fractures, any damage to pipeline, a chronology of events leading up to the explosion, among other issues that may come up as the investigation continues,” agency spokesperson Keith Holloway said by email.A preliminary report on the explosion could be available in about three weeks, whereas the final report could take up to two years, he said. Pennsylvania State Police are also investigating the cause.Some workers had told relatives they smelled natural gas before the blast, although the gas utility, UGI, said it had received no reports of a gas leak. UGI said it is cooperating with the probe.The family that owns the candy company said in a statement Wednesday that the loss of their employees “will be felt forever.”“My family and I are deeply saddened and heartbroken by the devastating loss of several colleagues and friends as a result of last week’s tragic incident at the West Reading facility,"" said the statement from Richard Palmer Jr. and his family.The Berks County coroner's office, which previously released the names of two of the seven victims, said it planned to release the rest of the victims' names on Wednesday afternoon.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850708,How German are the British royals?,"About 300 years ago, on August 1, 1714, England's Queen Anne died. As a result, the German Elector George Louis of Hanover was proclaimed king of Great Britain in absentia. He was the only possible heir to the throne, and the first German to ascend an English throne.At the beginning, his British subjects were not amused. The German king did not set foot on English soil until two months after his proclamation and was crowned King George I on October 20, 1714.A divorced man, he publicly flirted with two mistresses. It was claimed that George hardly spoke any English — though some historians have disputed this, suspecting it was a ploy used in some ministerial meetings — and he had no manners. In fact, legend has it a protocol instruction for banquets asked for people not to hurl pieces of meat at the servants.However, the British people soon realized that George I did a great deal for the kingdom. By focusing on peace, stability and prosperity for his two states — Great Britain and Hanover — he contributed to establishing ""a new European balance of power that ended decades of war,"" according to Encyclopedia Virginia.His son George II left the British their national anthem, ""God Save The King,"" which later became ""God Save The Queen.""His grandson George III was the first in the line of German kings to be born in England, with English being his first language. He married the German Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The couple had 15 children.George III suffered from a metabolic disorder, his health deteriorated and he became mentally ill. This made the popular monarch, who supported the arts and sciences, increasingly incapable of ruling. He is mostly remembered as ""Mad King George.""His eldest son, foppish Georg August Friedrich, took over during his father's lifetime as prince regent in 1811 and was crowned King George IV in 1820 — the next king with a predominantly German bloodline.George IV's extravagant lifestyle did not endear him to his subjects, and the obese monarch was not mourned much when he died. His eccentricity managed to severely damage the reputation of the royal house. He left behind no particular political legacy, but a cultural one: Buckingham House was expanded into a palace and a building was erected in the seaside resort of Brighton that is still unique in Europe in terms of opulence — the Royal Pavilion.In 1837, George IV's niece Victoria, who also had a partly German bloodline, was crowned. She married her cousin, the German Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Initially, the British wondered why their queen would choose a provincial German prince, but they soon changed their minds.Albert allegedly initiated in England the German custom of putting up Christmas trees. He established the first World's Fair, in London in 1851, while also reforming administration and construction througout the kingdom.Thanks to the queen's consort, the British royal family regained its reputation. A magnificent statue of Albert stands in the center of London and Albert Bridge in London was named after him, as was the famous Royal Albert Hall concert hall.Meanwhile, Queen Victoria carried out representative functions in addition to her role as mother of nine children. Her influence in foreign policy was primarily grounded in her kinship relations with the leading ruling houses of Europe.She made sure her children married into other European royal courts — little wonder that today her descendants sit on the throne in many European royal houses, including Queen Margrethe of Denmark, Kings Harald V of Norway and Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the former Spanish royal couple Juan Carlos I and Sophia — all the way to Elizabeth II, the former British queen.Victoria was nicknamed the ""Grandmother of Europe"" and at the time, with 64 years on the throne, she was Britain's longest-serving monarch. The Victorian era, named after her, saw the growth of the British Empire to a global industrial power, as well as advances in the arts and sciences, along with societal changes.Some 120 years later, her length of rule was surpassed by her great-great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II.Queen Victoria died in 1901, succeeded by her eldest son Edward VII, the first English king from the German dynasty of Sachsen-Coburg and Gotha. To make the name easier to pronounce for the English, the house was renamed Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Just a few years later, in 1910, his son George V became king. He was married to Maria von Teck, who also had German blood, and who became known as Queen Mary.The reign of George V coincided with World War I, which was waged against his cousin, German Emperor Wilhelm II. In England, attitudes toward all things German changed — after all, the German Empire was seen as the main aggressor.In 1917, George V decided to change the German family name to Windsor. George also renounced all German titles, as did his cousin Ludwig von Battenberg, who renamed his family Mountbatten. Queen Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, came from this family.George's son Edward VIII became king in 1936. Less than a year later, he abdicated for love and married Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. His brother Albert ascended the British throne as George VI.At the time, the Nazis and Adolf Hitler had long since gained a firm grip on Germany, with the world watching the Third Reich with interest and skepticism. Edward and Albert's mother, Queen Mary, insisted that her sons not forget their German roots — after all, they also had plenty of relatives in Hitler's Germany.For his part, Edward openly showed sympathy for the Nazis. One photo taken in 1937 shows the duke and his wife smiling and shaking hands with Hitler.Just a few years ago, a video emerged showing Edward and his sister-in-law practicing the Hitler salute with two little girls — Margaret and Elizabeth, with the latter one day becoming the queen of England. The snippet was filmed by Elizabeth's father, King George VI.To this day, the British do not like to be reminded of the at times cordial relations of the British aristocracy with the German Nazis, trying as much as possible to keep evidence of such connections under wraps.The mother of Queen Elizabeth II was British, so she was only partly of German descent — even if she did display some stereotypical German virtues throughout her life, including discipline and a sense of duty.Her husband Philip, however, had predominantly German ancestors and spoke fluent German. In 1947, he became a British citizen and, shortly before his marriage to Elizabeth, relinquished his German title of nobility and called himself only ""Mountbatten.""Their eldest son, the new King Charles III, has a bloodline made up of roughly half German ancestors.He and his first wife, the British Diana Spencer, had two sons: William and Harry. Prince William's wife, Catherine, has no German ancestors at all; Harry's wife, Meghan, is the daughter of an American with Irish roots and is said to have German ancestors.The person who is the last in line in the succession to the throne is actually a German. Hospital therapist Karin Vogel, who lives in Rostock, is a descendant of Sophia of Hanover, the mother of King George I, the first British king from Germany.But it's extremely unlikely that she would become queen of England one day: Nearly 5,000 people in the royal lineage would need to die before that can happen.This article was originally written in German and was first published in October 2022.",2023/03/29,,

He posted a 70-51 record in four years with a 28-9 mark this season before losing on Tuesday night in the NIT semifinals to UAB.“Having grown up in the area, I have always admired Cal as an institution and as an athletic program, with so many of my teachers, coaches and friends impressive Cal graduates,"" Madsen said. “We will win with young men who have elite academic and athletic talent and who will represent Cal with pride.”Madsen is the third prominent coach to flip sides in recent years in the Bay Area rivalry between Cal and Stanford. The Cardinal hired former Cal quarterback Troy Taylor to take over the football program last season and Bears women's basketball coach Charmin Smith played and coached as an assistant at Stanford.Madsen is faced with a tough task, taking over a program that went 3-29 under Fox and set a school record for most losses and worst winning percentage in a season.Cal went 38-87 during Fox’s tenure, ending his final season on a 16-game losing streak. Fox’s .304 winning percentage ranking second worst in school history to predecessor Wyking Jones’ 16-47 mark (.254) in the two seasons before Fox arrived.The Bears haven't been to the NCAA Tournament since 2016 and haven't won a game in the tournament since 2013 under Montgomery.Adding to the issues for Fox was the complete lack of interest in the program. Cal’s home attendance averaged just 2,155 this season for the lowest mark among any team in the Power 5 or Big East. That’s down from an average of 9,307 per game in Cuonzo Martin’s last season in 2016-17 and from 5,627 the year before Fox arrived.Cal had the worst winning percentage among any school in the six major conferences during Fox’s tenure. The Bears also were the lowest-scoring team (62.4 points per game) in all Division I under Fox and had the worst scoring margin of any major conference team under Fox.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850711,Congressional hearing targets 'NIL chaos' in college sports,"A congressional hearing Wednesday targeting “NIL chaos” in college sports drifted into the ramifications of athletes being deemed employees of their schools and mostly highlighted those who support congressional intervention to protect the collegiate model.A subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held the first hearing related to college sports on Capitol Hill in more than two years.The intended focus was name, image and likeness compensation for athletes. College sports leaders have been calling for help in the form of a federal law to bring uniform regulation to the way athletes can earn money off their fame with sponsorship or endorsement deals.Rep. Gus Bilirakis (Fla.-R), the chairman of the subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce, said passing a federal NIL law that would pre-empt existing state laws would provide clarity and transparency for athletes.“The lack of uniformity across different states and institutions has created confusion and uncertainty and a federal standard is needed, so all athletes are playing by the same rules,” Bilirakis said. “In short, we must strike a delicate balance between the rights of college athletes to profit from their own NIL while keeping the amateur status for all college athletes.”Seven previous hearings have been held in the House and Senate, but lawmakers have made no significant progress toward passing a college sports bill since the topic first started gaining attention.The latest hearing was held days before the Final Four in the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments were set to be played in Texas.Lawmakers questioned six witnesses for nearly three hours. They heard from two college sports administrators, the president of a Division II university, a former NFL player, a current Florida State softball player and one of the leaders of an athletes’ advocacy group.Most of the witnesses encouraged congress to act on NIL.“We need transparency in the market place,"" Washington State athletic director Pat Chun said.Jason Stahl, executive director of the College Football Players Association, pushed back. He said any NIL regulations would only serve the interests of schools, conferences and the NCAA.“The federal government should stay out of the NIL free market,” he said.The NCAA lifted its ban on college athletes earning money off their fame almost two years ago, but fear of lawsuits and a patchwork of state-level NIL laws steered the association away from putting in detailed and uniform rules.“The current NIL chaos means student-athletes are left to fend for themselves,” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.-R). “And those at the top of their game must figure out how to maneuver through a multiple of agents, collectives and high dollar contract offers all while maintaining their academic and athletic commitments.”The concern among many in college sports is NIL is being used as a recruiting inducement or as de facto pay-for-play, which are still against NCAA rules but have become difficult to enforce.New NCAA President Charlie Baker, who was not among the witnesses at the hearing, has said the athletes are the consumers in this burgeoning market and a federal law would be a form of consumer protection.“NIL is a powerful vehicle that rightfully allows student-athletes the ability to earn compensation from their unique market value,” Baker said in a statement. “At the same time, the lack of transparency in today’s NIL marketplace puts student-athletes in jeopardy of exploitation by bad actors.”The hearing also veered into the topic of college athletes being deemed employees and the possibility that colleges could be required to share with athletes the revenue generated by their sports.At most Division I schools, revenue generated by football and basketball help fund all the other sports.""The creation of an employee-employer model would significantly threaten this current dynamic and alter everything we know about how sports outside football and men’s basketball are supported,"" Florida State softball player Caley Mudge said.A bill introduced by a California state lawmaker in January would — if passed — require some Division I schools to share a percentage of revenue with mostly football and basketball players.A federal lawsuit being heard in Pennsylvania seeks to make colleges treat Division I athletes like employees and start paying them an hourly wage. A complaint to the National Labor Relations Board could also lead to employee status being granted to some college athletes, which could open the door to unions.“How does a football player unionize and a softball player doesn’t?” Chun said.Patriot League Commissioner Jen Heppel, who testified before lawmakers, said in written testimony that Division I college athletes being deemed employees “would likely represent a breaking point for the sponsorship of athletic programs at Patriot League institutions.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850712,UAE leader designates his eldest son as crown prince,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates, appointed his eldest son Khaled as crown prince of Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, placing him as next in line to take over as the leader of the federation.The state-run WAM news agency announced the appointment of Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan as crown prince late Wednesday, without providing further details.After Sheikh Mohammed, 62, who is commonly known as MBZ, ascended to the presidency last year, rumors swirled about whether he would make one of his brothers his heir.In that case, the front-runners would have been Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed, the powerful national security chief, Sheikh Mansour, the owner of the Manchester City football club, or the foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah.Instead, he appears to concentrating power within his immediate family, as Saudi Arabia's King Salman did by delegating wide-ranging powers to his son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS.A separate announcement said Sheikh Mohammed had appointed Sheikh Mansour as vice president of the UAE with the approval of the Federal Supreme Council. Sheikh Tahnoun and another brother, Sheikh Hazza, were appointed deputy rulers of Abu Dhabi.Sheikh Khaled, 41, the new crown prince, has risen to prominence at the country’s state security service and as chairman of the powerful Abu Dhabi Executive Office.The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, is best known as the home of Dubai, a major international hub for business and travel.The federation of seven emirates, including oil-rich Abu Dhabi, has rapidly transformed itself over the past half-century from a desert region sparsely populated by Bedouin tribes into a political and economic powerhouse with state-of-the-art infrastructure, including the world's tallest skyscraper.Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the UAE and the driving force behind its creation, ruled from 1971 until his death in 2004. He appointed his eldest son Khalifa as his successor and MBZ as deputy crown prince.Sheikh Mohammed has been the nation’s de facto leader since Sheikh Khalifa suffered a stroke in 2014. Sheikh Khalifa, for whom the world's largest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa, is named, died eight years later, in May 2022.During Sheikh Mohammed's rule, the UAE cultivated close ties with neighboring Saudi Arabia, initially joining it in its war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels before largely exiting the conflict years later. The UAE has sought to project military power across the region as it has opposed the rise of Islamist groups.In 2020, the UAE normalized relations with Israel in the first of the so-called Abraham Accords, followed by Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. The UAE and other Gulf Arab nations had quietly maintained ties with Israel for years befoe then, drawn together by mutual suspicions of Iran.The UAE hosts some 3,500 U.S. troops, many at Abu Dhabi’s Al-Dhafra Air Base, from where drones and fighter jets flew missions combating the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Dubai is the U.S. Navy’s busiest port of call abroad.But strains have emerged in recent years between Sheikh Mohammed and the U.S., long a guarantor of security in the wider Persian Gulf. The UAE and Saudi Arabia were alarmed by the 2015 nuclear deal reached among Iran, the U.S. and other world powers. The chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 further fueled fears that the U.S. was pulling back from the region.A planned U.S. sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE appears to be stalled in part over American concerns about the Emirates’ relationship with China. Meanwhile, the UAE has been careful not to alienate Russia as Moscow wages war on Ukraine.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850713,Colorado man cites fear of homelessness in ax killings case,"DENVER (AP) — An 81-year-old Colorado man accused of killing his wife and daughter with an ax told police he lost his job and was afraid they would end up homeless. Reginald Maclaren told police he didn’t regret killing them because he “knows they are in a better place,” according to court documents.Maclaren was arrested Saturday in the killings and booked into jail Tuesday after being taken to the hospital for what police have described as a preexisting medical condition, Crystal Essman, a spokesperson for police in the Denver suburb of Englewood, said Wednesday.Maclaren is scheduled to appear in court Monday, when prosecutors say they plan to file formal charges against him.Police said Maclaren called authorities Saturday to tell them that his wife and adult daughter had been killed and that he thought he knew who the suspect was. When officers arrived at his apartment, they found the bodies of two women in trash cans in the living room, police said in a press release. One of the women had been dismembered with a saw, they said.According to Maclaren's arrest affidavit, he told investigators he had lost his job at Hospital Shared Services, which provides security to health care facilities, and did not have any money left. He said they would have to move out Saturday because he could not pay the rent. He also said he had regular interactions with people who were experiencing homelessness and knew what a miserable life that was, according to the affidavit.During a press conference Tuesday, Englewood police's division chief, Tracy Jones, said longtime detectives described Maclaren's apartment as the “one of the most gruesome crime scenes” they had ever seen. All officers involved in the case are getting mental health support, he said.Maclaren is being represented by a lawyer from the state public defender’s office, which doesn’t comment on its cases.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850714,Florida sees fewer manatee starvation deaths as feeding ends,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The effort to feed thousands of pounds of lettuce to starving manatees in Florida officially ended for the winter season Wednesday, as deaths of the marine mammals appear to be slowing despite the long-term threat of pollution to their main food source, seagrass.State and federal wildlife officials said during an online news conference that just under 400,000 pounds (181,000 kilograms) of lettuce was provided to hundreds of manatees at a warmwater power plant site along the east coast where they typically gather for the winter.It was the second year of the experimental feeding program that was launched because of the deaths of at least 1,100 manatees in 2021, which was by far the most ever recorded. All told, more than 2,000 manatees have died mostly of starvation from January 2021 through March 10 of this year, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.The pace of manatee deaths seems to have slowed. Thus far this season, wildlife officials have counted 163 deaths. They attribute the slowdown to various factors including the partial recovery of seagrass in key winter areas and more animals that appeared to be in better physical condition than in the past.“We're well below what we experienced the past two winters,” said Andy Garrett, the FWC manatee rescue coordinator.Manatees are gentle, round-tailed giants sometimes known as sea cows that weigh as much as 1,200 pounds (550 kilograms) and can live as long as 65 years. Manatees are Florida’s official state marine mammal but are listed as a threatened species, also facing peril from boat strikes and toxic red tide algae outbreaks along the state's Gulf coast. Their closest living relative is the elephant.There are enhanced efforts to rehabilitate malnourished manatees that are recovered alive. As of Wednesday, there were 84 manatees at rehab sites around the country, including 72 in Florida, said Teresa Calleson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Of that total, she said 15 are considered non-releasable because of their permanently fragile health.“The rest will go back to the wild population once they clear their rehabilitation,” Calleson said.The total cost of this season's feeding program was about $250,000, most of which was covered by donations from people around the country to a nonprofit affiliated with the FWC.It's unclear whether officials will operate the program again next winter. One key measure will be an ongoing comprehensive count of the overall Florida manatee population, which is expected to be complete by fall. Previous estimates have placed the number of manatees at about 7,500 around the state.Beyond that, millions of dollars are being poured into various projects aimed at the root of the problem: nitrogen, phosphorus and sewage pollution from agriculture, urban runoff and other sources that trigger algae blooms, which in turn kill off the seagrass that manatees and other sea creatures rely upon.“Excessive human-produced nutrient pollution is a growing threat to all seagrass communities,” the Save The Manatee Club wrote in a summary of the problem. “When combined with the warming effects of climate change and sea level rise, these excess nutrients present an even greater danger to the future of seagrasses wherever they are found.”Last year, Florida legislators approved about $8 million for several habitat restoration projects around the state. Another $19.5 million in federal funding was recently earmarked for 33 projects ranging from stormwater treatment upgrades to filter systems that remove harmful nitrates from water that goes into the Indian River Lagoon, the huge east coast estuary where manatees congregate in winter.It will take time to assess how much impact the starvation event will have on manatees in the future, said FWC manatee veterinarian Marine Dewit. The effects could include problems with reproduction. Most dead or distressed manatees are reported by people who call an FWC wildlife hotline.“Considering the large number of manatees that were lost, there's going to be an impact on the population that has yet to be defined,” Dewit said. “The winters continue to be of concern. This is still an ongoing unusual mortality event. It still deserves attention and still deserves response.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850715,"NBA, players still talking about new deal as deadline looms","NEW YORK (AP) — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Wednesday he is hopeful that a new collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players can get done by the end of this week, though he stopped short of predicting that a deal would actually get struck.“I think everyone understands what's at stake,"" Silver said.The league and the National Basketball Players Association face a midnight Friday deadline for either side to decide that they will opt out of the deal and end the current CBA on June 30. That opt-out deadline already has been extended twice, and Silver said the NBA's current plan is to exercise that option if there is no deal by Friday night.“I certainly can foresee one getting done and I hope we do get one done,” Silver said at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. “It's just because, honestly, I’m only one side of the negotiation, it’s difficult for me to place odds on whether or not that’s going to happen.”NBPA Executive Director Tamika Tremaglio said the players do not intend to opt out if Friday's deadline passes without a deal.“The March 31st deadline is an important benchmark, and we are doing everything in our power to reach an agreement with the league,"" Tremaglio said. “If we don’t have a deal and the league decides to opt out, it will be disappointing considering all the work both sides have put into the negotiations, and the fair nature of our requests. As far as our fans are concerned, it will be business as usual. Games will continue uninterrupted.""Both sides have said throughout this process — and in past labor talks — that they do not intend to negotiate or discuss specifics publicly.The sides have been talking about a new CBA for more than a year, and Silver said he expected negotiations to resume Wednesday night. And if Friday passes without a deal, it wouldn't be dire immediately because the sides still will have three months to get something done before the current CBA expires.The opt-outs were put in place to avoid the drama of having talks go right up until the end of a deal, which would increase the odds of a work stoppage.“Still a lot to go in the next few days. There’s just something about collective bargaining where deadlines are necessary and seemingly sides tend to hold their best positions until the very end,” Silver said. “So, my sense is this will go down to the very end.”The league has made clear that it wants some changes to the current CBA and has been in discussions with the union on matters such as an upper spending limit, returning to a plan where players can jump to the draft directly from high school and enacting a minimum number of games played in order to be qualified for season-ending awards.“Every issue seemingly seems related to every other issue,” Silver said. “If you line up these 10 issues, you sort of go 80% of the way there on each issue and everybody’s holding their last move to say: ‘Well, OK, maybe I’m willing to do that, but I’m going wait to see what you’re going to do on those three issues. And if you make those moves on those three issues, then I’ll feel a little bit more comfortable.’ I mean, people are constantly trading things.""The current CBA, which took effect July 1, 2017, came with a mutual option for either the NBA or the NBPA to opt out after six seasons — June 30 of this year.The sides originally had a Dec. 15 deadline to announce an intention to exercise the opt-out, then pushed it back to Feb. 8, then to Friday.A lockout would be damaging on many levels — well beyond the obvious part of how a league that is coming off a season of record revenue (it topped $10 billion for the first time last season and basketball-related income reached $8.9 billion, another record) would see that momentum interrupted. It could also interfere with the makeup of teams for this summer's World Cup in the Philippines, with NBA players expected to fill the U.S. and other rosters (and three NBA coaches set to be part of the U.S. coaching staff).It could also disrupt plans for an NBA Summer League in Las Vegas this July that figures to feature presumed No. 1 draft pick Victor Wembanyama in what would be a global spectacle, as the French phenom begins his NBA career.“I think for both sides in various categories we acknowledge we’ve come closer together,” Silver said. “There still is a gap between where we feel we need to be in order to get a deal done. I’d say throughout the discussions have had a very positive tenor and continued the strong sense of partnership that we have with our players and the players association.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850717,Congress approves measure to toss Biden's water protections,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress on Wednesday approved a resolution to overturn the Biden administration’s protections for the nation’s waterways that Republicans have criticized as a burden on business, advancing a measure that President Joe Biden has promised to veto.Republicans have targeted the Biden administration’s protections for thousands of small streams, wetlands and other waterways, labeling it an environmental overreach that harms businesses, developers and farmers.They used the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to block recently enacted executive branch regulations. The Senate voted in favor 53 to 43 Wednesday to give final legislative approval to the measure. Four Democrats and Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona joined Republicans to vote in favor of the resolution.“The overreach, basically, it’s unreal,” said Sen. Joe Manchin, D.-W. Va., a critic of some of the White House's environmental policies.The Senate vote is the latest development in a long-running fight over the definition of “waters of the United States,” which establishes the breadth of the Clean Water Act’s protections. Environmentalists and the Biden administration have pushed to broaden the definition and protect more waterways from pollution while right-leaning groups and the Trump administration have argued that protecting fewer waterways would benefit builders, farmers and business.In early March, the Republican-controlled House approved the resolution 227-198. A Congressional Review Act resolution requires a simple majority in both chambers and can’t be filibustered.Water protections are “very symbolic and polarized,” according to Julian Gonzalez, legislative counsel with Earthjustice. He said moderate Democrats may vote for the resolution to show their independence from the Biden administration’s environmental agenda.“The perceived impact won't be as significant because the president will veto it, so they can sort of achieve their goal without causing that much damage,” Gonzalez said, adding that supporting efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act are shortsighted.Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said the Biden administration's rule is protective and fair.“The Biden rule requires us to be good neighbors, and stewards of our planet, while also providing flexibility for those who need it,” said Carper said.In December, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers repealed the Trump administration’s business-friendly rule that scaled back protections. Since the Biden administration enacted its broader rule, Republicans have targeted it in the courts and Congress.This month, a federal judge paused the rule in Texas and Idaho in a win for Republican legal challenges. Right-leaning states have argued in court the rule is too vague and would create unacceptable economic hardships.The Supreme Court is also considering a related case brought by an Idaho couple who are fighting a requirement that they receive a permit to build their home near a lake after the EPA determined that part of their property was a regulated wetland. The justices heard arguments in Sackett v. EPA in October and a decision is expected in the next few months.“Expansion of federal authority and an encroachment on states’ rights and private lands is the precise reason we have seen overwhelming support for my (Congressional Review Act) resolution,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.Democrats hold a 51-49 Senate majority, but Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is in the hospital being treated for depression and is unavailable for votes. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are also absent.The Biden administration's rule is built on a pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States,” but is more streamlined and includes updates to reflect court opinions, scientific understanding and decades of experience, EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox previously told The Associated Press. She added that the rule modestly increases protections for some streams, wetlands, lakes and ponds.The new rule repeated the Trump-era rule that was finalized in 2020 and was broadly supported by farm bureaus and business that wanted less regulation on private property. Environmental groups said the Trump-era rules left too many waterways unprotected from pollutants.Democrats Manchin, Jon Tester of Montana and both senators from Nevada, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, supported the resolution. Sinema also voted in favor.___Phillis reported from St. Louis.___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850718,Debut for deGrom in Texas to be limited against familiar foe,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Jacob deGrom will make his debut for the Texas Rangers — and in the American League — against a familiar foe from his nine seasons with the New York Mets.The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner will be limited to about 65 pitches Thursday against the reigning National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. Just having deGrom healthy and on the mound for the season opener is a positive start for the Rangers and the pitcher whose last two years in New York were plagued by injuries.“We feel good about him, and he should, too. He's had some great outings,” new Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “I think there were probably some questions when we did have to slow play him, but now we see that he's ready.”Texas was overly cautious with its prized offseason addition ( $185 million, five-year contract in free agency ) after he reported tightness in his left side just before the team's first official spring training workout. The right-hander struck out 10 over 6 2/3 scoreless innings in his only two exhibition games in Arizona, which came after throwing batting practice and in a minor league game.“Obviously I’d like my pitch count to be a little higher, but we’ll get there,” deGrom said. “We took the smart approach. ... If you throw through (the tightness), who knows, it could have snowballed.”Settling into his new home stadium in Arlington, Texas, DeGrom said he felt good after being able to throw all of his pitches in the final Arizona tuneup on Saturday “and everything felt like it was working. ... Now it’s time to play real baseball.""DeGrom is 9-1 with a 2.18 ERA and 136 strikeouts over 120 innings in 20 career starts against the Phillies. The only teams he has faced more are the rest of the NL East: Atlanta, Miami and Washington. In three opening-day starts for the Mets, deGrom tossed 17 scoreless innings with 25 strikeouts.Aaron Nola, the 29-year-old right-hander going into the final year of his contract, will make his sixth — and maybe last — opening day start for the Phillies. It comes days after president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said discussions about a contract extension had broken off, and the pitcher indicated those could wait until after the season.The opener also will be the Texas debut for Bochy. The three-time World Series champion manager was coaxed out of a three-year retirement by general manager Chris Young, one of his former pitchers who then revamped the Rangers rotation around a lineup with middle infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien, who are going into their second year together.DeGrom didn’t make his first big league start last year until Aug. 2, and he was 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 regular-season games before winning a wild-card game for the Mets. He had a career-low 1.08 ERA over 92 innings in 2021 before missing the final three months with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, then was shut down late in spring training last year because of a stress reaction in his right scapula.The Phillies will look different from when deGrom faced them in New York's opener two years ago. Nola didn't oppose him in that game because Philadelphia already had played a series while the Mets' scheduled opening games were wiped out because of COVID-19 issues surrounding the Washington Nationals.Four players remain from the Philadelphia starting lineup that deGrom faced in his 2021 opener, but only catcher J.T. Realmuto and third baseman Alec Bohm will play Thursday. Star slugger Bryce Harper is recovering from reconstructive right elbow surgery and first baseman Rhys Hoskins suffered a torn left ACL in spring training. Hoskins is scheduled for surgery in nearby Fort Worth on the same day of the season opener.“Faced those guys a lot, but they've got some new faces,” deGrom said. “I've got to figure out ways to get these guys out.”Like he has so many times on opening day, and in games against the Phillies.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850719,Kyiv monks accused of Russia links refuse eviction order,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Orthodox monks who've been ordered out of a monastery in Kyiv refused to leave on Wednesday, as a deadline to vacate the complex expired.The dispute over the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery, Ukraine's most revered Orthodox site, is part of a wider religious conflict playing out in parallel with the war.The monks using the property belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has been accused of links to Russia.But the site is owned by the Ukrainian government, and the agency overseeing the property notified the UOC earlier this month that, as of March 29, it was terminating the lease.Metropolitan Pavel, an abbot of the monastic complex, told worshippers on Wednesday that the UOC would not leave the site pending the outcome of a lawsuit it filed in a Kyiv court last week to stop the eviction.No attempts to evict the monks were made on Wednesday but Pavel said the UOC had been notified that the handover of the property would begin on Thursday.Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko appeared to confirm that, telling public broadcaster Suspilne that a commission would start working Thursday on ""the reception of those buildings that are to be transferred from the use of the metropolis to the use of the state.”The government claims that the monks violated their lease by making alterations to the historic site and other technical infractions. The monks of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church dispute this, calling the claims a pretext.The Ukrainian government has been cracking down on the UOC over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.The UOC has insisted that it’s loyal to Ukraine, has denounced the Russian invasion from the start and has even declared its independence from Moscow.But Ukrainian security agencies have claimed that some in the Ukrainian church have maintained close ties with Moscow.

They gradually transitioned to the rival Orthodox Church of Ukraine after it received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who is considered the first among equals among leaders of the Eastern Orthodox churches but who lacks the universal power of a pope.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850721,"Remembrances, calls for reform at Irvo Otieno's funeral","NORTH CHESTERFIELD, Va. (AP) — Family, friends and other mourners gathered Wednesday at a Virginia church to remember Irvo Otieno at a funeral service, celebrating his life and calling for mental health care and policing reforms after the 28-year-old Black man's death earlier this month while in custody at a state psychiatric hospital.“He had an illness. He should have been doctored to, not treated with brutality,"" said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered the eulogy.Other speakers recalled Otieno as an empathetic, energetic and well-respected friend, teammate and musical artist during the service at First Baptist Church of South Richmond, as they vowed to seek justice for his death.Otieno, whose family said he had long struggled with mental illness, died March 6 after he was pinned to the floor by sheriff’s deputies and others while being admitted to Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County. Seven deputies and three hospital workers have been charged with second-degree murder in his death, and an investigation is ongoing.Video released earlier this month shows sheriff’s deputies and hospital employees restraining a handcuffed and shackled Otieno for about 20 minutes after he was forcibly led into a hospital room. For much of that time, Otieno was prone on the floor, pinned by a group so large it blocked the camera's view of him at times.Personnel who realized he appeared limp and lifeless eventually began resuscitation efforts, the video showed. Otieno's family and their attorneys have said he posed no danger and was simply trying to breathe.""You know he couldn’t fight back — he was handcuffed and shackled. And if we sound angry, it’s because we are,"" Sharpton said.Dinwiddie Commonwealth’s Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill has said Otieno was smothered to death. An autopsy is pending.Otieno, who emigrated from Kenya as a young child, spent most of his youth in suburban Richmond. He was a “gregarious baby, a lively toddler, an energetic child, a fun-loving athletic teen and an artistic young man,” his funeral program said. He was also a high-achieving high school athlete who earned an athletic scholarship to attend college.He was pursuing a goal of building a music career, streaming his music under the moniker “Young Vo” while working toward starting his own record label, his family has said.Wednesday’s service was attended by hundreds of mourners that included friends, family, clergy members and representatives from the office of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. An interment was scheduled immediately following the service.Otieno's family and their attorneys have said Otieno was experiencing mental distress at the time of his initial encounter with law enforcement earlier this month, days before he was taken to the state hospital. He was first taken into police custody March 3, when he was transported to a local hospital for mental health treatment under an emergency custody order.Police have said that while at the local hospital, he “became physically assaultive toward officers,"" at which point they arrested him and took him to a local jail, something Otieno's family says should never have happened given that he was in need of treatment. On the afternoon of March 6, he was transferred to the state hospital, which has a unit that provides care for people admitted from jails or by court-order.Attorneys for the defendants charged in his death have said their clients were trying to restrain Otieno. During bond hearings and in statements, several defense attorneys have sought to distinguish their clients from the mass of bodies involved in pinning Otieno to the floor. All defendants have been granted bond and have pre-trial hearings in April or May.Attorneys for Otieno's family have pushed back at those characterizations and did so again Wednesday.“They engage in the intellectual justification of discrimination,” said attorney Ben Crump, who has been called “ Black America’s attorney general ” for his work on civil rights cases.Crump, Sharpton and another family attorney, Mark Krudys, called for more robust mental health care services and more training for law enforcement dealing with mental health-related situations. They also said Virginia should consider creating mental health-specific courts under a system like California's.Caroline Ouko, Otieno's mother, said she never could have imagined what would unfold after her son was first taken to the local hospital for care.""We will miss you dearly. But rest assured, as you fly in heaven with your God, you are not here physically with us. But we who remain, your family, your friends and my team beside me, we will get to the bottom of what happened to you,"" she said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850722,EU slams prison term for Russian father in antiwar art case,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russia's prosecution of a single father whose daughter drew an antiwar sketch at school elicited outrage from the European Union on Wednesday, even as the man, who fled house arrest before the verdict was announced, remained at large.Alexei Moskalyov was convicted of discrediting the Russian army and sentenced to two years in prison in his hometown of Yefremov on Tuesday in a case that has grabbed international attention and underscored the intensity of the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent against the war in Ukraine.European Commission spokesman Peter Stano tweeted that Moskalyov's sentence was “a total disgrace.” Earlier this month, he said the prosecution of Moskalyov represented political repression reaching “new levels,” akin to what happened in the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin.Russia “should respect its own constitution” and international “obligations instead of punishing kids & parents for political reasons,” Stano wrote.Moskalyov, 54, was charged over social media posts criticizing the invasion under a law adopted shortly after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. During his one-day trial, which concluded Monday, he insisted he had nothing to do with the posts.According to his lawyer and supporters, Moskalyov’s troubles began after his daughter Maria, now 13, drew an antiwar picture at Yefremov School No. 9 that depicted missiles flying over a Russian flag at a woman and child and said “No to war” and “Glory to Ukraine,” according to his lawyer and his supporters.The school called police, the girl was questioned and Moskalyov was fined for critical comments on social media. His apartment was raided in December and a criminal case was opened against him. He was placed under house arrest and his daughter was placed into the orphanage.Moskalyov had been under house arrest in his apartment in the town south of Moscow, but he escaped before the verdict was announced.He has been declared a political prisoner by Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest and most prominent rights groups that won the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.Another prominent rights group — OVD-Info — has provided Moskalyov with a lawyer and said it would continue to defend him and his daughter both on the charges of discrediting the army and on the issue of parental rights.A court in Yefremov next week is expected to consider the authorities’ petition to restrict Moskalyov’s parental rights.His supporters said father and daughter love each other, and Maria called him “my hero” in a letter she wrote for him in an orphanage, according to Moskalyov's lawyer who visited the facility on Tuesday. Moskalyov has been raising Maria alone for about 10 years.",2023/03/30,,World

Yost said he thought it a good idea that the railroad hire statewide businesses to do the work, which could take two years to complete.No one was injured in the Feb. 3 train derailment in East Palestine, but concerns over a potential explosion led state and local officials to approve releasing and burning toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars that forced the evacuations of half the village and closed schools for a week.Fifteen Ohio-based companies are already involved in the ongoing cleanup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850737,Ohio lawmakers OK rail safety rules after train derailment,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Rail safety measures proposed after the February train derailment and toxic chemical burn in East Palestine are closer to becoming law in Ohio, as part of a nearly $13.5 billion transportation budget that cleared the Legislature on Wednesday.A compromise budget plan that chiefly funds work on bridges and highways over the next two years passed both Republican-led chambers with bipartisan support, sending it to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for expected final approval.Nearly two months after a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials derailed in a fiery crash in eastern Ohio, lawmakers approved the plan that includes several railway safety provisions. Among them, it would mandate a two-person crew for freight trains; require personnel who receive messages about defects picked up by a railroad’s wayside detector system immediately notify a train operator; and order the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to submit written reports to the Legislature regarding the transportation of hazardous materials and waste.The safety proposals also include a requirement that the wayside detectors used to help spot problems be installed 10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 kilometers) apart, with oversight from the Ohio Department of Transportation and public utilities commission. Currently, the Federal Railroad Administration allows some wayside detectors to be spaced up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) apart.The public utilities commission also would have to examine different kinds of railway detectors and cameras and submit its findings to the General Assembly.Whether the Legislature is allowed to impose these provisions on the rail industry at all has been a matter of debate during the budget process. The Ohio Railroad Association has argued that several of the measures are preempted by federal law. State lawmakers disagreed, saying the General Assembly can put statewide safeguards in place to help protect its constituents.Republican Sen. President Matt Huffman said the Legislature has worked with legal experts and believes the provisions are not preempted, but if challenges arise it could be up to the federal courts to decide.The budget also incorporates lower registration fees for plug-in hybrid vehicles, reducing the annual cost from $200 to $150.A $1 billion fund for rural highways that had been included in the House version of the budget was nixed in the compromise with the Senate, though House Finance Committee chair, GOP Rep. Jay Edwards, said that funding will be pursued through the main operating budget that lawmakers must sort out in the next three months.The transportation budget also raises the threshold for the amount of money a local government can spend on projects such as bridge repairs by its own public workforce before it must bid them out to private contractors. The existing limits had been criticized as outdated and unnecessary obstacles to completing projects those local workforces were otherwise equipped to handle.___Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850738,Gwyneth Paltrow's ski trial defense leans heavily on experts,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Gwyneth Paltrow's attorneys came close to wrapping up their case on Wednesday by relying on more experts to mount their defense on the seventh day of trial over her 2016 ski collision with a 76-year-old retired optometrist.Paltrow's defense team called to the stand a radiologist, a neurologist, a neuropsychologist and a forensic psychologist, leaning on medical analysis rather than the testimony of the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer's friends or husband in order to make their case. In the final hour of their last full day to call witnesses though, they called Terry Sanderson, the man suing Paltrow, back to the witness stand.The eight-person jury is expected to get the case Thursday to deliberate after closing arguments.More than just a display of their financial investment in the case, Paltrow's team allotting most of their time to expert testimony is a gamble. Throughout the trial, bombshell testimony from Paltrow and Sanderson has engaged the jury, while hours of jargon-dense medical testimony has tested their endurance.Experts called by Paltrow's side testified that brain scans suggest Sanderson's cognitive abilities began to decline years before the crash with Paltrow. They challenged claims made last week by his doctors, who attributed his disorientation and memory loss to post-concussion syndrome.“Aging can result in this,” radiologist Carl Black said, pointing to Sanderson's brain scan, which he said showed microvascular ischemic disease of white matter, “because we’re all deteriorating to some degree or other everyday we live.”Members of the jury sat transfixed — with some on the edge of their seats — on Friday when Paltrow said on the stand that she initially thought she was being “violated” when the collision happened. Three days later Sanderson gave an entirely different account, saying she ran into him and sent him “absolutely flying.”Time constraints have challenged both sides throughout the eight-day trial and forced difficult decisions about who to call to testify from their lengthy roster of witnesses. The judge presiding over the trial in Park City has made it clear that he wants both sides to give their closing arguments by Thursday afternoon — in order to give the jury enough time to deliberate and come to a consensus.The trial is taking place in the city that annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998’s “Sliding Doors,” at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.Sanderson is asking for more than $300,000, saying that Paltrow's recklessness on the slope caused the crash, leaving him with four broken ribs and years of post-concussion symptoms including confusion, memory loss and irritability. Paltrow has countersued for a symbolic $1 and attorney fees, alleging that Sanderson veered into her from behind.The amount of money at stake for both sides pales in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit, private security detail and expert witness-heavy trial.The second week of trial has made clear that attorneys have spared little expense on making their case.Sanderson’s attorney told the jury last week that, for him, the trial was about “value, not cost.”To accompany their expert witnesses — many who have testified to being paid more than $10,000 — Paltrow's defense team has played multiple high-resolution animations depicting their side's version of the events that took place in February 2016 on a beginner run at Utah's Deer Valley Resort.Late on Wednesday afternoon, Paltrow's attorneys called Sanderson back to the stand to cast doubt on his claims of life-altering injuries. Instead of revisiting his medical history or expert testimonies, they asked questions about Sanderson's luxury and adventure travel after the crash.They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson riding a camel in Morocco, trekking up to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop around Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.",2023/03/30,,World

John Fetterman will return to the Senate in April, two months after the freshman Democrat sought inpatient treatment for clinical depression, a person close to Fetterman said Wednesday.The person, who was not authorized to discuss Fetterman’s plans and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Fetterman will return the week of April 17.It was not immediately clear when Fetterman will leave Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he checked in Feb. 15 after weeks of what aides described as Fetterman being withdrawn and uninterested in eating, discussing work or the usual banter with staff.Fetterman, 53, was barely a month into his service in Washington and still recovering from the aftereffects of the stroke he suffered last May during his campaign when he went to Walter Reed on the advice of the Capitol physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan.Post-stroke depression is common and treatable, doctors say.Before Wednesday, neither Fetterman nor Senate Democratic leadership had provided a certain timeline for his return.Fetterman’s return will be welcome news for Democrats who have struggled to find votes for some nominations, in particular, without Fetterman there.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has also been absent for several weeks recovering from a case of the shingles, and the two absences have made some votes difficult in Democrats’ single-vote, 51-49 majority.Republicans have also dealt with some absences of their own, notably Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been at home recovering from a fall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850742,Freed ‘Hotel Rwanda’ hero Paul Rusesabagina arrives in US,"HOUSTON (AP) — The man who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda” and was freed by Rwanda last week from a terrorism sentence returned Wednesday to the United States and joined his family after being held for more than two years.Paul Rusesabagina's arrival in San Antonio was announced by his daughter Carine Kanimba, who tweeted that “our family is finally reunited today.”White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan tweeted that “we’re glad to have him back on U.S. soil.”Rusesabagina's plane first touched down in Houston and the 68-year-old would visit a military hospital in San Antonio, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.Rusesabagina, a U.S. legal resident and Belgian citizen, was credited with sheltering more than 1,000 ethnic Tutsis at the hotel he managed during Rwanda’s 1994 genocide in which over 800,000 Tutsis and Hutus who tried to protect them were killed. He received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom for his efforts.Rusesabagina disappeared in 2020 during a visit to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and appeared days later in Rwanda in handcuffs. His family alleged he was kidnapped and taken to Rwanda against his will to stand trial.In 2021, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted in Rwanda on eight charges including membership in a terrorist group, murder and abduction following the widely criticized trial.Last week, Rwanda’s government commuted his sentence after diplomatic intervention on his behalf by the United States. On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists that Rusesabagina was in Doha, Qatar, and would make his way back to the U.S.Rusesabagina had been accused of supporting the armed wing of his opposition political platform, the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change. The armed group claimed some responsibility for attacks in 2018 and 2019 in southern Rwanda in which nine Rwandans died.Rusesabagina testified at trial that he helped to form the armed group to assist refugees but said he never supported violence — and sought to distance himself from its deadly attacks.Rusesabagina has asserted that his arrest was in response to his criticism of longtime President Paul Kagame over alleged human rights abuses. Kagame’s government has repeatedly denied targeting dissenting voices with arrests and extrajudicial killings.Rusesabagina became a public critic of Kagame and left Rwanda in 1996, first living in Belgium and then the U.S.His arrest was a source of friction with the U.S. and others at a time when Rwanda’s government has also been under pressure over tensions with neighboring Congo and Britain’s plan to deport asylum-seekers to the small east African nation.Rights activists and others had been urging Rwandan authorities to free him, saying his health was failing.In October, the ailing Rusesabagina signed a letter to Kagame that was posted on the justice ministry’s website, saying that if he was granted pardon and released to live in the U.S., he would hold no personal or political ambitions and ""I will leave questions regarding Rwandan politics behind me.”Last year, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Kagame in Rwanda and discussed the case.Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, had said Sullivan personally engaged in the case, “really doing the final heavy lifting to get Paul released and to get him on his way home.” ___Tucker reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850743,7 California officers charged in death of man in custody,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prosecutors charged seven California Highway Patrol officers and a nurse with involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday in connection with the 2020 death of a man who screamed “I can’t breathe” while multiple officers restrained him as they tried to take a blood sample.Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced the charges in the death of Edward Bronstein, which the LA County coroner said was caused by “acute methamphetamine intoxication during restraint by law enforcement.”“The officers had a legal duty to Mr. Bronstein,” Gascón said during a news conference. “He was in their custody. We believe that they failed their duty and their failure was criminally negligent, causing his death.”Bronstein, 38, was taken into custody following a traffic stop on suspicion of driving under the influence on March 31, 2020. He died at a CHP station in Altadena, north of downtown Los Angeles, less than two months before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis as he, too, repeatedly told officers, “I can’t breathe.”Luis Carrillo, an attorney representing Bronstein's father, said in an email that his client “is glad that the CHP officers were charged with crimes because the CHP officers took a human life and left a family in grief and sadness.”A nearly 18-minute video showing the officers’ treatment of Bronstein was released last year following a judge’s order in an ongoing federal lawsuit that the man's family filed against the officers, alleging excessive force and a violation of civil rights.Family members have said Bronstein was terrified of needles and believe that’s why he was reluctant to comply with the CHP initially as they tried to take a blood sample.The video, filmed by the sergeant, shows several officers forcing a handcuffed Bronstein to a mat on the floor as he shouts, “I’ll do it willingly! I’ll do it willingly, I promise!”He continues screaming as six officers hold him face-down — the lawsuit alleges they put their knees on his back — and pleads for help.“It’s too late,” one officer replies. “Stop yelling!” another shouts.“I can’t breathe!” and “I can’t!” Bronstein cries, and an officer responds, “Just relax and stop resisting!”But Bronstein's voice gets softer and he then falls silent. While he is unresponsive, the nurse continues to draw blood and the officers keep pinning him down.After they realize he may not have a pulse and does not appear to be breathing, they slap his face and say, “Edward, wake up.” More than 11 minutes after his last screams, they begin CPR.Bronstein never regained consciousness and was later pronounced dead.In a statement, CHP Commissioner Sean Duryee extended condolences to the family and said the agency's mission is to prioritize all Californians' safety.“I am saddened that Mr. Bronstein died while in our custody and care. Any death in custody is a tragedy that we take with upmost seriousness,” Duryee said. “I recognize this case will now move through the court system, and I respect the judicial process.”The seven CHP agents, who were put on administrative leave Wednesday, were identified as Sgt. Michael Little and Officers Dionisio Fiorella, Dustin Osmanson, Darren Parsons, Diego Romero, Justin Silva and Marciel Terry.They face one count each of involuntary manslaughter and one felony count of assault under the color of authority. If convicted, they could get up to four years in prison.It was not immediately clear whether they had lawyers who could speak on their behalf, and the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, the union that represents rank-and-file CHP officers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The registered nurse, Arbi Baghalian, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter.“I believe it is outrageous and irresponsible for the DA to charge a Registered Nurse (who was present to take a legal blood draw) with involuntary manslaughter,” said John Kelly, an attorney for Baghalian’s employer, Vital Medical, in a statement. ""I am not aware of anyone who has opined that the nurse’s conduct in any way caused or contributed to this unfortunate death.”An arraignment has not yet been scheduled.Bronstein's death prompted the CHP to change its policies to prevent officers “from using techniques or transport methods that involve a substantial risk of positional asphyxia,” the agency said. Additional training was also ordered for uniformed officers.In September 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law barring police from using certain face-down holds that have led to multiple unintended deaths. The bill was aimed at expanding on the state’s ban on chokeholds in the wake of Floyd’s murder.",2023/03/30,,World

But they said Hale, a former student at the school, did not target specific victims.Here’s a look at what is known about the shooting and the Nashville police response:THE SHOOTER'S ARRIVAL9:53 a.m.Hale arrived by car in the expansive parking lot Monday, according to a time stamp on edited school surveillance video released by police.Hale drove past someone who appears to be a maintenance worker standing on a sidewalk, and later children on swings in a playground before parking the vehicle.10:11 a.m.Carrying two “assault-style” weapons as well as a handgun, Hale, dressed in camouflage and wearing a vest. shot out glass doors at a side entrance to the school, according to surveillance video time stamps, kicked away remaining shards, ducked under a door crossbar and entered the school.THE 911 CALLS AND POLICE RESPONSE10:13 a.m.Police on Thursday released recordings of three emergency calls about an active shooter. Callers pleaded for help in hushed voices while sirens, crying and gunfire could be heard in the background.In one, 76-year-old retired church member Tom Pulliam tells the dispatcher he is with a group of people, including several children, who are walking away from the Christian school toward a main road. When the dispatcher requests a description of the shooter, Pulliam asks a second man to get on the line.“All I saw was a man holding an assault rifle shooting through the door. It was — he’s currently in the second grade hallway, upstairs” the man says.Asked about how many shots were fired, a woman responds, “I heard about 10, and I left the building.”In another call, a woman tells a dispatcher that she can hear a pause in the gunshots from her hiding spot in an art room closet. The teacher then says she can hear more gunshots, begging the dispatcher, “Please hurry.”Another caller says he is in a second-floor room, believes the shooter is on the second floor, too, and asks the dispatcher to send help.As officers responded, there were two immediate, glaring hurdles, according to Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake: Traffic was snarled as police tried to weave their way to the school, and police cars in the parking lot had been hit by gunfire.SHOTS INSIDE THE SCHOOL10:21 a.m.With alarms blaring and the school's emergency lights blinking, Hale walked slowly through a hallway, checked doors and briefly went into an office.The surveillance video finishes with the shooter far down a hallway, looking to the right where the hallway intersects with another room, and firing shots into the other room.At the same time, officers arrived on campus, police spokesman Don Aaron said in an email, citing dispatch records.POLICE VIDEOIn a six-minute compilation of bodycam video from two different officers released by police that didn't include time stamps, Officer Rex Engelbert parked his patrol car, opened the trunk and removed a service rifle from a duffel bag. He closed the trunk and walked up to a woman who told him that students were locked down and that people inside had just heard gunshots.""OK,"" Engelbert replies in a calm tone. “Yes, ma'am.”Engelbert and other officers swiftly searched classrooms, holding rifles and announcing themselves as police. The officers went upstairs to the second floor and entered a lobby area, followed by a barrage of gunfire and officers yelling commands.10:24 a.m.Officers “engaged” the suspect, Drake said.Within two minutes of that, the suspect was shot, according to the dispatch records.Approximately 15 minutes had passed from when Hale shot in the doors, according to the surveillance video and dispatch records. It’s not known exactly when Hale killed the six people.CHURCH LEADERSAt another Presbyterian church about 10 minutes away from The Covenant School, a meeting was taking place among area church leaders when news of the shooting quickly spread, said George Grant, a leader with the Nashville Presbytery, which is connected with the private school.“The first calls came to us at about the same moment that the police were arriving on the property,"" Grant said.In a separate blog post Wednesday, Grant said ""suddenly, unexpectedly, our deliberations were interrupted by a flurry of calls and texts: there was an active shooter at Covenant’s school facility. We emptied into the hallway ... The Covenant men hurried on their way back to the church. The rest of us began frenzied monitoring of the news while contacting our own flocks and families to mobilize prayer.”After the shooting, the remaining students who were locked down at the school were ferried to a safe location to be reunited with their parents.THE HOME SEARCHAfternoonDuring a search of Hale's home after the shooting, investigators found a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other unspecified evidence.Drake said after Hale's parents were interviewed, it was determined the shooter legally purchased seven firearms from five different local gun stores. Three were used in Monday’s shooting. Drake said.Hale’s parents were unaware that Hale had obtained most of the weapons. They said they believed Hale had only purchased one gun and had sold it.___Associated Press Religion News Editor Holly Meyer contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850747,"Fiona, Ian retired from list of tropical cyclone names","MIAMI (AP) — Weather officials announced Wednesday that they're retiring the names Fiona and Ian from the rotating list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names because of the death and destruction caused by the most recent storms with those names.Farrah will replace Fiona on the lists, and Idris will replace Ian, the World Meteorological Organization said in a news release. Tropical cyclones are assigned names from the alphabetical list when they intensify into tropical storms with winds of 39 mph (63 kph). The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. If a season experiences more than 26 named storms, forecasters use Greek letters.Storm names have long been used to help communicate warnings and to alert people about potentially life-threatening risks, officials said. The names are usually repeated every six years unless a storm is so deadly that the name is retired. Since the current storm-naming system was adopted in 1953, a total of 96 names have been retired from the Atlantic basin list.Hurricane Fiona hit the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos last September before moving northward over the western Atlantic and hitting Canada as a strong post-tropical cyclone. The storm caused over $3 billion in damage across the Caribbean and Canada, and was responsible for 29 direct and indirect fatalities.Days after Fiona's passing, Ian hit western Cuba as a major hurricane and made landfall in southwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm, causing massive storm surge and flooding. Ian was responsible for over 150 direct and indirect deaths, and over $112 billion in damage in the U.S. It was the costliest hurricane in Florida’s history and the third costliest in the U.S.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850748,Uncertain long-term future raising stakes for Brewers,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Milwaukee Brewers have operated the last handful of seasons under the philosophy that they want to contend for as long as possible rather than going all-in during a particular season.But a look at their roster indicates that championship window might not stay open much longer.The Brewers’ best two starting pitchers and their top returning position player all could become free agents at the end of the 2024 season. Craig Counsell, the NL’s longest-tenured manager, has a contract that’s set to expire after this season.That makes this season particularly important as the Brewers seek the World Series berth that has eluded them since 1982. The Brewers also are trying to bounce back after they finished a game out of the NL’s final wild-card spot last year, ending a franchise-record string of four straight playoff appearances.The Brewers open the season Thursday afternoon against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.“Whatever happens in the past is in the past,” ace pitcher and 2021 Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes said. “We can’t dictate what’s going to happen in the future. ‘Oh, you guys were on this run of making the postseason,’ that ended last year. It’s all about this year. It’s all about where our feet are at and what we can do this year.”Counsell takes issue with the notion that the Brewers’ potential future roster issues should add to their sense of urgency this season. As far as he’s concerned, that motivation should be there every year.“If you’re a great player, you get 15 shots at winning a World Series,” Counsell said. “So every season is a sacred season. Whatever situation is going on, you’re very fortunate to have a uniform on and to have a chance to win a World Series, to have great moments in front of thousands of fans with a bunch of friends and brothers.”David Stearns, the Brewers’ former president of baseball operations, often talked about getting as many “bites of the apple” as possible with the idea that multiple postseason runs increased the chances they eventually could win it all.How many more opportunities the Brewers will have with this nucleus remains uncertain.The list of Brewers who are arbitration-eligible for one more season after this one includes Burnes, two-time All-Star pitcher Brandon Woodruff and shortstop Willy Adames, who was voted by Milwaukee’s Baseball Writers Association of America chapter as the team MVP each of the last two years.And then there’s the case of Counsell, who is entering his ninth season and became the Brewers’ career leader in managerial victories last year. Counsell said his uncertain contract status doesn’t make this season feel different to him than any others.The signs of change around Milwaukee began last year.Stearns, the architect of the Brewers teams that earned four straight playoff bids, stepped down as president of baseball operations in October. Matt Arnold, who had been Stearns’ right-hand man during that run, has taken over.One of Stearns’ final major moves was to send four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader to San Diego at the trade deadline last year. Hader had one more year of arbitration left at the time of the move, the same position that Burnes, Woodruff and Adames find themselves in now.The Brewers dealt Hader even though they were leading the NL Central at the time. If the Brewers have fallen out of contention by the trade deadline, who’s to say they wouldn’t deal another prominent player?“We can’t control what’s going to happen at the end of the year,” Burnes said. “We can’t control what’s going to happen halfway through the year. What we can control is going out, playing hard and playing with the group that’s in the clubhouse, and that’s what we’re going to do.”The Brewers don't want to worry about what might happen in the future. Not when they see so much promise in the present.“I wish we could stay together for the rest of our careers, because it’s a really fun group,” Adames said. ""But, like you say, there’s a lot of motivation. Obviously, we want to perform on the field and put up numbers. But I feel like at the end of the day, everybody has the same mindset, to win a championship. So I think as players we just want to have fun, enjoy our time together and try to win a championship together.”NOTES: RHP Adrian Houser will open the season on the injured list with a groin issue. Counsell said Houser likely will miss three weeks. ... Counsell said utilityman Brian Anderson could get much of the playing time at right field early in the season. With Tyrone Taylor out for the start of the season with an elbow injury, the Brewers figure to have an outfield including Christian Yelich in left, rookie Garrett Mitchell in center and Anderson in right.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

Arsenal will play Paris Saint-Germain or Wolfsburg.Fridolina Rolfö scored twice in the first half for Barcelona and Mapi León added another to make it 3-0 by the break. Asisat Oshoala and Patri Guijarro scored two more shortly after interval before Annamaria Serturini netted a consolation goal for Roma.After winning the opening leg 1-0 at Stadio Olimpico in Rome in front of a record-setting crowd of 39,454, Barcelona dominated from the start at Camp Nou.Oshoala knocked down a cross for unmarked Rolfö in the 11th minute to fire home a low shot from 10 meters (yards) to double the aggregate lead.Some 20 minutes later, León unleashed an unstoppable left-foot drive from well outside the area that gave diving Roma goalkeeper Camelia Ceasar no chance.In first-half stoppage time, Caroline Graham Hansen broke down the right to provide a precise cross for Rolfö at the far post to tap in her second.Just seconds in the second half, Aitana Bonmatí presented another perfectly timed cross from the right for Oshoala to make it 4-0 from close range. And minutes later, Guijarro headed in Hansen's corner for the fifth.Arsenal suffered an early blow when captain Kim Little had to be substituted soon after the kickoff due to an injury but then scored twice in a six-minute span in the first half to turn things around.Pressuring its opponent, Arsenal won the ball back inside Bayern's half and played a series of quick passes to tee up Frida Maanum, who drove a shot from just outside the area into the roof of the net to put the hosts 1-0 ahead in the 20th minute.Six minutes later, Katie McCabe set up the second with a cross from the left for Stina Blackstenius to head in the decisive goal and send Arsenal into the semis for the first time in 10 years.Arsenal then wasted a string of clear scoring chances in both halves to stretch the advantage.The English club has won its last six home matches in all competitions without conceding a goal.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850750,Minneapolis council to discuss post-Floyd policing lawsuit,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minneapolis City Council is set to hold a special meeting Thursday to discuss a potential settlement in a lawsuit filed by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights over the city’s policing practices following the murder of George Floyd.City and state officials had been negotiating the agreement, in fits and starts, since the state agency issued a scathing report last year that said the police department had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade. The city and state then agreed to negotiate a court-enforceable agreement known as a consent decree, moving to address the long list of problems identified in the report.Few details about the closed meeting have been released. Mayor Jacob Frey, in a letter to the council, said he was calling the gathering for the purpose of ""receiving a briefing"" on the state's lawsuit. Spokespeople for the mayor did not immediately return calls Wednesday.A spokesman for Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero declined to provide details Wednesday and Gov. Tim Walz declined to say much when asked at a news conference held on a different topic.“This is the Minnesota Department of Human Rights,"" Walz said. ""I'm not going to speak on this. These are classified agreements that they're working on together, and again, the goal there is just to make sure that our communities are safer and they're working together, and I know a lot of work's been into that.”The city is also awaiting the results of a similarly sweeping federal investigation into whether the police department has engaged in a “pattern or practice” of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. The Justice Department launched its probe a day after former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the May 25, 2020, killing of Floyd.The Black man repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe, then went limp as Chauvin knelt on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes. The killing was recorded by a bystander and sparked months of mass protests across the country and around the world as part of a broader reckoning over racial injustice.Chauvin is serving 22 1/2 years on his state murder conviction. He later pleaded guilty to a separate federal charge of violating Floyd’s civil rights and was sentenced to 21 years. The sentences are running concurrently.The federal investigation is expected to lead to a separate court-enforceable consent decree. The city and state would then modify their agreement to resolve any conflicting provisions.The state report, issued in April 2022 after a two-year investigation, detailed evidence showing disparities in how officers use force, stop, search, arrest and cite people of color, particularly Black people, compared with white people in similar circumstances.The report blamed, in part, the culture of the police force, saying officers “receive deficient training, which emphasizes a paramilitary approach to policing that results in officers unnecessarily escalating encounters or using inappropriate levels of force.” City officials disputed a portion that accused police of using “covert, or fake, social media accounts to surveil and engage Black individuals, Black organizations, and elected officials unrelated to criminal activity, without a public safety objective.”The Department of Human Rights sued the city and the police department in June 2020, barely a week after Floyd was murdered, and obtained a preliminary injunction, pending completion of its investigation, that compelled the city to address the allegations of systemic and institutional racism within the police department. Among the immediate changes were a ban on the use chokeholds and neck restraints and a requirement that officers try to stop other officers they see using improper force.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850751,Gwyneth Paltrow won her ski trial. Here's how it played out,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.But Gwyneth Paltrow’s live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year — spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.On Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn’t at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:___LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUSFor seven days, attorneys highlighted — and downplayed — Paltrow and Sanderson’s extravagant lifestyles.Sanderson’s attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.Paltrow’s legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.Sanderson’s attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he “had no joy left in his life.""To keep jurors engaged, Paltrow’s team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.___THE BURDEN OF FAMEAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.Sanderson’s side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 — drawing attention to Paltrow’s testimony that she was “not good friends” with Swift but just “friendly.”Paltrow’s defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson’s “obsession” with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: “I’m famous.”“To become famous, he will lie,” one of Paltrow’s attorneys said. “I’m not into celebrity worship,” Sanderson later rebutted.___FACTORY OF MEMESThough the trial tested the jury’s endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet’s insatiable appetite for memes.Viewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to “The White Lotus” — an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers — and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow’s defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible.”Photographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom — often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook — also have gone viral on social media.___UTAH’S POSHEST SKI TOWNThe proceedings have drawn the world’s attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998’s “Sliding Doors,” at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.The jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.The all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Unlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow’s team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson’s lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as “just a country lawyer"" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.___THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPROPaltrow’s attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.Sanderson’s daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn’t imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.Internet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson’s ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.___THE VERDICTPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury’s verdict in the Park City courtroom.The jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide. It’s unknown when the judge will make that decision. No decision was posted Friday in the online court docket.Paltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.“I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,” the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.As Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson’s shoulder and told him, “I wish you well,” Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, “Thank you, dear.”___Furman reported from Los Angeles.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850752,DeSantis' board says Disney stripped them of power,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Board members picked by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to oversee the governance of Walt Disney World said Wednesday that their Disney-controlled predecessors pulled a fast one on them by passing restrictive covenants that strip the new board of many of its powers.The current supervisors of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District said at a meeting that their predecessors last month signed a development agreement with the company that gave Disney maximum developmental power over the theme park resort's 27,000 acres in central Florida.The five supervisors were appointed by the Republican governor to the board after the Florida Legislature overhauled Disney's government in retaliation for the entertainment giant publicly opposing so-called “Don’t Say Gay” legislation that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as lessons deemed not age-appropriate.In taking on Disney, DeSantis furthered his reputation as a culture warrior willing to battle perceived political enemies and wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue ahead of his potential White House run.The new supervisors replaced a board that had been controlled by Disney during the previous 55 years that the government operated as the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The new board members held their first meeting earlier this month and said they found out about the agreement after their appointments.“We’re going to have to deal with it and correct it,” board member Brian Aungst said Wednesday. “It’s a subversion of the will of the voters and the Legislature and the governor. It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern.”Under the terms of the agreement, the district is prohibited from using the name “Disney” or any symbols associated with the theme park resort without the company's permission, nor can it use the likeness of Mickey Mouse, other Disney characters or other intellectual property in any manner. The company can sue for damages for any violations, and the agreement is in effect until perpetuity, according to the declaration.If the agreement is deemed to violate rules against perpetuity, it will be in effect until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of England's King Charles III, the declaration said.In a statement, Disney said all agreements were above board and took place in public.“All agreements signed between Disney and the District were appropriate, and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida’s Government in the Sunshine law,” the statement said.Separately, Disney World service workers on Wednesday voted to accept a union contract offer that raises the starting minimum wage to $18 an hour by the end of the year.“Our cast members have always been at the heart of the Walt Disney World experience, and we are thrilled that, with the support of the union, they have overwhelmingly approved this new five-year agreement that significantly increases wages, alongside our leading benefits program that includes affordable medical coverage and more,"" Walt Disney World Resort president Jeff Vahle said in a statement. ""Frontline employees also have access to 100 percent paid tuition for higher education through the Disney Aspire program.”The agreement covers around 45,000 service workers at the Disney theme park resort, including costumed performers who perform as Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, bus drivers, culinary workers, lifeguards, theatrical workers and hotel housekeepers.Workers will see their hourly wages rise between $5.50 and $8.60 an hour by the end of the five-year contract, according to union leaders.A contract approved five years ago made Disney the first major employer in central Florida to agree to a minimum hourly wage of $15, setting the trend for other workers in the region dominated by hospitality jobs.",2023/03/30,,World

(AP) — NASCAR fined Daniel Suarez $50,000 on Wednesday for hitting another vehicle on pit road following the race at Circuit of the Americas.The fine was classified as a behavioral penalty and cited ""contact with another vehicle on pit road after the race.""Suarez hit both his Trackhouse Racing teammate Ross Chastain from behind and then Alex Bowman as the cars returned to pit road following Sunday's race on the road course. He spoke with Bowman on pit road after, and leaned into Chastain's car to speak to his teammate through the window.“He just thought I drove in and tried to drive through him,” Bowman said. “Daniel and I, we’ve been teammates in the past, raced together a long time. I respect the hell out of him. I’m sure he’s still not super happy. Just tried to explain that I wouldn’t race him like that, that I was shoved in there.”Suarez finished 27th in a race that went to triple overtime with 10 cautions in the final 17 laps. The race went seven laps past the scheduled distance.The penalty could be considered light in that Suarez avoided a points reduction. NASCAR last year fined Ty Gibbs $75,000 and docked him 25 points for hitting another car on pit road. The penalties are typically intense because of the safety concerns with team personnel and NASCAR officials located on pit road.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

Brown, who said he is a notorious water drinker, has started to chew on hard candy to keep his mouth from drying up — a trick he learned from Scully.Before joining the Arizona Diamondbacks last season, Chris Garagiola did games for Pensacola in the Double-A Southern League, which had a pitch clock and limited infield shifts. But even with that experience, Garagiola is still learning the best way to get the requisite promotional reads during games.Garagiola said last season he would do some during the middle of an at-bat if the game was lagging, but now he is trying to do them coming out of a break between innings or immediately after an out.Many worry the new rules will take away the storytelling and folksy nature of calling baseball on the radio. Then again, Scully thrived in an age when games were quicker, too — the average time of big league games never exceeded 2 hours, 40 minutes until 1982. The average time has been above three hours since 2012, including 3:10 last season.Cleveland Guardians radio broadcaster Tom Hamilton said he paid too much attention to the clock during the first week of spring training, to the point where he was missing what happened in the field. Hamilton hopes the one adjustment that umpires can make is being more demonstrative on pitch clock violations and whether it is on the pitcher or batter.“You have to pop up your head in a hurry after writing something down, or you miss something. I’ve gotten burned on that a couple of times,” said Hamilton, who has done radio for Cleveland since 1990. “You’ve got to be a lot more judicious with your words and get in and out of things quicker because it’s amazing how quickly an inning of baseball can go by right now.”Hamilton said the last three innings of baseball games had become like the final 2 minutes of some basketball games because of how things tended to grind to a halt.“I would have a hard time finding a group of people that enjoyed watching nothing. We’re saving 25-26 minutes of nothing,” Garagiola said. “I did the math over a whole season, which adds up to under 80 hours. I mean, just three full days of nothing.”Michael Kay — who does Yankees games and is part of ESPN’s KayRod Cast on “Sunday Night Baseball” — still thinks the changes will significantly impact radio more than television.“Maybe you won’t be able to see eight replays on a simple ground ball to short because there’s not much time between batters, but I think it’s going to have a big impact on radio broadcasts where the analyst simply is not going to have time to talk,” he said. “I think that’s going to be a different vibe, baseball on the radio this year.”Kay also noted that the KayRod Cast, which he does with Alex Rodriguez, usually had guests on for 1 1/2 innings last season, but that might change if the innings are shorter.Sometimes though, not talking is not a bad thing. ESPN “Sunday Night Baseball” analyst Eduardo Perez acknowledged that there's a running joke in which the best innings are ones when the analysts never talk — and said there might be some truth to it.“If you want to still broadcast Major League Baseball, you better adapt, or you’ll become a dinosaur,” Hamilton said. “The game will dictate whether or not you can get those stories and stats in. If you have a great game and didn’t get a chance to use a lot of that material, that was better for the audience anyway, because it’s still the game that matters.”____AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850756,Why the debate over repealing Iraq War approval matters,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is moving toward doing something it hasn't done since the Vietnam War — repealing authorizations for the president's use of military force. For lawmakers, that's an important gesture toward reclaiming a say over the wars America wages abroad.The Senate voted 66-30 on Wednesday to repeal the 2002 resolution giving President George W. Bush the green light to invade Iraq, an authorization that many now see as a mistake. The measure also would repeal the 1991 resolution authorizing the U.S. military's combat action against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.Approval by the House, which is less certain, would officially end congressional approval for the U.S. war in Iraq and, symbolically at least, close the U.S.-led war itself.Debate on repealing the 2002 authorization comes nearly 20 years after Bush stood in front of a “Mission Accomplished” banner to declare that U.S. troops had wrapped up major combat in Iraq. After that breezy moment of American confidence, the U.S. war went on to take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and thousands of Americans.The U.S. overthrow of Saddam and Iraqi security forces in 2003 opened the door for the rise of both Islamic State fighters and Iranian-allied political parties and militias in Iraq, as well as horrific sectarian violence. Only in December 2021 was the U.S. military finally able to declare an actual end to its combat role — though 2,500 U.S. troops remain in supporting roles.As the Iraq War’s timeline shows, little about how the U.S. starts and ends its modern wars, and who gets to decide, is at all clear cut.Here’s a look at congressional action all this matters.WHAT ARE THE AUTHORIZATIONS? WHY NEEDED?First of all, an “authorization for use of military force” is not a declaration of war. Framers of the Constitution split responsibility over wars abroad between Congress and the president. They gave lawmakers authority on declaring and funding but the president — as commander in chief — authority to direct the waging.That’s what’s in print, anyway. In practice, lawmakers since the Vietnam era have accused the executive branch of starting and pursuing foreign wars and launching military strikes without congressional sign-off.In fact, the last war Congress formally declared was World War II, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.An authorization for use of military force is kind of a war declaration-light, without the more drastic domestic actions that come with formally declaring the nation at war.Presidents since the end of World War II have invoked the authorizations or claimed other legal justifications for the Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm, the wars in Afghanization and Iraq and dozens of more limited military strikes abroad — without full-on declarations of war.In Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson used a 1964 congressional resolution for military force, after an alleged attack on U.S. ships, to steadily draw U.S. forces deeper into the increasingly unpopular war. U.S. intelligence findings justifying the 1964 resolution were later questioned. In the 1970s, Congress repealed the authorization and sought unsuccessfully to assert more control over America’s foreign wars.Still, a half-century later, congressional authorization for military force is a powerful signal that lawmakers are on the same page as the president in the need to wage a war abroad. So revoking that authorization sends a powerful signal, too.WHY SCRAP THE 2002 AUTHORIZATION AND WHY NOW?War fatigue drained public support for both of the post-Sept. 11, 2001, wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq, as the conflicts dragged on for longer and with far darker and deadlier results than the Bush administration and Congress had anticipated. Republican backing, decisive in passing the 2002 authorization, ebbed. That' was especially so as an isolationist trend in the party grew under President Donald Trump.Advocates for repeal won broad and bipartisan support in the Senate on Wednesday, as well as backing from the White House. They argue a repeal shows the world that Iraq’s current, democratically elected government is no longer a U.S. enemy and that Iraq has stabilized.“It sends a message about America. We are willing to turn swords into plowshares,” Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and a main sponsor, told reporters.Keeping congressional authorization for military force on the books “invites presidential mischief,” giving administrations legal cover to launch new military strikes abroad without first consulting Congress, Kaine argued.WHAT'S THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE AUTHORIZATION?Opponents argue repeal would signal weakness, particularly to U.S. rival Iran, and invite Tehran to exert its influence in the Middle East even further. They also say the 2002 authorization is needed to make sure future presidents can respond quickly to threats.“I am opposed to Congress sunsetting any military force authorizations in the Middle East,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said this week. “Our terrorist enemies aren’t sunsetting their war against us.""A March 23 drone strike that killed a U.S. contractor in Syria added impetus to that argument. The U.S. blamed an Iranian-allied militia.Supporters of the repeal counter that presidents can and do cite a range of other legal arguments for authorizing rapid action when a security threat suddenly looms abroad. They point particularly to a separate 2001 congressional authorization for military force against extremist groups that was passed in the immediate aftermath of al-Qaida attacks on the United States. Senators last week resoundingly rejected a bid by Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to repeal the 2001 authorization.THE IRAQ WAR AND CONGRESSLawmakers arguing for withdrawing the 20-year-old authorization for the war in Iraq say it would be a step toward righting the balance of power between Congress and the president when it comes to launching into conflicts abroad.Critics of repeal say Congress willingly yielded too much of its war powers to presidents, especially on the so-called “Forever Wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed the 2001 al-Qaida attacks. Afghanistan became the longest war in U.S. history.Unlike in every previous major war, Congress has allowed administrations to go into debt to pay for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars rather than draw on taxes, said Linda Bilmes, a public finance and policy researcher at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. She has charted the resulting trillions of dollars in interest payments facing the U.S. from those two, two-decade conflicts.Money from the borrowing limited financial scrutiny of the wars in Congress. It also allowed lawmakers and successive administrations to avoid touching off politically fraught debates over the rising costs, Bilmes said.“It was something which was not in the interest of the American public,” Bilmes said. “But it was in the interest of elected officials across the board to have minimal oversight.”WHAT'S NEXT?Repeal of the Iraq War authorizations goes next to the House. It's not clear how broad the support for the repeal is there, or how soon any action might come. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has suggested he is open to supporting repeal, although he previously opposed it. President Joe Biden says he supports the repeal and will sign it if it gets to his desk.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850757,House committee passes bill to overturn DC police reform,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Following through on plans for robust oversight of the nation's capital, House Republicans on Wednesday accused Washington officials of losing control of local affairs, voting to overturn a police reform package passed by the D.C. Council amid nationwide protests about police brutality.“Your position seems to have been ‘Hands off our city’ and that’s not going to fly with the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee,” Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told members of the D.C. Council. “We want to work with you and you’re going to have to work with us.”The measure, approved by the panel along purely partisan lines, now goes to the full House.The latest salvo against the district's home rule followed Congress' action earlier this yea r to nullify a rewrite of the local criminal code. Democrats defended the Council’s right to govern as they see fit and Republicans maintained that the police reform law had demoralized the police force.D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen took the brunt of the criticism, with multiple Republican committee members saying the council's policies were soft on criminals and anti-police in the midst of a crime wave.“D.C. clearly has a crime crisis,” said Comer, R-Ky. “Our nation’s capital has deteriorated and declined. D.C. officials have not carried out their responsibility to serve the citizens.”Mendelson maintained that overall crime numbers were down. But he acknowledged that a spike in homicides and car jackings had fueled public anxiety over safety issues.“People should feel safe, and it is a problem that many residents of the district don’t,” he said.The police reform measure was passed by the D.C. Council on an emergency basis in 2020 and made permanent last December. It bans the use of chokeholds by police officers, makes police disciplinary files more available to the public, weakens the bargaining power of the police union and limits the use of tear gas to disperse protestors.Under terms of Washington’s Home Rule authority, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability essentially vets all new D.C. laws. It frequently alters or limits new laws through budget riders.Congress voted three weeks ago to overturn a comprehensive rewrite of Washington's criminal code. President Joe Biden signed the measure last week.Republicans at the time pledged vigorous oversight of the district. And Wednesday's hearing was just the start, as GOP members moved beyond the district's policing bill to raise a broad range of issues including school truancy, bike lanes and abortion.At the hearing, Mendelson defended the law saying it was “not an attack on police” but designed in part to make it easier to weed out bad officers without the blanket protection of the police union.“It enhances our police chief’s ability to strengthen the force by firing officers who engage in egregious misconduct or commit serious offences,” Mendelson said.Gregg Pemberton, head of the Washington police union, largely sided with congressional Republicans in saying that the law was part of an anti-police campaign by the council that had led hundreds of officers to resign.Pemberton accused the council of “chasing headlines and jumping on the bandwagon of anti-police rhetoric.”D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb watched the hearings and concluded that they didn't have much to do with the actual specifics of the police reform law.“Unfortunately it's what I expected,” Schwalb told The Associated Press. “It's political theater ... They're just using the District of Columbia as a political pawn.”Democratic committee members used the hearing to lobby for statehood for the district or to question oversight. Some said that if congressional Republicans were serious about violent crime, they would back serious gun-control legislation.“I don’t understand why we’re having this hearing,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “I could go through a lot of states right now, especially on the red side, where I don’t like their policies, I don’t like their elected officials and I’d like to have a hearing to second guess them and overturn their legislation.”Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said that even though the committee has the constitutional right to delve into district laws, it should leave the running of the city to its elected officials.“I would encourage folks who are interested in running cities to go run for city council or run for mayor,” said Garcia, a former mayor of Long Beach, California. “Should we be having hearings on why Texas has the highest percentage of uninsured people? Should we be having hearings on why Louisiana and Mississippi have some of the lowest life expectancy?”At times, some of the Republican critics seemed fuzzy on the specifics of the laws they were criticizing. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama asked why the district allows 25-year-old criminals to be tried as minors. A mystified Allen said it doesn't, so Palmer quickly shifted focus to the state of the district's schools, telling the two council members: “You've got crappy schools. Your schools are not only dropout factories, they're inmate factories.”Later, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked Allen why public urination had been decriminalized. Allen said that it hadn't.Mendelson and others have expressed concern that the council will spend the next two years fending off aggressive intervention from an activist Republican-held House. Comer made it clear that Wednesday's hearing will be the first of many. The next D.C.-focused hearing was scheduled for May 19 with Mayor Muriel Bowser as the sole witness.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850768,California may end travel ban to states with anti-LGBTQ laws,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — When North Carolina in 2016 banned transgender people from using the bathroom of their gender identity in public buildings, California retaliated by banning state-funded travel to that state and any other state with laws it deemed discriminatory against LGBTQ people.But seven years later, California now bans state-funded travel to nearly half of the country following a surge of anti-LGBTQ legislation in mostly Republican-led states.The prohibition means sports teams at public colleges and universities have had to find other ways to pay for road games in states like Arizona and Utah. And it has complicated some of the state’s other policy goals, like using state money to pay for people who live in other states to travel to California for abortions.Wednesday, state Senate leader Toni Atkins announced legislation that would end the ban and replace it with an advertising campaign in those states that promotes acceptance and inclusion for the LGBTQ community. The bill would set up a fund to pay for the campaign, which would accept private donations and state funding — if any is available.“I think polarization is not working,” said Atkins, who is a lesbian. “We need to adjust our strategy. We know what we need to do, but we need to be able to be there to do it.”Overturning the ban could be difficult in the California Legislature, where 10% of lawmakers now identify as LGBT. Assemblymember Evan Low, a Democrat from Campbell who authored the travel ban in 2016, said he supports the advertising campaign but said “we shouldn't completely end California's state-funded travel ban without having an alternative action in combating discrimination.”“We can't back down, especially as a record amount of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is being introduced,” said Low, who is gay.California's travel ban has been in effect since 2017. The state Attorney General keeps a list of states subject to the ban, a list that has grown quickly as several states have passed laws restricting doctors from providing gender-affirming care to minors and stopping transgender women and girls from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity.Today, the ban includes 23 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.The law applies to state agencies, departments, boards, authorities and commissions — including the schools that are part of the University of California and the California State University systems.That means schools like the University of California, Berkeley, can't use state money for their football teams to travel to away games in Arizona and Utah — schools it must play against because they are in the same athletic conference.The San Diego State University men's basketball team will play in the Final Four on Saturday in Houston, a state that is on the no-travel list. The team got around the ban because the NCAA, not California taxpayers, is footing the bill for the team's travel. But the ban does mean the school can't schedule football games against teams in Texas, said Jamie McConeghy, senior associate athletic director of communications and media relations for San Diego State.The law has a number of exceptions, including travel necessary to enforce California laws, meet contractual obligations or to obtain grant funding. It also allows travel for the protection of health and safety, which is why a state-funded security detail could travel with Gov. Gavin Newsom's family on a vacation to Montana last year.But it has complicated some of the Democrats' policy goals in surprising ways. Last year, California agreed to spend $20 million to help women in other states travel to California for abortions in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.“We could help someone fly or travel to California, but when they had to go back to Texas or Florida or whatever any of those states, we actually couldn't legitimately spend money to send them home,” Atkins said. “It starts to get complicated.”Atkins said she will formally introduce the legislation on Thursday, which must be vetted by lawmakers in both the state Senate and state Assembly before it could become law — a process that will take several months.“When you disagree with someone, you should try to open their eyes to change hearts and minds, not pretend they don't exist,"" said Assemblymember Greg Wallis, a Republican from Bermuda Dunes. ""I'm glad California is coming around to that approach.”Marc Stein, a history professor at San Francisco State University who is gay and does research on queer history, said he would want to hear from LGBTQ communities in other states before deciding whether he supports lifting the travel ban.But Stein said he would like to see an exception made for social justice research. Shortly after California's travel ban took place, he said he had trouble booking a trip to North Carolina shortly after the travel ban took effect so he could research the case of a transgender woman who had been arrested for sodomy in the 1960s.Stein said the university eventually found a way to fund his research, but said the barrier remains for other researchers, particularly students studying for advanced degrees.“I think Ph.D. students in California are being discouraged from pursuing research projects that would require extensive trips to the list of states which is now almost half the country,” he said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850769,West Virginia bans marriage for children age 15 or younger,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia will no longer allow children under 16 to marry, after the governor signed a compromise bill Wednesday.The law signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice continues allowing children ages 16 and 17 to get married with restrictions. Under the new law, those minors must get parental consent and can’t marry someone more than four years older than them. Existing legal marriages, and those done in other states, are unaffected.Previously, anyone younger than 16 could have gotten married with a judge’s waiver.Similar bills to ban child marriage were proposed in recent years but didn’t get traction.Some Democrats, including the bill's sponsor, Del. Kayla Young of Kanawha County, had hoped to eliminate child marriage altogether. Some Republicans in the GOP-dominated Legislature spoke about how they or their parents had married before adulthood and argued that state recognition of the relationships helps keep families together.Young said she had to compromise with her Republican colleagues to secure a minimum age for marriage, and celebrated the aspect of the bill that prohibited large age gaps.Seven states have set the minimum age for marriage at 18, all since 2018, according to the advocacy group Unchained at Last, which has lobbied for legislation in variousstates to end child marriage. The group calls the practice a human rights abuse.Supporters of such legislation say it reduces domestic violence, unwanted pregnancies and improves the lives of teens.West Virginia had the highest rate of child marriages among the states, according to the Pew Research Center. There were around seven marriages for every 1,000 children ages 15 to 17 in West Virginia in data collected from 2010 to 2014, compared to around 4.6 marriages per 1,000 for the same age group nationwide.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850770,Special prosecutors appointed in Baldwin set shooting case,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Santa Fe's district attorney has appointed two veteran New Mexico lawyers to serve as the new special prosecutors in the manslaughter case against Alec Baldwin and a weapons supervisor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer during a 2021 movie rehearsal.The appointment of Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis to the positions will allow District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies to focus on New Mexico's “broader public safety needs,” her spokesperson Heather Brewer said in a statement Wednesday.The original special prosecutor, Andrea Reeb, resigned earlier in the wake of missteps in the filing of initial charges against Baldwin and objections that Reeb’s role as a state legislator created conflicting responsibilities.Carmack-Altwies subsequently had been preparing to appoint a new special prosecutor and also guide the complex case as co-counsel.But Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said on Monday the district attorney should either lead the case on her own or turn it over entirely to another prosecutor.Baldwin and movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 18 months in prison and fines.Hutchins died shortly after being wounded Oct. 21, 2021, during rehearsals for the Western film “Rust” at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.A defense attorney for Gutierrez-Reed objected to Carmack-Altwies' earlier plans to serve as co-counsel, arguing it would be illegal under New Mexico law and fundamentally unfair to a 25-year-old defendant with limited financial resources.Brewer said the appointment of Morrisey and Lewis, with their “extensive experience and trial expertise, will allow the state to pursue justice for Halyna Hutchins and ensure that in New Mexico everyone is held accountable under the law.”A weekslong preliminary hearing in May will decide whether evidence against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed is sufficient to proceed to trial.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850772,Adnan Syed case pits victims' rights against justice reform,"BALTIMORE (AP) — When Baltimore prosecutors asked to vacate Adnan Syed's murder conviction and have him freed after 23 years behind bars, their request exemplified a growing movement within the American criminal justice system to acknowledge and correct past mistakes, including police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.But a Maryland appellate court ruling released Tuesday raises new questions about the rights of crime victims, whose role in such proceedings often comes in opposition to ongoing justice reform efforts. In interviews Wednesday, legal experts said the ruling could have serious implications in Maryland and beyond.The Appellate Court of Maryland’s 2-1 decision reinstated Syed’s conviction, creating yet another unexpected wrinkle in the protracted legal odyssey chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.” The court ordered a redo of the September hearing that won Syed his release, finding that the victim’s family didn’t receive adequate notice to attend in person, which violated their right to be “treated with dignity and respect.”Syed will appeal the decision to the state’s highest court, his attorney said Tuesday. In the meantime, he will continue working at Georgetown University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, a program that offers classes to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people.“Will Adnan go back to prison? I don’t think so,” his friend and advocate Rabia Chaudry told supporters on Instagram live Wednesday morning. “He’s living his life.”While crime victim advocates celebrated their victory, others warned the ruling could have a chilling effect on existing efforts to fight wrongful convictions and excessive sentences.“The victims’ rights movement is a very powerful lobby that wants a reserve seat at the head of the criminal justice table,” said Doug Colbert, a University of Maryland law professor who represented Syed at his initial bail hearing decades ago. “This ruling certainly seems to satisfy their agenda.”David Jaros, faculty director of the Center for Criminal Justice Reform at the University of Baltimore School of Law, said defendants rarely succeed in getting prosecutors to reconsider a standing conviction.“Adding additional hurdles is absolutely a legitimate concern,” he said. “We need to create a balance between respect and sympathy for victims, on the one hand, and the very critical need for courts and prosecutors to revisit these cases.”Syed was 17 when his high school ex-girlfriend and classmate, Hae Min Lee, was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave in 1999. He was arrested weeks later and ultimately convicted of murder. He received life in prison, plus 30 years.At the direction of then-State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore prosecutors started reviewing Syed’s case under a Maryland law targeting so-called juvenile lifers. Many states have passed similar laws in recent years since the U.S. Supreme Court prohibited mandatory life sentences for children convicted of serious crimes.That review uncovered numerous problems, including alternative suspects and unreliable evidence presented at trial. Prosecutors filed a motion to vacate Syed’s conviction, giving him a chance at freedom after years of failed appeals and international media attention.A Baltimore judge quickly scheduled a hearing on the motion.The victim’s brother, Young Lee, was notified on a Friday afternoon that the hearing would take place the following Monday. When the hearing started, an attorney representing the Lee family requested a one-week postponement so Young Lee could travel to Baltimore from his home in California. A judge denied the request but allowed him to address the court via Zoom.The judge later declared Syed’s conviction vacated and ordered him unshackled inside the Baltimore courtroom. He descended the courthouse steps surrounded by beaming relatives and cheering fans. Prosecutors were given 30 days to decide whether to retry the case.In the meantime, Young Lee’s attorney filed an appeal, saying the family received insufficient notice about the hearing.While the appeal was pending — and eight days before the deadline — Mosby announced her decision to drop all charges against Syed, saying new DNA testing from Lee’s shoes excluded him as a suspect. She said the Lee family’s appeal was now moot because there were no underlying charges.In its ruling Tuesday, the appellate court disagreed. The majority judges determined Mosby dropped the charges in an effort to thwart the appeal. They ordered Syed’s conviction reinstated but stayed their ruling for 60 days, delaying a determination on whether Syed returns to prison while the case proceeds.Mosby, who left office in January after losing re-election, said the ruling “sets a dangerous precedent over a prosecutor’s ability to reverse an injustice.”In his dissenting opinion, Judge Stuart Berger said he considered the appeal moot after the charges were dropped. He also found Young Lee’s rights were not violated.Berger said Maryland legislators should develop more specific victims’ rights requirements — including how much notice they should receive for conviction vacatur hearings — instead of leaving it to the courts to interpret a patchwork of existing statutes that don’t directly address the issue.Attorneys for Young Lee applauded the ruling, which largely affirmed their arguments.Paul Cassell, a victims’ rights lawyer and University of Utah law professor, similarly expressed approval.“This decision is an important milestone, signaling that crime victims’ rights are becoming an enforceable part of our nation’s criminal justice architecture,” he said. “It would add insult to criminal injury to extend victims only paper promises.”But Ashley Nellis, senior research analyst for The Sentencing Project, said the ruling could jeopardize other wrongful conviction cases and hinder a growing reform movement, in part because of the media spotlight focused on Syed.“This is a very unique situation on multiple fronts,” she said. “For one celebrity case, many more are affected.”—Associated Press writer Brian Witte in Annapolis contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World

But his team sees them as a tool to bypass the traditional news media and speak directly to supporters, and as part of a broader effort to steer Trump toward policy instead of his own grievances and obsessions with the past.“It certainly lays down a marker for President Trump and the campaign on very specific policy prescriptions. No campaign has done it thus far and it sort of harkens back to 2016 where President Trump was pushing out policies left and right,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said. “We want to put a focus on policy and do it differently from a run-of-the mill campaign.”That effort has continued even as Trump's campaign faces the prospect that he could become the first former president in U.S. history to face criminal charges. The campaign strategy offers insight into how his team might press forward if he does end up on trial in New York or faces indictment in other ongoing state and federal investigations.On Wednesday afternoon alone, Trump posted half a dozen videos on his Truth Social site, including several blasting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seen as Trump's most serious potential rival for the Republican presidential nomination.In one video, Trump thanked supporters for attending his recent Texas rally and asked them to “sign up, donate and volunteer for our campaign.” In another video, he lashed out at the federal and state prosecutors who have been investigating his conduct. “Election interference through prosecutors is the new ballot stuffing for the Democrat Party,"" Trump charged.The made-for-internet videos are typically released on Trump's site between a barrage of angry, all-capital-letter missives and flattering articles from conservative sites, though some have been previewed by media outlets. Those have featured Trump laying out policy plans on topics ranging from crime and immigration to inflation. He has envisioned flying cars in futuristic cities and has pledged to impose tariffs on most foreign goods, increase penalties on minors who commit crimes and rid the Pentagon of “warmongers.”There are more to come: Trump filmed 27 in a recent session, underscoring the campaign's embrace of the format.The videos do not always garner mainstream media attention. But they often receive several hundred thousand views on platforms such as Rumble and Twitter.Trump allies say the videos were introduced at a critical time for the campaign, when it was struggling after a lackluster launch and a disappointing midterm election outcome in 2022 in which Trump was blamed for Republicans' failures to make expected gains.The first video was released the same day as a widely panned digital trading card announcement and after Trump's dinner with a known white nationalist and a rapper who had spewed antisemitism. At the time, even people close to Trump were publicly voicing doubts about whether he was serious about going through with another campaign.The videos, they argued, helped to change the narrative by demonstrating Trump had plans for a second term and was running not just to try to stave off indictment or because of his lingering anger over the 2020 White House election, which he continues to falsely insist he won.“These policy videos have been largely responsible for repositioning his candidacy for the better,"" said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and close adviser to Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. “And it happened slowly and it happened under the radar. They didn’t get tons of mainstream media attention, but they served as a constant reminder to GOP primary voters,"" Surabian said, that the former president ""has a serious forward-looking policy vision for 2024.”They also developed from a tacit acknowledgement that Trump was receiving less media attention, both from Fox News, as it increasingly embraced DeSantis, and other cable outlets that had once eagerly aired Trump's rallies live and allowed him to call in for hours of interviews.“This is one way to bypass them,” Cheung said. ""We all know digital video and social media is one way to do that — going directly to the people.”This isn't the first time Trump aides have turned to videos at a consequential moment.On Jan. 6, 2021, hours after the his supporters violently stormed the Capitol in a bid to halt the peaceful transfer of presidential power to Democrat Joe Biden — and after desperate aides and allies begged Trump to call them off — Trump released a video filmed in the Rose Garden in which he told the rioters to “go home now,"" while adding: “We love you, you're very special.”He taped another video the next day, outtakes from which were played during congressional hearings.During his 2016 campaign, Trump also turned to a recorded statement to apologize after the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape in which he used lewd and sexually charged comments about women.Now, the series of campaign videos is part of a larger focus on policy by Trump that has often been overshadowed by his more incendiary comments.During an early March speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, for instance, Trump described the 2024 race in apocalyptical terms. “In 2016, I declared, ‘I am your voice.’ Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,"" he said.But Trump also spent much of that speech outlining his priorities for a second term, from new crackdowns on immigration to creating tent cities for the homeless and those addicted to drugs.The videos are typically filmed in sessions once or twice a week in a room adjacent to the central “living room” space at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. After the first video received a better-than-expected reception, the campaign realized there was an appetite for policy content and that the format gave it better traction than traditional news releases.Some videos received widespread attention. That was the case with his plan for a “quantum leap in the American standard of living,"" with new futuristic cities built on federal land, investments in vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, and “baby bonuses” to launch a new “baby boom,""“I think they’ve been very successful,” Trump said of the videos during an appearance on the conservative “Just the News” last month. He credited them for his recent polling bump.Democrats say the videos simply renew attention on an unpopular agenda that voters have already opposed.“Donald Trump’s ‘policy’ videos serve as a consistent reminder that a second Trump administration would dramatically build on the four years of his disastrous MAGA agenda with more extreme and dangerous proposals,"" said Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.”“While the rest of the 2024 field competes to out-MAGA Trump, the American people will see an exceedingly extreme party they’ve already rejected, more than once,” Harrison said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850774,Milley: US has long way to go to build munitions stockpile,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military “has a long ways to go” to beef up its munitions stockpiles and ensure the country is ready for any large-scale war, the top U.S. military officer told Congress on Wednesday.Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the war in Ukraine has underscored the heavy use of munitions that is required during any major conflict.He and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin faced repeated questioning from members of Congress this week about the impact the war is having on the Pentagon, as it supplies Ukraine with much of the ammunition it needs to fend off the Russian forces.They, and senior Army leaders, said the conflict has pushed the U.S. to increase production rates and re-evaluate how much of a stockpile is really needed as tensions with China and Russia continue to rise.“If there was a war on the Korean peninsula or great power war between the United States and Russia or the United States and China, the consumption rates would be off the charts,” Milley said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. “So I’m concerned. I know the secretary is ... we’ve got a ways to go to make sure our stockpiles are prepared for the real contingencies.”He said Austin directed the military to conduct a complete review of all its war plans and assess the munitions estimates, which can then form the basis for future budget requests.The Pentagon is requesting $30 million in the 2024 fiscal year budget to invest in the industrial base and to “buy the maximum number of munitions that American industry can produce,” Austin said during the same hearing.In testimony earlier this week, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told lawmakers that right now the Army is “comfortable that the amount of lethal assistance we’ve been providing is not eroding our readiness, but we keep a close eye on that.”A key concern is the 155 mm ammunition. The U.S. has sent Ukraine 160 howitzers and more than 1 million of the 155 mm howitzer rounds. The munitions have been put to heavy use with as many as 3,000 rounds fired a day, according to the Pentagon.Wormuth, who visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania where the shell casings for the rounds are made, said the service asked for $1.5 billion in the budget to be able to shore up that production. She said the U.S. would like to increase production from about 20,000 shells a month to 75,000 a month by 2025.“We are working very closely with industry to try to do everything we can to help make it easier for them to increase both the volume of their production but also the speed of their production,” she said.Asked about the impact on American troops, Gen. James McConville, chief of staff of the Army, said the military goes through about 150,000 rounds a year for training — or roughly 14,000 a month.Another pressure point is ammunition for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, which the U.S. is also sending to Ukraine. Wormuth said the U.S. is working to increase production from about 6,000 a year to 15,000 a year.Austin and Wormuth also said the Pentagon is hoping that Congress will allow it to do multi-year procurement plans in order to save money and provide stability for the industry.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850778,Bayern Munich limp out of Champions League at Arsenal,"In the first three months of 2023, Bayern Munich had conceded just one goal. But on a rainy night in north London, it took just 26 minutes for Arsenal to score twice as many and a further 64 to send the German side out of the Champions League with the merest of whimpers.Before Wednesday's game, Arsenal coach Jonas Eideval had made a point of talking up Bayern's defensive strengths. ""They work very hard together collectively,” he said. ""There are a lot of times when you get into the penalty area and they block your shots and make things really tight around you.”They may have done so in the first leg, and in their crucial win over Wolfsburg on Saturday, but this was a brutal lesson from an Arsenal side missing their two best attacking players in Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead. The Women's Super League (WSL) side also lost their captain, Kim Little, early in the piece, forcing England skipper Leah Williamson in to midfield.It was from there that Williamson played a crucial part in a sublime 19th-minute opener, her backheel paving the way for Frida Maanum to whip a sensational effort off the woodwork and in. Stina Blackstenius doubled the lead seven minutes later. It wouldn't get any better for Bayern.""We just weren't good enough in the 1v1s,” Bayern's Icelandic defender Glodis Perla Viggosdottir told DW after the game. ""It was really women against girls in the tackles and I think that's why we lost the game. We felt overwhelmed, they had so many attacks we could've lost 6-0 and in total over the two games they totally deserve to be through to the next round. They were very good.”Bayern had looked invincible of late, a run of 14 consecutive wins meaning confidence could not have been higher. So how to explain an opening period where they were second best in every area? Where their strengths — a hardworking and technically sound midfield three and two experienced, intelligent center backs —  crumbled so feebly.""It's about how you start the game. Whether you win or lose your first tackles,” Viggosdottir offered. ""The confidence was a big problem and when they pressed us on the left we couldn't find the solutions. I think those games are often decided in the 1v1s and they just put everything in every tackle [and we didn't].”Though his center back could offer some analysis in the aftermath, Bayern coach Alexander Straus could only flail in frustration during that devastating first half. The Norwegian threw his arms out, called his players in at any opportunity and eventually resorted to shrugging his shoulders and slumping back to the bench.If Straus had anything to work with at the break, it was that his side were still, somehow, alive in the tie with Blackstenius among those who could've put Arsenal out of sight. He got a response of sorts after the break. That midfield three of Georgia Stanway, Sarah Zadrazil and Lina Magull wrestled the second half on to a more even keel, Saki Kumagai and Viggosdottir looked a little happier coping with Blackstenius and Caitlin Foord.But, in truth, it was never much more than a foothold, with their former goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger never tested in the Arsenal goal. At the other end, Caitlin Foord spurned a glorious chance to put the game to bed. Still Bayern somehow clung to hope, though it proved useless without conviction.With minutes remaining, Straus withdrew both Lina Magull and Lea Schüller – hooking two such dominant figures in his side an admission of the paucity of Bayern's efforts. Stanway's wild lunge in injury time added a measure of pointless frustration. She wasn't the only one feeling it.""We have to go all in on the league now and we have to recover from this game. Of course it's hard because it's a bad feeling,” Viggosdottir concluded. ""We've never won against a really, really good team in the Champions League — whether it's Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain or Barcelona. It really annoys me because that should be the next step, to handle that pressure. We're still a young team but that's something that we have to learn.”Having proved so much with the first leg win against Arsenal and victory against Wolfsburg in Bavaria at the weekend, Bayern undid plenty of that on Wednesday night, leaving old questions still open. The test now is to make sure that a night on the ropes in London doesn't leave them on the canvas in the Bundesliga title race.Edited by Kalika Mehta",2023/03/29,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850779,Twitter removes tweets about 'Trans Day of Vengeance',"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Twitter says it has removed thousands of tweets showing a poster promoting a “trans day of vengeance” protest in support of transgender rights in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.Ella Irwin, Twitter’s head of Trust and Safety, said in a tweet Wednesday that the company automatically removed more than 5,000 tweets and retweets of a poster promoting the event.“We do not support tweets that incite violence irrespective of who posts them. “Vengeance” does not imply peaceful protest. Organizing or support for peaceful protests is ok,” Irwin wrote in the tweet.In removing the tweets, Twitter said it used automated processes to do it quickly at a large scale, without considering what context the tweets were shared in. Because of this, both tweets that were critical of and those that supported the protests were removed.This appeared to anger many conservative Twitter users who said the rules were unfairly applied to them because they were posting the image of the protest flyer to speak out against it.But trans activists were quick to point out that “trans day of vengeance” is a meme that has been around in the trans community for years and is not a call to violence — and said Twitter is misguided in its reasoning behind removing the tweets in support of the protest.Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit liberal advocacy group Fight for the Future, said Twitter’s actions are “the latest example of Big Tech companies employing double standards in content moderation.”""They are slow to moderate content targeting trans people, but quick to silence us when we speak out or push back. ’Trans Day of Vengeance' is not a specific day or a call for violence. It’s a meme that’s been around for years, a way of expressing anger and frustration about oppression and violence the trans community faces daily,” Greer said. “Context is everything in content moderation, which is why content policies should be based in human rights and applied evenly, not changed rapidly based on public pressure or news cycles.”The poster in question is a largely text-based digital flyer. It reads “we want more than visibility” on top, followed by “trans day of vengeance” and “stop trans genocide” as well as the date and time of the planned protest.Many of the tweets Twitter removed were from conservative users sharing an image of the flyer in an attempt to connect the planned protests with the recent school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee. In the aftermath of the shooting, some right-wing activists and commentators have seized on the gender identity of the shooter in order to denounce transgender people and advocates, call transgender people violent, and “evil,” and insinuate they are planning to engage in violence. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, was among the Twitter users whose account was affected.The shooting is still under investigation. As of Wednesday, police have shared no evidence that the shooter's gender or gender identity played a role in the shooting.On its website, the group organizing Saturday's protest said it does not condone violence. In a statement posted on the site, the Trans Radical Activist Network and other organizers also strongly rejected any connection between the school shooting in Nashville and Saturday’s protest, which organizers said was planned before the shooting took place.“Vengeance means fighting back with vehemence,” the protest's organizers wrote on their website. “We are fighting against false narratives, criminalization, and eradication of our existence.”Twitter, both currently under Elon Musk and before the billionaire bought the company, has long prohibited the incitement of violence in tweets. In early March, Twitter announced what it called a new policy prohibiting “violent speech” on its platform, though the new rules appear similar to guidelines against violent threats that the company had on its books before Musk took over.Among the updates, Twitter had expanded its policy to include a ban on “coded language,” which is often referred to as “dog whistles,” used to indirectly incite violence. It also added a rule that prohibits “threatening to damage civilian homes and shelters, or infrastructure that is essential to daily, civic, or business activities.”",2023/03/30,,World

Luckily we are all OK,” she said.She said she recorded the video Monday, but it was too raw to post that day.“I don’t know what to say anymore,” she said. “Enough is enough.”A spokesperson for Hart, who has starred in sitcoms including “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” didn't immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking further comment.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850781,North Dakota aims at school curriculum to deter abortions,"North Dakota schools would be required to show students high-quality video of how a human fetus develops in each week of pregnancy under a bill Senate lawmakers approved during a vote Wednesday.The 37-9 vote comes on the heels of the North Dakota Supreme Court's ruling this month that a state abortion ban will remain blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds.“If young people see the beauty of these beginnings, then hopefully they’ll think twice before running to the abortion clinic,"" Sen. Janne Myrdal, a Republican of Edinburg who helped introduce the bill, said in an interview with The Associated Press.The bill would mandate schools to show middle and high school students a high-definition ultrasound video, at least three minutes long, on the development of the brain, heart and other vital organs in early fetal development — along with a high-quality animation of the fertilization and human development process inside the uterus, “noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy.”Lawmakers did not explicitly mention abortion when debating the bill on the Senate floor.Opponents of the bill said they did not want to overstep by telling local schools how to teach, whereas supporters said lawmakers have the right to mandate curriculum in taxpayer-funded institutions.“Although the video was great, well-intended, I just think we’re opening the door to something that in the future might widen the scope of how we dictate local schools,” Republican Sen. Michelle Axtman, of Bismarck, said in opposition to the bill.Myrdal countered that state lawmakers already mandate many aspects of school curriculum including sex and abstinence education, Native American history and anti-bullying programs.Republican Sen. Michael Wobbema, of Valley City, said the bill would not cost schools any money because the content the lawmakers have in mind is already online and free.The bill was amended in the Senate, so it still needs to gain final approval in the House and a signature from the governor to become law.Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound around six weeks into a pregnancy in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart.In Georgia, which has one of the nation's most restrictive abortion measures, the law prohibits most abortions once there is a “detectable human heartbeat"" and effectively bans most abortions at a point before many people know they are pregnant.Similar so-called heartbeat measures have been considered this year in states including Ohio, South Carolina and Nebraska.___Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850783,Final Four a chance for SDSU to double its championships,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The number of San Diego State teams that have won an NCAA Division I championship can be counted on one finger.Many Aztecs fans and alumni have no idea because it happened 50 years ago and the school dropped men’s volleyball in 2000. Brian Dutcher, who has been on campus for 24 years, does know about that championship and would love to double the school's total when he coaches the Aztecs in their first Final Four.“Volleyball. Men’s volleyball. Chris Marlowe,” Dutcher said, referring to one of the stars of that 1973 team, who went on to win a gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and once broadcast SDSU basketball games on local TV. “They’re hard to get so you value every one of them when you can get one.”SDSU’s first trip to the Final Four, secured with a nail-biting win against Creighton, has resonated with Aztecs alumni and fans, as well as throughout this championship-starved city. Even Bill Walton is stoked, which shows how big of a deal it is. The Aztecs (31-6) will play fellow first-timer Florida Atlantic (35-3) in the national semifinals on Saturday.Marlowe, who does play-by-play for the Denver Nuggets, said he lost count of the number of calls, texts and emails he received after the Aztecs won the South Region final Sunday. The highlight was a voicemail from Walton, who grew up near SDSU, won two national titles under John Wooden at UCLA and watched his youngest son, Chris, play for Steve Fisher at SDSU in the early 2000s.“It went on for maybe two minutes about 'How great it is for San Diego State and Chris Marlowe, you were an Aztec!’ You know how Bill can rant. It was just so much fun to listen to his message. I called him back and I now have a dinner invitation at his house when in August we go down there for vacation,"" Marlowe said.SDSU has had some great individual basketball players, including Kawhi Leonard, Michael Cage and two-sport star Tony Gwynn. Gwynn still holds SDSU's game, season and career assists records. He was drafted by both the Padres and the then-San Diego Clippers on the same day in 1981, and a year later began his 20-year Hall of Fame career with the Padres. He later coached baseball at SDSU for 12 seasons before dying of cancer in 2014 at age 54.But the hoops teams themselves have been mostly mediocre. Fisher inherited one of the worst teams in the country when he was hired in March 1999, bringing Dutcher along as an assistant. Together they built the Aztecs into a West Coast power. Dutcher took over after Fisher retired six years ago.“Everybody’s just fired up,” Marlowe said. “Sometimes the longest road can be the most beautiful thing. When you’re winning every year, when you’re contending every year, there are high expectations. I don’t think anybody really expected this San Diego State team to get to the Final Four, but they have a terrific, interesting team to watch, with a collection of manly men — strong and broad and long and jumpy, and yet they are very disciplined under Brian Dutcher, which is really impressive.”Tony Gwynn Jr., who played for his dad at SDSU, said it’s “surreal” to see his alma mater in the Final Four.“For those of us who have watched the Aztecs as long as I have, this is almost a coming-out party,” Gwynn said. “Those are the type of wins that change the program forever and hopefully moving forward this is a consistent team.”Gwynn imagines his father “having a smile from ear to ear” if he were still alive. “That’s how big of a deal this is. My dad’s first love was basketball. He loved it so much that he was broadcasting State games for a while there. He loved the program. He got to see it in its infant stages and go from doormat to seeing the potential that it had.”Gwynn’s phone was blowing up on Sunday, too. He was broadcasting the Padres’ spring training game against Seattle in Peoria, Arizona. Mariners first baseman Ty France, who played at SDSU for Gwynn’s dad, had just taken his defensive position when the score of the Aztecs game was announced on the PA system.“He was celebrating, I’m hanging out the window, giving a round of applause. It was a San Diego State moment for sure,"" said Gwynn, adding that pretty much everybody he went to school with began texting him. “My phone could not stop buzzing.""Asked if he knew how many NCAA championships SDSU has won, junior guard Lamont Butler said: “I think it's zero.” Told about the 1973 men's volleyball team, he added: “Oh wow, I didn’t know that.”Gwynn also thought it was zero and then guessed the one title was men's golf.Told it was men's volleyball, he quickly added: “Before we got rid of the program.”That 1973 national championship volleyball team will have a 50th reunion in August in San Diego at the home of Duncan McFarland, who was MVP of the NCAA Tournament.“If San Diego State happens to win the basketball championship, that would make it even more entertaining, I think,"" Marlowe said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850784,TikTok ban pushed by Missouri's Hawley blocked in Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley tried to force a Senate vote Wednesday on legislation that would ban TikTok from operating in the United States, but he was blocked by a fellow Republican as lawmakers in both chambers are still trying to figure out what action, if any, is appropriate against the social media app.In trying to force a vote — a move that rarely works in the Senate, since one senator’s objection can block it — Hawley called TikTok “digital fentanyl” and argued it could give the Chinese government access to data from 150 million American users. His bill would block and prohibit U.S. transactions with TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., within 30 days.The bill “sends the message to Communist China that you cannot buy us,” Hawley said.Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky objected to Hawley’s motion, arguing that trying to ban an app would violate the Constitution and anger the millions of voters who use it. “Speech is protected whether you like it or not,” Paul said.Hawley’s effort to bring attention to the issue comes a week after a combative House hearing in which lawmakers from both parties grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew over his company's ties to China’s communist government, data security and harmful content on the app. Chew attempted to assure lawmakers that the hugely popular video-sharing app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections. But the tense standoff gave new momentum to Hawley and other lawmakers who say it should be banned or limited.The Missouri senator said Congress “should act decisively to ban TikTok directly.” Other lawmakers have considered broader approaches, though there is no widespread consensus on any piece of legislation.There is broad Senate support for bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that does not specifically call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms. The White House has backed that bill, but it is unclear if it will be brought up in the Senate or if it could gather much support among House Republicans.Another bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida would, like Hawley’s bill, ban U.S. economic transactions with TikTok, but would also create a new framework for the executive branch to block any foreign apps deemed hostile. His bill is cosponsored by Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., and Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.Those pushing new legislation point to agreement on a bill passed in December that banned TikTok from most government devices. But despite the bipartisan desires, the varying proposals underscore how difficult it could be to find agreement on an unprecedented effort to ban or scale back an app that is used by millions of Americans.Paul said trying to ban an app like TikTok is a slippery slope. He’s had videos censored by YouTube, he said, but he still believes the company has a right to exist.“I despise these people, but I’m not going to vote to ban them,” he said. “We don’t ban things that are unpopular in the United States.”",2023/03/30,134,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850785,West Virginia governor signs ban on gender-affirming care,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday signed a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors, joining at least 10 other states that have enacted laws restricting or outlawing medically supported treatments for transgender youth.The bill outlaws those under 18 from being prescribed hormone therapy and fully reversible puberty blockers. It also bans minors from receiving gender-affirming surgery, something physicians say doesn’t even happen in West Virginia.Unlike measures passed in other states, however, West Virginia’s law contains a unique exemption: It permits doctors to prescribe medical therapy if a teenager is considered at risk for self-harm or suicide.Under the law, which will take effect in January 2024, a patient can be prescribed puberty blockers and hormone therapy after receiving parental consent and a diagnosis of severe gender dysphoria from two clinicians, including a mental health provider or an adolescent medicine specialist.Both practitioners must be trained to diagnose and treat young people with severe gender dysphoria and provide written testimony that medical interventions are necessary to prevent or limit possible or actual self-harm.The provisions were added at the urging of Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo, who is a physician.“These kids struggle. They have incredible difficulties,” the Republican said on the Senate floor earlier this month. Takubo cited more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies showing a decrease in rates of suicide ideation and attempts among youth with severe gender dysphoria who had access to medication therapy.Gender dysphoria is defined by medical professionals as severe psychological distress experienced by those whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.The bill also prohibits minors from being prescribed hormone therapy before the age of puberty, something West Virginia physicians say doesn’t happen anyway.The medication dosage for any adolescent must be the lowest possible necessary to “treat the psychiatric condition and not for purposes of gender alteration,” according to the bill.The West Virginia law comes as Republican lawmakers across the U.S. have pursued several hundred proposals this year to push back on LGBTQ+ rights, particularly rights for transgender residents, including banning transgender girls from girls sports, keeping transgender people from using restrooms in line with their gender identities and allowing or requiring schools to deadname trans students.Lawmakers in West Virginia and other states moving to enact bans on transgender health care for youth and young adults often characterize gender-affirming treatments as medically unproven, potentially dangerous in the long term and a symptom of “woke” culture.Every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association, supports gender-affirming care for youths.A 2017 study by UCLA Law’s The Williams Institute estimated West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country.The rate of suicide ideation, or having suicidal thoughts or ideas, for transgender youth in West Virginia is three times higher than the rate for all youth in the state, according to West Virginia Youth Risk Behavior Survey data.Natalie Frazier, who oversees gender-affirming care for Planned Parenthood in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, said the bill Justice signed Wednesday was “better than it could have been.”“But it’s still unnecessary — just an unnecessary barrier to care that is going to end up harming people,” she said, adding that not every child’s family will have the resources to travel to two different clinicians for a gender dysphoria diagnosis.Frazier, who is also a certified nurse midwife, said the diagnosis of severe gender dysphoria with risk of suicide “could probably apply to just about any kid getting access to gender-affirming care.”“That’s why people are are so invested in providing the care because there is a disproportionate risk,” she said. “That’s something that any of these kids could be at risk for and nobody’s going into this care lightly.""West Virginia’s ban also includes exemptions for people who are born intersex and for people taking treatments for infection, injury, disease or disorder that has been “caused by or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition procedures.”Surgeries can be performed if a child is at risk for “imminent danger of death or impairment of a major bodily function.”At least 11 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850786,Bulls C Drummond ruled out after posting about mental health,"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Bulls center Andre Drummond missed the team's 121-110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night after he posted on Twitter that he was deleting his social media apps to focus on his mental health.Drummond was ruled out because of personal reasons, according to the Bulls. Coach Billy Donovan said he is hopeful about the possibility of Drummond traveling with the team ahead of Friday night's game at Charlotte.“As we come here and play games there's also a human side, a personal side to all these guys,” Donovan said, “and you feel bad when anybody's going through something like that. I think you try to give as much support as you can.”The 29-year-old Drummond is in his first year with Chicago and his 11th season in the NBA overall. The two-time All-Star posted on Tuesday that he was deleting his apps and changing his number.“Time to focus on my mental health,” Drummond wrote. “If you too are struggling with your mental health, you are not alone ... it’s okay to ask for help.”Drummond is averaging 6.1 points and 6.7 rebounds in 62 games for the Bulls in a reserve role. He had 11 points and eight rebounds during Monday night's 124-112 loss at the Los Angeles Clippers.“Sometimes when people look at these guys and they see them play and they see these NBA players, stars, all this other stuff, and all the stuff that comes with it that gosh, their lives must be just absolutely perfect,” Donovan said, “and they're not. We're all flawed. We all have challenges. We all have issues and things we all have to deal with.”Bulls star DeMar DeRozan, who has been open about his own battle with depression and mental health issues, said he plans to give Drummond his space while also letting him know that he is there for him.“We love this game. We play this game. This game's been good to us all,” DeRozan said before the loss to Los Angeles. “But at the end of the day you got to worry about and care for yourself first and foremost.”DeRozan's honesty about his issues has led to frequent encounters with people who have expressed their gratitude about his openness with his mental health. Donovan said he was approached by a man in Toronto this season who wanted to thank DeRozan, and the player then spent some time with the man.“Moments like that to me is bigger than playing a basketball game, a paycheck, I mean, you name it, man,” DeRozan said. “There's just something about it that speaks volumes when someone's story can help someone else and when I actually see it, it touched me in a different type of light. It's nothing but appreciation and it just shows a different type of empathy that I wish we all had.”___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850787,Most gig workers paid sick leave under new Seattle law,"SEATTLE (AP) — Most gig workers in Seattle will be permanently entitled to paid sick leave and safe time under a first-in-the-nation law signed by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell on Wednesday. The measure expands pandemic-era protections and strengthens labor rights for app-based workers.Seattle previously allowed food delivery workers to accrue paid sick and safe time, but that policy was due to expire May 1, six months after the end of the emergency order imposed by the city during the coronavirus pandemic.The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to make it permanent for “on-demand” gig workers on apps such as DoorDash, Postmates and Instacart.“A healthy workforce leads to a healthy community, and no one should have to choose between taking a sick day to care for themselves — or their families — and making rent,"" Harrell said.The measure also expands the categories of workers covered by the policy beyond food delivery, to include those who work for car wash or other apps. Workers who set their own rates, such as those on some pet-sitting apps, will not be covered, however.Drivers for transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft already earn paid sick and safe time through a state law signed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee last year.Seattle in 2012 became one of the first cities to require businesses to provide paid sick leave for gig workers when they have medical appointments or need to help care for a sick relative, and safe leave if they need to care for themselves or a family member because of domestic violence, stalking or sexual assault.The city expanded the law to cover app-based food delivery workers in 2020, citing the danger many were exposing themselves to so they could earn money for rent or other expenses. Some companies failed to comply; Postmates agreed to pay nearly $1 million after denying workers in Seattle sick time.Making the policy permanent is the latest in a string of victories for labor advocates in the city. The council last spring approved a bill guaranteeing app drivers minimum pay and mileage.In an emailed statement, Instacart suggested the measure was ""misguided.""“Instacart is willing to work with any policymaker that prioritizes the health and safety of shoppers who choose to earn income through our platform,” it said. ""However, at a time of high inflation and tightening household budgets, it is critical that policymakers also take into account the rising financial burden their misguided policy proposals could have on their constituents.”Nationally, President Joe Biden's administration has proposed new standards that could make it more difficult to classify millions of workers as independent contractors and deny them minimum wage and benefits.“I’ve heard from workers on these apps for years that ... being forced to work through injuries and sickness was always a huge challenge,” Joel Shapiro, co-founder of the Seattle-based grocery-delivery app Dumpling, told the council. “All workers should have the ability to take sick time when needed, no matter what kind of work they do.”City Council Member Teresa Mosqueda, who sponsored the measure, thanked the workers for their efforts.“Our city needs to be taking care of you the way that you've taken care of our families,” Mosqueda said before the bill signing. “If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we need to protect workers on the front line, protect their health, because your health is good for the population's health.”Under the law, workers will accrue one day of paid sick or safe time for every 30 days they make a work-related stop in Seattle. They would be paid their average daily compensation for each calendar day they worked in Seattle over the previous 12 months.Maria Hernandez, who has worked for apps delivering food since 2019, testified before the council Tuesday that when she had surgery for breast cancer in 2021, doctors told her to take three months off to prepare for radiation. But she had little money in the bank and returned to work after just one month; her company insisted the paid sick leave was only for COVID-related illness, she said.“This new permanent law will help create more than a free day for anyone who is sick,"" she said. ""It will give us tranquility and some peace in our hearts.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850788,Officials warn of wildfire risk as Southwest US dries out,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Snowcapped mountains in the Southwestern U.S. signal a possible delayed start to the wildfire season for some higher elevations, but officials in New Mexico and Arizona warned Wednesday that dry, windy conditions in other areas are increasing wildfire risks and prompting red flag warnings.With leaves crunching under her feet and the wind starting to kick up, New Mexico's governor warned that if the state wants to avoid a historic wildfire season like last year's when more than 1 million acres (400,000 hectares) burned, she said everyone will have to be prepared.“You can start to think about the landscape in New Mexico and the extreme drought here,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told those gathered at the Rio Grande Nature Center State Park. “We are at extreme risk.”New Mexico is coming off a devastating wildfire season that included the largest blaze in the state's recorded history — a conflagration sparked last spring by the U.S. government as forest managers were trying to clear out dead and overgrown vegetation in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.A pair of prescribed burn operations went awry and fierce spring winds fueled the flames, displacing thousands of people and resulting in Congress approving nearly $4 billion in recovery funds. New Mexico lawmakers also recently passed legislation creating a low-interest loan program to help communities repair or replace public infrastructure damaged by wildfires or subsequent flooding.The governor noted that Alaska was the only state to have more acres burn in 2022 than New Mexico.New Mexico already has seen more than 100 fires this year, and officials in neighboring Arizona have reported responding to dozens of starts over the last month, all human-caused.“We hope that’s not an indication of what’s to come, but with the heavy grass crop down there, we are staying vigilant and on alert,” Tiffany Davila with the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said of the southern part of the state.New Mexico State Forester Laura McCarthy didn't want to predict the kind of season the Southwest might see.“If we’re learning anything from last year, it’s that the past is not really a good indicator of what’s coming in the future,” she said. “And I think that if we get two, three or four weeks of really hot, dry weather with winds, we’re right back in it.""Aside from preparing firefighters and homeowners, McCarthy said state and federal land managers have a growing challenge to cut and remove overgrown brush and trees “on a scale we’ve never done before” that will include more prescribed burns and thinning projects.The U.S. Forest Service, following a review last year, is implementing new policies and procedures for its prescribed fire operations. The planning process now includes a new template that calls for plans to be validated and updated to ensure that the information is current and the most recent science and modeling is incorporated.For areas with a healthy snowpack, any fire activity in the high country may be delayed until late May into mid-June, which means the window for wildland fires could be shortened, Davila said.Still, Davila joined New Mexico officials in urging caution, especially in those areas still mired in drought.“Even with all of the snow and rain the state received, it is a temporary fix to a long-term drought issue,” she said.",2023/03/30,,World

Chicago hosts the Milwaukee Brewers on opening day on Thursday.The Cubs did lock in one key player, finalizing a $35 million, three-year contract infielder Nico Hoerner on Wednesday. That contract begins in 2024. Hoerner is moving to second base after playing shortstop last season with the arrival of All-Star Dansby Swanson on a $177 million, seven-year contract.“Super happy for him and that he's really happy about how everything went down, about the fact that he's going to be here with security,” Happ said. “That's the most fulfilling part, as a teammate and a friend and having been so close with him for so long. Being able to watch just how excited he is to be here for the next three years is really cool.”Happ, chosen by Chicago with the No. 9 overall pick in the 2015 amateur draft, made his first All-Star team and won his first Gold Glove last season. He set career highs in batting average (.271) and RBIs (72) while hitting 17 home runs.The Cubs had struggled to re-sign their players in recent years prior to reaching an agreement with Hoerner. They traded Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Báez at the 2021 deadline, and three-time All-Star catcher Willson Contreras signed with the NL Central rival St. Louis Cardinals in December to replace Yadier Molina.“You play with other guys that end up other places and it’s OK,” Happ said. “It’s not the end of your career when you’re not playing where you came up. There definitely will be moments here and there. It’s appreciating that, appreciating getting to play with this group.

Cirstea previously defeated No. 4 Caroline Garcia this month at Indian Wells and topped Garcia again in the second round at Miami.“I think I’m a bit speechless,” Cirstea said. “I came out knowing that it’s going to be a really tough match. Aryna hits so hard, so I knew I had to hold my ground, and I’m very, very happy with my performance today.”The 74th-ranked Romanian, who has two career singles titles, will face either Petra Kvitova and Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semifinals. The Kvitova-Alexandrova match had been scheduled for Wednesday night but was postponed to Thursday because of rain; also postponed was the men's match between top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz and No. 10 Taylor Fritz.Alexandrova advanced on Tuesday when Bianca Andreescu suffered a left ankle injury and left the court in a wheelchair. On Wednesday, the 22-year-old Andreescu tweeted that she tore two ligaments in her ankle and will be out indefinitely.“It's tough to say exactly how long it will take, but let's just say it could've been much worse!! I'm going to take it day by day, and I am optimistic that with the right work, rehab, and preparation, I'll be back on court soon,” the 2019 U.S. Open champion said in her social media post.Sabalenka had six double faults, three of them on break points, and made 21 unforced errors to just nine for Cirstea.“I guess people like to keep count of the age, the years, the results, but I never do that. I just mind my own business, work hard, do my thing, believe in my game, work with my coach Thomas Johansson — we just started in December and so far, I think it’s going great,” Cirstea said.In the men's draw, 11th-ranked Jannik Sinner beat Emil Ruusuvuori 6-3, 6-1.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850815,Golden Knights overcome goalie injuries to lead West,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Golden Knights' latest loss was an exception to the recent play by Vegas and its multiple goalies.Until then, the Knights kept finding ways to win, receiving more than adequate play from whoever filled in as the goaltender of the night.Coach Bruce Cassidy said Wednesday he hoped the 7-4 loss to the Oilers the previous night and all-around sloppy play was a “one-off,” and was encouraged by his players' ability to adverse situations all season.The Knights are the only team to have five goalies record multiple victories this season. Vegas also made NHL history when it became the first team ever to win four consecutive games with four different goalies last week.“I think at the end of the day they’re not concerned about who the starter is that night,” Cassidy said of his players. “They’re ready to go. I think that’s why we’ve kept on winning no matter who's been in nets. Now credit the guys in nets for giving us a chance to win.”Even with the loss to the Oilers, the Knights entered Wednesday leading the Western Conference with 98 points and could clinch a playoff spot Thursday at San Jose. The race, however, is tight in the Pacific Division with Los Angeles at 96 points and Edmonton at 95.Cassidy brought over his defensive system from Boston to take pressure off the goalies. He spent six years there, and last season goalie Linus Ullmark began to emerge into a player who now leads the league with 1.90 goals-against average.Under Cassidy's system, opponents often are forced to shoot from angles, creating easier save opportunities for the goalies.“It might make it feel like the other team is kind of pounding you, but we’re not being asked to make any back-door plays or (face) a lot of odd-man rushes because we’re so patient and our guys are kind of clogging up the middle of the ice,” goalie Laurent Brossoit said.Brossoit and recent acquisition Jonathan Quick are the Knights' healthy goalies at the moment.Brossoit underwent offseason hip surgery and then, after clearing waivers, spent most of the season in the AHL. He was promoted in February and soon after missed another 13 games because of injury. But Brossoit is 2-0-2 and leads the team with a 2.42 GAA and a .924 save percentage.Quick came over from Columbus after being traded by Los Angeles, where he won two Stanley Cups and became a fan favorite. But he had a 3.50 GAA and .876 saves percentage before the Kings parted ways. His numbers with the Knights are similar, though Quick is 5-2 and has flashed moments of his old form.Cassidy has only eight games left to figure out his goaltender situation before the playoffs, and All-Star rookie Logan Thompson could be added to the mix if he returns from a lower-body injury. He was the Knights' No. 1 goalie before going down Feb. 9.“We've talked about it internally,” Cassidy said. “I think you're going to see both goaltenders (Brossoit and Quick) is the easiest way I can put it. It's not about revealing some secret, it's that we don't get that far ahead of ourselves, especially the wild card in (Thompson) and what he's going to do.”The Knights also have used Adin Hill and Jiri Patera in net. Hill is out with a lower-body injury and Patera is the goalie for the AHL affiliate in Henderson. Both excelled when given the opportunity, and as the club's sixth-round pick in 2017, Patera could be the goalie of the future.Robin Lehner was supposed to be the goalie of the present, but Vegas announced in August he would have hip surgery, forcing the team right away to adjust in net.The Knights have been doing it ever since then.“We're not going to change how we play regardless of who's in the net,"" defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. ""We've had a lot of success with what we're doing.”THEODORE DAY TO DAYDefenseman Shea Theodore, who had 41 points in 54 games, will miss at least Thursday's game at San Jose because of an undisclosed injury. Ben Hutton will replace him, and the Knights called up defenseman Brayden Pachal from Henderson. ___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

The key values defining authenticity for global shoppers were: being straightforward on delivering promises (58%); transparency within supply chains (43%); standing up for sustainability (39%); clear brand values (39%); and transparency with supplier relationships (34%).   Authenticity – the new currency for conversion, spend and loyalty   Seventy three percent (73%) of global shoppers also said authenticity made them more loyal to brands, with a further 65% saying they would switch to a competitor if they felt a retailer wasn't authentic. Shoppers in Hong Kong (73%), France and Spain (both 72%) proved the most likely to switch brand allegiances, while shoppers in Hong Kong (80%) and the United States (75%) were the consumers whose spend propensity was the most impacted by a brand's authenticity.   In the context of economic global headwinds and the rising cost-of-living putting extra pressure on household budgets and discretionary spend, authenticity is also helping retailers fend off rising price-sensitivity among shoppers. While a third of global shoppers plan to cut back on the volume of things they buy in 2023, almost half (48%) said a brand's authenticity would make them less sensitive to inflationary price increases. However, this dipped to 43% of shoppers in the UK,  where inflation remains close to a 40-year high.   Renaud Marlière, Global Chief of Business Development of Asendia, commented:  ""Of course, we see that shoppers are acting with caution due to the rising cost-of-living, but invariably they are also consuming consciously and mindfully. Shoppers now want to engage and buy from brands who act authentically. Increasingly, shoppers are holding the retailers and brands they shop with to account - and it is clear that authenticity is now having a significant impact on share of wallet, revenue and loyalty.""    ""Brands and retailers need to take control of their own destiny when it comes to shaping the authentic shopping journeys consumers are now demanding. Shoppers increasingly expect accountability and transparency from retailers, whether through greater transparency around supply chain emissions, delivery promises or offering low- or carbon-neutral shipping options,"" Renaud Marlière continued.   In 2022 Asendia announced it had  reached 100% carbon neutrality through its carbon offsetting projects. It now offers carbon neutrality across all shipments carried out for international retail customers via its e-PAQ solution, a specialist range of international packet and parcel services designed for online retailers.   Channel matters – the impact of DTC on authenticity perception   Overwhelmingly, global shoppers feel brands that operated Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) were more authentic than those retailers who just operated via marketplaces. Over half (56%) of global shoppers felt that retailers that operated their own DTC channels were more authentic, rising to 68% of consumers in Hong Kong and 60% in both Spain and the U.S.   Combining global presence with local expertise, Asendia empowers online retailers to grow their cross-border operations by improving international shopping experiences.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850832,Okta announces new identity verification feature for Zoom video conferencing and collaboration,"Okta Authentication for End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) available to all paid Zoom customers 
SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 30 March 2023 -   Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: OKTA), the leading independent identity provider, today announced a new identity verification feature within Zoom that leverages Okta to authenticate a meeting attendee's identity by email in Zoom meetings using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This identity authentication and attestation, powered by Okta, can help independently determine if a meeting guest is who they say they are.   Okta Authentication for E2EE is available for all Zoom's paid customers. Zoom account admins can enable Okta Authentication for E2EE in the  Security tab of the  Zoom Web Portal. Once the Zoom account admin has enabled this feature, a meeting attendee can enable sharing of their identity by turning on the feature in their individual settings.   Depending on a user's organization's settings, they may get verified automatically or be redirected to the Okta web page to finish authentication with their login credentials for two-factor authentication.   Once a meeting attendee is authenticated, a blue shield with a lock will appear next to their username in the meeting participant list. Anyone participating in the meeting can hover over the icon to see a card that displays authenticated information about that person, including their company domain and corresponding Okta-verified email address.   ""Flexible work underscores the need for a robust set of identity and access management tactics. Building this strategic feature with Okta directly into Zoom's E2EE meetings allows our users and customers to take an 'always verify, never trust' approach, while reducing the need to toggle between disparate solutions,"" said Ricky Kapur, Head of Asia Pacific, Zoom. ""Zoom is striving to add an extra layer of security to virtual communication while maintaining our seamless and consistent experience.""   Apply Zero Trust to Zoom encrypted meetings   Participant impersonation in meetings is another form of social engineering that's become increasingly sophisticated. This makes protecting personal information more important and challenging than ever. Collaboration apps must adopt Identity verification best practices like single-sign-on and two-factor authentication.   In addition to these core competencies, the Zero Trust security framework is exploding in adoption. Okta's latest State of Zero Trust security report revealed that 97% of companies surveyed either had a Zero Trust initiative in place or would have one in place in the coming 12-18 months. Embraced by the enterprise and government agencies, zero trust's core principle is  ""never trust, always verify."" With a Zero Trust approach, strong Identity and access controls are a requirement, especially with a workforce that operates in diverse, dynamic environments.   By leveraging Okta to apply a Zero Trust approach to Zoom, IT and security teams can help their organizations reduce security risks—without sacrificing user experience.   ""Okta has always been at the forefront of innovation. We were one of the first to treat Identity and Access Management as an independent platform, recognizing its integral role in digital customer experiences. We continue the innovation journey as Zoom's first and exclusive partner to verify the email identities of users in end-to-end encrypted meetings,"" said Ben Goodman, Senior Vice President and General Manager for Asia Pacific & Japan, Okta.   ""Once again, Okta has demonstrated its position as an open and vendor-neutral platform that allows customers, partners and ISVs to develop and integrate Okta's Identity solutions within their apps and technologies, ultimately letting anyone anywhere to safely use any technology.""Hashtag: #Okta https://www.linkedin.com/company/okta-inc-/

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850833,NetApp’s 2023 Cloud Complexity Report Highlights the Shifting Demands of a Multicloud Environment,"Key findings indicate that 98% of technology leaders have been impacted by the increasing complexity of the cloud, bringing issues of cybersecurity and cost optimization to the forefront 
SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 30 March 2023 - NetApp® (NASDAQ: NTAP), a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company, today released the  2023 Cloud Complexity Report, a global survey exploring how technology decision makers are navigating cloud requirements coming from digital transformation and AI initiatives and the complexity of multicloud environments. The report found that 98% of senior IT leaders have been impacted by increasing cloud complexity in some capacity, potentially leading to poor IT performance, loss in revenue and barriers to business growth.   ""Our global research report highlights paradigm shifts in how technology leaders look at and manage their cloud initiatives,"" said Ronen Schwartz, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cloud Storage, NetApp. ""As cloud adoption accelerates and businesses innovate faster to compete, technology leaders are facing growing pressure to juggle multiple priorities at once – causing many to rethink how they manage efficiency and security in this new environment.""   ""Our global survey data demonstrates the extreme complexity of modern IT environments, and the pressure technology executives are under to show measurable outcomes from cloud investments,"" said Gabie Boko, Chief Marketing Officer, NetApp. ""At NetApp, we've simplified the complex through our approach, which enables technology executives to increase the speed of innovation, lower costs and improve consistency, flexibility and agility across on-premises and cloud environments.""   Key findings from the report include:   Cloud Complexity Reaches a Tipping Point    Data complexity has reached a boiling point for companies globally, and tech executives are feeling the pressure to contain its impact on the business. However, technical and organizational challenges may stunt their cloud strategies, with 88% citing working across cloud environments as a barrier, while 32% struggle just to align on a clear vision at the leadership level.   Global Context: The following regions list this as their top concern if data complexity is not managed:          Cybersecurity: France, Spain, and Australia/New Zealand             Leadership skepticism: France, Spain, Japan             Inefficient use across the organization: Australia/New Zealand           Lack of visibility: Japan      In  Asia Pacific (APAC), the top business impacts due to increasing complexity of data across their cloud environments are increased skepticism over cloud from leadership (47%), staff not taking full advantage of business applications (47%), increased cybersecurity risk (45%), and lack of visibility into business operations (41%).   Leadership Want Cloud Results Now   Sustainability has become an unexpected cloud-driver, with nearly eight in ten tech executives citing ESG outcomes as critical to their cloud strategy. However, return on investment (ROI) is a concern among leadership, with 84% of tech executives saying their cloud strategy is already expected to show results across the organization.   Global Context:         Nearly half of tech executives (49%) report that when cloud strategy discussions happen, cost concerns come up often or all the time.           Data regulation and compliance is another cloud driver, with various local regulations promoting their multicloud strategy most or some of the time.        In  APAC, 86% of tech executives are already expected to show results across the organization. The pressure to already show ROI on cloud investment is highest in India and Singapore, where 9 out of 10 tech executives feel it.?   Furthermore, 80% of executives in APAC say cloud systems are developed with sustainability goals specifically in mind. Within the region, Singapore (72%) and Japan (69%) lead in featuring cloud prominently in their sustainability strategy.   Three out of four tech (75%) APAC executives say their multicloud strategy is driven by data sovereignty requirements.   Tech Executives Consider AI as a Possible Solution    In the next year, over a third (37%) of tech executives report that half or more of their cloud deployments will be supported by AI-driven applications. Nearly half of tech executives at smaller companies – those with fewer than 250 employees – expect to reach the 50% mark in the next year, and 63% by 2030, while larger companies lag.   Global Context:         The U.S. leads EMEA and APAC on plans to deploy AI-driven cloud applications in the next year, with France and Japan as outliers in their regions.           In APAC, 56% of tech executives report that half or more of their cloud deployments will be supported by AI-driven applications by 2030. This presents a long-term growth opportunity for AI-driven applications in the region.               Scaling AI is the top priority in EMEA and APAC, but is second in the U.S., behind meeting regulatory compliance.        ""NetApp's global research report reveals a disconnect between the executives outside of IT and those within - specifically, leaders working to execute on cloud are the ones most ingrained in the cost and complexity issues while those outside of IT have yet to fully understand. In the process of shifting to the cloud, leaders are experiencing challenges, leaving room for vendors to address these current or yet-to-be discovered issues,"" said Randy Kerns, Senior Strategist & Analyst at the Evaluator Group. ""As customers express concerns with cloud implementation, vendors have the opportunity to build and offer solutions to simplify the process.""   ""APAC leaders today recognize cloud's importance in producing critical business outcomes such as data sovereignty and sustainability. By addressing the cloud complexity confronting their organizations, they can unlock the best of the cloud and innovate faster to compete,"" said Matthew Swinbourne, CTO, Cloud Architecture, NetApp Asia Pacific. ""With NetApp's unique combination of expertise, capabilities and hyperscaler partnerships, we help customers use the clouds they want, the way they want, while optimizing for cost, risk, efficiency, and sustainability.""   As organizations increasingly move to multi-cloud environments, NetApp aims to alleviate efficiency bottlenecks by allowing IT leaders to manage their systems on one, streamlined user interface. By taking an evolved cloud approach, NetApp is leading the charge for next generation cloud management and storage – equipping teams with the tools necessary to stay abreast of the key trends outlined in the research report above (e.g., optimizing costs, assessing risks, and operating sustainably).

Methodology   NetApp partnered with Wakefield Research to conduct a quantitative research study during November 2022, among 1,300 tech and data executives at businesses in 9 markets: US, EMEA (France, Germany, Spain, the UK), and APAC (India, Japan, Singapore, and Australia/New Zealand). At the time of completion, all participants held positions that were classified as ""director-level and above"" and worked across IT, IT infrastructure, cloud infrastructure and data engineering departments.

Cloud Complexity Reaches a Tipping Point   In  APAC, the top business impacts due to increasing complexity of data across their cloud environments are increased skepticism over cloud from leadership (47%), staff not taking full advantage of business applications (47%), increased cybersecurity risk (45%), and lack of visibility into business operations (41%).            2. Technical and Organizational Barriers Add to the Cloud Complexity Dilemma      In  APAC, tech executives in Australia/NZ cited data mobility (42%) and security and addressing risk (42%) as top challenges. Security and addressing risks also (42%) emerged as the top barrier in Singapore. In Japan, executives cited not having a vision for cloud strategy (37%) as the top barrier.            3. Tension Increases Between Tech Executives and Leadership Around Cloud ROI      In  APAC, 86% of tech executives are already expected to show a ROI on what the company has spent on cloud, either in increased revenue or in saved costs or are under pressure to show short-term progress. The pressure to already show ROI on cloud investment is highest in India and Singapore, where 9 out of 10 tech executives feel it.            4. There are Key Drivers that Continue to Make Cloud Essential      In  APAC, three out of four tech (75%) executives say their multicloud strategy is driven by data sovereignty requirements.            80% of executives in APAC say cloud systems are developed with sustainability goals specifically in mind. Singapore (72%) and Japan (69%) are leading in featuring cloud prominently in their sustainability strategy.     5.

The All-Star forward was eventually helped up and stayed in the game to shoot his free throws, but was clearly in pain and the Knicks then quickly committed a foul to substitute him out of the game.The Knicks announced at halftime Randle would not return.He was having a quiet game with just three points and five rebounds, but leads the Knicks with 25.4 points and 10 rebounds per game.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850838,Mariners' Rodríguez ready for 2nd season of 'J-Rod Show',"SEATTLE (AP) — Julio Rodríguez sent a buzz through T-Mobile Park, whether it was the second-deck home runs or running down fly balls in center field.And this was just the workout day for the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday. The reigning AL rookie of the year seems more than ready for the start of the regular season on Thursday night against Cleveland.It's a far cry from a year ago when everything was new for Rodríguez.“I mean definitely it’s different. I feel like now I know a little bit more, kind of know how things are going to go,” Rodríguez said. “Now I know how things are going to go, but kind of have an idea of how to take care of myself, like how to do certain things, and I’m able to make a better plan.”Rodríguez is already the star attraction for a franchise bursting with excitement entering the 2023 season. The Mariners ended their 21-year playoff drought last season when Rodríguez became one of the new, young faces of baseball.It was evident Wednesday as fans filled the “J-Rod Squad” section of seats in center field and crammed along the baselines seeking Rodríguez’s autograph during Seattle’s workout. Those fans brought magazines with Rodríguez’s face on the cover, wore his No. 44 jersey and chanted “Julio,” incessantly.“Oh my gosh,” Seattle manager Scott Servais cracked when the constant chant of “Julio,” from some kids drowned out his media session in the dugout.But it is J-Rod’s world, at least in Seattle. Last season, Rodríguez became the fifth rookie of the year in franchise history, but only Ichiro Suzuki’s award in 2001 generated the same amount of excitement as Rodríguez.Rodríguez overcame a brutal first month of the season to hit .284 with 28 home runs, 75 RBIs and 25 stolen bases. He was the instigator Seattle’s offense needed to balance its superior pitching and carried the Mariners into the postseason as a wild-card team.It also landed Rodríguez a massive contract that will pay him hundreds of millions and could keep him in Seattle his entire career.But Rodríguez has made putting last year behind him an emphasis during the offseason.“Flipping to the next page I feel is always really important, because if you get caught up into the success you had in the past, you’re always going to be living in the past. You’re never going to be living where your feet are right now,” Rodríguez said.The goal now for Seattle is closing the gap to the Astros in the AL West, something the Mariners believe they can do thanks to some additions that should make the lineup deeper and take some of the load off Rodriguez.“I just feel like we’ve got the pieces to give a good ballgame against anybody in the league,” Rodríguez said. “And I feel like that’s going to stay throughout the year, throughout the whole season. That’s what we’re going to root for. If it’s the Astros we play, if it’s whoever it is we’re going to give them a good ballgame.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850839,Police: Wizards' Bradley Beal faces possible battery charge,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Washington Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal is facing a possible misdemeanor charge in central Florida after a fan accused the NBA All-Star of hitting him during an argument after a game against the Orlando Magic.Probable cause exists to charge Beal with simple battery for the March 21 confrontation, an Orlando police case report said.Beal had not been arrested or charged as of Wednesday.The report said the case would be filed with the local State Attorney’s Office, but prosecutors said they didn’t have a record of the case late Tuesday.The Wizards acknowledged they knew about the situation with Beal in Orlando but declined to comment.According to the police report, Beal was walking down a tunnel at Amway Center to the Wizards’ locker room following the team’s 122-112 loss to the Magic. A fan swore at Beal and accused him of causing the fan to lose $1,300 from a bet.Beal walked back toward the fan and his friends, and began to exchange words, investigators said. At some point, Beal swatted a hat off the head of the heckler’s friend, police said, allegedly hitting the friend’s head.The friend contacted police the next day to report the alleged assault and provided police with video of the confrontation.A spokesman for the Magic said the team has never had a similar incident but is discussing potentially adding security in that general seating area.Beal, 29, was the third overall pick in the 2012 draft by the Wizards. He was selected in the 2013 All-Rookie First Team and is a three-time All-Star.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850840,Biden won't veto Republican-led bill ending COVID emergency,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden won’t veto a Republican-led measure to end the national COVID emergency, despite having expressed strong objections against it earlier this year, ensuring the bill is on an easy path to becoming law.It marks the second time in the new Congress that the Biden administration has signaled opposition to a Republican measure, rallying most Democrats in Congress to vote against it, only to soften its stance and let the legislation eventually become law.Just weeks ago, Biden stunned many fellow Democrats when he declined to veto a Republican-led bill to upend a new criminal code for the District of Columbia he and others in the president's party opposed, allowing the GOP's tough-on-crime push into the local government to become law.Republicans celebrated the turn of events Wednesday as a sign of their newfound influence in divided Washington, while Democrats quietly complained that the Biden administration had shifted its views.But the White House stood firm, and the Senate gave final approval, 68-23, sending the bill to Biden's desk.A White House official said that when the House Republicans were first preparing to vote on the bill at the start of the year, it would have lifted the national emergency declaration for the coronavirus pandemic in February.But now, it's much closer to the White House's own plan to wind down COVID national emergency status on May 11.The president still strongly opposes the legislation, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the situation. But if this bill comes to Biden's desk, he will sign it, the official said.Ahead of voting, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., one of the bill’s main sponsors, said he hoped “that the rumors are true — that the president will finally sign this legislation.”The legislation is a simple one-line measure saying that national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, “is hereby terminated.”It comes from one of the more conservative Republicans in the House, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, and draws on Republican-led opposition to mask mandates, lockdowns and others precautions that were put in place to stem the spread of the virus during the pandemic. It was among the early bills the new House GOP put forward at the start of the year.At the time, the administration warned the proposal would cause chaos. More than 197 Democrats in the House voted against it.“An abrupt end to the emergency declarations would create wide-ranging chaos and uncertainty throughout the health care system — for states, for hospitals and doctors’ offices, and, most importantly, for tens of millions of Americans,” the administration said in a formal statement of administrative policy.In the days leading up to the House vote, the Biden administration announced its own plan to wind down emergency status on May 11, three years after the virus outbreak.The administration's announcement meant the federal coronavirus response would be treated more as an endemic threat to public health that could be managed through agencies’ normal authorities, rather than pandemic status.Just a few weeks ago Biden signed another Republican-led bill into law that would nullify the District of Columbia's revamp of its criminal code. The administration had previously said it opposed that bill.On Wednesday, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee voted to overturn a police reform package passed by the D.C. Council.___Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850841,Rejection of Black educator angers some Mississippi senators,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday against confirming veteran educator Robert P. Taylor as state superintendent of education, angering some Black Democrats who said the rejection was at least partly because Taylor is Black and wrote years ago about the state's racist history.The state Board of Education — which has members chosen by the Republican governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker — conducted a nationwide search for a superintendent last year. Board members announced in November that their unanimous choice was Taylor, who had worked the past 30 years in North Carolina.“This whole confirmation was a political process, and I knew that coming in,” Taylor told The Associated Press on Wednesday evening after the Senate vote. He said senators in the past have confirmed all previous nominees for state superintendent, and he is disappointed this group of senators did not confirm him.“The fact that they didn't, that is what I have to live with,” Taylor said. “I will always respect the process.”It's not unusual for nominees to serve while waiting for senators to consider confirmation, and Taylor had been working as superintendent in Mississippi since January. With the Senate's rejection, the board will search for another superintendent.About 38% of Mississippi residents are Black. Taylor would have been Mississippi's second Black state superintendent of education, after Henry Johnson served from 2002 to 2005.Taylor grew up in Laurel, Mississippi, and earned his bachelor's degree in 1990 at the University of Southern Mississippi. As an undergraduate, he wrote for a newsletter called “The Unheard Word,” which he said gave Black students a voice that the campus newspaper often ignored.A 2020 article on the university's Center for Black Studies website focused on the short-lived newsletter.“‘The Unheard Word,’ in my opinion, recognized that The University of Southern Mississippi was in the most racist state in the Union, and that while historical focus has always been on the University of Mississippi, Southern Miss had a past that was tainted as well,” Taylor told the Center for Black Studies.Taylor told AP in a phone interview that it's important for people to read his words in context. He said the newsletter wrote, for example, about the history of Clyde Kennard, who sought to become the first Black student the university in the 1950s and was rejected because of his race. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a state spy agency at the time, led efforts to block Kennard's enrollment.The Senate vote on Taylor's nomination Wednesday was mostly along party lines, 31 Republicans voting against. Of the 21 who voted for confirmation, five were Republicans and the others were Democrats.“Because we reject him because of his race, we're rejecting God because God made him that way,” said Democratic Sen. David Jordan, who is Black.Republican Sen. Chris Johnson of Hattiesburg, who is white, voted in favor of confirming Taylor. He said Taylor answered senators' questions in a straightforward manner during a confirmation hearing, including about what he had written about Mississippi's racist history.“He answered that by saying, ‘At that time, that’s how I felt,"" Johnson told reporters Wednesday after the nomination failed.The previous Mississippi superintendent of education, Carey Wright, retired on June 30 after 8 1/2 years in the job. An interim superintendent started July 1 and served until Taylor arrived.Senate Education Committee Chairman Dennis DeBar, a white Republican from Leaksville, said race had nothing to do with his vote against the nomination of Taylor. DeBar said he thinks Taylor is a good man and should be respected.“I think what really hurt Dr. Taylor the most ... is we have several low-performing schools in our state,” DeBar said. “We would like to see someone with a better resume on improving low-performing schools.”Democratic Sen. Derrick Simmons of Greenville, who is Black, said Taylor should have been confirmed.“Dr. Taylor did everything that we tell people in the state of Mississippi to do — get a good education, try to use that good education, go out and get your experience and then come back to the state of Mississippi and give Mississippi all of your educational talents and all of your educational experience and give back to the community that gave to you,” Simmons said.Hours after the Senate rejected Taylor's nomination, Democratic Sen. Barbara Blackmon of Canton, who is Black, tried to amend other legislation to say Mississippi would only consider nominees who have never left the state — a way of expressing her anger about the rejection. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said the amendment was not relevant, and senators did not vote on it.___This story was first published on March 29, 2023. It was updated on March 30, 2023 to correct the number of years the previous superintendent served. Carey Wright spent 8 1/2 years on the job, not 13 years.",2023/03/30,,World

They are 2 1/2 games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets and opened a four-game gap over the seventh-place Heat.They did it with reserves Quickley, Hart and Isaiah Hartenstein going all 12 minutes, along with Grimes and RJ Barrett.“The way they were playing was incredible and they just found a way to keep fighting, and everything they were doing on both sides of the ball, they were clicking,” point guard Jalen Brunson said. “So you’ve just got to go with that.”Brunson returned after a two-game absence with a sprained right hand. Now the Knicks will wait to see about Randle, who will be evaluated Thursday. The All-Star forward has started all 77 games.“I thought our bench was terrific,” Thibodeau said. “So next guy get in there, next man up, get it done and that’s the way we have to approach it.”The top six teams are guaranteed postseason spots. The Heat's third straight loss dropped them 1 1/2 games behind the Nets.“Losing is what got us here,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “None of us feel good about it. This is where we are. You are what your record is. You are what has happened recently. But things can change quickly. ... The only solutions we have right now are in that locker room. We have the competitive character.”Brunson scored 12 points, and RJ Barrett also finished with 12 after shaking off an 0-for-8 start. New York visits Cleveland on Friday in what could be the preview of the 4-5 matchup in the East.Gabe Vincent scored 21 points and Tyler Herro had 16 for the Heat, who faded down the stretch after losing in Toronto on Tuesday. The No. 1 seed in last year's East playoffs are searching for answers why they might not even get in this time.“We didn’t win games. At the end of the day, that’s what it is,” Jimmy Butler said. “I don’t know why we didn’t win. Probably because the opposing team scored more points than we did. That’s literally what happened.”The Knicks led 86-85 midway through the final quarter before Hart had a pair of baskets and Grimes added four points in a 9-0 burst that pushed it to 95-85 on Quickley's free throw with 4:17 remaining. The Heat never made another run.Randle sprained his left ankle late in the second quarter when Bam Adebayo landed on him after Randle had grabbed an offensive rebound and faked the Heat's center in the air. Randle remained in to shoot the free throws, but was clearly in pain and the Knicks quickly fouled to check him out of the game.The Heat led 23-19 after a first quarter in which New York went 0 for 6 on free throws. Brunson made a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give New York a 48-46 halftime edge.TIP-INSHeat: Kyle Lowry sat out the second half of the back-to-back after playing Tuesday against his former team. ...

Durant finally made his home debut for Phoenix on Wednesday night.Nic Claxton added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Brooklyn, and Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 points and 11 assists. The Nets had 33 assists on 44 baskets and won for the second time in three games to snap a four-game home losing streak. The victory, coupled with the Miami Heat’s loss to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, boosted the Nets' lead to 1 1./2 games over Miami for the No. 6 spot in the East.“We (have) six games left, They’re all super-important for us,” Johnson said. “There’s no excuse for how we played the first 40 minutes of the game, but we were able to clean it up and come out of it with a win.”Kevin Porter Jr. had 31 points, nine rebounds and six assists for Houston, and Alperen Sengun had 21 points and 12 rebounds. The Rockets have lost seven in a row.“After being on the road for nine days, for them to come out and show the grit and fight they did, that shows the character of this group,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “It shows they’re still competing, they’re still fighting, they’re still trying to do what’s right.”Houston outrebounded Brooklyn 52-41 and was on the verge of dealing the Nets a blow to their playoff chances with a 110-105 lead with 3:05 left.”(Porter) was making plays for himself, making plays for his teammates,” Silas said. “Him and (Sengun) had a real connection going. I thought (Sengun) was great on the offensive glass.”But Brooklyn roared back with an 11-0 run and closed the game by outscoring the Rockets 18-4. Brooklyn made nine fourth-quarter 3-pointers, with Johnson and forward Royce O’Neale each knocking down three and Bridges hitting two from deep.“We feed off each other, we feed off the crowd,” O’Neale said. “We trust each other to keep knocking them down.”“We made shots, and it gave us a little bit of steam, a little bit of momentum,” Johnson said.TIP INSRockets: Forward Jae’Sean Tate (knee) missed his sixth straight game.Nets: Guards Edmond Sumner (right hip contusion) and Seth Curry (personal) and O’Neale returned to the lineup after missing the previous game in Orlando.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850887,Philippine ferry fire kills 31 people; at least 7 missing,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A fire broke out on a ferry in the southern Philippines and raged overnight for eight hours, killing at least 31 of the approximately 250 passengers and crew, officials said Thursday.Many of the more than 200 people who survived the blaze jumped off the MV Lady Mary Joy 3 and were rescued from the dark sea by the coast guard, navy, a nearby ferry and local fishermen, said Gov. Jim Hataman of the southern island province of Basilan. Rescuers were still searching Thursday for at least seven missing people, he said.Hataman said the burned ferry was towed to Basilan’s shoreline, where the bodies of 18 of the 31 victims were discovered in a budget section of the passenger cabin.“These victims perished on board due to the fire,” Hataman said by telephone. He said more people may have been on the ferry who were not listed on its manifest.The ferry's skipper, however, told coast guard officials that he tried to run the burning ferry aground on the nearest shore to allow more people to survive or be rescued, regional coast guard commander Rejard Marfe said. The fire raged for about eight hours, he said.The ferry was traveling to Jolo town in Sulu province from the southern port city of Zamboanga when it caught fire off Basilan close to midnight, Hataman said. At least 23 passengers were injured and taken to hospitals.“Some of the passengers were roused from their sleep due to the commotion caused by the fire. Some jumped off the ship,” Hataman said.The steel-hulled ferry could accommodate up to 430 people and was not overcrowded, Marfe said. According to the manifest, it was carrying 205 passengers and a 35-member crew, he said. In addition, it had a security contingent consisting of four coast guard marshals and an unspecified number of soldiers who were not listed on the manifest for their protection, Marfe said.He said officials are investigating whether the 33-year-old ferry was seaworthy, if there were passengers not listed on the manifest, and whether the crew properly guided passengers to safety.Sea accidents are common in the Philippines because of frequent storms, badly maintained vessels, overcrowding, and spotty enforcement of safety regulations, especially in remote provinces.In December 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world’s worst peacetime maritime disaster.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850888,"Embiid, Harden power 76ers past Mavericks, 116-108","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joel Embid returned from a hotly debated one-game absence because of injury and got the 76ers to 50 wins in the fewest amount of games since 2001. Maybe like Allen Iverson and the ‘01 Sixers, perhaps Embiid's next step is an MVP and a trip to the NBA Finals.And if that MVP doesn't come?“I don't care,” Embiid said. “It's all about the playoffs.”Embiid had 25 points and nine rebounds, James Harden added 15 points and 12 assists and Philadelphia beat the Dallas Mavericks 116-108 on Wednesday night.Embiid flashed his MVP credentials as he plays with a calf injury and powered the Sixers back in the fourth against Luka Doncic and got them to 50 wins in 76 games. Embiid hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 103 and followed with a 16-footer the next time down for what ended up the winning basket and keep the 76ers as the No. 3 seed in the East.Doncic had 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Kyrie Irving scored 23 points for the Mavericks, who did not score the final 3:18 of the game.The Mavericks fell to 37-40 and are in danger of missing the playoffs in the West.“We just can't be a championship game overnight,” Irving said. “I've wrapped my head around it. I'm at peace with it.”Tyrese Maxey added 22 points to help the 76ers snap a three-game losing streak. They returned from a 1-3 trip with both Embiid and Harden healthy. Harden (Achilles) missed the last four games.“They looked good. not great,” coach Doc Rivers said of his returning stars.Embiid sat out against against Denver and fellow MVP candidate Nikola Jokic because of a balky right calf. Embiid played in both games of a back-to-back set against Golden State and Phoenix. After a day off, Embiid couldn’t go in the anticipated showdown of MVP frontrunners, leaving the team and the All-Star center open for criticism.“If one game is going to hurt anybody's chances, then I guess everybody should be out of it,” Embiid said. “We all have bad games, guys miss matchups, that's not the first time.”Rivers said the issue wasn’t as simple as just resting Embiid a game in the back-to-back. The plan was always to play Embiid on the entire trip but the NBA’s reigning scoring champion simply couldn’t go against the Nuggets.That scuttled the highly anticipated showdown between MVP candidates that many felt could have decided whether Embiid, the runner-up the last two years, denied Jokic a third consecutive award.Some voters opined Embiid’s day off could cost him MVP first-place votes. Rivers said that wasn’t a fair decision.“You’re not (MVP) for just one game, that I know of,” Rivers said. “It’s for the entire season of work your team’s record and how you perform. He’s been dominant all year. He’s missed other games, should we ... you know, what I’m saying. Will that hurt him? I doubt it but it could. I don’t know what people use as a criteria. It seems like it changes weekly what the real criteria is.”The MVP is voted on regular-season play. The real criteria for a successful season these days for Embiid is a title.“There's a bigger goal in sight, that's to make sure we're healthy for the playoffs,” he said.HOME COOKINGThe 76ers are not only coming off a four-game trip, they wrapped a stretch where they played 12 of 15 games this month on the road.“Let's get through this game and I then I think we can take a deep breath,” Rivers said. “I think the first game is hard. Then you can get your legs back.”The Sixers are off Thursday and play another home game on Friday before the season starts to wind down. Embiid and Harden are banged up but can get some time off once the play-in tournament starts.“I'm not worried about rest as much anymore,” Rivers said. “That the one great thing about the play-in. You do get a little bit of time to practice and rest. We are probably way more focused on conditioning than we are rest.”TIP-INSMavericks: Led by 12 points in the first half.76ers: The start of the second half was briefly delayed because one of the nets needed to be replaced.UP NEXTMavericks: At Miami on Saturday night.76ers: Host Toronto on Friday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

They're now five points up on Pittsburgh and six ahead of Florida with five games left to play in the regular season.“We’re trying to make the playoffs,"" said Bo Horvat, who along with Kyle Palmieri scored in the shootout. ""We want to play the right way and do all the right things and play well at both ends of the rink, and we’ve been doing that as of late. That’s what you’re going to need in the playoffs come that time. Our goal is to get there and continue to keep playing the way we’re playing.”Sorokin again was crucial for New York, stopping two of three shooters in the shootout after some key saves before that. The All-Star goaltender improved to 8-1-1 in his last 10 games, a stretch in which he has stopped 263 of 286 shots.“I feel good,” Sorokin said, deflecting any talk about the prospect of making the playoffs. ""I don’t think about this. Just one game. No overthinking, just one day and control what you can control. That’s it.”Engvall scored New York's only goal in regulation, his second in two games and sixth since being acquired in a trade from Toronto. It was his fourth goal on four career shots against Darcy Kuemper.The Islanders have gone 11-4-2 since top center and second-leading scorer Mathew Barzal went down with a lower-body injury.There's nothing new to report on Barzal's status, according to Lane Lambert, who was back in his old home arena for the first time as an NHL head coach. Lambert was an assistant on Barry Trotz's staff when the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018 and succeeded him as coach of the Islanders but ascribed no special meaning to this return.“We had some good memories, Barry and I, here and the first time back here four years ago was maybe it was like a little bit of this or that,” Lambert said earlier in the day. “But we’ve been back here so many times that this is no different.”The Islanders return April 10, by which time they could be in position to clinch a playoff berth — their fourth in five years. New York reached the East final in 2020 and 2021 before a combination of a lengthy opening road trip and a series of injuries and virus absences derailed last season.Similar trials and tribulations have affected Washington this season, likely ending the organization's postseason streak at eight. Playing without Nicklas Backstrom, Tom Wilson and John Carlson for long stretches, the Capitals were sellers at the trade deadline after a rough stretch and have lost five of six to fall out of the race.“Every time you’re losing, you’re not happy with the game and you can’t really be happy,” Backstrom said. “But we’re just gonna keep working, and that’s all we can do.”Conor Sheary scored Washington's only goal, and Kuemper made 25 saves in falling to 21-22-6 in his first season with his new team after backstopping Colorado to the Cup last year.UP NEXTIslanders: Visit the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday night.Capitals: At Tampa Bay on Thursday night.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

The annual speculation has intensified, though, especially since the 74-year-old coach allowed his expected induction this summer into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame after years of refusing to even be nominated.The Spurs have two home games remaining, but those will be played 73 miles away in Austin’s new Moody Center.“It’s something that is real, but I try not to think about it too much,” Spurs point guard Tre Jones said. “I feel like he has time left, for sure, coaching. I don’t see him stopping anytime soon, but honestly, nobody really knows. Obviously, I hope he will be back coaching us next year.”Popovich has overseen a young roster that has struggled with injuries, consistency, and defense — and that continued against Utah.San Antonio (19-57) lost its fifth straight in its worst season since 1997, the year it drafted Tim Duncan with the No. 1 overall pick.Rookie Malaki Branham led San Antonio with 21 points. Jones, Sandro Mamukelashvili and Devonte’ Graham each added 17.The Jazz were without Lauri Markkanen, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson and Rudy Gay, while the Spurs were without starters Keldon Johnson, Jeremy Sochan and Devin Vassell.“It’s pretty much been like that all year, so we’re kind of used to it,” Popovich said. “As long as they’re giving effort, they’re all learning. They’re making mistakes, but overall, that’s what we’re trying to do. No matter who’s out, no matter who’s not playing, other guys are happy to get minutes.""So, trying to get to learn how to play is what this is all about.”Horton-Tucker responded by shooting 15 for 25 from the field, including 6 for 11 on 3-pointers.“Just trying to get out in transition and get easy buckets,” Horton-Tucker said. “Usually when we have Lauri or JC (Clarkson) playing, (I’m) hitting them early in transition, getting them baskets. But, also for me, getting downhill early in the clock is something I feel is hard to guard for certain teams.”Kris Dunn added 17 points and Udoka Azubuike had 12 points, both off the bench for the Jazz.Utah remains in 12th place in the Western Conference, a half-game behind Dallas for 11th and 1 1/2 games behind Oklahoma City for the final berth in the play-in tournament.TIP-INSJazz: Former Spurs first-round pick Luka Samanic had nine points and nine rebounds in his first NBA game since May 12, 2021. Utah recently signed Samanic to a 10-day contract.Spurs: Veterans Doug McDermott and Gorgui Dieng were both active but did not play as Popovich opted to give his younger players extended minutes.MIC DROPWhile Johnson and Sochan did not play, the team’s starting forwards addressed the crowd before the game during the Spurs’ Fan Appreciation Night.After thanking Spurs fans for their support, Sochan said: “And any Utah fans here, you’re about to lose tonight. Go Spurs, go!”The Spurs joked about Sochan's bold words after the game.“I don’t think we should ever do that again,” Jones said, laughing. “When he mentioned the other team, I was like ‘Oh, God.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850893,Chiefs to be tested by Blues in 'Battle of the Bombays',"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Hamilton-based Chiefs will face the toughest test to their unbeaten start to the Super Rugby Pacific season since it began with an upset over the Crusaders when they take on the Auckland-based Blues on Saturday in a sixth-round match.After their shock first-round win over the defending champions, the Chiefs have padded their 5-0 record with wins over lowly-ranked teams. They now face the fourth-placed Blues, who have a 3-2 record and a large contingent of All Blacks but are playing below the level that such squad strength should guarantee.The Chiefs enter Saturday’s home match on the back of an uninspiring win over the New South Wales Waratahs, while the Blue had an equally unimpressive win over the Perth-based Western Force in a match in which most of their All Blacks were rested.The Chiefs have a break next week and will follow that with testing matches against the Wellington-based Hurricanes and Fijian Drua before they face the Christchurch-based Crusaders for a second time. The Blues will face the Melbourne Rebels, Drua and Moana Pasifika before they again play the Crusaders, to whom they lost 34-28 in Round 4.The next few rounds likely will have a major role in shaping the top four.The Blues’ season would benefit a great deal from a win over the Chiefs, at least from a sustained performance. Again this season, they have a tendency to fade late in matches.While the Blues beat the Force comfortably and did so without most of their international stars, it was performance they likely would want to move on from.“We’ll turn this round quickly,” head coach Leon MacDonald said. “We’re going to have about 13 new players turning up Monday pretty fresh after a break and pretty excited about the week ahead.”MacDonald said the Blues players are looking forward to taking on the Chiefs on the home ground.“We love that challenge,” he said. “It’s definitely one of the games the guys get up for. Hamilton is a place we like to go and win at. It’s one of the better feelings in rugby.“We know we can play a game that can beat them if we’re on. We’re backing ourselves to go there and get the job done.”Coach Cameron McMillan acknowledged the Chiefs’ win over the Waratahs was far from perfect but said often it is better to win ugly than “lose pretty.”“Our ball-carrying height was pretty poor,” McMillan said. “We carried high. We allowed them to get two people in the tackle. It was slow. We weren’t getting to ground on our terms.“Everyone has games like that. You scrap to the end and you wish you had played a lot better. But that’s the beauty of our game – there are always things to work on.”The Blues and Chiefs are neighbors, separated by the Bombay Hills which divide Auckland from Waikato province. That adds intensity to their matches.“The Blues are a team that we always love playing,” McMillan said. “It’s the Battle of the Bombays. We only get them once this year in round-robin play, so that adds to the motivation.”The Canberra-based Brumbies lost their unbeaten record last weekend after fielding an understrength lineup against the Crusaders. They resume against the Waratahs in what usually is one of the high points of the season in Australia. Although not so much this year because the Waratahs are not playing well.Brumbies chairman Matt Nobbs is so confident, he has promised to buy a beer for every visiting fan if the Sydney-based Waratahs win in the national capital.“If they’re good enough to beat us, I’ll meet everyone in the bar ... and shout them all a beer,” Nobbs said.____More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850895,AP source: Minor leaguers reach 5-year labor deal with MLB,"NEW YORK (AP) — Minor league players reached a historic initial collective bargaining agreement with Major League Baseball on Wednesday that will more than double player salaries, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details were not announced.As part of the five-year deal, MLB agreed during the contract not to reduce minor league affiliates from the current 120.The sides reached the agreement two days before the start of the minor league season and hours after a federal judge gave final approval to a $185 million settlementreached with MLB last May of a lawsuit filed in 2014 alleging violations of federal minimum wage laws.Union staff recommended approval, and about 5,500 minor leaguers were eligible to cast ballots in a vote expected Thursday. MLB teams must also vote to approve and were likely to do so over the next week.Minimum salaries will rise from $4,800 to $19,800 at rookie ball, $11,000 to $26,200 at Low Class A, $11,000 to $27,300 at High Class A, $13,800 to $27,300 at Double A and $17,500 to $35,800 at Triple-A. Players will be paid in the offseason for the first time.Most players will be guaranteed housing, and players at Double-A and Triple-A will be given a single room. Players at Low A and High A will have the option of exchanging club housing for a stipend. The domestic violence and drug policies will be covered by the union agreement. Players who sign for the first time at 19 or older can become minor league free agents after six seasons instead of seven.Minor leaguers players will receive four weeks of retroactive spring training pay for this year. They will get $625 weekly for spring training and offseason training camp and $250 weekly for offseason workouts at home.Beginning in 2024, teams can have a maximum of 165 players under contract during the season and 175 during the offseason, down from the current 190 and 180.The union will take over group licensing rights for players.Major leaguers have been covered by a labor contract since 1968 and the average salary has soared from $17,000 in 1967 to an average of $4.22 million last season.MLB raised minor league minimum salaries in 2021 and last year began requiring housing for some minor leaguers.The Major League Baseball Players Association took over as the bargaining representative of the roughly 5,500 players with minor league contracts last September after a lightning 17-day organization drive.MLB agreed to accept the union rather than force players to ask the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election.Negotiating for players was led by Tony Clark, Bruce Meyer, Harry Marino, Ian Penny and Matt Nussbaum.

Covington was 9 of 10 from the field, making all seven of his 3-point attempts.Bones Hyland added 20 points for Los Angles, including 12 in the fourth quarter as the Clippers pulled away in the final seven minutes.“Just being composed,” Westbrook said about the difference down the stretch. “As a point guard, I was taught the last five or six minutes of the game were very important. Getting stops, getting good shots. We did a good job of executing down the stretch.”Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with 36 points and nine assists. Dillon Brooks added 30 points as all five Memphis starters finished in double figures. The Grizzlies had won seven in a row and 12 straight at home.While the Clippers were already without Paul George as he recovers from a right knee sprain, Kawhi Leonard was a late scratch for personal reasons.The Grizzlies sat a number of key players on the second night of a back-to-back. Morant was back after sitting out against Orlando on Tuesday night, but Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane, Tyus Jones and reserve John Konchar were declared out with various ailments.The game built in intensity and the teams got into a scrum near midcourt in the third quarter with Brooks and Covington barking at each other. Throughout the game, coaches were yelling at officials, players were mouthing to each other and the physical play put everybody on edge.For the Clippers, the 3-point line was a benefit. Los Angeles made 22 of 37 3-pointers fueled by Covington and Westbook making all of their attempts.“I think this is the first time in my career that I went perfect from the 3-point line,” said Covington in his 10th season.The shooting percentage from outside the arc — just under 60% — was well above Los Angeles' average at 38%.“Obviously, they made a lot of shots,” said Memphis forward Santi Aldama, who finished with 17 points on 6 of 7 from the field, adding: “I think the looks we gave them were very easy for the most part. They just got so many free looks.”The win left the Clippers in fifth place in the Western Conference, one game ahead of idle Golden State. But the way the middle of the conference is jumbled, each game is important.“It's going to be tight,” Covington said of the playoff spots. “The West from four through 12 or 13 is like a three-game gap, something like that?

Alex Lyon stopped 38 shots as Florida pulled one point behind Pittsburgh for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference.“It’s a tough, tough league,” said Montour, who added an assist that gave him the franchise record for points by a defenseman in a season with 63. “We have all the belief in the world.”Zach Aston-Reese and Auston Matthews scored for the playoff-bound Maple Leafs, and Ilya Samsonov had 26 saves.“Played a good game,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “Didn’t score enough to win and then made some mistakes at the end. Cost us the extra point.”The Panthers trailed 2-1 until Reinhart tied it with 1 minute left in regulation on a power play as he got a pass from Aaron Ekblad and fired a one-timer from above the left circle through traffic and past Samsonov. It was his 28th.Lyon and Montour then stole the show in OT.“I don’t get too worked up anymore,” said the 30-year-old Lyon, who got the start ahead of the under-the-weather Sergei Bobrovsky on the front end of a back-to-back. “Not to sound like I’ve been through it all, but just spent a lot of time in the (minors) and played a lot of games. You just try to find ways to block out the other things ... all that matters is stopping the puck.”In overtime, Aleksander Barkov brought the puck up the left side on a 2-on-2 rush and sent a cross-ice pass to Montour who quickly fired it past Samsonov for his 14th.Lyon robbed Matthews earlier in OT to keep his team in the fight.“Gave us every chance,” Barkov said of Lyon. “He’s the type of guy who brings the joy into the locker room.”Matthews had given Toronto the lead at 6:40 of the third as he got a pass from Mitch Marner above the left circle and fired a shot that beat Lyon five-hole. It was Matthews' 37th goal of the season and gave Marner 67 assists.Matthews has six goals and five assists as part of a seven-game point streak. Marner, meanwhile, has points in 11 straight games.Lundell got the Panthers on the scoreboard first, getting a pass from Eetu Luostarinen in the slot and firing a shot past Samsonov just 1 minute into the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850899,Jalen Williams' late tip-in gives Thunder win over Pistons,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Rookie Jalen Williams' putback with less than a second remaining gave the Oklahoma City Thunder a 107-106 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.The pressure was on for the Thunder, who entered the night two games under .500 and hanging on to the final Western Conference play-in spot. The Thunder lost to the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night and couldn't afford another loss to a team near the bottom of the league's standings.And Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander — the league’s No. 4 scorer with 31.3 points per game — was out with a sprained left ankle for the second straight game.It wasn't pretty, but the Thunder found a way.“We were grittier tonight than we were last night,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “And I thought the response of our players coming off of a disappointing performance last night was right where it needed to be, and this team’s made a habit of that all year. We’re not perfect, but these guys do a great job of refocusing and getting the car back on the road, and I thought they did that tonight.”Williams answered the call with 27 points, eight rebounds six assists — and the tip-in on Josh Giddey's miss in the closing second. Williams celebrated his first NBA game-winner with some of the fans.“It was dope,"" Williams said. “Throughout all that, some fan grabbed me, and that’s when I was like, ‘Oh, OK, like I’m really close to the crowd.’ But that’s a moment that’s dope to share.”Lu Dort scored 20 points, Aaron Wiggins had 19 and Giddey added 18 for the Thunder.Dort said the players embraced the high stakes.“I mean, we definitely all take a look at that, honestly,"" Dort said. “We’ve worked so hard this season to be in this position today.”Jaden Ivey followed his season-high 32-point performance against Milwaukee on Monday with 24 against the Thunder. The Pistons have the league’s worst record and have lost seven straight and 18 of 19.Detroit coach Dwane Casey said it came down to more than just the final basket.“We always remember that play, but there’s so many other little things that led into that that we have to make sure we grow from and learn from and really correct to win close games like that,” he said.Williams scored two quick buckets in close to put the Thunder ahead 97-90 with six minutes remaining, but the Pistons rallied and tied it on a 3-pointer by Ivey with 3:35 to play.The Thunder led 103-100 with just under two minutes remaining when Oklahoma City's Jaylin Williams took a charge from Ivey with 1:48 remaining for Ivey's sixth foul. Williams then hit a short jumper to bump Oklahoma City's lead to five.Detroit rallied and Cory Joseph hit a 3-pointer with 13.5 seconds left to put the Pistons ahead 106-105, setting up the final sequence.It appeared the Thunder had taken the lead on a putback by Dort, but a jump ball was called. Dort won it and Giddey tracked it down. He got a decent turnaround shot off before Jalen Williams put it back in.Daigneault said the sequence by Dort was typical of his style of play.“I think his physicality, his toughness, his resilience — that stuff is contagious and it helps our team stick its chest out,” he said. “And you really can’t quantify that. But he brings that to us and the end of the game, you know, it’s just a small example that.”TIP-INSPistons: F Eugene Omoruyi, waived by the Thunder earlier this season, finished with 14 points and five rebounds in 28 minutes. ...

There is nothing preventing him from meeting Tsai at a neutral event, he said.
Pavel explained that it is one thing for Czech parliamentarians to visit Taiwan, but a presidential visit would definitely trigger a full-blown reaction from China, such as full-scale economic retaliation. Because of the difference in Beijing's perception of parliamentary-level and high-level visits, it is unreasonable to expose Czech companies to such risks, he said.

Tsai is expected to meet McCarthy in California, although this is not officially confirmed.Meanwhile, one of Tsai's most prominent domestic opponents, former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, embarked on a trip to China on Wednesday, the first such visit by a former Taiwanese leader.Beijing has warned against any meeting between Tsai and McCarthy and vowed to take ""resolute measures to fight back"" if it goes ahead.Xu Xueyuan, the charge d'affaires at the Chinese embassy in Washington, said she had spoken directly to US officials numerous times and warned them that Tsai's trip would violate China's core interests.""We urge the US aside not to repeat playing with fire on the Taiwan question,"" she told reporters, alluding among other things to last year's visit to Taiwan by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Recent visits by a Czech delegation and a German minister were met with rebukes from Beijing.Pelosi's visit triggered an angry response from Beijing, with the Chinese military conducting drills at an unprecedented scale around the island.This time round, the United States said China should not use Tsai's stopover as an excuse to act aggressively near the Taiwan Strait.China claims the island as part of its territory, and vows to reunite it with the mainland, even by force if necessary. And Beijing opposes official ties betweeen Taipei and foreign governments.Tsai's trip follows Honduras's decision this month to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing, leaving Belize and Guatemala among the just 13 countries that have official ties with Taipei.China has increased investment in Latin America, a key diplomatic battleground between Taipei and Beijing.Taiwan accused China on Sunday of using ""coercion and intimidation"" to lure away its allies after Honduran Foreign Minister Enrique Reina and his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang officially launched relations in Beijing.Meanwhile, the Honduran Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that President Xiomara Castro will travel to China ""soon,"" without providing a date for the trip.The move continued a trend in Latin America, with Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica all switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing in recent years.In addition to Guatemala and Belize, Taiwan still has official ties with a handful of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Paraguay and Haiti.dh/sri (AFP, Reuters, EFE)",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850942,Ecuador court says congress can pursue impeaching president,"QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — Ecuador’s Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday the opposition-dominated National Assembly can take up the question of whether to impeach President Guillermo Lasso over allegations of crimes against state security and corruption.The ruling was only a first step. The congress still must follow a formal process that requires the presentation of evidence and arguments before legislators may vote on impeachment.The court, which is the interpreter and guarantor of Ecuador’s constitution, gave the go-ahead for impeachment proceedings on a 6-3 vote by the justices.The issue was put before the court by the unicameral legislature, a body of 137 legislators in which a majority is held by opposition parties led by the Union for Hope party, which has ties to former President Rafael Correa, who governed in 2007-2017.Lasso, a conservative former banker, began his four-year term in May 2021.Allegations have been raised that the president’s brother-in-law, Danilo Carrera, has links with public officials involved in corruption and drug trafficking. In urging the court to reject the matter, Lasso said there was no evidence to justify the accusations.The National Assembly now has up to 45 days to complete the impeachment process against Lasso. Removing the president will require the votes of at least 92 of the 137 legislators.There is constitutional provision that would allow Lasso to dissolve the legislature and then govern by decree for six months while running for re-election. But analysts think that unlikely due to his low popularity among Ecuadorians.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850943,House GOP approves broad bill to 'unleash' American energy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Thursday approved a sprawling energy package that seeks to undo virtually all of President Joe Biden's agenda to address climate change.The legislation would sharply increase domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal, and ease permitting restrictions that delay pipelines, refineries and other projects. It would boost production of critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt that are used in electric vehicles, computers, cellphones and other products.By a 225-204 vote, the House sent the measure to the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it “dead on arrival.” Four Democrats joined with all but one Republican to support the bill.Biden has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would replace “pro-consumer policies” adopted in the landmark climate law approved last year “with a thinly veiled license to pollute.'' The bill would roll back Democratic investments in clean energy and ”pad oil and gas company profits,'' the White House said.Republicans call the bill the “Lower Energy Costs Act” and gave it the symbolic label H.R. 1 — the top legislative priority of the new GOP majority, which took control of the House in January.The measure combines dozens of separate proposals and represents more than two years of work by Republicans who have chafed at Biden's environmental agenda. They say Biden's efforts have thwarted U.S. energy production and increased costs at the gas pump and grocery store.“Families are struggling because of President Biden's war on American energy,'' said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., one of the bill's main authors.The GOP bill will “unleash"" abundant U.S. natural resources ""so we can produce energy in America,'' Scalise said. “We don't have to be addicted to foreign countries that don't like us.''Democrats called the bill a giveaway to big oil companies.""Republicans refuse to hold polluters accountable for the damage they cause to our air, our water, our communities and our climate,'' said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.“While Democrats delivered historic wins for the American people by passing historic climate legislation, Republicans are actively working to undermine that progress and do the bidding of their polluter friends,″ Pallone said.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the bill “restores American energy leadership by repealing unnecessary taxes and overregulation on American energy producers,'' and ""makes it easier to build things in America'' by placing a two-year time limit on environmental reviews that now take an average of seven years.“Every time we need a pipeline, a road or a dam, it gets held up five to seven years and adds millions of dollars in costs for the project to comply with Washington’s permitting process,'' McCarthy said in speech on the House floor. “It’s too long, it’s unaffordable, it’s not based on science and it’s holding us back.''He pointed to a project to modify and improve Lake Isabella Dam in his central California district that has lasted 18 years and still is not completed.“Permitting reform isn’t for everyone,'' McCarthy added. “If you like paying more at the pump, you don’t want to make it faster for American workers to build more pipelines. If you’re China, you’d rather America sit back and let others lead. And if you’re a bureaucrat, maybe you really do enjoy reading the 600-page environmental impact studies.''Most Americans want lower prices and more U.S. energy production, McCarthy said — results he said the bill will deliver.Democrats called that misleading and said the GOP plan was a thinly disguised effort to reward oil companies and other energy producers that have contributed millions of dollars to GOP campaigns.Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, derided the bill as the “Polluters Over People Act'' and “a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting industries.''Instead of reining in “Big Oil” companies that have reported record profits while “hoarding thousands of unused leases'' on public lands and waters, the GOP bill lowers royalty rates paid by energy producers and reinstates noncompetitive leasing of public lands, Grijalva said.The bill also gives mining companies “a veritable free-for-all on our public lands” and “makes mockery of tribal consultation'' required under federal law, he said.Under the GOP plan, mining companies will “destroy sacred and special places"" throughout the West, ""ruin the landscape and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and hurts our health — all without paying a cent to the American people,'' Grijalva said.Schumer called the measure “a giveaway to Big Oil pretending to be an energy package.”The House energy package “would gut important environmental safeguards on fossil fuel projects,'' locking America ""into expensive, erratic and dirty energy sources while setting us back more than a decade on our transition to clean energy,'' Schumer said.Schumer said he supports streamlining the nation's cumbersome permitting process for energy projects, especially those that will deliver “clean energy” such as wind, solar and geothermal power. “But the Republican plan falls woefully short on this front as well,'' he said, calling on Republicans to back reforms that would help ease the transition to renewable energy and accelerate construction of transmission lines to bolster the nation's aging power grid.The Republican bill would repeal a new $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and other parts of the climate and health care law passed by Democrats last year. The fund, also known as a “green bank,” is set to provide low-cost financing for projects intended to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.The House bill also would eliminate a new tax on methane pollution that would charge companies for methane leaks from oil and gas wells.Four Democrats voted in favor of the bill: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzales of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., opposed the bill.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850944,"Taiwan's leader, in US, stresses security for her island","NEW YORK (AP) — In a highly sensitive U.S. visit, Taiwan’s president delivered the message Thursday that keeping her self-ruled island strong will help ensure the world’s safety — even as her travel is carefully calibrated to try to contain what furious Chinese officials warn could be a strong response.Taiwan is billing President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to New York as simply a “transit,"" but she kept a full agenda of events Wednesday and Thursday before flying to Central America.Most provocatively in the eyes of Beijing, her trip is expected to include a meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week. In a sign of the sensitivity of her visit, little about Tsai’s full itinerary has been made public, and her events Thursday were closed to the news media.The visit — while important for Taiwan in demonstrating its overseas support — is fraught for both Taiwan and the U.S. because China views Taiwan as its territory and treats any dealings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials as a challenge to its sovereignty.Even with the precautions, Tsai’s trip, including any meetings with U.S. lawmakers, raises tensions at a time when both China and the U.S. and its allies are boosting their military preparedness for a possible confrontation in the Indo-Pacific. China’s often-stated determination to take Taiwan, by force if necessary, stands as one of the region’s main flashpoints.Chinese officials are focusing, angrily, on the expected meeting next week between Tsai and McCarthy. It would be one of the highest-level in-person meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials on U.S. soil.Tsai emphasized Taiwan's perseverance in the face of daunting challenges in a closed-door speech Thursday night hosted by the Hudson Institute think tank, which awarded her its leadership award.She said the Taiwanese public remains unswerving in its commitment to democracy, and that Taiwan is the responsible, calm side in contrast to China, which is raising tensions in cross-strait relations, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency.""She made a strong point that the defense of Taiwan is actually the defense of America,” said Miles Yu, a Hudson Institute director who attended the speech.A few dozen pro-China demonstrators — holding signs declaring “One China” and “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China” — gathered behind police barricades outside the hotel where Tsai spoke.The United States’ longstanding “one-China” policy acknowledges that the Chinese claim Taiwan as their territory. However, the U.S. does not endorse that claim and remains Taiwan's most important provider of military hardware and other defense assistance.On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning restated China’s serious objections to any interactions between Tsai and U.S. leaders.“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,” Mao told reporters in Beijing. “China will continue to closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”A senior Chinese diplomat in Washington, embassy charge d'affaires Xu Xueyuan, pointed to the anticipated meeting between Tsai and the U.S. House speaker as one that would have significant repercussions overall and a “serious, serious, serious” impact on U.S.-China relations.Neither Taiwan nor McCarthy, a California Republican, has publicly confirmed any in-person get-together. Analysts have framed a session between the two outside Washington as possibly less provocative than a trip by McCarthy to Taiwan, which he has said he also intends to makeBeijing responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last August by launching missiles, deploying warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of the island. China also temporarily suspended dialogue with the U.S. on climate and other major issues and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.The United States broke off official ties with Taiwan in 1979, when it formally established diplomatic relations with China. U.S. law requires Washington to treat all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern” but does not explicitly say whether the U.S. would commit troops.Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he hoped any U.S. officials meeting unofficially with the Taiwanese president emphasize that American support for Taiwan is ""strong and unequivocal.”Tsai has made six previous trips through the U.S. during her presidency, meeting with members of Congress and members of the Taiwanese diaspora. Administration officials are underscoring that her trip is in line with what she and her predecessors have done in the past.Tsai's ""transit is consistent with our longstanding unofficial relationship with Taiwan and is consistent with the United States' one-China policy, which remains unchanged,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.“The People’s Republic of China should not use this transit as a pretext to step up any aggressive activity around the Taiwan Strait,"" Kirby said. “The United States and China have differences when it comes to Taiwan. But we have managed those differences for more than 40 years.”Tsai told reporters before boarding her plane to the United States that “external pressure will not obstruct our resolution to engage with the world.""Tsai was expected to meet with the American Institute in Taiwan chair, Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.Tsai's stops in Central America are expected to shore up Taiwan's partnerships there, after Honduras this month switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China. Tsai accused China of using “dollar diplomacy” to lure away Honduras. Worldwide, just 13 countries now officially recognize Taiwan.Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said the visit is a chance for Tsai “to convey to the Congress how important the partnership between the U.S. and Taiwan is and what’s necessary to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”Tensions between Washington and Beijing have grown as China under President Xi Jinping seeks to expand its regional and global influence. Passage of what the U.S. said was a Chinese spy balloon across the U.S. this winter heightened Americans' sense of challenge from China. China says it was a research balloon that was blown off course.___Knickmeyer and Mascaro reported from Washington.

For the next 16 days until the animal was shot by a hunter on March 27, the theme park continued to deny that the creature had escaped from its property.Adding to the controversy were claims by the hunter surnamed Lin (林) that he had been authorized by a Leofoo Village employee to shoot the baboon when it rushed toward him. Leofoo Village is currently disputing this claim.On Wednesday evening (March 29), Leofoo Village released a statement in which it claimed that because the containment measures around the baboon area seemed to be normal when the baboon was spotted in Taoyuan City, the park did not believe that any of its baboons had escaped. However, it was revealed that when a veterinarian assisted in capturing the baboon, its tubal ligation scars were consistent with those of the baboons in the park, and it was determined that the escaped primate belonged to Leofoo Village.It also issued the following apology:""We feel infinitely saddened by the passing of the baboon's life. We are deeply sorry for causing trouble for the public and expending social resources. The park has conducted a self-reflection. Relevant supervisors and colleagues will be punished, and the company will share the responsibility with the employees.""After the statement was released, netizens flooded Leofoo Village's Facebook page to criticize the company for its actions. Many questioned the sincerity of the management's apology and condemned their handling of the escape.Netizens accused Leofoo Village of being ""full of lies and excuses."" Many expressed a wish to boycott the park, but worried about the livelihood of the animals in the park.They suggested that if Leofoo Village had admitted the escape from the beginning, the baboon may not have been hunted down in the same manner. They complained that the park displayed a careless attitude towards life and did not issue an apology until late at night, two days after the killing.At a press conference held at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday morning (March 30), Yeh Chung-yueh (葉忠岳), senior director of Leofoo Village Theme Park, bowed and issued an apology after reading a statement on behalf of the park. Yeh pledged that Leofoo Village would conduct a thorough investigation and issue penalties, and the reprimands would extend to the highest level park supervisors.As for whether the shooting was ordered by a veterinarian employed by Leofoo Village, Yeh said that the entire case is under judicial investigation and the park is not at liberty of discussing too many details at this time.",2023/03/30,1805,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851000,Taiwan’s falling birth rate due to marriage hesitancy,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — For the past 20 years, Taiwan has faced a declining birth rate and the problem is only getting worse.
Last year, the number of newborns was just 138,000, and the fertility rate dropped to 0.87, both historical lows. This trend threatens economic growth and social stability.
At a press conference on Thursday (March 30) hosted by Business Today, stakeholders addressed the underlying causes of this issue, such as marriage hesitancy, economic concerns, lack of partners, and a lack of government support.
“A super aged society paired together with a low birth rate is a very big problem for society. We need to find solutions quickly through new research. Our birth rate has even fallen behind that of Europe and Japan. This makes me wonder why we can not be more successful in raising the birth rate, said Business Today President Liang Yung-huang (梁永煌).










Liang attributes Taiwan’s low birth rate to the economic pressure felt by young people. He believes the government has adopted the wrong attitude to the situation which is only bound to get worse.
“There’s no hope for Taiwan if we don’t solve this problem, and we hope that today we can have a new beginning and a better concept of this problem,” said Liang.
Later in the press conference, findings of a survey carried out by the publication in conjunction with Pollster were presented. The fertility rate of married women has actually grown since 2003, but the number of unmarried women has expanded year by year. According to statistics in 2021, the unmarried rate of Taiwan's marriageable population aged 25 to 34 reached 49.36%.
Furthermore, poll results showed that 56.2% of all unmarried people have the intention of getting married, with 69.58% of men wanting to get married, which is much higher than 45.91% of women. The lack of a partner as well as economic conditions are two major obstacles to marriage.
As for what the government can do to promote more marriages, some suggestions offered by survey participants include the creation of a marriage fund as well as housing subsidies for newlyweds. A few have even asked for straightforward benefits such as tax breaks.
Willingness to have children
Business Today found that among unmarried people, 61.22% of men want to have children, much higher than 42.98% of women. The greatest obstacle to raising children is money, as 70% of the survey respondents say they are afraid that they will not be able to support them.
In terms of age, people’s willingness to have children decreased with age, but even among unmarried people aged 40 to 49, 46.11% still expressed a desire to have children.
In recent years, in order to encourage more childbirths, central and local governments have successively introduced policies such as childcare allowances, childcare subsidies, parental leave, and other cash subsidies.
The survey found that less than 30% of respondents would be encouraged to have children because of these policies.
As for what measures the public believes would be the most helpful to increase their willingness to have children, the survey found three effective measures: a monthly subsidy for all children under the age of 18, 30 days of parental leave every year, along with flexible work schedules, and better quality public daycare services.
Building a good foundation
While financial stimulus plans can encourage young people to have children, researchers are finding that many young people are having tremendous difficulty getting to the stage in life where having children is something they would consider.
One obstacle is that many young people regard buying an apartment or a house as a prerequisite for marriage. In the survey, Business Today found that 43.4% of people had considered delaying marriage or not getting married because of plans to buy a house.
The results of Business Today’s survey about marriage and child rearing show that government incentives are currently insufficient. The glimmer of hope is that more than half of unmarried people do have the desire to have children. This indicates that the government should also make concerted efforts to remove obstacles to marriage.
Only after promoting marriage can Taiwan begin to rescue the problem of a declining birth rate, which will require more comprehensive support for young families with better childbearing policies that can carry on the hope of more future generations to come.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — For the past 20 years, Taiwan has faced a declining birth rate and the problem is only getting worse.Last year, the number of newborns was just 138,000, and the fertility rate dropped to 0.87, both historical lows.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851018,Ukraine by rail: Inside Zelenskyy's efforts to buoy a nation,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (AP) — The caravan of unmarked vehicles tears across the muddy grass next to the playground. On the merry-go-round, the children stop swinging and spinning. The curious — parents and other residents of this southeastern town — gather around. Car doors swing open, and heavily armed security guards in battlefield fatigues spill out.And just like that, he is among them: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wartime leader and his country's chief morale officer.This week, Zelenskyy shuttled across the country on a 48-hour train trip to rally soldiers who are battling Russian forces — and, just as important, to buoy the communities often caught in the crossfire. Here, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the front lines, Zelenskyy came to see for himself the destruction from a Russian attack that damaged dozens of apartments one week ago.The violence hit just steps from the playground and merry-go-round. One person was killed and 30 others wounded. For Zaporizhzhia, the attack was a reminder of the often arbitrary nature of the threats many Ukrainians face each day as Russian missile strikes stretch beyond the front lines.But with the conflict now in its second year, Zelenskyy worries that both the outside world and Ukrainians far from the front lines are starting to become numb to the harsh, daily realities of war.And so he comes — to reassure, to motivate, to comfort.___KEEPING A NATION FOCUSED“Thank you that you are not meeting with me only in the capital,"" Zelenskyy tells journalists from The Associated Press who traveled with him on the train journey. “Thank you,” he says, that you ""found such possibility to be in our places.”Zelenskyy has rarely traveled with reporters, and his office said AP’s two-night trip with him was the most extensive since the war began.For the past year, Zelenskyy has served as the public face of Ukraine’s unexpectedly strong resistance to Russia’s invasion. Backed by billions of dollars in Western military aid, Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back repeatedly, including holding off efforts to take Kyiv in the early days of the war.That success has led to what Zelenskyy sees as the split-screen “reality of modern war” — the capital city, where cafes and restaurants are filled, and the grinding, deadly battles in the east and elsewhere along Ukraine’s expansive border with Russia.“From one side, it’s great that children, families, people — they love the life and it’s great. It’s great that our soldiers are bringing back normal life,” he says. “But from another side, it’s very dangerous.”Dangerous, he says, because soldiers on the front lines could lose motivation if they sense their fellow citizens are turning attention elsewhere. Dangerous because some Ukrainians seem willing to let down their guard about the risks that still exist far from the front.He laments that it has become a “natural habit” to ignore air raid sirens and not decamp to bomb shelters. He compares it to the way many people dropped their guard before the second wave of COVID-19 infections hopscotched around the world.Zelenskyy is not wrong. Moments before his caravan arrives at the apartment block in Zaporizhzhia, air raid sirens ring out across the city. No one flees. No one even flinches.___RIDING THE RAILSZelenskyy’s travel across Ukraine is a closely guarded secret. His whereabouts typically aren’t revealed until after he’s already moved on, when his robust government communications team posts photos and video online — often featuring him speaking to the camera. At the request of the president's office, the AP is withholding some logistical information about his travel.His schedule can be grueling. He departed Kyiv on Sunday night under cover of darkness for a 10-hour overnight train trip to the country's southeastern corner. There he made private visits to troops on the front lines, awarded medals to ailing soldiers at a local hospital and huddled with the head of the UN’s atomic energy agency about a strategically important power plant that has faced repeated Russian attacks.Zelenskyy has picked up the pace of his travel in recent weeks, often pushing closer to the front. He’s seeking to remind Ukrainians of their successes so far, attending ceremonies in small towns and cities marking their liberation from Russian forces one year ago.“These people saved our country against Russian tanks and armed vehicles,” he told AP in Okhtyrka, a border city of about 50,000 that was heavily damaged in the war's first months. Residents wiped away tears as Zelenskyy heralded Okhtyrka's heroism as the names of soldiers who died defending the city were read aloud.Most of Zelenskyy’s travel is done by train. He works from a specially outfitted coach car that, from the outside, is indistinguishable from the mass of Ukrainian state rail cars that regularly crisscross the expansive country. Other cars in the train are filled with two- and four-bed sleeper cabins, most occupied by Zelenskyy’s traveling advisers, security detail and railway staff.Throughout the war, Ukraine’s rail system has been a crucial artery for moving people and goods at a time when commercial air traffic is shut down and roadways can be dangerous or unpredictable. The trains keep remarkably on schedule, almost as if defying the broader uncertainty that has enveloped the country.Zelenskyy doesn’t keep still for long in any one place. He often zips off in well under an hour. He acknowledges that he sometimes pushes his security team beyond their comfort levels, particularly with his desire to visit troops in front-line positions. He knows the risks, though.“I have to think also about their lives,” Zelenskyy says of his security team. “That’s why I’m as careful as I can be.”Still, the high-energy president does occasionally find himself chafing at the restrictions that come with being a wartime leader. After complaining recently about his fading eyesight, he approached his head of security to see if he could get some fresh air. Perhaps some walks outside?His security chief had other ideas. “He said, ‘OK. Open the window.’”___FINDING PURPOSE IN WARThey called him a lightweight at first.Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to politics through a circuitous route, building a public persona as an actor and comedian. He was dismissed by many, including in Western capitals, after he was elected in 2019. He became known to many Americans through the first impeachment trial of then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who tried to leverage a sought-after visit by Zelenskyy to Washington for dirt on his then-political rival Joe Biden.Now, Zelenskyy’s past as an entertainer is rarely mentioned. When it is, it’s billed as an asset.He communicated aggressively in the war’s early days, rallying support at home and around the world with nightly videos showing him planted in Kyiv as it faced the prospect of Russian encirclement, resisting attempts to move him to safer ground. He’s a regular presence — usually virtually — at a range of international events, including the Grammys and the Super Bowl. His celebrity supporters are legion, even as Russian President Vladimir Putin casts him as an enemy and a dangerous renegade.He has embraced the optics of a wartime president, scrapping pre-invasion suits for military-style sweatshirts, cargo pants and boots, even when greeting world leaders. He has used his force of personality and public platforms to cajole dozens of them to visit Ukraine in recent months, casting each visit as another brick in the geopolitical wall isolating Russia from the rest of the world.Like him, many of them take trains — a method of transport dubbed by Ukrainians as “Iron Diplomacy.” A poster inside one of the cabins in Zelenksyy’s train touts “300+ delegations safely delivered to the Capital of Bravery” and features photos of world leaders aboard the railway. Among them: Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and Indonesian President Joko Widodo.Zelenskyy has little down time. He says he stays energized by what he calls “moments of little victories” that provide a respite from the relentless war. The woman he met Tuesday in the liberated town of Trostianets who asked him for a hug. A quick phone call with his young son to talk about a second-place finish in a recent wrestling match.“Sometimes these two or three minutes can bring you to a very adequate state,"" he says, “and you can relax.”___‘NOW I KNOW WHAT IS IMPORTANT’Ask Zelenskyy what has surprised him the most about himself over this past year, and he laughs — and doesn't answer. “This question is the biggest surprise,” he says. But he does acknowledge this much: The war has changed him, and it has focused him.“Now I know what is important,” he says. “My home, my God …. my country, my wife, my children and parents.”In the youngest of his two children — his son, who is nearly 10 — he sees a new generation of Ukrainians, young people who have been changed and shaped by a war he believes began nearly a decade ago with Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.“My son (is) a real child of the war,” Zelenskyy says. “He’s a real Ukrainian. He understands who is enemy, who is hero, who are our friends.”Zelenskyy acknowledges the toll the war has taken on Ukrainians. He hears it from all over, and he is living some of it himself. Often he appears filled with feeling, particularly when he meets families who have lost loved ones.“Everyone’s very emotional because of stress,” Zelenskyy says. “There is nothing good in the war. Children without childhoods, without school years, without moments of friendship, moments of love.”Yet just as he projects hope and optimism when he speaks at his whistlestops of reassurance, Zelenskyy finds something about his nation's war to be grateful for. It has, he says, forced Ukraine, a relatively young democracy, to grow up quickly and learn what it is willing to fight for.“It wasn’t a surprise for me that people are ready to fight for freedom,” he says. “Freedom is really in Ukrainians’ hearts. It means that we are ready to stay as long as we need.” ___Julie Pace is senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851019,Harris enters the fray over democracy with visit to Tanzania,"DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday encouraged Tanzania’s fragile progress toward a more inclusive government, stepping onto the front lines of America’s push to strengthen democracy in Africa as part of her weeklong trip to the continent.Standing alongside Samia Suluhu Hassan, Tanzania’s first female president, Harris cited recent decisions from Tanzania such as lifting a ban on opposition rallies and encouraging more press freedom as “important and meaningful steps” toward democratic reforms. Hassan has undone some of Tanzania's more oppressive policies even though she came to power as a member of the ruling party.“You have been a champion in the sense of democratic reforms in this country, and in that way have expanded our partnership,” Harris said.Hassan noted Tanzania's participation in a virtual summit on democracy hosted by the White House this week, saying it “sends a clear message that the fathers of democracy recognize our efforts in building a democratic nation.”The Tanzanian leader is finishing out the term of President John Magufuli, who earned a reputation for stamping out dissent, arresting critics and forcing them into exile, before he died in office. Hard-liners have been uncomfortable with some of Hassan’s changes, however, which could cost her in the next election two years from now.The meeting between Hassan and Harris, the first woman to be America's vice president, was a noteworthy show of support from the United States as it deepens its outreach to Africa. Harris announced $560 million in U.S. assistance for Tanzania, some of which will require congressional approval. The money is intended to expand the countries’ trade relationship, as well as encourage democratic governance.Hassan also pushed for the U.S. to make long duration visas available for Tanzanian citizens, something she said would improve ties between the countries. Issues with U.S. visas, from availability to processing delays, have generated frustration around Africa.“There’s so much excitement here, and people are saying it’s like madam president’s efforts in changing the country are being rewarded with recognition from an economic and political superpower that is the U.S.,” said Tanzania-based analyst Mohamed Issa Hemed.America's push on democracy is a delicate issue here. Washington has backed African dictators when it believes doing so serves U.S. interests and that has led to accusations of hypocrisy. In addition, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol raised questions over whether democracy remains secure even in the world’s most powerful country.When the U.S. promotes democracy, it risks a backlash from Africans who sense paternalism in the approach. Some African leaders also see the issue as a backdoor effort to meddle in their internal affairs and strengthen opposition politicians. They note that China asks no such questions about democracy when its looking to cut lucrative deals in Africa.Harris has emphasized the issue during her trip, particularly during her previous stop in Ghana, one of Africa’s most stable democracies.During a news conference with Ghana's Nana Akufo-Addo this week, Harris quoted the president's words in a recent speech that “it is important we never forget that democracy is not a static achievement, but a promise that needs continuous nurturing.”Harris agreed, saying “there is a duality when it comes to democracies” because they are “an exhibition of strength and they are fragile.”The time with Tanzania's Hassan provided Harris with another opportunity to highlight women’s issues in Africa, something she’s done repeatedly over the course of her trip. During her previous stop in Ghana, Harris met with female entrepreneurs and said women need leadership opportunities.The future, Harris said, should be a place “where women are not just treated equally but are able to thrive.”“These conversations are very important,” she said at the Mix Design Hub, a modern building that features a restaurant, an art gallery and a co-working space. “Because the well-being of women will be a reflection of the well-being of all of society.”Hassan described her meeting with Harris was “another milestone” and would be an “inspiration and a testimony to Tanzanian young girls.”After her meeting with Hassan, Harris visited a memorial to the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998 — the day a simultaneous bombing took place in Kenya. At the memorial, called “Hope Out of Sorrow,” Harris shook hands with staff who were present during the attack in Dar es Salaam, as well as the U.S. ambassador to Tanzania from that time, Charles Stith.Harris paused in front of the memorial, where there was a wreath adorned with white flowers, to pay her respects.“Thank you all for a continued life of service,” Harris told embassy staff. The bombing in Tanzania killed 12 people and wounded 77.Harris arrived in Tanzania late Wednesday, and she will conclude her weeklong trip with a stop in Zambia, another country that is striving to strengthen its democracy. She plans to return to Washington on Sunday.Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development in Abuja, Nigeria, said Harris’ visit can help galvanize enthusiasm when there are concerns over backsliding into authoritarianism in Africa and around the world.“Many people will want the U.S. to speak to the issue of democracy, which they feel is beginning to decline and is not what it used to be,” she said. “There are more that need to be assured that democracy is here to stay.”Like Tanzania, Zambia has made uneven steps toward democracy since its independence. But there has been a burst of hope after the country elected Hakainde Hichilema, a former opposition leader who once faced charges of treason.Zambia has since decriminalized defamation of the president, a law that was used to stifle opposition. It’s also serving as a co-host of President Joe Biden’s democracy summit.Hichilema warned this week that economic progress is necessary to sustain open societies. “You can’t eat democracy,” he wrote in The Washington Post. “Human rights may sustain the spirit but not the body.”___Musambi reported from Nairobi, Kenya.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851020,Kings end long playoff drought with 120-80 win over Blazers,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — While a throng of purple-clad visiting fans were already celebrating, De'Aaron Fox was watching from the bench as the moments ticked down in Sacramento's 120-80 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.For Fox, drafted by the Kings in 2017, the wait was finally over. Sacramento clinched a spot in the playoffs for the first time since 2006.“We want to do bigger things, but 16 years — that’s a long time,” Fox said.Fox finished with 18 points in the victory, which also gave the Kings home-court advantage. The team’s 16-year playoff drought was the longest in NBA history and the longest active postseason dry spell among teams in the NBA, NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball.“Definitely with this team, I think you’re just playing for a higher purpose,” Fox said. “And I think we have a team that’s capable and we know that we can continue to get better.”The last time the Kings made the playoffs, Fox was 8 years old.Kings rookie Keegan Murray made his 188th 3-pointer of the season with 6:44 to go in the third quarter to set the NBA record, passing Donovan Mitchell's mark of 187 set in 2017-18. Murray, who flashed an understated grin after the shot fell, finished with 13 points.Malik Monk finished with 19 points off the bench and Kevin Huerter added 17. The Kings fans at Portland's Moda Center celebrated with the team's rallying cry, “Light the Beam!”“For all the support they've given us over the years, continuing to come to the arena, heartbreak, frustration and disappointment season after season,"" forward Harrison Barnes said. ""To finally get this moment for them, it's everything.”The Kings (46-30) sit in third in the Western Conference. The first-place Denver Nuggets and the Memphis Grizzlies, who sit three games back, had already clinched.Rookie Shaedon Sharpe had 30 points for the Blazers, who have lost four straight and 10 of their last 11 games. The loss to the Kings eliminated Portland from playoff contention.Portland was depleted with regular starters Damian Lillard (right calf), Jusuf Nurkic (right knee), Anfernee Simons (right foot) and Jerami Grant (left quad) all nursing injuries. It got a bit worse for Portland on Wednesday when Keon Johnson, who had 20 points in a loss to New Orleans on Monday, broke a finger in shootaround. Only seven Blazers played.The Kings are 23-14 on the road this season, third-best in the NBA. And they’ve avoided extended losing streaks: The team’s longest came at the start of the season when the Kings opened with four straight.“Our guys are excited about it,” Kings coach Mike Brown said about finally reaching the playoffs. “They're excited about the way that they played tonight and the accomplishments that they've had so far. They were excited for Keegan. But in the same breath, and not to downplay anything, they expect more.”Portland had a 20-19 edge after the first quarter, but the Kings took over, going up 44-32 on Huerter’s 3-pointer with 3:51 to go before halftime. Portland closed the gap to 50-46 at the break.The Kings went on to lead by as many as 40 points in the second half. Domantas Sabonis finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds.“Biggest difference was in the second half, they started making 3s, and they're that type of team,"" Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. ""They're going to play the same way. They're going to shoot a lot of 3s, and miss or make, they're going to play that way. We just couldn't keep up.”PRAISE FOR MURRAYMurray's milestone was not lost on Brown in the midst of the celebrating.“Breaking any type of records at the highest level in anything you do is absolutely amazing. And to see Keegan do that tonight, with the way he's played all year and how hard he's worked, was an amazing feat,” Brown said. “You don't take that for granted. That is hard to do when you're talking about something in the history of something.”TIP-INSKings: The Kings were also in a position to clinch Monday, but they fell to Minnesota 119-115. ... “I think every experience that we’ve gone through this year can help translate (to the playoffs),” Brown said before the game. “But I’m telling you, we’ll experience it in the playoffs at another level. And every round you advance in the playoffs, it’s going to even take it up another notch.”Trail Blazers: It will likely be the second straight season the Blazers have missed the postseason. ... Forward Justise Winslow had surgery Wednesday on his left ankle. He is expected to be ready to play next season.UP NEXTThe Kings and the Trail Blazers play again Friday night at the Moda Center.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851022,Manhattan claws back people as urban counties stem outflow,"Turns out the pandemic hasn't permanently dissuaded people — especially immigrants — from seeking their fortunes amid Manhattan's bustling streets.The county that encompasses Manhattan added more than 17,000 residents in the year ending last July after losing almost 111,000 people in the previous 12-month period, according to population estimates released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The earlier decline was among the worst urban population losses from the COVID-19 outbreak.New York County was among several large, urban U.S. counties that either gained residents or stemmed the rate of declines between July 2021 and July 2022 compared with a year earlier.The reversal in population losses was particularly notable in King County, Washington, home to Seattle; as well as in large Sunbelt counties such as Dallas County, Texas; and two South Florida counties, Miami-Dade and Broward. The locations all had something in common: international immigration led the gains.“I wasn’t expecting this quick of a bounce back for some cities and urban areas. It’s not a full recovery from before the pandemic but moving in the right direction,” demographer William Frey, of the Brookings Institution’s metropolitan policy program, Brookings Metro, said Thursday.Population change is driven by migration, both within U.S. borders as people move around, and international trends as people arrive from abroad. It also depends on whether births outpace deaths, or vice versa.Maricopa County, Arizona, home to Phoenix, had the biggest gain of any U.S. county, with almost 57,000 new residents last year. Domestic migration was primarily responsible. Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, followed with more than 45,000 new residents and international arrivals and natural increases propelling that growth; 20,000 residents left. Collin County, a northern suburb of Dallas, ranked third in rising population, with more than 44,000 new residents who primarily came from other U.S. counties.Los Angeles County, the most populous in the U.S. with 9.7 million people, lost the most residents last year, more than 90,000, as Angelenos moved elsewhere. One bright spot: The loss from domestic migration was 20% less than the previous year. The next biggest population loss was in Cook County, Illinois, home to Chicago, and the nation's second most populous county. That change was also driven by people leaving.Several San Francisco and San Jose-area counties that saw populations dramatically wane from July 2020 to July 2021 — primarily due to tech workers working remotely — had significantly smaller declines in 2022.The counties with the biggest influx of international immigration last year were Miami-Dade County, Florida; Harris County, Texas; and Los Angeles County.Harris County, Los Angeles County and Dallas County had the biggest natural increases. Three Florida counties — Pinellas, Sarasota and Volusia — led the U.S. in natural decreases attributed to deaths outpacing births. Florida's median age of 42.7 is one of the highest in the nation.The growth in Manhattan's New York County was propelled by international migration, and to a lesser extent by domestic migration and births outpacing deaths. It came despite rising Manhattan rents and coincided with many businesses' partial return to their offices, which ended some opportunities for remote work.“There was a flood of people coming back into the city once the pandemic started easing up and that pushed rents up,” said Daniel Akerman, a New York real estate agent. “People always want to live in Manhattan.""All the population estimates rely on birth, death and migration data.Despite the most recent gains, New York County was still running a population deficit of almost 98,000 residents as of last July when compared with April 2020, when COVID-19 spread quickly across the U.S. and the metropolitan area became an epicenter of the virus, spurring tens of thousands of residents to flee. Surrounding counties continued losing population last year. The three counties encompassing the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens recorded among the biggest population declines in the U.S., with losses ranging from 40,000 to 50,000 residents.“This is still not really a COVID recovery year. It’s only sort of a recovery,” City University of New York sociology professor emeritus Andrew Beveridge said Thursday. “They haven’t recouped.”Several New Jersey counties near New York also experienced outflows last year. They included Hudson County, where the COVID-19 omicron variant closed preschools around Christmas 2021 and drove David Polonsky and his family to move temporarily to South Florida, near his parents. The move became permanent in 2022, as the family acclimated to being near relatives and because Polonsky and his wife could work their tech jobs remotely. They sold their home in Jersey City and purchased one in Palm Beach County, Florida.Polonsky said he misses some things about the New York area, such as being able to walk places instead of driving, and getting a decent slice of pizza instead of mahi mahi, the fish ubiquitous on Florida menus.“I love mahi mahi as much as the next person,” he said. “But there’s only so much mahi mahi you can eat.”___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851023,Australia makes biggest carbon polluters curb emissions,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The Australian Parliament created landmark new laws Thursday that will make the nation’s biggest greenhouse gas polluters reduce their emissions or pay for carbon credits.The center-left Labor Party administration said the so-called Safeguard Mechanism reforms are essential to Australia reaching its target of reducing its emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade and net-zero emissions by 2050.Set to take effect July 1, the reforms create a ceiling on the nation’s emissions and force Australia’s 215 most polluting facilities to reduce their emissions by 4.9% a year or reach the target with carbon credits.The laws create Australia’s first price on carbon since a former Labor government created a carbon tax in 2012. A conservative government repealed that tax in 2014 and has since rejected any climate policies that would make polluters pay.The bills passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 32 to 26, with Labor senators supported by the minor Greens party and unaligned legislators.The Greens, who represent 11 senators, began negotiations with Labor with a demand that no new coal and gas extraction projects be allowed. But the Greens are satisfied that an agreement to strictly cap emissions would mean that half of the 116 new coal and gas projects proposed in Australia would not go ahead.The Liberal Party and the Nationals party, which formed the conservative coalition government that was voted out of office in 2022 after almost a decade in power, opposed the legislation.Opposition climate change and energy spokesperson Ted O’Brien said capping emissions would drive Australian industrial investment offshore to China and India while increasing costs for Australians.“This is a tax that will see prices go up in the midst of a cost of living crisis where every household across this country is feeling the pain of prices going up,” O'Brien told Parliament, referring to unusually high inflation and interest rates in Australia.The government argues that without the mechanism, Australia would only reduce its emissions by 35% by the end of the decade.Emissions won’t be able to exceed Australia’s current pollution level of 140 million metric tons (154 million U.S. tons) a year, and that cap will decrease over time. Big polluters would be able to buy carbon credits to help achieve their emission reduction targets, but polluters that use carbon credits to achieve more than 30% of their abatement would have to explain why they were not doing more to reduce their own emissions.The reforms would reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 205 million metric tons (226 million U.S. tons) by 2030, equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia’s cars off the road in the same time, the government said.The conservative parties created the Safeguard Mechanism when they were in power in 2016. But the emission limits were so high that the 215 major polluters, which account for almost 30% of Australia’s emissions, were able to increase their emissions by 4%.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his party was voted into power at 2022 elections to take action on climate change.“Today’s a big step toward repaying that faith,” Albanese told Parliament. “Passing this legislation has put Australia on a realistic path to net-zero emissions by 2050 and a 43% reduction by 2030.”The previous government had set a less ambitious target of reducing Australia’s emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.The Climate Council, a leading climate communicator, described the reforms as the first Australian legislation in a decade that would regulate greenhouse gas pollution.The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, which represents oil and gas producers, said the reforms make it harder for gas to be used to transition Australia away from more harmful coal and provide reliable backup for renewable energy.The House of Representatives, where Labor holds a majority of seats, passed Senate amendments 89 votes to 50 later Thursday. The House had passed the original draft of the laws on Monday.___Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851024,"Across Latin America, migrant blaze families left reeling","SAN MARTIN JILOTEPEQUE, Guatemala (AP) — The last Ana Marina López heard of her husband, the 51-year-old Guatemalan migrant told his family that he was being detained by Mexican immigration agents at the U.S.-Mexico border.That was two days before a fire in an immigration detention center in Ciudad Juárez claimed the lives of at least 39 migrants and left more than two dozen injured.Then his name appeared on a government list of the fire victims, but not specifying whether he was among the dead or the hospitalized. That has left López and her daughter back in their small western Guatemalan town clinging to hope that he may be alive.And they aren't the only ones.As images of the devastating blaze consume news broadcasts and social media, families scattered across the Americas are reeling in agony as they await news of their loved ones. The pain and uncertainty felt by families underscores how the effects of migration ripple far beyond the individuals who embark on the perilous journey north, touching the lives of people across the region.In Juarez, Mexico, a sister waits for news of her Venezuelan brother who's been sedated and intubated in a hospital. In Honduras, families sit stunned after watching video of guards hurrying away from a growing cloud of flames and smoke in the immigration detention center.And in Guatemala, López cradles a photograph of her husband in a cowboy hat unsure if he is alive or dead.“This shouldn’t be able to happen. (Migrants) are people, they are humans,” López said, her voice shaking. “What I ask for is justice. They aren’t animals and can’t be treated as such.”Little is known about the cause of Monday night's fire, and authorities are investigating eight people, including a migrant, who may have started it.When López's husband, Bacilio Sutuj Saravia, departed on his journey north in mid-March, he told her he was going to Mexico for tourism. Sutuj, who ran a small transport business with two pickup trucks, waited until he was in Mexico to tell her that his intention was to cross to the U.S. to see their daughter and two sons.However, he never had the chance. Getting off a bus in Juárez's station on Saturday, immigration agents detained him.López learned of the fire from television news reports. Their children had been unable to reach Sutuj since a brief call he made Saturday saying he had been caught.“The authorities should be there watching them and taking care of them, not fleeing and leaving them locked up and burned. That pains me,"" López said.In the rolling coffee-dotted mountains of western Honduras, the three families horrified by the surveillance video are awaiting confirmation of the fates of their sons. The three friends had set out together for the United States from their small town of Proteccion. Like many in the rural area, the men planned to work and send money back to support their families.They met a smuggler in San Pedro Sula, a major point of departure in northern Honduras, who took them to Mexico.On Tuesday the three men's names — Dikson Aron Cordova, Edin Josue Umaña and Jesús Adony Alvarado — were among those to appear on the government’s list of victims without any details of whether they were alive.“You want to be strong, but these are hard blows. They’re unbearable,” said José Córdova Ramos, father of 30-year-old Cordova. “We’re waiting for real news that would be the first and the last, as they say, if they are alive or dead.”Their concern is matched by anger from watching guards run away from growing flames and thickening smoke rapidly encapsulating migrants.Another father rambles off questions: Who started the fire? How did they get fire in there? Did a guard give a lighter to someone inside?“They didn’t want to do anything,"" José Cordova said of the guards.In Ciudad Juarez at the U.S.-Mexico border, 25-year-old Venezuelan nursing student Stefany Arango Morillo has been left with the same pit in her stomach.She and her brother Stefan Arango Morillo, both single parents, migrated from their northern Venezuelan city of Maracaibo in February, leaving behind three young children between them with their mother in hopes of claiming asylum in the U.S.Joining a rising wave of Venezuelans heading to the U.S. border, the siblings traversed seven countries in a month’s time to reach Ciudad Juárez.Together, they attempted unsuccessfully each day to register through a smart-phone app for an appointment to apply for asylum in the U.S.But their quest came to an abrupt halt Monday, when Stefan was detained by Mexican immigration authorities and placed behind bars in the detention center that hours later would turn into an inferno.Stefany, searched desperately for her 32-year-old brother, fearing the worst when she received a text from his phone inside a private hospital. He was alive, but his injuries from smoke inhalation made it nearly impossible for him to talk.In the hospital, Stefan's health deteriorated, and the aspiring physical education teacher was transferred to the hospital emergency room in a coughing fit.Hours later, his sister pushed into the bustling hospital and planted a kiss on her brother’s forehead shortly before he was sedated and intubated.“He’s playful, but also has a strong will,” she said.In the hospital waiting room she cries as she calls relatives in Venezuela, delivering the news. But as she waits, she clings to hope that she can bring him back home.“This is a like a life lesson,"" Stefany said. ""And believe me that I know and have faith that my brother, that he’ll get out of there and also keep fighting for our dream.”___Lee reported from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Escalón from Proteccion, Honduras.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851025,Booker leads Suns over Timberwolves in Durant's home debut,"PHOENIX (AP) — Kevin Durant's a 13-time All-Star, a two-time NBA champion, a four-time league leader in scoring and has done just about everything else a player can do in the game of basketball.But even he can get a little nervous on a night like Wednesday.Devin Booker scored 29 points, Durant had 16 points and eight rebounds in his home debut and the Phoenix Suns won their third straight game, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 107-100.After a huge ovation from the sellout crowd — which waited more than a month to see him play a game in Phoenix after his trade from Brooklyn — Durant missed his first six shots and finished 5 of 18 from the field, though he did hit a couple important 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter.“It was hard for me to get sleep today, it was hard for me to stop thinking about the game,” Durant said. “Sometimes you can want it too bad and you come out, start rushing and being uncharacteristic.”“I'm glad I'm back, I'm glad I'm playing again and being one of the guys. Just building from here.”Even with the nerves, the Suns are 4-0 with Durant in the lineup. The Timberwolves had a four-game winning streak snapped.The Suns and Wolves are in the middle of the Western Conference playoff race, fighting to stay in the top six so they don't fall to the play-in tournament. Every game is crucial at this point — just three wins separated the Nos. 4-11 spots coming into Wednesday.The Suns took an 81-74 lead into the fourth quarter and held on in the final minutes.Durant changed his shoes at halftime, hoping for some better mojo.“I thought he battled on both ends,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “I think his cardio has got to get back to the level he wants it. Once he gets that, we’ll see the Kevin that we all know.”Chris Paul added 19 points and six assists for Phoenix.Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 31 points. Karl-Anthony Towns added 25.Durant played for the first time since March 5. He was warming up for his first home game with the Suns three days later when he sprained his left ankle during pregame preparation. The injury cost him 10 games.The timing of that ankle injury — less than an hour before his expected home debut — felt like a bad omen for the Suns, who added the 34-year-old Durant in a blockbuster trade-deadline deal that sent Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder and draft picks back to the Nets.But Phoenix managed to tread water in the standings without its newest star. His second attempt at the home debut went much better, even if his shooting touch was off.The Timberwolves took a 51-48 halftime lead. Towns scored 20 points, hitting four 3-pointers. Booker led the Suns with 12.MAD GOBERTThe Timberwolves — and particularly center Rudy Gobert — were irritated about a 27-12 advantage in free throw attempts for the Suns.“It's really not fair every night,” Gobert said. ""I have been in this league for 10 years and I try to always give the benefit of the doubt, but it is hard for me to think that they are not trying to help (the Suns) win tonight.“It is hard for me to think that they didn't try to have the Warriors win the other night or the Sacramento Kings the other night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851026,A college in upheaval: War on 'woke' sparks fear in Florida,"SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — Professors at the New College of Florida are using personal email because they’re afraid of being subpoenaed.Students are concerned, too. Some fear for their physical safety. Many worry their teachers will be fired en masse and their courses and books will be policed. It’s increasingly hard to focus on their studies.For years, students have come to this public liberal arts college on the western coast of Florida because they were self-described free thinkers. Now they find themselves caught in the crosshairs of America’s culture war.Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has targeted the tiny school on the shores of Sarasota Bay as a staging ground for his war on “woke.” The governor and his allies say New College, a progressive school with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, is indoctrinating students with leftist ideology and should be revamped into a more conservative institution.Students and faculty say America should take note because the transformation at New College could become a blueprint with national implications as DeSantis gears up for a likely presidential bid.“I’m sorry, but this isn’t an indoctrination facility. This isn’t a factory that pumps out, you know, non-binary communists,” says Viv Cargille, 20, a marine biology major from Miami. She is passionate about researching dolphin acoustics but finds it mentally exhausting to focus on classes in a climate she describes as turbulent, volatile and anxiety-inducing.Her roommate Olivia Pare, a second-year biology major, wishes the politicians would leave their school alone. “My biggest frustration is the way it is impacting my education. I am here to learn. I am not here to be more woke — whatever that is,” Pare said. When she does research in the organic chemistry lab, “we’re not talking about organic chemistry anymore — we’re talking about whether my professor will get her tenure approved.”In January, DeSantis and his allies overhauled the 13-member Board of Trustees and installed a majority of conservative figures. The new trustees promptly fired the college president and replaced her with a Republican politician, the first of several administrators to lose their jobs. Next, they dismantled the office of diversity and equity. They have not revealed future plans but trustees have posted vague warnings on social media like: “You will see changes in 120 days.”Changes so far have come in tandem with a new bill DeSantis unveiled Jan. 31 aimed at overhauling higher education in Florida. The bill would ban gender studies majors and minors, eliminate diversity programs and any hiring based on diversity, weaken tenure protections and put all hiring decisions in the hands of each university’s board of trustees.The effect at New College has been chilling and disruptive. Students and faculty compare the upheaval to a “hostile takeover” that feels even more jarring because of what the school has represented to so many students for so many years: a haven of open-mindedness and acceptance in a place of idyllic beauty, with palm-tree-lined paths along a stretch of white-sand coast.“It felt very much like New College was a little bubble in Florida,” said Willem Aspinall, 19, an environmental studies major who grew up in a Chicago suburb. “Now it feels like that has kind of been burst. The campus feels a lot less safe now.”Students and faculty are afraid of one thing most of all: The extinction of New College as they know it.They are not wrong to worry.One of the new trustees is Christopher Rufo, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and architect of the right-wing outrage against critical race theory, a legal term that has come to represent teaching about the ongoing effects of slavery. Rufo actively posts on social media about his vision for the future of New College, often in militaristic terms. He has referred to new trustees at the public institution as the “landing team,” saying, “We got over the wall,” and referencing an operation to “recapture” the college.New College has its problems. The college performs poorly in certain state metrics, including a decline in enrollment until last year. Students complain of mold in dorms, broken elevators and other delayed maintenance because of years of underfunding. Some students say they would welcome more conservative students to balance the left-leaning student body. DeSantis and the new trustees cite the challenges as justification for the state intervention.“We will be shutting down low-performing, ideologically-captured academic departments and hiring new faculty,” Rufo said in one tweet. “The student body will be recomposed over time: some current students will self-select out, others will graduate; we’ll recruit new students who are mission-aligned.” He and others have posted plans to “redesign the curriculum” with a goal of making the school more politically conservative.Some students are fleeing, for schools that feel safer. Many on campus have voiced a concern that the politically charged spotlight on their school could invite danger. Several professors who asked not to be named are sending out resumes. Trustee meetings have become a focal point of student protests, and the only source of information on the school’s fate.New College has long been an anomaly in a state filled with large public universities. It has barely 700 students, no fraternities or sororities and no football team. It is Florida’s designated honors college and produces an impressive number of the state’s Fulbright scholars. It has a uniquely self-directed curriculum that allows students to design individualized majors. The average class size is 11 students. There are no letter grades; students get detailed “narrative evaluations” as part of a pass-fail system.The academic freedom is mirrored by a student body that feels free to express itself, say students and faculty, who describe New College as a haven for brainy kids who are high-achieving and intellectually curious. Some were the quiet kids in high school, or were bullied for being queer or different, or struggled socially because of autism or other disabilities. Some were homeschooled or come from alternative educational backgrounds that led them to be self-directed in their schooling. They arrived at New College and felt welcome in a way they never had before, say parents, students and faculty.There is a long table in the center of the New College dining hall that epitomizes the school’s culture of acceptance, according to several students. People sitting there invite newcomers to come join them. Anyone walking in knows they never need to eat alone.“It is one of the most unique places I think that exists in American higher education,” says Elizabeth C. Leininger, a neuroscientist and associate biology professor, who knows all her students by name. She compares an education at New College to small, private liberal arts schools at a fraction of the cost. In-state tuition at New College is $7,000 and out-of-state is $30,000, but many students get scholarships that cut tuition by at least half.For the first time in her academic career, Leininger is wondering if some of her courses, like “Sex, Gender, Mind and Brain,” will court trouble.“I would have to think very carefully about how I am going to teach that class now,” said Leininger, a graduate of Swarthmore College who did her Ph.D. at Columbia University, where she also taught. Like other faculty, Leininger is using personal email or encrypted messaging platforms when discussing the upheaval, fearing school email accounts will be subpoenaed. “There is very much a policing of ideas.”Students, too, have shifted conversations on organizing protests to encrypted platforms like Signal and Slack to ensure privacy, says Gaby Batista, 19, an anthropology major who has taken personal precautions as well. “I’ve made my Instagram private and took off my pronouns.”For parents who have felt the intense heartache of watching their child struggle and then the deep relief of seeing them thrive, the upheaval at New College is making them relive a painful past.Psychologist Joyce White calls the experience “devastating” and “destabilizing” for the parents and students, particularly those who endured childhood bullying only to find themselves again feeling targeted. White’s daughter, Lola, is a third-year biology major at New College with plans to be a veterinarian. Lola is autistic, has ADHD and “lives in a constant state of anxiety,” her mother said. Ever since she was a child, Lola excelled at school but found it very stressful. She has difficulty adapting to change and feeling like she belongs. Until fifth grade, Lola threw up every day on the way to school, her mother said. The pandemic wreaked havoc on her mental health and disrupted Lola’s college plans. She attended community college online for two years, before transferring in the fall of 2022 to New College.“We found this little school that was perfect for Lola,” said White, who moved her family from Minnesota to Sarasota to ease Lola into college. It wasn’t easy at first, adjusting to the Florida heat and to in-person classes, but Lola was settling in. She loved her small classes at New College and the ability to meet professors one-on-one. Her confidence was growing, which made her less introverted. She felt safe, and one day she joked with another student that she had no friends. The student responded, “You’re our friend,” and invited Lola to study with her group at the library.“I felt like I could connect to the people here. The kids are accepting – of anyone. There is no judgment,” said Lola. She was amazed at the resources the school offered to help students who were struggling. She was assigned an academic adviser, a career coach and a special adviser for transfer students. “When I told them I was struggling, they reached out even more. No one has ever done that for me before in education,” Lola said, seated beside her mother at sunset on a recent evening along the school’s private beach.“It’s been such a long road, and I finally felt like I could see light at the end of the tunnel,” said White, who recognizes in herself feelings of anxiety and depression as she worries if Lola will find her path again. “Now it feels like everything has blown up.” She adds, “I’m trying to put on a brave face for her.”Two of Lola’s friends are transferring out of New College. Lola has struggled lately with panic attacks, stress and difficulty concentrating on schoolwork. But for now, she plans to stay. “I can do it, but there will be repercussions on my mental health.”Meanwhile, students and faculty are noticing new restrictions they worry are aimed at curtailing freedom of expression. Faculty received a memo recently with new recommended guidelines for email signatures: They “should only include” name, title, college address, logo and phone number, which faculty see as a ruling that disallows pronouns. An event known as V.I.P. Weekend that was organized by the diversity and equity office to host prospective students overnight was also abruptly canceled. And maintenance crews recently were instructed to wash away chalk drawings and messages that covered a campus overpass, part of a longstanding tradition of eclectic artwork and expression. Many of the chalk messages voiced outrage at DeSantis and the new trustees or carried messages of support, such as: “Diversity is our strength.”Faculty are advising students to concentrate on schoolwork and block out the noise, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that the worst is yet to come, said Aspinall, the environmental studies major.“I’m concerned they’re going to take a school that does not indoctrinate students and turn it into a school that does.”___The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851056,Anatomy of a political takeover at Florida public college,"SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has targeted a tiny, public liberal arts college on the shores of Sarasota Bay, as a staging ground for his war on “woke.”The governor and his allies say the New College of Florida, known as a progressive school with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, is indoctrinating students with leftist ideology and should be remade into a more conservative institution.A top-down restructuring is under way at New College, where DeSantis' allies are carrying out what students and faculty call a “hostile takeover” and a political attack on their academic freedom.Here is the anatomy of the takeover, so far, at New College:Jan. 6 Gov. Ron DeSantis appoints six new members to 13-member Board of Trustees at New College, packing the board with Republican allies and insiders: -Christopher Rufo, conservative activist, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and architect of right-wing outrage over critical race theory -Jason “Eddie” Speir, co-founder and superintendent of a Christian school in Bradenton, Florida -Matthew Spalding, a professor and dean at conservative Hillsdale College; senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a right-wing think tank -Charles Kesler, senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and a professor at Claremont McKenna College -Mark Bauerlein, retired English professor at Emory University and vocal opponent of diversity, equity and inclusion programs -Debra Jenks, an attorney in Palm Beach and the only new trustee who attended New CollegeJan 26 Florida’s Board of Governors appoints seventh new trustee, Ryan Anderson, president of Ethic and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank.Jan. 31 -At first meeting with new trustees, the board votes to fire New College president Patricia Okker. -Board announces plans to name new interim President Richard Corcoran, a former Republican speaker of the Florida State House and DeSantis’ first Commissioner of Education. They approve a base salary of $699,000 for Corcoran, more than double Okker's salary. -Board also announces plans to hire new general counsel, Bill Galvano, an attorney and former GOP Florida Senate president.Feb. 28 Second meeting of new trustees. Board votes to eliminate New College’s Office of Outreach and Inclusive Excellence, as part of plans to abolish spending on diversity and equity programs. New trustee Rufo tells the meeting that DEI programs “restrict academic freedom and degrade the rigor of scholarship” because they treat “people differently based on their skin color or other inborn identities.”March 3 New president Corcoran’s first personnel move is to fire chief diversity officer, Yoleidy Rosario-Hernandez, who identifies as a transgender person of color.March 23 New College announces Provost Suzanne Sherman, who had publicly clashed with new trustees, has “stepped down” and will be replaced by an interim provost.Sydney Gruters, a former GOP congressional aide, named as executive director of the New College of Florida Foundation. She is married to State Sen. Joe Gruters, former chair of Florida Republican Party.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851057,Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Gwyneth Paltrow wasn’t to blame for a 2016 collision with a retired optometrist on a beginner run at a posh Utah ski resort during a family vacation, a jury decided Thursday following a live-streamed trial that became a pop culture fixation.A jury awarded Paltrow $1 — a symbolic amount she asked for in order to show it wasn’t about money — and delivered her the vindication she sought when she opted to take it to trial rather than settle out of court.“I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,” Paltrow said in a statement released by her representatives that she also posted as an Instagram story for her 8.3 million followers. She also thanked the judge and jury for their work.As Paltrow left court she touched Terry Sanderson’s shoulder and told him, “I wish you well,” he told reporters outside court. He responded, “Thank you dear.”Paltrow's attorney, Steve Owens, added in a statement he read outside court that “Gwyneth has a history of advocating for what she believes in – this situation was no different and she will continue to stand up for what is right.”Paltrow, an actor who in recent years has refashioned herself into a celebrity wellness entrepreneur, looked to her attorneys with a pursed lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury’s verdict in the Park City courtroom. She sat intently through two weeks of testimony in what became the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year.After the verdict was read, the judge polled the jury, which was unanimous on the decision. In civil court in Utah, only three-fourths of jurors need to agree on a verdict. The attorney fees Paltrow asked for in her countersuit were not included in the jury’s verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.Addressing reporters after the verdict, Sanderson questioned whether the lawsuit was worth it and said he believed that people tend to naturally trust celebrities like Paltrow.“You get some assumed credibility from being a famous person,"" Sanderson said. ""Really, who wants to take on a celebrity?”The dismissal concludes two weeks of courtroom proceedings that hinged largely on reputation rather than the monetary damages at stake in the case. Paltrow’s attorneys described the complaint against her as “utter B.S.” and painted the Goop founder-CEO as uniquely vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits due to her celebrity.Paltrow took the witness stand during the trial to insist that the collision wasn’t her fault, and to describe how she was stunned when she felt “a body pressing against me and a very strange grunting noise.”Throughout the trial, the word “uphill” became synonymous with “guilty, ” as attorneys focused on a largely unknown skiing code of conduct that stipulates that the skier who is downhill or ahead on the slope has the right of way.Worldwide audiences followed the celebrity trial as if it were episodic television. Viewers scrutinized both Paltrow and Sanderson’s motives while attorneys directed questions to witnesses that often had less to do with the collision and more to do with their client’s reputations.The trial took place in Park City, a resort town known for hosting the annual Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies including 1998’s “Sliding Doors,” at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a lifestyle influencer. Paltrow is also known for her roles in “Shakespeare in Love” and the “Iron Man” movies.The jury’s decision marks a painful court defeat for Sanderson, the man who sued Paltrow for more than $300,000 over injuries he sustained when they crashed on the ski slope at Deer Valley Resort.“He never returned home that night as the same man. Terry has tried to get off that mountain but he’s really still there,” attorney Robert Sykes said during closing arguments.Both parties blamed the other for the collision. Sanderson, 76, broke four ribs and sustained a concussion after the two tumbled down the slope, with Paltrow landing on top of him.He filed an amended complaint after an earlier $3.1 million lawsuit was dismissed. In response, Paltrow countersued for $1 and attorney fees, a symbolic action that mirrors Taylor Swift’s response to a radio host’s defamation lawsuit. Swift was awarded $1 in 2017.Paltrow’s defense team represented Sanderson as an angry, aging and unsympathetic man who had over the years become “obsessed” with his lawsuit against Paltrow. They argued that Paltrow wasn’t at fault in the crash and also said, regardless of blame, that Sanderson was overstating the extent of his injuries.___AP writer Anna Furman contributed from Los Angeles.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851058,Piastri is back at an Australian GP in a far different role,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Oscar Piastri is hoping his debut Formula One drive on home soil at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday will be more successful than the first time he stood on the grid in Melbourne.The first-season driver, who grew up in a nearby suburb to the Albert Park circuit, was chosen as a flag holder for Toro Rosso Ferrari driver Daniil Kyvat in Melbourne in 2016.But, to his disappointment, a chance to meet the Russian driver did not eventuate because Kyvat experienced electrical difficulties on the formation lap.“I was holding Daniil Kyvat’s flag and he broke down on the lap to the grid, so I never actually got to see him,” Piastri said. “(It will be) pretty special to have someone holding my flag this time.”The 21-year-old Piastri, who replaced popular compatriot Daniel Ricciardo at McLaren for the 2023 season, grew up a 15-minute drive from the circuit but has never driven a race around it.The track encircling a lake is in a sporting precinct and is surrounded by cricket ovals.“I played Aussie rules football and cricket on some of the ovals that are now the paddock, so (it is) very special to be at home this weekend,” he said. “But the last time I raced in Australia, I was still in go-karts. I think it was seven years ago now. (It will be) nice to get out on the race track in Australia.”Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief executive Andrew Westacott estimates Piastri’s appearance on the grid has boosted ticket sales for the weekend by 10%.Piastri is seeking to break a curse for Australian drivers in their home race, with none of his compatriots posting a podium finish since the inception of the Australian Grand Prix in 1985.Ricciardo, who is at Albert Park as a reserve driver for championship leader Red Bull this weekend, finished in second position on the track behind Nico Rosberg on his debut in 2014. But hours later he was disqualified after stewards found his Red Bull 10 had exceeded the legal fuel flow rate.Piastri has modest ambitions for Sunday, saying the McLarens driven by himself and teammate Lando Norris will be seeking a top-10 finish.McLaren has endured a difficult start to the season. Piastri retired in the opening race in Bahrain, while Norris finished 17th. Piastri impressed in qualifying for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in mid-March, finishing eighth.But an opening-lap mishap with his teammate Norris bounced the pair out of the points, with Piastri finishing in 15th position, two spots ahead of the Englishman.“Qualifying, especially, gave me a lot of confidence that the way that we’re working is the right way,” Piastri said Thursday. “I think (in) the first lap, I probably could have done a few things differently and maybe kept myself out of trouble a bit better.“But I think for the rest of the race, it is nice to get a race distance under my belt at least. And that leads to some learning and getting rid of some of the rust. Hopefully we can just have a clean race and that my front wing doesn’t wipe out Lando this time.”McLaren has flagged development plans in the break between the Australian Grand Prix and the next race in Azerbaijan on April 30.New team principal Andrea Stella said on Thursday a major upgrade is also planned for the month-long break after Round 13 of the season in Belgium in late July.“We would expect, definitely, another major upgrade which will interest more areas of the car and will be more apparent,” he said.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851059,"Gaudreau scores two SHGs, Wild beat Avalanche 4-2","DENVER (AP) — Frederick Gaudreau scored two short-handed goals, Filip Gustavsson stopped 39 shots, and the Minnesota Wild beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-2 Wednesday night.Marcus Johansson and Sam Steel also scored for the Wild, who improved to 16-1-4 in their last 21 games and moved three points ahead of Colorado and Dallas atop the Central Division.Bowen Byram and Lars Eller scored for the Avalanche, who lost for just the 10th time in their last 34 games (24-7-3). Alexandar Georgiev finished with 25 saves.Despite outshooting the Wild by a 44-29 margin, including a 19-4 advantage in the third period, the Avalanche struggled throughout the night to outmaneuver Gustavsson, who leads the NHL in save percentage and goals against average since Nov. 19.“It’s so much fun being back there and having that pressure that you can make such a big difference,” Gustavsson said. “I think that’s why I started playing goalie in the first place.”The first three Minnesota goals came after crucial miscues by Colorado.An errant pass from Georgiev from behind his own net set up Johansson’s goal just 3:24 into the first period. After Byram tied it midway through the opening period, a battle for a lost puck in front of the Colorado net resulted in a backhanded goal from Steel with about four minutes left in the period. Gaudreau scored just 14 seconds into a Colorado power play at 9:10 of the second period to push the Wild's lead to 3-1.“It’s a game of mistakes,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “We made some big ones. We didn’t make a lot of them, but we made some big ones and they capitalized on them. That turns out for me to be the difference in the hockey game.”Eller scored to get the Avalanche within one with 6:19 remaining in the third, but Gaudreau sealed the win with a short-handed empty-netter with 33 seconds remaining as the Wild improved to 30-0-2 when leading after two periods.“We knew coming in it would be a tough game,” Gaudreau said. “The crowd was very loud. It was a fun game to play in. It feels good. The thing that feels the best is I think we did it the right way. We were focused for the whole game. It’s fun to get the result from an effort like that.”Colorado had won the previous two meetings between the teams this season, both of which came on the road. The loss snapped a 12-game streak in which the Avalanche had at least one power-play goal, the franchise’s second-longest run since it moved to Denver in 1995.“To start the game, they were more competitive than we were,” Bednar said. “I felt like we had some passengers for the first period-plus. When you’re playing a game like this, a playoff-style game, you can’t have passengers.”NOTES: RWs Brandon Duhaime (non-COVID illness) and Ryan Reaves (upper-body injury) were scratches for Minnesota. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851060,Thailand uses helicopters to fight mountain wildfires,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thai authorities used helicopters Thursday to try to contain a fire that overnight engulfed two mountains on largely undeveloped forest land in a province northeast of the capital Bangkok.The fire broke out Wednesday night in Nakhon Nayok province, 114 kilometers (70 miles) northeast of Bangkok, but firefighters could not directly tackle it because the mountains are too steep to safely climb, especially in the darkness of night, provincial Governor Bancha Chaowarin told reporters.“Apart from the wind’s direction, I also have to look after the lives and safety of those conducting the operation. After reviewing the situation, since it is at a mountaintop, we had to retreat to standby and convene over what we can do,” Bancha said late Wednesday night.At least 10 firefighting vehicles were dispatched to battle the blaze, and they were joined Thursday afternoon by at least two helicopters, which surveyed the situation and dumped water.Initial efforts to contain the blaze had concentrated on creating firebreaks.Bancha was quoted by the newspaper Thai Rath as saying it was initially estimated the fire could be brought under control within five days, but that he would try to do it in just three.Other forest fires have broken out in recent days in provinces farther north as seasonal temperatures rise, a perennial problem that contributes to dangerously high levels of air pollution.About 700 rai (about 275 acres, or 112 hectares) of forest in Nakhon Nayok had been burned by noon Thursday as the fire continued to smolder, Bancha said.The fire began on a high part of Khao Chaplu mountain and then spread to the adjacent Khao Laem mountain. Local media said it burned easily because much of the growth was bamboo, and high winds fanned the flames.The mountains sit in a vast parcel of land not far from one of the country’s best known nature reserves, Khao Yai National Park. Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, Thailand’s version of West Point, is close to where the fire broke out and a village of about 500 residents is about 1 kilometer (half a mile) from the fire site, Thai Rath reported. Residents were warned to alert officials about any wild animals they saw fleeing the burning forest.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was closely monitoring the situation and had ordered officials and the army to mobilize to stop the fire’s spread, government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said.He added that Prayuth ordered officials to watch for anyone deliberately lighting fires to clear land for farming and other purposes, a practice that has been blamed for past fires. The cause of the fire in Nakhon Nayok was not yet clear, though some local media reports said it was set off by lightning.Bancha was quoted by Thai Rath as saying a storm on Tuesday ignited a fire nearby that strong winds blew to the Khao Laem area.Separate forest fires have been raging farther north, Anucha noted, including in Chiang Mai province, where water was dumped from the air Wednesday in an effort the dowse the flames.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851061,China e-commerce giant Alibaba outlines future strategy,"HONG KONG (AP) — Alibaba plans to spin off some of its sprawling e-commerce and finance empire as independent businesses to make them more flexible and maximize their value, its top executives said Thursday, as the company emerges from regulatory crackdowns that rattled Chinese tech industries.Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang outlined details of a plan announced earlier this week to split Alibaba into six main groups as a prelude toward stock listings of some of its companies. The restructuring marks a new stage in Alibaba’s growth after a series of setbacks as regulators tightened oversight of the industry.Alibaba, whose headquarters is in the eastern city of Hangzhou, will be “in the nature of a holding company that is the controlling shareholder of the business group companies,” Zhang said in a conference call.Alibaba's CFO, Toby Xu, said the company would continue to evaluate the strategic importance of group companies after they go public and decide whether or not to retain control. He declined to say when they might go public.“We believe the market is the best litmus test, so each business group company can pursue independent fundraising and IPOs as and when they are ready,” Xu said.Alibaba’s stock prices in Hong Kong and New York have rallied nearly 15% since the restructuring was announced Tuesday. The firm’s Hong Kong-listed stock was up 0.9% by midday Thursday.The plan, and the recent return of Alibaba founder Jack Ma to China after months abroad appear to mark a turnaround after several hard years. Chinese regulators singled out Alibaba for scrutiny in a crackdown on technology and internet companies, putting the brakes on a planned initial public offering in 2020 of Alibaba’s financial affiliate Ant Group.Ma had kept a low profile with few public appearances since Nov. 2020, when he had publicly criticized China’s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai.Ant had been set to raise $34.5 billion in what would have been the world’s largest share offering at the time. Alibaba was later investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules as Chinese authorities cracked down on the once-freewheeling technology industry.Alibaba is to split into its Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Business Group, Local Services Group, Global Digital Business Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each group apart from Taobao Tmall could potentially seek an initial public offering. Taobao Tmall will remain wholly-owned by Alibaba Group.Zhang said he expected the shake-up to be challenging but would also “allow all of our businesses to become more agile, enhance their decision making and enable faster responses to market changes.""Among other things, the restructuring plan might allay past antitrust concerns, since as Zhang explained, each Alibaba business unit would be empowered to make its own decisions and raise capital independently.“The looser connections between the business units is in line with the regulatory stance of encouraging competition,” said an analyst’s note from Moody’s Investor Service.Alibaba's restructure — the first such major overhaul in the Chinese technology industry — also could serve as an example for similar companies such as online games company Tencent to follow suit. Tencent's shares rallied after Alibaba's announcement on Monday.“We think that Alibaba’s new organizational structure could be used by Chinese regulators as a template for other Chinese Big Tech firms,” said a report by CreditSights.Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong, said that in the short term Alibaba's move will likely allow the group to raise more capital. But it might be more difficult for the company to stay competitive in mergers and acquisitions.“When you split into six business units, you'd just be a lightweight competing against the heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Alphabet,"" Lun said.He pointed out that only Alibaba's e-commerce and cloud units were profitable and that in the long-term, the other units may not succeed.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851062,Israel's Palestinians mostly sit out democracy protests,"HAIFA, Israel (AP) — Amal Oraby is usually a fixture at street protests. But as tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated for months against a contentious government plan to overhaul the judiciary, Oraby is sitting this one out.An activist and lawyer, Oraby is one of the many Palestinian citizens of Israel who have stayed on the sidelines of some of the country’s largest and most sustained demonstrations — a glaring absence in a movement that says it aims to preserve the country's democratic ideals.“I don’t see myself there,” Oraby said.As minorities long plagued by systemic discrimination, Palestinian Israelis have potentially the most to lose if the plan, which would likely weaken the judiciary's independence, is implemented.But the community harbors a deep sense that the system is already rigged against it and always has been — and sees the demonstrations as an exclusively Jewish movement unwilling to include issues that matter to Palestinians and blind to the longstanding injustices against them.The patriotic hallmarks of the movement have only reinforced for many Palestinian Israelis that there is no place for them: the ubiquitous Star of David flag, the national anthem about the yearning of the Jewish soul for Israel, and the heavy participation of former officials from the military, an institution Palestinian citizens view with suspicion, if not hostility.“In this demonstration, we don’t talk about occupation. We don’t talk about racism. We don’t talk about discrimination,” said Sami Abou Shehadeh, a former legislator in Israel’s parliament. “And they call it a struggle for democracy.”Organizers say they have repeatedly invited Palestinian Israelis to participate but are keeping their message focused tightly on the overhaul.The massive, monthslong demonstrations and a general strike forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week to postpone the overhaul. But he did not scrap it, and the protests are expected to continue.The plan as it currently stands would give the government control over who becomes a judge and limit judicial review on its decisions and legislation. Netanyahu's government says the proposal would ease the lawmaking process and rein in a judiciary that it sees as having liberal sympathies.Critics say it would damage the country’s system of checks and balances — and it galvanized opposition from a broad range of Israeli society, including leading economists, top legal officials and even the military.While the protesters say their aim is to safeguard the Supreme Court, seen by Jews as a bulwark against tyranny, Palestinian Israelis see the court as having failed them repeatedly. They have long viewed Israel’s democracy as tainted by both the country’s treatment of them and its 55-year, open-ended occupation of lands the Palestinians seek for an independent state.Israel's Palestinian citizens, who make up one-fifth of its 9.6 million people, have the right to vote and have Arab representatives in parliament, with one Arab party even recently joining a governing coalition for the first time — but they have long suffered discrimination in a range of spheres, from housing to jobs.Descendants of Palestinians who remained within the borders of what became Israel, they are seen by many Jewish Israelis as a fifth column because of their ties and solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.While Palestinian Israelis have in many cases risen to the highest echelons of government, academia, and business, the population as a whole is poorer and less educated than Jewish Israelis.In their criticism of the Supreme Court, Palestinian Israelis point to a 2021 decision to uphold a contentious law that defines the country as the nation-state of the Jewish people, a law they claim discriminates against minorities. They say the court generally permits Israel to build on occupied land and regularly allows Israel to demolish the homes of Palestinian attackers.Still, as a minority, they could have even more to lose were Israel to become more illiberal, said Muhammed Khalaily, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.Existing protections could be threatened. A senior member of Netanyahu’s government, for instance, once called for segregated maternity wards.That grim potential future hasn't been enough to draw them into the protests.Having watched their own rights attacked over the years, some in the community feel a sense of betrayal that Jewish Israelis never rallied against those injustices with the same fervor they have exhibited over the last three months.“Where were you? Where were you during our struggle?” asked Oraby, the activist.Protest organizer Shir Nosatzki said she recognized the complexities keeping Palestinian Israelis away, but added the movement has reached out to the community repeatedly and has had a growing number of Palestinians speak at the protests.“There is no other group in Israeli society that's been the target of so much effort to rope it into the protest,” said Nosatzki, who also heads a group fostering Jewish-Arab political partnerships.But the reality is less welcoming for some. Former military officials have been constant presences, boasting of their battle achievements against Palestinians and others, claims that are painful for Palestinian Israelis to hear.A small contingent of left-wing Israelis who oppose the occupation has been ostracized by other protesters for waving the Palestinian flag and trying to raise the Palestinian issue in the protests, for fear that it might push more nationalist Israelis away or be used by opponents to smear the protests as a cover for radical leftists.The issue did elbow its way in after a rampage by West Bank Jewish settlers through a Palestinian town, Hawara, and what critics said was a muted response to it by Israeli security services. Protesters shouted at police: “Where were you in Hawara?” That became a recurring chant against the heightened police presence throughout the protests.Some Palestinians support attending the protests, if only as a platform to share their perspective. Others have tried to piggyback on the demonstrations, creating their own movement demanding Israel treat all citizens equally.Reem Hazzan, a political activist, said she accepted an invitation to speak at a protest last month in the northern city of Haifa but backed out at the last minute after she said organizers asked for changes to her speech, saying it was not the right tone for the demonstration. Nosatzki said all speakers submit their speeches in for review, which tends to cause tensions.“It is a struggle that is lacking when it doesn’t discuss the root of the problems,"" Hazzan said. ""The real invitation for Arab citizens will be genuine when these protests will come and say, ’Friends, we want to build a future together, without occupation, with peace and with equality.'""",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851105,Taiwan not ready for human composting to promote green burial,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan is not introducing neo-environmentally-friendly burial methods anytime soon as it observes the upcoming Tomb Sweeping Festival, or Qingming Festival.Taiwan is not ready for innovative burial approaches such as human composting, said Tang Ken-shen (唐根深), an official at the Interior Ministry’s Department of Civil Affairs. Customs aside, the criminal code will need to be amended concerning the handling of corpses for such practices to be legalized, Environmental Information Center quoted Tang as saying.Human composting, or terramation, entails turning a body into soil by mixing it with substances like straw and wood chips until it is decomposed by thermophile microbes.Natural burial is gaining popularity in Taiwan, which has seen a tenfold surge in this alternative to burying or cremating human remains over the past decade. A total of 18,949 such practices were recorded in 2021, accounting for 10% of the total. In 2011, there were only 1,765 cases, per the interior ministry.Tree and flower burials are the most common forms of eco-friendly burial in Taiwan, accounting for over 90% in 2021, the latest available data. Other options include disposing of cremated human remains in the ocean and designated parks or greens.Taipei boasts some of the most scenic tree burial facilities, teeming with a variety of plants, including one on Yangmingshan. According to the city’s Mortuary Service Office, family members of the deceased will bring flowers and even play musical instruments when they pay respects to the dead.The vessel will be packed with wood chips and straw and will be able to compost a body in six months.

He said consumption and investment picked up and “market expectations improved.”Chinese retail sales rose 3.5% over a year earlier in January and February, recovering from December’s 1.8% contraction, government data showed earlier. Spending on restaurants rose 9.2%. Growth in investment in real estate and other fixed assets accelerated to 5.5% from December’s 5.1%.Li's audience included Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.A former Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, Li took office earlier this month in a once-a-decade change of government that installed loyalists of Chinese leader Xi Jinping to enforce his vision of tighter political control over the economy and society.The premier sought to counter unease about growing state dominance in the economy and tension with the United States over security, technology and trade.“No matter how the world situation may evolve, we will stay committed to reform, opening up and innovation-driven development,” Li said. “We welcome countries around the world to share in the opportunities and benefits that come with China’s development.”Li called China a global “anchor of peace,” a statement that conflicts with the ruling Communist Party's military buildup and menacing behavior toward Taiwan, Japan and other neighbors.The military budget, the world's second-largest after the United States, was increased this month for a 29th straight year.

Not this early in the year.The forest fire that that broke out last Thursday near the village of Villanueva de Viver surprised Rubio and fire experts by displaying an unusual ferocity for spring, when in previous years lower temperatures helped keep fires manageable. That doesn't bode well for a country that led Europe in burned land during a record-hot 2022.“I was expecting a fire like the ones we normally see in March, which can consume 100, 200 hectares, not the more than 4,300 hectares (11,600 acres) that this one has burned,” Rubio, 39, told The Associated Press hours before going back into the fray. “We are dealing with weather conditions appropriate for the summer and have a fire that is behaving like a summertime fire.”The Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average due to climate change caused by the release of greenhouse gases. The effects, European and Spanish officials agree, are already being seen in the multiple heat waves and the prolonged drought that Spain has endured over several months.Those conditions have turned Spain’s vast expanses of woods into a tinderbox just waiting for the random lightning strike, spark from a tractor or saw, negligently cast cigarette, or act of arson to ignite the landscape.Some 267,000 hectares (666,000 acres) burned last year in Spain, making 2022 its worst year of fire destruction since 1994, government statistics say. That was three times the national average for the past decade of 94,000 hectares (232,000 acres). According to the European Union’s Copernicus satellite observation service, Spain accounted for 35% of all burned land in European wildfires in 2022.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned of worse to come unless some desperately needed rain comes to the rescue, on his visit to the country’s first major fire of the year.“Unfortunately, over the last few years these fires are becoming normal. What is not so normal is that we see them in March,” Sánchez said on Monday. “This has a lot to do with the climate emergency that the world is facing.”The fire has forced the evacuation of nearly 1,400 people from their homes in Villanueva de Viver and other small villages in the hilly, rural provinces of Castellon and Teruel. Like many parts of Spain's interior, the regions have shrinking, and aging populations.Some 4,600 hectares of forest that authorities deem of “high ecological value” have gone up in huge plumes of smoke. Five hundred firefighters, supported by 20 water-dumping aircraft, battle on to protect a nearby nature reserve.To make things tougher for Rubio and his fellow firefighters, the area is full of tiny villages that are surrounded by trees, making them difficult to protect. A generation ago, the lands were tended to by the villagers. Now that younger generations have abandoned those agricultural jobs, which included collecting firewood, the land is overgrown with dense foliage that fuels fires when dry.Rubio said that the area’s vegetation, mainly made up of small pine trees typical of the Mediterranean, and brush, which is very dense, combined with abnormally high temperatures and well-under-average rainfall produced the perfect conditions for the fire. In this part of Castellon, only 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell during the winter months, when the average is over 100 (4 inches).France, too, saw surprisingly early forest fires this year, after having several major fires in 2022 like Spain. Amid a record-breaking stretch of winter drought across France, wildfires broke out in February near Avignon in the southeast, in the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the Charente-Maritime region on the Atlantic coast.The spokesperson for Spain’s weather service, Rubén del Campo, warned Wednesday that higher temperatures, reaching 5-10 degrees Celsius (9-18 degrees Fahrenheit) above average, were forecast for Castellon and the rest of eastern Spain in the coming days. He said the expected temperatures are “normally seen in mid-to-late May.”“The rising temperatures combined with westerly winds, which reach the Mediterranean hot and dry, cause the relative humidity to fall, and the risk of wildfires goes up dramatically,” Del Campo said.More fires flared up across northern Spain on Thursday. Over 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres) were scorched in the northwest province of Lugo, while authorities in the Asturias region reported over 97 different fires that forced at least 20 people to evacuate their homes.Army firefighting units were deployed to all three areas to help extinction efforts.The situation north of the fire in Spain’s Catalonia, which borders with France, is also incredibly delicate, and authorities are bracing for the worst.The region home to Barcelona is suffering its worst drought on record and temperatures beat yearly averages by a full 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) last year. The director of Catalonia weather service, Sarai Sarroca, said Wednesday that their climate models hadn't expected such a huge surge in temperature until the year 2050.Sarroca said that one cause of the drought is the collapse of strong, humid winds that usually blow over the Pyrenees Mountains and help produce snow and rain in the winter.For Juli Pausas, a specialist in fire ecology who researches desertification for the Spanish National Research Council, this was all sadly predictable.He said that with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Castellon fire and a lack of rainfall, “we now have 20th century vegetation in a 21st century climate.""“We are in climatic conditions that favor big fires,” Pausas told the AP. “We have known for a long time that the climate is changing, and we have known that this would have consequences, including more wildfires, yet we haven't done enough to stop it.”___Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",2023/03/30,,World

Oil prices declined.Wall Street rose Thursday as worries about the global financial system eased following the collapse of two U.S. banks and one in Switzerland.Traders hope a measure of U.S. inflation due out Friday that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve will show upward pressure on prices easing. That might prompt the Fed to postpone plans for a possible rate hike at its May meeting.A softer inflation reading would be a “signal to continue with the risk-on theme,"" said Tim Waterer of Kohle Capital Markets in a report.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.3% to 3,269.83 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1.1% to 20,532.33.The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 1% to 28,046.75 after government data showed factory output rebounded and retail sales rose in February.The Kospi in Seoul added 0.9% to 2,475.69 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was 0.8% higher at 7,176.00.New Zealand declined while Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia advanced.Traders were rattled by this month's bank failures but regulators appear to have calmed fears by promising lending measures if needed to keep other institutions stable after repeated rate hikes caused prices of bonds and other assets on their books to fall.Markets have shifted focus back to uncertainty about the global economic outlook as the Fed and other central banks try to extinguish inflation.Traders have begun betting the Fed will be forced to cut rates as early as mid-year to shore up economic growth. That is despite statements by Fed officials that they plan to raise rates one more time before holding them steady into at least early 2024.The Fed's key lending rate stands at a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from close to zero at the start of last year.On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.6% on Thursday to 4,050.83 for its fifth gain in six days.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 32,859.03. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.7%, to 12,013.47.Expectations for easier rates in turn have helped to buoy the Big Tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500 and other indexes.Amazon rose 1.7% on Thursday, while Apple and Microsoft also rose.A report Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. That could be a sign of increased layoffs, but the number is low compared with historical levels.In a separate report, the government revised down its estimate for how much the U.S. economy grew during the last three months of 2022. But it also still showed growth.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude shed 6 cents to $74.31 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.40 on Thursday to $74.37. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, lost 16 cents to $78.44 per barrel in London. It advanced 99 cents the previous session to $79.27.The dollar gained to 132.93 yen from Thursday's 132.47 yen. The euro was little-changed at $1.0903.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851123,Taiwan sees less severe China reaction to president's US meeting,"TAIPEI, March 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan expects a less severe reaction from China to an expected meeting between President Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and has not seen any unusual Chinese military movements, a senior Taiwan security official said on Thursday.
Tsai arrived in New York on Wednesday on her way to Central America, and will stop off in Los Angeles next week on her way back to Taipei.
While in California she is expected to meet McCarthy. China has threatened unspecified retaliation if she meets him.
Speaking in parliament, Taiwan National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Ming-yen said the government expected a less severe reaction to that meeting than when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came to Taipei and China staged war games around Taiwan after she left.
""We believe that the actions the Chinese communists might take are unlikely to go as far as being as large as when Pelosi visited last August,"" said Tsai, who shares a common family name with the president but is not related.
""She will be meeting in the United States, so the political complexity is not as high as the speaker coming to Taiwan.""
Taiwan's defence ministry, in its daily update on China's military activities, said that from Wednesday to Thursday morning it had not spotted any Chinese aircraft entering Taiwan's air defence zone or crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which serves as an unofficial barrier.
China's air force flies almost daily into the air defence zone, or across the median line, in which Taiwan calls ""grey zone"" warfare designed to test and wear out its forces.
Tsai said they had been conducting dry runs for what to do to respond to a rise in tensions while the president is away, including when she is flying, and that she can be reached at any time to meet her top security officials.
Speaking to the Taiwanese community in New York on Wednesday, the president reiterated that Taiwan has shown, when faced with difficulties, it neither provokes nor gives in to pressure, the official Central News Agency reported.
""Taiwan has the ability to maintain regional peace and stability, and moreover is determined to protect the values we adhere to and the way we live,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851156,Whistleblower says Taiwan courting Ghana as possible ally,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei is courting the African nation of Ghana to establish diplomatic relations, according to an anonymous whistleblower with alleged connections to Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).UDN reported on Thursday (March 30) that MOFA dispatched Chang Chun-yu (張均宇) to serve as director of the Taipei Trade Office in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2022, with the additional directive of establishing contact with government officials in Ghana. According to the UDN source, Taipei hoped to establish ties with Ghana prior to severing ties with Honduras, which had been anticipated.

Chang was ostensibly sent to Lagos to take over for envoy Liu Yi-ping (劉翼平) in early 2022. However, Chang and Liu continued to serve in the same ministerial position in Lagos for over a year.The whistleblower asked why MOFA would station two high-level ministers at a trade office for so long. They suggested that there was other diplomatic work being done in the region, outside of Nigeria.The most extraordinary claim of the whistleblower is that MOFA allegedly paid a Taiwanese business executive, surnamed Huang (黃), to act as a broker with the Ghanaian government. The anonymous source claims that Taiwan paid a fee of US$20 million (NT$610 million) to start talks about establishing diplomatic relations with Accra, but that nothing has yet come from the expenditure.In response to the UDN report, MOFA called the claims completely fictitious. It accused the whistleblower of starting malicious rumors that would be echoed by pro-China media to defame Taiwan. MOFA said the details of the report do not match the facts, and condemned the allegations.Ghana has experienced some diplomatic friction with China over the years and is reportedly seeking international aid in settling or restructuring Accra’s debts to Beijing. Some recent reports suggest that there is public dissatisfaction among the Ghanaian public with regard to China’s economic activity in the region, and its exploitation of Ghana’s natural resources.This week, U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris visited Ghana, where she met with political leaders and pledged security and economic assistance to Ghana and Central Africa. Harris’ trip is reportedly intended to balance U.S. power vis-a-vis China, as the two countries compete for economic and diplomatic influence across the mineral-rich continent.",2023/03/30,3336,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851158,President Tsai highlights Taiwan's progress at welcome banquet,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) praised the progress Taiwan has made in the post-pandemic era at a welcome banquet in New York City on Wednesday (March 29).
Speaking to the local Taiwanese community, Tsai said Taiwan has changed in three important ways, CNA reported.
The first change is that Taiwan has become more resilient one step at a time, Tsai said. The government has increased tax revenue and invested in many policies and construction projects, while social welfare, childcare, and elderly care have been carried out diligently.
Special budgets have been set up to help small and medium sized businesses and disadvantaged groups. Through tough times, the nation is moving toward economic recovery, she said.










Taiwan's military and national defense have also been strengthened, Tsai added.
The second change is the increased global attention Taiwan is getting, the president pointed out. In the past three years, the nation’s pandemic prevention measures have received praise from the world.
In times of difficulty, many countries helped Taiwan, demonstrating that democratic partners work together to create a “cycle of goodness,” she said.
The third change is Taiwan’s significant strides in diplomacy and its deepening ties with the U.S., Tsai said. Over the past three years, Taipei and Washington have made major progress in bilateral exchanges, trade, and security.
Taiwan does not provoke or give in to international pressure, the president said. “Taiwan demonstrates its will and determination to defend itself, and demonstrates composure, calmness, and risk control.”
Tsai added that Taiwan is at the forefront of the world's democratic front. The more united the Taiwanese, the safer the world will be.
She vowed that Taiwan would continue to walk on the path of freedom and democracy.
American Institute in Taiwan Chair Laura Rosenberger also delivered remarks, saying that the U.S. is working hard to establish a global partnership that includes Taiwan. This includes providing assistance programs to Taiwan’s partners, allowing Taiwan to meaningfully participate in international organizations and multilateral forums, and working closely with like-minded partners to help them know more about Taiwan.
Rosenberg said that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the core of America’s regional policy. It is not only crucial to regional security and prosperity, but also to global security and prosperity.
She thanked Tsai for her commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851168,Taiwan CECC head rebukes Ma's claim of 'China's contribution to humanity' in Wuhan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) head Victor Wang (王必勝) on Thursday (March 30) rebuffed former President Ma Ying-jeou’s (馬英九) claim that China's alleged early control of the COVID outbreak in Wuhan was a ""contribution to humanity,"" and defended his center's response to the pandemic.On Wednesday (March 29), Ma paid a visit to a museum in Wuhan extolling the virtues of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) handling of the COVID outbreak. When he came upon an exhibit titled ""Taiwan Compatriots Assisting Epidemic Prevention Zone,"" the guide claimed that some Taiwanese in Wuhan at the start of the outbreak were stranded because they had been traveling as tourists and wanted to leave Hubei and Wuhan as soon as possible.After the first batch of Taiwanese returned to their hometowns, the guide alleged that the Chinese government originally planned to send the rest of the ""Taiwanese compatriots"" back to Taiwan on Feb. 5 and 6. However, the guide purported that the remaining flights were ""blocked by Democratic Progressive Party authorities, making it difficult for Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan to return home.""The guide claimed that it was only after continuous efforts by the Chinese government that all Taiwanese were sent back to their hometowns by April 21. After listening to the guide's story, Ma turned to Zhang Dingyu (張定宇), the head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which was one of the first hospitals to deal with the disease, and said, ""I'm sorry that our government has caused you trouble.""In addition, Ma said that under the leadership of Zhang, the epidemic was initially controlled to prevent it from expanding significantly. ""We admire this very much. This was not just for Mainland China, but rather was a contribution to humanity as a whole,"" Ma said.When asked to comment on Ma's remarks in Wuhan during a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Wang said ""From his own (Ma's) perspective as a Chinese, since it is a Chinese point of view, we respect him."" However, regarding China's alleged contributions, he bluntly said, ""What exactly was their contribution? This pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole world, causing 700 million people to be infected and more than seven million people to die. Of course, we know that the number is greatly underestimated.""Wang went on to say, ""I don't understand what contribution (was made), but what I do know is that this was a catastrophe for humanity.""Regarding potential future exchanges with counterparts in China, Wang said that future medical and health exchanges and professional exchanges between the two sides of the strait are very much anticipated and welcome.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851169,Taipei metro malfunction results in train skipping three stops,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Metro Taipei malfunction caused a train to skip three stops on Thursday morning (March 30), much to commuters’ confusion and worry.The incident was shared to online forum PTT by user Huang Shin-wen, who wrote that at around 8:30 a.m., the train drove past the Nangang Software Park Station and Donghu Station. A passenger then pressed the emergency communication button to alert train operators.“We had already passed two stations without stopping, but it sounded like the control center had not realized any abnormality. They even asked us where we were at the moment,” Huang wrote.He added that as the train approached Huzhou Station, it finally slowed down. “It seemed that the control center finally intervened and started operating it. However, perhaps because they were too slow or there was an issue with manual operation, when the train stopped it was past the platform…,"" Huang explained.According to Huang, when the train’s doors finally opened again, it was at Dahu Park Station.Huang questioned that, considering the high frequency of trains on the Wenhu Line during rush hour, if a fellow passenger train had not alerted the control center staff about the incident, “Would the control center only realize what was going on only after we hit the previous train?”In response to the incident and Huang’s concern, Metro Taipei wrote in a press release that all trains on the Wenhu Line are equipped with automatic train protection (ATP) technology, which ensures a safe distance between each train. At the time of the incident, the train’s ATP had been functional, it added.The company apologized for the malfunction and vowed to investigate. It stressed that there were no systemic delays during the incident, writing that the feature controlling the train’s stopping at stations had been switched off, though it did not specify why.(YouTube, Huang Shin-wen video)",2023/03/30,1502,Society

The global sales of trucks and buses has seen a major boost over the past few years owing to the rising need for commercial transportation. This has consequently resulted in a surge in the demand for truck and bus radial (TBR) tires, which are designed primarily for use on commercial vehicles. Trucks have a much higher volume of sales as compared to buses and hence, contribute significantly to the overall demand for OE & aftermarket TBR tires. This can be attributed to their increased usage in the transportation of goods and materials across various industries.










It is estimated that in 2022, the global truck industry recorded a total sales volume of 19.4 million units, whereas the global bus industry registered a total sales volume of 1.4 million units. As far as the sales channels for truck and bus TBR tires are concerned, the aftermarket segment of the global truck and bus tires market accounts for the bulk of global sales. This can be attributed to the fact that truck and bus tires are prone to wear and tear due to heavy usage and therefore, require frequent replacements.
When it comes to the leading regions with the highest sales volumes in the truck & bus radial (TBR) tire market, Asia Pacific currently holds the top spot. This can be attributed to the presence of many developing countries such as India and China, which are home to major truck and bus manufacturers. Moreover, the rising population in these countries has also been a major driver for the growth of the truck & bus radial (TBR) tire market in the region. It has been estimated that in 2022, the Asia Pacific region accounted for around 62% of the overall global sales in the truck & bus radial (TBR) tire market.
More than 75% Revenue of Global Truck and Bus Tires Market Comes from Aftermarket Sales
The global truck & bus radial (TBR) tire market has grown significantly in recent years. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for commercial transport vehicles, rising need for fuel efficiency, and growing awareness of safety among consumers. However, the aftermarket segment accounted for a major share in the overall global sales in the truck & bus radial tire market, estimated at around 76.0% in 2022. This can be attributed to the rise in the average age of vehicles, which has increased the demand for aftermarket services and products. According to data from the Global Automotive Aftermarket Report 2022, the average age of cars and light trucks stood at 11.3 years in 2020, and is expected to be 12.2 years by 2030.
The rise of e-commerce platforms in the global truck and bus tires market, such as Amazon and Flipkart, has resulted in an increase in the aftermarket sales of truck and bus tires. In the US, the sale of truck and bus tires in the aftermarket is estimated to reach around 57 million units in 2023. The increasing demand for light trucks, buses, and trailers is driving the market in the US.
Furthermore, government policies are also contributing to the growth of the aftermarket segment. For instance, in India, the government has set up several initiatives, such as Make in India, to promote local manufacturing and exports. This has led to an increase in the availability of auto components and other related products in the domestic market, thus driving the growth of the aftermarket segment. Additionally, in the U.S., the government has provided incentives to encourage the sale of electric and hybrid vehicles, thereby boosting the demand for aftermarket services and products in the country.

The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth. The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the Hydrofluoroether industry.The global Hydrofluoroether market held a market size of USD 120.65 Million in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 204.34 Million by 2027. The hydrofluoroether market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% over the assessment period. The market size by volume for Hydrofluoroether was 6,470.7 Tons in 2020.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS109Hydrofluoroether (HFE) has attributes such as chemical inertness, non flammability, low toxicity, zero ozone depletion potential (ODP), and non-corrosiveness. HFEs are being utilized as third-generation replacements to hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) due to their relatively low global warming potential and nearly zero stratospheric ozone depletion. The demand for HFEs as cleaning solvent is anticipated to surge owing to the increasing requirement of precision cleaning processes in the medical, aerospace, military, and analytical equipment industries.In addition, as authorities across the globe are passing guidelines on reducing the utilization of hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbon and chlorofluorocarbons, the demand for HFEs in heat transfer solutions, aerosol formulation, and lubricants is expected to increase at a considerable rate. For instance, in October 2016, with the leadership of the United States, an amendment to phase down HFCs under Montreal Protocol was adopted by 197 countries. The countries committed to cut the production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80% over the next 30 years, under this amendment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851229,Ukraine updates: Orthodox monks in Kyiv refuse eviction,"Orthodox monks who've been ordered out of a monastery in Kyiv refused to leave on Wednesday, as a deadline to vacate the complex expired.The dispute over the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery, Ukraine's most revered Orthodox site, is part of a wider religious conflict playing out in parallel with the war.The monks using the property belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), which has been accused of links to Russia.But the site is owned by the Ukrainian government, and the agency overseeing the property notified the UOC earlier this month that, as of March 29, it was terminating the lease.Metropolitan Pavel, an abbot of the monastic complex, told worshippers that the UOC would not leave the site pending the outcome of a lawsuit it filed in a Kyiv court last week to stop the eviction.No attempts to evict the monks were made on Wednesday but Pavel said the UOC had been notified that the handover of the property would begin on Thursday.The Ukrainian government has been cracking down on the UOC over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Thursday, March 30:Alexei Moskalyov, who was sentenced to two years in prison for discrediting the Russian military and whose daughter was taken into state care, has been detained after fleeing house arrest, human rights activist and lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov told Reuters news agency on Thursday.Moskalyov was prosecuted for social media posts following an anti-war drawing made by his daughter that depicted missiles flying over a Russian flag at a woman and child and said ""No to war"" and ""Glory to Ukraine.""Earlier, European Commission spokesman Peter Stano tweeted that Moskalyov's sentence was ""a total disgrace.""Russia will no longer give the US advance notice about its missile tests as envisioned under a nuclear pact the Kremlin has suspended, a senior Moscow diplomat said Wednesday.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies that Moscow has halted all information exchanges with Washington under the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US after suspending its participation in it last month.Along with the data about the current state of the countries' nuclear forces routinely released every six months in compliance with the New START treaty, the parties also had exchanged advance warnings about test launches and deployments of their nuclear weapons.Such notices have been an essential element of strategic stability for decades, allowing Russia and the United States to correctly interpret each other's moves and make sure that neither country mistakes a test launch for a missile attack.Meanwhile, as part of the Russian drills that began Wednesday, Yars mobile missile launchers will maneuver across three regions of Siberia, Russia's Defense Ministry said. The movements will involve measures to conceal the deployment from foreign satellites and other intelligence assets, the ministry said.Spain plans to supply Ukraine with 10 German-made Leopard battle tanks of the older 2A4 type — with six to arrive in the next two weeks — but will not send Kyiv fighter jets, Defense Minister Margarita Robles said.The other four tanks will have to be sent at a later date because they must undergo repairs to make them fit for service, she said during a parliamentary debate on Spanish military aid to Ukraine.The dispatch of fighter jets was ""categorically"" ruled out by the minister. She said Spain does not have F-16 fighter jets of the type Ukraine would like to obtain. Other models are out of the question because Ukrainian pilots would need a training period of up to two years, Robles argued in the lower house of parliament.Russian authorities said Ukrainian forces had struck a railway depot and knocked out power in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region.The city lies around 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the frontline and analysts have said it could be a target for a highly-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive.dh/sri (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851236,New rules and home games to have impact on IPL 2023,"NEW DELHI, India (AP) — The usual procession of global cricket stars like Virat Kohli and Ben Stokes will be reinforced by so-called impact players in the latest innovation for the Indian Premier League in Season 16.The biggest and richest franchise tournament in the sport is set to open Friday with the defending champion Gujarat Titans against four-time champion Chennai Super Kings.The 2023 edition will be a mix of the old and the new, returning to the home-and-away format across 70 matches in the first phase, with four knockouts to follow.The COVID-19 pandemic caused all kinds of scheduling issues for the trailblazing Twenty20 tournament.In 2020, the IPL was halted midway in April because of a coronavirus surge, and the second half was staged in the United Arab Emirates in September. The entire 2021 edition was staged in the UAE and last year, competition returned to India but under restrictions, with all games either in Mumbai or Pune until the knockout stage, when the venues shift to Kolkata and Ahmedabad.So there's tremendous buzz among Indian cricket fans as the IPL comes home for all 10 franchises.For context, the initial 65,000 tickets put on sale for the season-opening game between Gujarat and Chennai at Ahmedabad were sold out within hours. A sell-out crowd is expected for the 135,000-seat stadium.The Titans, led by Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya, won the title in their debut season. The franchise has the world’s foremost T20 bowler Rashid Khan on its books, and has further rejuvenated its squad by bringing in former New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson.Ahmedabad fans, like millions across India, will be hoping to catch a glimpse of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the former India captain who is a colossal figure for Chennai Super Kings.The 41-year-old Dhoni will be leading again after a failed experiment with a replacement captain last year, and there's increased speculation that this will be his last playing season. Chennai will be fielding a stronger squad with England’s test skipper Stokes and allrounder Moeen Ali in the group.Another England player in the spotlight is allrounder Sam Curran, who missed 2022 IPL because of injury but now returns for Punjab Kings as the most expensive player in 15 years. He was player of the tournament at the 2022 T20 World Cup, which England won.Allrounder Cameron Green enters the IPL for the first time with Mumbai Indians after playing a big role for Australia on the recent tour to India.Five-time champions Mumbai Indians, who finished last in the league in 2022, snapped up Green in one of the most lucrative deals in the this year's player auctions.As well as new players, there's a host of new rules for the 2023 season.The biggest one pertains to an Impact Player, giving teams a chance to bring in a substitute player at any time during the game. Any Indian player can act as an Impact Player, while an overseas player can only be used in the role if the team hasn't used the full quota in the starting XI. As a standard rule, IPL teams can contain a maximum of four overseas players in its starting lineup.For this purpose, the rules around the coin toss have been changed. Captains can now confirm a starting lineup after the toss, instead of before, depending on if they're batting or bowling first. Not everyone is convinced it's the best way forward.“This rule almost negates the role of allrounders,” Delhi Capitals head coach and former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. “Unless they are absolutely world class, and are getting picked either as batsman or bowler, not sort of bits and pieces guys, I don’t think we will see many teams this season who actually use allrounders that might bat at No. 7 and bowl an over or two. Because you don’t need those guys anymore.”In annother important change, a time penalty has been introduced to control over rates. Like in international T20 and one-day international cricket, the number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle will be reduced if the fielding team fails to finish its overs in the stipulated time. The IPL will also break new ground in terms of its broadcast. For the first time in Indian cricket, there will be two different broadcasters involved in taking the action to audiences.Disney Star retained television rights for the 2023-2027 period and Viacom18 entered into the market with digital rights for the same five-year cycle in deals that were worth about $6 billion for the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which runs the IPL.___ More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851237,"Pope showing 'marked improvement,' could leave hospital soon","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis showed a “marked improvement” Thursday after being given intravenous antibiotics for a bronchitis infection and could be released from the hospital in the coming days, the Vatican and his doctors reported.The 86-year-old pontiff, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, ate breakfast, read the newspapers, rested and worked from his hospital room at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni.An additional update provided late Thursday by doctors revealed Francis had been diagnosed with bronchitis. The infection “required the administration of antibiotic therapy on an infusion basis which produced the expected effects with a marked improvement in his state of health,” the doctors’ statement said.“Based on the expected course, the Holy Father could be discharged in the coming days,” it concluded.The timeframe brought into question Francis’ participation in Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter’s Square this weekend, as well as his presence during Holy Week activities. They include Holy Thursday, Good Friday, the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday on April 9.Francis was hospitalized Wednesday after having trouble breathing in recent days.It was the first time he had back to Gemelli since he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed and spent 10 days there in July 2021.Despite his absence, the Holy See was abuzz with activity Thursday: Two Vatican offices issued a historic statement repudiating the “Doctrine of Discovery,"" the legal theory backed by 15th century papal bulls that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands and form the basis of some property law today.And there was continued fallout over the sudden resignation of a founding member of the pope's sex abuse prevention board, with Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley pushing back against Rev. Hans Zollner's critiques in his remarkable resignation statement issued the previous day.He said soon after the intestinal surgery that he had recovered fully and could eat normally. But in a Jan. 24 interview with The Associated Press, Francis said his diverticulosis, or bulges in the intestinal wall, had “returned.”Francis has used a wheelchair for over a year due to strained ligaments in his right knee and a small knee fracture, though he had been walking more with a cane of late.Francis has said he resisted having surgery for the knee problems because he didn’t respond well to general anesthesia during the 2021 intestinal surgery.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851238,Alonso seeks 33rd Formula 1 win after 100 podium finishes,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — After claiming his 100th podium in Saudi Arabia in confusing and controversial circumstances, Fernando Alonso is looking for a better result at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix than his two third-place finishes so far this Formula One season.Maybe even his 33rd Formula One win, and first in 10 years.The Aston Martin driver was behind the Red Bull pair of Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez in the first two races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in what has been a one-sided championship so far.Alosno believes the championship will become more competitive as the season progresses but is pleased with how his Aston Martin is performing leading into the Melbourne race.Practice sessions for the Australian Grand Prix begin on Friday, with another session on Saturday prior to qualifying.“At the moment we are extremely happy with the performance of the car, obviously. It was better than expected, especially in Jeddah,” Alonso said. “We arrived here with a good level of confidence. But, as I said, after a few events from now on, I think the cars will change a lot in a few areas through development.”The 41-year-old Alonso became the sixth driver in Formula One to reach the 100-podium milestone when he finished third in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago in a race with a contentious postscript.The Aston Martin driver was hit with a 10-second penalty for being slightly out of position at the start, which dropped him to fourth behind Mercedes’ George Russell.Alonso was later reinstated to third after a successful appeal to FIA, arguing stewards had not informed Aston Martin of the penalty within the regulated timing.Russell said on Thursday it was a strange situation but believes the correct call was made.“Obviously it was the right decision. It was just a bit of a shame what a mess it was for everybody else,” Russell said. “I think from my side and our side, we didn’t feel like we deserved to finish in third position, but obviously it is quite a nice feeling when it is handed to you. But then when it is taken away, it was just all a bit silly.”Alonso said although “the situation in Jeddah was not ideal,” he still enjoyed the experience of celebrating the achievement on the podium prior to the stewards’ deliberations.As a result of the Jeddah situation, the grid box for the Australian Grand Prix and remaining races has been extended, with a center line added to help drivers start in the correct position.Alonso last won an F1 race in Spain in 2013, but his pair of podium finishes in 2023 have excited fans in his homeland, including No. 1- ranked tennis player and compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.Alcaraz dedicated a victory over Tommy Paul in the Miami Masters this week to the two-time world champion. After his triumph, Alcaraz wrote the words “33 soon” when signing off on the result on the broadcast camera lens. It prompted a friendly interaction between the pair on social media.“It is crazy to see how Spain is now so enthusiastic again for Formula One, for everything that is happening. This is very nice to see,” Alonso said. “Hopefully we can reach that number, 33, and then go for 34.”Verstappen, who leads the drivers’ championship by one point from Perez, believes Alonso is capable of ending the drought soon.“I think Fernando should have won a lot more races. He deserves to. I would be happy to see him win No. 33 but also in a way, I would like to see him win more,” he said.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851239,Cologne hit with FIFA transfer ban over youth player signing,"COLOGNE, Germany (AP) — German soccer club Cologne said FIFA has banned it from signing new players next season as punishment for breaking transfer rules in the case of a promising 17-year-old forward from Slovenia.Cologne said in a statement late Wednesday that it was accused of inciting Jaka Cuber Potocnik to break his contract with Olimpija Ljubljana in his home country.Cologne said a FIFA tribunal fined the club 51,750 euros ($56,100), banned it from signing new players in the next two transfer windows, and suspended Potocnik for four months.The club, which announced plans to appeal the verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, argues Potocnik left Olimpija because of “numerous breaches of contract"" and says it has evidence it did not incite him to leave.FIFA has not published any details of the case.Potocnik is considered one of the brightest young talents in German club soccer. He has scored 13 goals in as many games in the under-19 league for Cologne this season and has represented Slovenia's national under-19 team.In recent years, FIFA has stepped up efforts to enforce worldwide rules in the often cutthroat international transfer market, especially around the signing of players under the age of 18. Chelsea served a transfer ban for one window in 2019 after the sanction was reduced from two transfer windows on appeal.French club Marseille is in the process of appealing a ban imposed over its signing of Senegal midfielder Pape Gueye. English club Watford claims it had a valid agreement in place to sign Gueye before he moved to Marseille instead.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851240,9 killed in Army Black Hawk helicopter crash in Kentucky,"FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) — U.S. Army investigators are trying to determine what caused two Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopters to crash during a routine nightime training exercise in Kentucky, killing all nine soldiers aboard. No one was hurt on the ground.Nondice Thurman, a spokesperson for Fort Campbell, said the deaths happened Wednesday night in southwestern Kentucky during a routine training mission.A statement from Fort Campbell said the two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, part of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed around 10 p.m. Wednesday in Trigg County in southwest Kentucky. The 101st Airborne confirmed the crash about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Fort Campbell.One helicopter had five people aboard and the other had four, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, the 101st Airborne deputy commander, said Thursday. The helicopters crashed in a field near a residential area with no injuries on the ground, Lubas said.An Army spokesperson declined to comment on whether the helicopters collided in the air.""At this time, there is no determination on the specifics regarding the accident,” Daniel Matthews, a public affairs officer for the 101st Airborne Division, said in an emailed statement Thursday afternoon. Matthews said an aviation safety team from Fort Rucker, Alabama, will investigate the accident.Lubas said it is unclear what caused the crash.“This was a training progression, and specifically they were flying a multi-ship formation, two ships, under night vision goggles at night,"" Lubas said. He said officials believe the accident occurred when ""they were doing flying, not deliberate medical evacuation drills.”The helicopters have something similar to the black boxes on passenger planes, which records the performance of aircrafts in flight and are used by investigators to analyze crashes.“We’re hopeful that will provide quite a bit of information of what occurred,"" Lubas said.Speaking a news conference Thursday morning, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the state would do everything it can to support the families of those killed.“We’re going to do what we always do. We’re going to wrap our arms around these families, and we’re going to be there with them, not just for the days, but the weeks and the months and the years to come,” Beshear said.The Black Hawk helicopter is a critical workhorse for the U.S. Army and is used in security, transport, medical evacuations, search and rescue and other missions. The helicopters are known to many people from the 2001 movie “Black Hawk Down,” which is about a violent battle in Somalia eight years earlier.Black Hawks were a frequent sight in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan during the wars conducting combat missions and are also used by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. They were also often used to ferry visiting senior leaders to headquarters locations in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones.Fort Campbell is located near the Tennessee border, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Nashville, and the crash occurred in the Trigg County, Kentucky, community of Cadiz.Nick Tomaszewski, who lives about a mile from where the crash occurred, said he saw two helicopters flying over his house moments before the crash.“For whatever reason last night my wife and I were sitting there looking out on the back deck and I said 'Wow, those two helicopters look low and they look kind of close to one another tonight,’” he said.The helicopters flew over and looped back around and moments later “we saw what looked like a firework went off in the sky.”“All of the lights in their helicopter went out. It was like they just poofed ... and then we saw a huge glow like a fireball,” Tomaszewski said.Flyovers for training exercises happen almost daily and the helicopters typically fly low but not so close together, he said.“There were two back to back. We typically see one and then see another one a few minutes later, and we just saw two of them flying together last night,” he said.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered his condolences to the families of those killed.“My heart goes out to the families of these servicemembers and to the members of the 101st Airborne Division who bravely and proudly serve our country each and every day,"" Lloyd said in a statement.In the Kentucky House and in the Senate, members stood for a moment of silence Thursday morning in honor of the crash victims. Kentucky state Rep. Walker Thomas said the crash occurred about 15 to 20 minutes from his home.“They’re there to protect us,” Thomas said. “And we’re constantly seeing these helicopters flying over our communities.”Thomas spoke about how connected Fort Campbell soldiers and their families are to the communities near the Army post.“The Fort Campbell soldiers that live in our communities, go to our churches ... they go to our schools, their kids do,” he added. “And this really hurts.”By Thursday morning, word of the crash was spreading through the community of Clarksville, Tennessee, just outside Fort Campbell.Chaterra Watts, a former Army soldier who was stationed at Fort Campbell from about 2015 to 2019, said once she heard about the crash, she jumped on social media to try to find out more and if she knew any of the victims.“I pray for their friends and their families and just hope that we can all come together as a community and that something positive will come out of something so tragic,” Watts said.Last month, two Tennessee National Guard pilots were killed when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed along an Alabama highway during a training exercise.___Lovan and Reynolds reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851266,US House passes bill to combat China's unethical organ harvesting,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this week aimed at combating unethical organ harvesting by doctors and authorities in China.A press release from New Jersey representative Chris Smith, who authored the bill, said it is intended to target the “ghoulish industry of stealing young people’s internal organs,” which amounts to crimes against humanity. If signed into law, the bill, HR 1154, will require regular reports on organ transplantation in foreign countries, with a special focus on China, in order for a country to qualify for foreign assistance from the U.S.The bill will also require strict penalties, including sanctions as well as civil and criminal punishments, for individuals and organizations that are implicated in the unethical harvesting of internal organs. The bill also includes provisions for stronger checks to ensure organs brought to the U.S. for transplantation, or U.S. citizens going abroad for such procedures, do not involve organs forcibly harvested from unwilling victims.According to HR1154, civil penalties for anyone implicated in such practices may amount to fines of up to US$250,000 (NT$7.6 million). Criminal penalties for individuals implicated in forced organ harvesting may amount to US$1 million (NT$30.5 million) and up to 20 years in prison.The press release mentions a 2022 house hearing that revealed the CCP regime’s horrific human rights abuses, particularly the harvesting of organs from political prisoners including Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs in the concentration camps of Xinjiang.“State-sponsored forced organ harvesting is big business for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party and shows absolutely no signs of abating,” said Smith. “We must act decisively,” the representative added.There has been much speculation about the extent of China’s forced organ harvesting operations over the years, with most evidence based on first-hand accounts of individuals involved. Smith’s press release mentions two such individuals, a Chinese doctor and a security official, who testified before a House committee that they were involved in prisoner executions to procure hearts for transplant procedures.Despite many first-hand accounts, a lack of transparency in China’s security and medical institutions has made it very difficult to establish data-based evidence to understand the extent of unethical organ harvesting in China.That was until a study published in 2022 used reports in Chinese language medical journals to collect a wide swath of data on doctors whose own reports indicate that they violated the “dead donor rule” when extracting hearts from living prisoners. The study, written by Matthew Peterson and Jacob Levee, makes it clear that heart procurement from still-living patients is a regular occurrence in China.A summary of their findings was published in Tablet magazine in June 2022.",2023/03/30,807,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851278,Taiwan denies report it stationed troops in Tuvalu,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday (March 30) refuted a media report claiming that Taiwan has a significant number of troops stationed in Tuvalu, a diplomatic ally.
MOFA said in a press release that the report cited “unidentified and unverified information,” alleging that the Taiwanese Navy and Marine Corps have 1,000 personnel in Tuvalu. The foreign ministry labeled the report “absolutely false” and called on the media to verify the information before publishing articles and refrain from spreading misinformation, which affects cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies.
When Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano visited Taiwan in September, he signed a joint communiqué reaffirming diplomatic relations, MOFA noted. Three other agreements, concerning bilateral cooperation in law enforcement, coast guard, and marine science research cooperation, were signed during his trip.
MOFA also pointed out that Tuvalu foreign minister Simon Kofe withdrew from the 2022 UN Ocean Conference to protest China’s abuse of power and threats to modify the list of the Tuvalu delegation and remove participating Taiwanese experts.










Taiwan will continue to cooperate with diplomatic allies and like-minded countries to respond to China's “malicious influence in the international arena,” MOFA said.
Taiwan and Tuvalu have a close and friendly relationship based on the shared values of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, it said, adding that the countries will continue to work together in fields such as medical care, education and culture, clean energy, maritime security, police administration, climate change, and information and communication.

Peace is a prerequisite for development,"" he said.COVID curbs battered China's economy for three years before being dropped in December, and Li said there were signs a recovery was starting to take hold.China has set itself a modest target for gross domestic product growth of about 5% this year, after significantly missing its target for 2022. That is lower than what the International Monetary Fund and some private forecasters think it can achieve.""Judging from the situation in March, it's better than in January and February. In particular, major economic indicators such as consumption and investment continue to improve, while employment and prices are generally stable,"" Li said.In veiled comments aimed at the United States, which is working with its allies to stymie China's access to advanced technologies such as microchips, Li said Beijing opposed trade protectionism and decoupling.Relations between the two superpowers have been tense for years and worsened last month after the United States shot down a high-altitude balloon off the U.S. East Coast that it says was a Chinese spying craft.Another flashpoint in U.S.-China rivalry has been Taiwan, the democratically ruled island that China claims as its territory.In the latest escalation, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen arrived in New York on Wednesday for the first of two U.S. stopovers that Beijing has called provocative.In his speech, Li said ""chaos and conflicts"" must not happen in Asia and that China would act as an ""anchor"" for global peace.",2023/03/30,349,World

Jim Hataman of the southern island province of Basilan. The search and rescue effort was continuing Thursday for at least seven missing passengers.The burned ferry was towed to Basilan’s shoreline, where coast guard personnel and other authorities later discovered 18 more bodies in a budget section of the passenger cabin, Hataman said, adding the search of the vessel was continuing.“These victims perished onboard due to the fire,” Hataman said. The governor said an investigation was underway and the discovery suggested there were additional travelers not listed on the vessel's manifest.The ferry was enroute to Jolo town in Sulu province from the southern port city of Zamboanga when it caught fire midway off Basilan close to midnight, he said.At least 23 passengers were injured and brought to hospitals.“Some of the passengers were roused from sleep due to the commotion caused by the fire. Some jumped off the ship,” Hataman told The Associated Press by telephone.Sea accidents are common in the Philippine archipelago because of frequent storms, badly maintained boats, overcrowding and spotty enforcement of safety regulations, especially in remote provinces.In December 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world’s worst peacetime maritime disaster.",2023/03/30,194,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851302,"King Charles III addresses German parliament, meets Scholz","BERLIN (AP) — King Charles III became the first monarch to address Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, on Thursday as part of a high-profile visit by the U.K. head of state aimed at bolstering ties between the two European powers.Speaking to lawmakers and other dignitaries in the packed lower house, Charles stressed the close bonds between the United Kingdom and Germany going back centuries, including his own family links to the royal House of Hannover, and the present-day economic, scientific, cultural and military cooperation between the two countries.Charles noted that London and Berlin have provided considerable aid to Ukraine in its efforts to fend off Russia's invasion, a point that will appeal to German government officials more used to hearing how their country isn't doing enough to help Kyiv.“Germany's decision to provide so much military support to Ukraine is extremely brave, important and welcome,” Charles said.Speaking mostly in fluent German, he noted how the intertwined history of the two nations could be seen in the home of the Bundestag itself. The restoration in the 1990s of the former Reichstag building, that was heavily damaged during World War II, was capped with a glass cupola designed by British architect Norman Foster intended as a symbol of transparency and accountability.“From here the citizens can actually watch their politicians work,” Charles said. “Democracy in action.”The 74-year-old largely trod on safe territory, making gentle jokes about soccer rivalry, national humor and mutual admiration for each other's cultures — from the Beatles to Kraftwerk and from Brahms to Byron. Charles briefly touched on the grim history of Nazism and WWII.Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, will visit Hamburg on Friday to pay respects at a memorial to the Kindertransporte, or children's transports, which saw more than 10,000 Jewish children rescued from Nazi Germany 85 years ago. They will also commemorate the more than 30,000 people — most of them civilians — killed in the Allied bombing of Hamburg in July 1943.“Heeding the lessons of the past is our sacred responsibility, but it can only be fully discharged through a commitment to our shared future,” he said. ""Together we must be vigilant against threats to our values and freedoms, and resolute in our determination to confront them. Together we must strive for the security, prosperity and well-being that our people deserve.""When Charles finished his speech, the lawmakers rose for a long, standing ovation, something rarely seen in Germany's parliament.Charles is on his inaugural foreign trip since becoming king. He and Camilla arrived in Berlin on Wednesday. Crowds of well-wishers and Germany's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, greeted the couple at the capital’s iconic Brandenburg Gate. They later attended a banquet in their honor at the presidential palace.Pomp and royal glamour aside, the three-day visit has a decidedly political purpose. The U.K. government is trying to mend frayed ties with its continental partners following the painful Brexit process.The fallout has been considerable: Britain's departure from the European Union's common market has resulted in trade barriers and labor shortages, and locked the country out of key European science programs. By devoting special attention to the EU's two biggest powers — France and Germany — Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hopes to normalize relations with the 27-nation bloc.Charles originally planned to stop in France first, but anti-government protests there delayed that part of his trip. That put the focus on Germany, where the U.K. royal family and particularly the late Queen Elizabeth II have long commanded interest and admiration.Not all were pleased by the visit, however. Jan Korte, a lawmaker with the opposition Left party, said it wasn't in keeping with Germany's democratic tradition to have Charles address the country's highest political body, the Bundestag.“A king isn't elected,” Korte told public broadcaster ZDF. “He can obviously speak everywhere and is very welcome, including by me, but I think that particularly in the Bundestag, which is about representing the people, it's not really appropriate to have a monarch speak.”Charles has spoken to the Bundestag before, at an event in 2020 commemorating the victims of WWII, though he was still the Prince of Wales at the time.Before his speech Charles met briefly with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and visited a farmers' market in Berlin.After his speech, Charles visited a refugee center for Ukrainians at Berlin's former Tegel airport, and met representatives from a joint German and U.K. military unit stationed near Berlin to see a demonstration of their bridge-building amphibious vehicles.Later on Thursday afternoon, he visited an organic farm 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of the capital where he helped make an orange-colored cheese with a crown imprint.His drive to the countryside was slowed down by torrential rain, and he had to skip a tour of the cowshed with newborn calves. Still, Charles had enough time to try a special, crown-shaped cake made by the farm's pastry chef in his honor.When the king's motorcade left the farm, a few royal fans huddled under umbrellas on a nearby lawn shouted in German “Long live the king,” as Charles waved good-bye from his car.___Kirsten Grieshaber contributed.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851304,Irving tries to finish tumultuous season on a high in Dallas,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kyrie Irving -- he says now -- wanted to finish out this season in Brooklyn. He has five games left instead to potentially finish this season out of the playoffs with Dallas.And the enigmatic guard suddenly has more questions -- none having to do with Earth’s shape -- about his basketball future as he prepares to become a free agent in the summer.As for the current state of the team?“It kind of looks like a little bit of a cluster (expletive),"" Irving said.The Mavericks’ 116-108 loss in Philadelphia on Wednesday night dropped them to 8-14 since Irving was acquired in February and has a franchise that reached the Western Conference finals last season on the brink of missing the playoffs this season.Dallas is 37-40 and in 11th place in the West. The NBA play-in tournament includes teams with the seventh through 10th-highest winning percentages in each conference.“It’s been a scramble since I’ve been here,” Irving said.Irving was expected to team with Luka Doncic and put the focus on his game again after a disastrous stint with the Nets that included fallout from his tweet of a link to a film containing antisemitic material.Irving, who scored 23 points against the 76ers and continued his recent beef with courtside fans, said growing pains have come in Dallas from “learning each other on the fly.”“Who do guys go to on the team to confide in off the court? Who is our coaching staff as people? he said. “What do they expect from me? The big question, why they traded for me? And you know, what does it look like for the future? That’s the big question.""The eight-time All-Star hasn’t been interested in talking much about what his long-term future could be with the Mavericks and has been focused more on trying to jostle them ahead of Oklahoma City for the final play-in spot. The Mavericks, losers of five of six games, have a back-to-back weekend set at Miami and Atlanta. They finish with three games at home.“The realistic view is that when I came here was that this was going to be a growing process. This was for the long term,” Irving said. “This was for something that is bigger than ourselves. We can’t just be a championship team overnight, especially me coming here. I think I’ve wrapped my head around that aspect of it. I'm at peace with it. It doesn’t mean that I’m giving up on the season or any of my teammates are.”While Irving said his overall tenure in Dallas has been good -- “outside of the losses, of course,” he said -- he acknowledged little has gone right for him this season.“I didn’t expect to ask for a trade,” he said. “I wanted to finish out with Brooklyn, finish out with the season that we had going and I didn’t get a chance to do that. Some of the goals I had previously this season had to be shifted. I had to be more than willing, which I am, to be flexible and adaptable and live with the results, whether we make the playoffs or not.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851319,"Oscar Pistorius eligible for parole, could be free this week","CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Former Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius has applied for parole and is expected to attend a hearing on Friday that will decide if he can be released from prison 10 years after killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by shooting her multiple times through a toilet door in his home.Pistorius, who was convicted of murder in Steenkamp's Valentine's Day 2013 killing, could leave the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre in Pretoria on Friday if his parole is granted, although the Department of Corrections said the process may take days to finalize if his application is successful.Barry and June Steenkamp, the parents of Reeva, have said they oppose Pistorius' release and are allowed to address the parole board at his hearing. A submission by a victim's relatives is one of numerous factors taken into account.""He is a murderer. He should remain in jail,"" Barry Steenkamp said in an interview with Britain's Daily Mail newspaper published last month on the 10th anniversary of his daughter's killing.The Department of Corrections declined to give details on Pistorius' hearing, saying it was “an internal matter” like any other parole hearing.According to guidelines, the board will consider the offense Pistorius was convicted of, his conduct and disciplinary record while in prison, whether he took part in educational or other training courses, his mental and physical state, whether he's likely to “relapse into crime” and the risk he poses to the public.Of all the factors, legal expert Neo Mashele said that “generally speaking, the behavior of the offender is the most important consideration.""Pistorius’ parole lawyer, Julian Knight, has previously said Pistorius has been a “model prisoner.” Knight didn’t respond to requests for comment this week. Neither did a lawyer for the Steenkamps.Pistorius, who is now 36, was ultimately convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed against an initial conviction for culpable homicide, which is comparable to manslaughter. He was eventually sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison for murder in 2017, again after a prosecution appeal against a lighter sentence.Offenders in South Africa convicted of serious crimes must serve at least half their sentence before being considered for parole. Pistorius has done that after taking into account the time he served in jail from late 2014 while the appeals in his case were heard.A number of options are available to the parole board: Pistorius could be released on full parole or placed on day parole, where he would be allowed to live and work in the community during the day but have to return to prison at night. He could also be placed under correctional supervision, which means he would be released but have to spend some of his time during the week at a correctional center.Pistorius' parole could be denied, where the board usually asks the offender to reapply at a later stage.A double-amputee runner and multiple Paralympic champion once hailed as an inspirational figure, Pistorius' murder trial and downfall captivated the world. His crime eventually led to him being sent to the Kgosi Mampuru II maximum security prison, one of South Africa's most notorious.He was moved to the Atteridgeville prison in 2016 because that facility is better suited to disabled prisoners. Pistorius had both his lower legs amputated as a baby and walks with prosthetics.There have been glimpses of his life in prison, with reports claiming he had at one point grown a beard, gained weight and taken up smoking and was unrecognizable from the elite athlete who competed against able-bodied runners on his carbon-fiber blades at the 2012 London Olympics.He has spent much of his time working in an area of the prison grounds where vegetables are grown, sometimes driving a tractor. His father, Henke Pistorius, said in a 2018 interview that he was running bible classes for other inmates.There have also been flashes of trouble. Pistorius sustained an injury in an altercation with another inmate over a public telephone in 2017. A year earlier, Pistorius received treatment for injuries to his wrists, which his family denied were a result of him harming himself.Pistorius has been seeking parole since 2021 but a hearing that year was canceled partly because he hadn't yet met with Barry and June Steenkamp in a process known as a victim-offender dialogue. It is required in South Africa — if victims or their family want the meeting — before an offender can be considered for parole.Pistorius claims he shot 29-year-old Reeva Steenkamp by mistake with his licensed 9 mm pistol because he thought she was a dangerous intruder. He met face-to-face with her father last year in a meeting which convinced Barry Steenkamp that Pistorius should not be released, he said in the Daily Mail interview.“I told Oscar directly that he had shot my daughter deliberately and he denied it,” Steenkamp said. “He stuck to his story that he thought it was an intruder. After all these years we are still waiting for him to admit he did it in anger. That is all we wanted.”“If he told me the truth,"" said Steenkamp, ""I would have let the law take its course over his parole.""",2023/03/30,,World

(TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") applauds the recently announced Canadian Federal budget and its strong support for clean economy investments. The 2023 Canadian budget contains several new initiatives focused on fighting climate change, helping to retool the Canadian economy and supporting the creation of the net-zero industries of tomorrow. The new federal initiatives include a set of clear and predictable investment tax credits, low-cost strategic financing, and targeted investments and programming, where necessary to respond to the unique needs of sectors or projects of national economic significance.    The Federal programs supporting First Hydrogen include Investment Tax Credits for Clean Hydrogen ($17.7 billion) and Zero Emission Technology Manufacturing ($11.1 billion) as well as lower tax rates for Zero Emission Technology Manufactures ($1.3 billion). The Federal incentives are in addition to incentive programs offered by the Province of Quebec, which the Company has picked for its first green hydrogen eco-system. Development sites for the local production of green hydrogen and the assembly of First Hydrogen's zero-emission commercial vehicles are being assessed in the City of Shawinigan.   First Hydrogen offers a zero-emission solution via producing and supplying green hydrogen, refueling stations and next-generation hydrogen-powered fuel-cell light to medium commercial vehicles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851334,New Taipei City slammed for using simplified Chinese,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators held a press conference on Thursday (March 30), slamming the New Taipei City government for using simplified Chinese characters in official communications, and called on mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) to explain.The simplified characters appeared in educational pamphlets produced to promote the city’s environmental protection plan, per FTV, but they will now be reprinted to make them easier to read, according to city officials. Meaning “wind power generation,” the simplified characters ""风力发电"" appeared on the cover of the pamphlet, which appear as ""風力發電"" in traditional Chinese characters.DPP legislator Cho Kuan-ting (卓冠廷) slammed the New Taipei City government for the blunder and said this was proof it could not protect Taiwan. ""If you can't even protect the traditional characters of the Republic of China, how can you possibly be able to protect the Republic of China and Taiwan,"" he said.The DPP legislators alleged that the textbooks were ordered from the Chinese online retail giant Taobao, but the city government denied this and said they were manufactured in Tainan. The city government said that training will be put in place for city employees to ensure the mistake is not repeated.The educational product's instruction pamphlet is shown with simplified characters appearing throughout. (Facebook, Cho Kuan-ting photo)They also denied the legislators’ accusation that NT$5.1 million (US$170,000) had been spent on the pamphlets, and issued a statement saying only NT$9,975 was spent. The spokesperson for the environmental protection wing of the city government, Hsu Ming-chih (許銘志), warned that these accusations are not in the public interest.This is the second time simplified characters have caused political controversy in recent weeks, with independent legislator May Chin (高金素梅) receiving criticism for using briefing notes written in simplified characters during a parliamentary debate on March 15. In 2019, simplified characters were discovered on road markings in Kaohsiung, and were subsequently re-written using traditional characters.Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many overseas Chinese communities use traditional Chinese characters, while China, Malaysia, and Singapore use simplified characters. A small number of simplified characters appear in informal settings in Taiwan, though it is generally regarded as unacceptable to use simplified characters for formal communications.",2023/03/30,2336,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851358,Tight supply in Taiwan sees British pork come to market's rescue,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — It’s not just eggs that have been in short supply in Taiwan. Other agricultural products have also been affected, such as pork.The Taiwan Frozen Meat Packers Association (TFMPA台灣冷凍肉品工業同業公會), which supplies the domestic meat market, has been in discussions with the U.K.’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB英國農業與園藝發展委員會) regarding the possibility of significantly increasing the volume of British pork imports as a processed product.The AHDB has stressed that British pork does not use additives such as ractopamine and strictly controls the use of antibiotics. British pork is regarded as a premium and healthy option, especially as a source of protein, and the importing of high-quality British pork will assist domestic manufacturers and help meet the needs of domestic meat processing manufacturers.According to the latest statistics from the Council of Agriculture Cabinet, Taiwan consumes about 900,000 tons of pork annually, or approximately 35.32 kilograms per person. Clearly a significant food item for Taiwan.Pork imports have also become the focus of Taiwan’s foreign trade negotiations. In recent years, especially since the beginning of 2023, domestic pork supply has been tight, and seeking foreign pork imports has become an important option for domestic manufacturers to consider.To promote the export of British pork, AHDB has actively explored the Asia-Pacific market. AHDB has long regarded Taiwan as the focal point for the promotion of British pork, particularly in the last 2 years.After the epidemic prevention measures were lifted, AHDB, this week, led a delegation of British pork representatives to Taiwan and held three consecutive promotional activities, including a meat import forum, pork tasting meeting, and one-to-one negotiations, inviting Taiwanese meat importers and catering companies to participate. All parties greatly enjoyed the events and look forward to working more closely together in the future.Based on official U.K. statistics, the export of British pork to Taiwan in 2022 reached approximately 1,700 tons, with an export value of around NT$117 million (£3.1 million). This represents a noteworthy 200% increase compared to the export of pork to Taiwan in 2021. With the interest shown in British pork, it is expected that 2023 will be a bumper year in terms of British pork exports to Taiwan.Susan Stewart, Senior Asia-Pacific Export Manager and Spokesperson of AHDB reiterated that British pork is produced without the use of ractopamine for the entire production process, and the use of growth hormones has been strictly prohibited since 1988.Additionally, the use of antibiotics is also strictly controlled, and the farming methods used for pig rearing comply with animal welfare regulations. The logistics and slaughter processes from farm to table are strictly monitored, making British pork a safe food source that Taiwan consumers can trust.Tom Burn (嚴濤暮), the deputy representative of the British Office in Taipei, pointed out that Taiwan is renowned for its exceptional culinary skills, and the U.K. is eager to witness the emergence of a fresh range of healthy and delectable pork dishes that feature British pork as an ingredient. He looks forward to the innovative ways in which local chefs will incorporate British pork to create new dishes soon.",2023/03/30,820,Opinion

 HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 30 March 2023 -  NTT Ltd., a leading global IT infrastructure and services company, today announced the launch of its Managed Detection and Response (MDR) security service to help companies achieve business performance objectives through improved cyber resilience. The cloud-native, analytics-driven offering combines human and machine expertise with leading technologies and threat intelligence to reduce the mean time to detect and respond to cyber-attacks.   The MDR service is built on Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft's leading next-gen security information and event management (SIEM) platform, powered by AI, automation, and threat intelligence. Sentinel enables organizations to collect data at scale across all users, devices, apps, and infrastructure, both on-prem and in multicloud environments.   Using analytics, machine learning, and threat intelligence, the service hunts for suspicious activities and minimizes false positives. With built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks, enterprises can respond to incidents rapidly and remotely isolate threats.   This latest offering represents another step forward in NTT and Microsoft's multi-year Strategic Alliance Agreement (SCA) signed in 2020. Since then, the two companies have collaborated to build advanced solutions in public, private and edge cloud, data & AI, digital & app innovation, modern workplace, and now most recently in security.   With over 25 years of Microsoft experience, including 5000+ Microsoft engineers, and more than 10,000 Microsoft certifications, NTT provides an advanced combination of application and systems integration, advisory and managed cloud, and security services that are built using Microsoft platforms and can be delivered globally.   ""Organizations are typically utilizing a patchwork of security technologies that lack alignment,"" said Charlie Li, Senior Executive Vice President: Managed Cloud and Infrastructure Services, NTT Ltd. ""This disjointed approach has left businesses often unable to detect hard-to-find threats and lacking the necessary agility to mitigate them. Many are simply adding more security layers, increasing complexity, and generating even more logs and alerts that go untreated.""   ""NTT's MDR service helps organizations stay ahead of attackers and has a direct impact on workforce productivity and customer satisfaction through real-time and long-term threat correlation, advanced analytics, and continuous monitoring of digital transactions. It delivers a strong cyber-resilience posture, directly impacting an organization's operational, financial, and resource resilience,"" he added.   ""Our research indicates that IT security professionals are in high demand, largely driven by more threats that have sprouted with the expansion of today's hybrid workforce and the magnitude of the increased volume of digital transactions impacting businesses,"" said Craig Robinson, Research VP, International Data Corporation (IDC). ""MDR services are greatly assisting organizations in taking a pro-active stance to protect all forms of digital transactions and providing those organizations with high-impact, real-time, advanced analytics and professionals 24X7X365.""   ""We're extremely pleased to expand on our existing strategic relationship with NTT through the launch of the new MDR service, based on Microsoft Sentinel, to further help protect and support our joint customers,"" said Csaba Deme, General Manager, Global Security Sales at Microsoft.   NTT is well-positioned to enhance its strategic partnership with Microsoft, having earned the esteemed Microsoft Azure Expert Managed Services Provider status, as well as 8 Specializations. NTT is a member of the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) and boasts a strong legacy with over 20 Microsoft Partner Awards, including the prestigious Partner of the Year.   The global managed detection and response market size is predicted to increase from  $2.6B in 2022 to $5.6B by 2027. Some of the factors that are driving market growth include shortage of skilled cyber security professionals and budget constraints, government regulations, and strict compliance for adoption of MDR services.   NTT's MDR base service includes service tiers and deployment options, as well as support for add-ons that provide additional capabilities to expand detection capabilities and response actions. Current add-ons are MDR for Endpoint and Security Device Management (SecDM) for MDR, for Security Devices and Services.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851375,Hang Lung Properties and LVMH Group Launch Common Charter: 20 Actions to Accelerate Sustainability Progress in 2023,"HONG KONG, SHANGHAI AND PARIS -  Media OutReach - 30 March 2023 - Hang Lung Properties (SEHK stock code: 00101) (""Hang Lung"") and Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (""LVMH"") (collectively hereafter, ""the Groups"") are delighted to announce that the Groups have formulated an ambitious agenda for sustainability action together entitled  Common Charter: Joining Forces to Accelerate Change (""Charter""), which outlines a set of 20 innovative actions they will implement in 2023 to accelerate sustainability progress. The Charter is the next important step for the first-of-its-kind sustainability partnership agreement (""Agreement"") entered into by the Groups in October 2022. It follows their inaugural Real Estate & Climate Forum (""Forum"") held in November 2022, which convened hundreds of people and generated more than 200 ideas.   Under the Charter, the Groups will pursue 20 concrete actions organized under the following four pillars:     Climate Resilience, including sharing energy data, turning off lights at night, encouraging energy innovation through awards, and pursuing renewable energy;       Resource Management, including a mandatory carbon footprint analysis, a shared database of low carbon materials, auditing waste streams, and innovative projects in recycling and reuse, water management, and biodiversity;       People and Wellbeing, including air quality and acoustics projects, development of a shared learning agenda, and initiatives to enhance community wellbeing; and       Sustainability Governance, including the use of digital platforms to improve environmental governance, and sharing of strategies for sustainable procurement.         To speed progress, leverage expertise and strengthen impact under the Charter, the Groups are partnering with a number of external organizations, including: Bluerisk on water management; CLP on renewable energy; GIGA (RESET) on carbon footprint assessment and low carbon materials; the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) on environmental governance; Schneider Electric on energy management; and TRASHAUS on waste audits and recycling. In addition, they are developing research projects on key challenges through the Urban Land Institute, and through Hang Lung's association with the Hang Lung Center for Real Estate at Tsinghua University.   Mr. Adriel Chan, Hang Lung Properties Vice Chair, and Chair of its Sustainability Steering Committee, said: ""Hang Lung and LVMH have already covered much ground in the five months since entering our pioneering sustainability partnership. Now, we aim to design and shape even more innovative sustainability solutions together through the 20 actions that we will implement in 2023, as detailed in the Charter. We have been able to move so quickly together because of the trust between the two Groups, our embrace of innovation and 'learning by doing', and our commitment to accelerating positive impacts in sustainability. In early 2024, we will report back on how we did in all 20 action areas, as well as add new ideas for even greater impact.""   ""This partnership will be a model around the world, of how to create new partnerships between landlords and tenants. We need to accelerate improvements to the stores' environmental footprint. Synergies such as this one are key to addressing sustainability challenges. The Charter is a new phase in our partnership, one of action, through our 20 concrete measures. With the support of a new kind of changemaker – our great partners such as Bluerisk, CLP, GIGA (RESET), Schneider, and TRASHAUS – the Real Estate and Climate Forum established by the Groups is really a portfolio of solutions,"" said Ms. Helene Valade, LVMH Group Environment Development Director.   Some of the Charter actions have already begun. For example, the Groups are working with TRASHAUS on a waste audit covering the demolition process of a store renovation in Hang Lung's Plaza 66 in Shanghai. The audit is collecting data on wood, metal and mixed renovation waste, and investigating waste transit and recycling facilities, in order to identify ways to reduce waste and increase circularity. The Groups will then look to apply insights gained to other tenant renovations.   In a spirit of transparency and to encourage greater innovation and collaboration among stakeholders, the Groups are making the Charter public in its entirety. It is available for download in both English and simplified Chinese on their shared Forum  website. Updated versions of the Charter, reflecting learnings, progress achieved – including quantifiable results from actions undertaken in 2023 – and new ambitions, will be released in 2024 and 2025.   Spanning Hang Lung's portfolio of properties across seven cities in mainland China, the Agreement engages 26 LVMH brands occupying over 90 retail spaces with a lettable floor area in excess of 27,000 sq. m. With plans to engage the employees and suppliers of both Groups, the partnership will run to the end of 2025, and is expected to be renewed thereafter.  Hashtag: #HangLungProperties

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851386,Russia arrests Wall Street Journal reporter on spying charge,"Russia's security service arrested an American reporter for The Wall Street Journal on espionage charges, the first time a U.S. correspondent has been detained on spying accusations since the Cold War. The newspaper denied the allegations and demanded his release.Evan Gershkovich, 31, was detained in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, about 1,670 kilometers (1,035 miles) east of Moscow. Russia's Federal Security Service accused him of trying to obtain classified information.Known by the acronym FSB, the service is the top domestic security agency and main successor to the Soviet-era KGB. It alleged that Gershkovich “was acting on instructions from the American side to collect information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex that constitutes a state secret.”The Journal ""vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,” the newspaper said. “We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.”The arrest comes at a moment of bitter tensions between the West and Moscow over its war in Ukraine and as the Kremlin intensifies a crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and civil society groups.The sweeping campaign of repression is unprecedented since the Soviet era. Activists say it often means the very profession of journalism is criminalized, along with the activities of ordinary Russians who oppose the war.Earlier this week, a Russian court convicted a father over social media posts critical of the war and sentenced him to two years in prison. His 13-year-old daughter was sent to an orphanage.Gershkovich is the first American reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since September 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released without charge 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union's United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.At a hearing Thursday, a Moscow court quickly ruled that Gershkovich would be kept behind bars pending the investigation.While previous American detainees have been freed in prisoner swaps, a top Russian official said it was too early to talk about any such deal.In Washington, the Biden administration said it had spoken with the Journal and Gershkovich's family. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the arrest ""in the strongest terms"" and urged Americans to heed government warnings not to travel to Russia.The State Department was in direct touch with the Russian government and seeking access to Gershkovich, Jean-Pierre said. The administration has no “specific indication” that journalists in Russia are being targeted, she said.Gershkovich, who covers Russia, Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as a correspondent in the Journal’s Moscow bureau, could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of espionage. Prominent lawyers noted that past investigations into espionage cases took a year to 18 months, during which time he may have little contact with the outside world.The FSB noted that Gershkovich had accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist, but ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova alleged that Gershkovich was using his credentials as cover for ""activities that have nothing to do with journalism.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “It is not about a suspicion, it is about the fact that he was caught red-handed.”Gershkovich speaks fluent Russian and had previously worked for the French news agency Agence France-Presse and The New York Times. He was a 2014 graduate of Bowdoin College in Maine, where he was a philosophy major who cooperated with local papers and championed a free press, according to Clayton Rose, the college's president.His last report from Moscow, published earlier this week, focused on the Russian economy’s slowdown amid Western sanctions imposed after Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year.Ivan Pavlov, a prominent Russian defense attorney who has worked on many espionage and treason cases, said Gershkovich's case is the first criminal espionage charge against a foreign journalist in post-Soviet Russia.“That unwritten rule not to touch accredited foreign journalists, has stopped working,” said Pavlov, a member of the First Department legal aid group.Pavlov said the case against Gershkovich was built to give Russia “trump cards” for a future prisoner exchange and will likely be resolved “not by the means of the law, but by political, diplomatic means.”Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov ruled out any quick swap.“I wouldn’t even consider this issue now because people who were previously swapped had already served their sentences,” Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies.In December, WNBA star Brittney Griner was freed after 10 months behind bars in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.Another American, Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the U.S. government have said are baseless.“Our family is sorry to hear that another American family will have to experience the same trauma that we have had to endure for the past 1,553 days,” Whelan's brother David said in an emailed statement. “It sounds as though the frame-up of Mr. Gershkovich was the same as it was in Paul’s case.”Jeanne Cavelier, of the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, said Gershkovich's arrest “looks like a retaliation measure of Russia against the United States.”""We are very alarmed because it is probably a way to intimidate all Western journalists that are trying to investigate aspects of the war on the ground in Russia,” said Cavelier, head of Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk at the Paris-based group.Another prominent lawyer with the First Department group, Yevgeny Smirnov, said that those arrested on espionage and treason charges are usually held at the FSB's Lefortovo prison, where they are usually placed in total isolation, without phone calls, visitors or even access to newspapers. At most, they can receive letters, often delayed by weeks. Smirnov called these conditions “tools of suppression.”Smirnov and Pavlov both said that any trial would be held behind closed doors. According to Pavlov, there have been no acquittals in treason and espionage cases in Russia since 1999.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851387,"French foreign minister hopes Sweden, Finland join NATO soon","VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — France's top diplomat said Thursday that she hoped the NATO applications of Sweden and Finland would be “ratified quickly,” as the Turkish parliament was expected to vote soon on whether Finland should join the 30-member alliance.French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna referred to an upcoming NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital in July when she said that “we hope this summit will be a success and that there will be 32 countries at the Vilnius summit.”“The applications of Sweden and Finland should be ratified quickly,” she told a news conference.Both Sweden and neighboring Finland applied to join NATO in May 2022, abandoning decades of nonalignment in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. NATO requires the unanimous approval of its members to take in new countries.On Monday, Hungarian lawmakers ratified Finland’s request to join NATO. However, the approval of Sweden’s bid has stalled because of opposition from Turkey and Hungary.The Turkish government has accused Sweden of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Ankara needs further assurances before it will give its final approval.Members of Hungary’s governing party said they would wait for the government in Stockholm to clear up lingering disagreements before scheduling a vote in parliament. The government in Budapest alleges that some Swedish politicians have made derisive statements about the condition of Hungary’s democracy and played an active role in ensuring that billions in European Union funds were frozen over alleged rule-of-law and democracy violations.Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said that “we see no reason why we should not be ratified. Those reasons have nothing to do with the Swedish NATO application. It is something completely different, it is about what views the EU has on Hungary,"" according to Swedish news agency TT.In Vilnius, Colonna said that Russia should reconsider a recently announced plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which has close military ties with Russia and was a staging ground for Moscow's invasion of neighboring Ukraine last year.“France condemns Russia’s plans as they are related to the destabilization of Europe. We want this decision to be reconsidered, and it would be very good if (Russian President) Vladimir Putin revoked that decision,” Colonna told reporters.The move by Russia to station tactical atomic weapons in Belarus came in response to the West’s increasing military support for Ukraine. Putin announced the plan in a television interview that aired Saturday, saying it was triggered by a U.K. decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.Colonna was in Vilnius to meet with Lithuanian counterpart Gabrielius Landsbergis to discuss the upcoming NATO summit in Vilnius on July 11-12. She also was scheduled to meet with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte and visit French troops currently deployed in the Baltic country as part of NATO's air policing mission.—— Associated Press Writer Jan M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851388,EU reaches provisional deal to raise renewable energy target,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union countries and negotiators from the EU's parliament reached a provisional deal Thursday to raise the share of renewables in the bloc's energy mix, another step to accelerate its green transition.The European Council, which represents the 27 member nations, said the agreement reached after all-night negotiations would raise the renewable energy target to 42.5% of total consumption by 2030. The current goal is 32%.To meet the EU’s goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the EU's executive commission supported a target of 45%. The council and the European Parliament left a door open for such an increase, agreeing on “an additional 2.5% indicative top up that would allow to reach 45%.”Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated the EU's green transition. The bloc reduced its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and increased its renewable energy use over the past year.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement announced Thursday would allow ""for more ambition and faster roll-out of renewables,”“This will help us progress towards climate neutrality, strengthen our energy security and boost our competitiveness, all at once,” von der Leyen said.According to EU data, the bloc's gas consumption dropped 19.3% during August 2022-January 2023 compared to the average for the same months between 2017 and 2022.A review by global energy think tank Ember showed that wind and solar generated a record 22% of the EU's electricity last year and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%.The negotiations between the European Parliament and the European Council dragged on into the night because of a rift between two groups of countries over the role of nuclear energy in the production of hydrogen.In the end, the agreement gave nations the possibility of using nuclear technology.Under the deal, 42% of the hydrogen used in industry should come from renewable fuels of non-biological origin by 2030 and 60% by 2035. EU countries producing hydrogen from nuclear power would be able to reduce their overall renewable hydrogen production target by 20% if they also reduce the share of hydrogen from fossil fuels.The deal still needs formal approval to take effect.___Follow AP’s coverage of climate and environment at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851389,Fox lawsuit highlights effects of conspiracies on Dominion,"PHOENIX (AP) — In Arizona’s most populous county, elected officials are bracing for what could happen when it comes time to replace its $2 million-a-year contract for voting equipment.Officials in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, say they have no concerns about their current vendor, Dominion Voting Systems. The problem is that the company has been ensnared in a web of conspiracy theories since the 2020 presidential race that have undermined public confidence in U.S. elections among conservative voters, led to calls to ban voting machines in some places and triggered death threats against election officials across the country.“I have concerns over my own personal security if we re-enlist Dominion,” Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican elected in 2020, said in a court filing. “It went from a company that nobody had heard about to a company that is maybe one of the most demonized brands in the United States or the world.”That sudden turnabout in fortunes for the Colorado-based voting machine company is at the heart of a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit it has filed against Fox News, with the trial scheduled to begin in mid-April. Dominion claims Fox defamed it by repeatedly airing false claims about the company’s voting machines and software. Court records and testimony revealed that several Fox hosts and executives didn’t believe the claims pushed by former President Donald Trump and his allies since the 2020 election but continued to air them, in part because they were worried about losing viewers.Fox has argued the network was reporting on allegations that were newsworthy as Trump and his Republican allies contested his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The network has said Dominion has been overstating its value, could not have suffered damages in the amounts it is claiming and has played down security concerns about its machines. Fox lawyers also argue that documents produced in the case show Dominion is in a solid financial position.“The case has no merit, and the outrageous damage claim only highlights its naked attempt to suppress legitimate speech protected by our Constitution,"" Fox said in a statement.Dominion has been presenting evidence that it says shows lost contracts and business opportunities over the past two years. It cites misinformation as the reason officials in some counties in Nevada, Pennsylvania and Tennessee have terminated their contracts with it while counties in Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio have opted against renewing.One expert, in a report submitted by Dominion in November as part of its lawsuit, estimated the company had experienced nearly $16 million in lost profits from customers that either terminated their contracts early or decided not to renew.The same estimate projected Dominion has already suffered $72.3 million in lost opportunities, which includes potential contract extensions, additional equipment sales and service contracts with existing customers, and new business.Overall, the expert estimated the company had experienced a $920 million decline in value, which includes the estimated taxes the company would have to pay if it were awarded damages. The expert also estimated additional future lost opportunities that have yet to be detailed publicly.“The evidence will show that Dominion was a valuable, rapidly growing business that was executing on its plan to expand prior to the time that Fox began spreading and endorsing baseless lies about Dominion voting machines,” Stephanie Walstrom, a Dominion spokeswoman, said in a statement.The company's challenges haven’t ended, as conspiracies about the last presidential election have permeated much of the Republican Party. Trump allies continue to travel the country meeting with community groups and holding forums to promote election conspiracies.The conspiracies have been cited by some county officials, who say they are responding to constituent concerns, as justification for refusing to certify election results and have fed attempts to decertify or ban voting equipment.“People aren’t acting rationally,” said Lawrence Norden, an election security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice, which has advocated for more voter access and money for election offices. “They are canceling contracts at great expense to their taxpayers.”Not included in the Dominion expert’s report are more recent actions, including in Shasta County, California, where the board of supervisors terminated its contract with Dominion early. At a meeting in January, the board cited a loss in public confidence in the machines, which are used in the county to tabulate paper ballots marked by hand.In 2020, Trump won Shasta County with 65% of the vote.“Dominion has to prove to me that we have a free and fair election,” said Board of Supervisors Chair Patrick Henry Jones, who led the effort to end the contract. “Just because we’re all sitting up here and elected doesn’t mean we had free and fair elections every single time.”The board is now pursuing a plan to count ballots by hand, a process experts consider to be less accurate and more time-consuming in all but the smallest of jurisdictions. Trump ally Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, has promised to support their efforts to get rid of their voting machines.In an interview, Lindell said he was prepared to help cover the costs of any lawsuits Shasta County might face.“They are within their rights of going to paper ballots and a hand count,” Lindell said. “They have to be courageous, or we are not going to get rid of these machines.”Cathy Darling Allen, the elected Shasta County clerk and registrar of voters, has defended the voting equipment and blamed “disproven conspiracy theories” for undermining the county’s election system and staff. She has warned the county was in danger of not being able to conduct elections.“Their actions have placed the security of our elections at risk and created a dangerous precedent encouraging outsiders to undermine our elections at the county level,” Darling Allen wrote in testimony to Congress this month.She estimated that hand-counting all ballots in a presidential election with 50 contests on the ballot would cost at least $1.6 million and require hiring nearly 1,300 temporary employees. The county has more than 111,000 registered voters.Election security experts were concerned that the market for voting machines already was limited before the 2020 election, dominated by three companies. One Dominion competitor, Election Systems & Software, has not reported contract cancellations but has also been forced to defend its reputation amid the voting machine conspiracies.In a recent hearing, Erin Murphy, an attorney for Fox, told the Delaware Superior Court judge presiding over the defamation case that Dominion has “a real speculation problem” regarding its claims for damages and said Dominion’s lost-profits argument appears to be based on the presumption that it would have won every contract it sought had it not been for Fox’s coverage of the election fraud allegations.That ignores the fact that Dominion’s rivals have sometimes offered lower bids or more attractive technology, Murphy said. Fox has highlighted internal communications, including a chat in which one Dominion employee said, “God our products suck,” as well as a federal advisory outlining potential vulnerabilities reported in a Dominion system.Arizona's Maricopa County has been at the forefront of the conspiracy theories about Dominion. The GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 used its subpoena power to seize the county’s voting equipment and hired a firm run by Trump supporters to comb through it in search of evidence the machines were compromised. The firm found none, and Doug Logan, who oversaw the project, conceded in a private text message that surfaced in an unrelated lawsuit that “the Dominion machine is actually quite precise."" Nevertheless, distrust remains rampant.Dominion’s executive vice president of sales, Waldeep Singh, said in a court filing that the situation in Arizona has made it impossible to do business there. He blamed conspiracy theories for scuttling the company’s chances of winning business in Yavapai County, a conservative rural county north of Phoenix.“All I can tell you is, based on my experience and our trajectory at the time in Arizona, we were trending in a very positive direction,” Singh said.Now, he said, “I don’t think we’ll win anything in Arizona again.”___Cassidy reported from Atlanta.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851390,4 bankers convicted over Swiss account of longtime Putin pal,"GENEVA (AP) — Four former bankers with the Swiss affiliate of a key Russian bank were found guilty Thursday of failing to properly check accounts opened in the name of a Russian cellist with longtime ties to President Vladimir Putin.The defendants were handed suspended sentences in Zurich district court that, if violated, could lead collectively to hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs in fines.Lawyers for all the defendants immediately announced plans to appeal, according to an email from a spokesman for Gazprombank Switzerland, which is in the process of winding down its operations and wasn't itself facing charges.The verdict follows a one-day trial on March 8 based on information about secret financial flows revealed in the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that implicated musician and Putin’s childhood friend Sergei Roldugin. It took years for prosecutors to unravel the web of money and bring the case to court.The trial opened a rare window into allegations from the Panama Papers that a member of Putin’s circle of friends helped funnel millions abroad and that financial employees may have turned a blind eye to such inflows. Putin has denied the accusations.The former Gazprombank employees — three Russian-born and one Swiss-born, who couldn't be named under Swiss law — were charged with failing to adequately check whether Roldugin actually owned the assets in the accounts. He was a bank customer from 2014 to 2016.All four defendants denied the charges, which include allegations of violating Swiss anti-money-laundering law.In a statement, the Zurich regional prosecutors office said it welcomed the verdicts as “an important signal that due diligence obligations under money laundering law must be observed.”Both before and since Putin ordered forces into Ukraine, Western nations have imposed sanctions against oligarchs and others with close ties to his government, including Roldugin.The U.S. Treasury Department describes Roldugin as “part of a system that manages President Putin’s offshore wealth.”Documents filed when the accounts were opened listed expected transactions of 11.5 million Swiss francs ($12.2 million). The indictment didn't indicate how much may have arrived at the bank, but noted how Putin has “enormous assets managed by people close to him.”Gazprombank maintained the accounts despite “abundant” media reports about Roldugin’s relationship to Putin, including that he was godfather to one of Putin’s daughters, the indictment said.The bank’s documents listed Roldugin’s income as 1 million Swiss francs a year, his assets at 10 million francs, and his occupation as a musician, indicating that the money flows were “in no way plausible as Roldugin’s own wealth,” the indictment said. It said the way the accounts were structured indicated he was being used as “a straw man.”In 2016, when reports named Roldugin as the owner of $2 billion in offshore assets, Putin denied having any links to offshore accounts and described the Panama Papers leaks as part of Western efforts to weaken Russia.The verdict was largely symbolic: The public prosecutor’s office sought seven-month suspended prison sentences for the defendants.For years, Switzerland has sought to clean up its reputation as a secret haven of billions in ill-gotten or laundered money, including through legislation that requires bankers to scrutinize the origin of funds associated with “politically exposed persons.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851391,"Pickleball Slam: Roddick, Agassi, McEnroe, Chang take swings","When Andy Roddick agreed to join John McEnroe, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang at the Pickleball Slam, the 2003 U.S. Open champion figured he had two distinct advantages against the three other International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees participating in the made-for-TV exhibition in Hollywood, Florida.At age 40, Roddick is the junior member of the quartet (McEnroe is 64, Agassi 52, Chang 51). And Roddick’s serve, which topped 150 mph back in his days on the tennis tour, was the fastest among the group of retired Grand Slam title winners who signed up for something that features a $1 million purse and airs Sunday on ESPN at noon Eastern, before the March Madness women’s championship game.“As I’m walking through the (pickleball) rules, I saw they took away my youth with (limited) movement, and they took away my serve with having to serve underhand,” Roddick said with a chuckle, “so I’m not really sure what’s left.”He will face Chang, then McEnroe will take on Agassi, before a McEnroe-Chang vs. Agassi-Roddick doubles competition at the Pickleball Slam — the latest in a series of attempts to draw eyeballs to a sport taking over courts in neighborhoods all over while still finding its footing on television.“Everyone likes it instantly. It’s pretty well-regarded by people that play it,” Roddick said. “But you also don’t know if it will ever translate to TV and be a very watchable product without knowing the ins and outs and nuances that, frankly, I don’t know that people have the time to learn.”ESPN/ABC have shown pickleball in the past, there is a deal in place with one league for some of its competitions, and there are ongoing discussions with others.“We’re obviously not writing big checks for pickleball at this moment,” said Tim Bunnell, ESPN senior vice president of programming. “The stage of development for the sport is: We’re all still figuring out how it translates in the media world. We know how it translates participation-wise.”Horizon Sports & Experiences (HS&E) is producing the Pickleball Slam in tandem with InsideOut Sports and Entertainment (ISE). The idea, HS&E co-CEO David Levy explained, was for bold-faced names from one racket sport to help promote another.“Today, right now, nobody truly knows the top pickleball players. No one can even name maybe the top 50 pickleball players,” said Levy, the former president of Turner Networks. ”(But) it’s a huge rising phenomenon in sport. And we decided to jump in, in a unique way.”Likening the appeal of Sunday’s event to what drew fans to “The Match,” a televised golf exhibition that began under his watch at Turner with Tiger Woods playing against Phil Mickelson in 2018, Levy said: “I’ve done this magic before.”He said he would love to get tennis stars such as the Williams sisters, Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal to play pickleball in future editions.“Keep building this incredibly rising sport,” Levy said, “with great brand names.”___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851392,TikTok propaganda labels fall flat in 'huge win' for Russia,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A year ago, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, TikTok started labeling accounts operated by Russian state propaganda agencies as a way to tell users they were being exposed to Kremlin disinformation.An analysis a year later shows the policy has been applied inconsistently. It ignores dozens of accounts with millions of followers. Even when used, labels have little impact on Russia's ability to exploit TikTok's powerful algorithms as part of its effort to shape public opinion about the war.Researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan, transatlantic nonprofit operated by the German Marshall Fund that studies authoritarian disinformation, on Thursday published a report that identified nearly 80 TikTok accounts operated by Russian state outlets like RT or Sputnik or by individuals linked to them, including RT's editor-in-chief.More than a third of the accounts were unlabeled, despite a labeling policy announced by TikTok a year ago. The labels, which appear in bold immediately below an account's name, read “Russia state-controlled media.” Clicking on the label brings up more information, including a description that “the government has control over the account's editorial content.”The accounts have spread pro-Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine as well as false and misleading claims about the U.S. and the international coalition that stands against Russia's war.“US to hold biggest satanic gathering in history,” claims one of the videos on Sputnik.Brasil, a Russian media account currently unlabeled on TikTok. Other videos posted by the account blame the U.S. for the war in Ukraine, claim the U.S. will start a nuclear war, and suggest the U.S. is working to make Brazil invade Iran.RT Mexico, one of the most popular unlabeled accounts, has posted multiple videos playing up tension between the U.S. and Mexico over immigration and drugs.“This is a huge win for Russian propaganda that they’re able to reach such large audiences on TikTok,” said Joe Bodnar, a research analyst at Alliance for Securing Democracy. “TikTok is not taking it as seriously as other platforms.”That charge comes as the video sharing platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, faces questions in Washington about its ties to the government as well as concerns about privacy, surveillance and harmful content.Britain, Canada, the U.S. federal government and a growing number of American states are among the governments that have already banned TikTok on government-issued devices. Some lawmakers in the U.S. have floated the idea of a complete ban on the app unless ByteDance agreed to sell its U.S. assets to another company.TikTok has labeled more than 120 accounts, a spokesperson for the platform told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The platform's policy covers outlets and organizations, not individuals, a loophole that allows RT's editor-in-chief to remain unlabeled.The platform said it would label many of the other accounts identified by researchers after being contacted by the AP.“This is an ongoing process and we’ll continue to review new accounts and add labels as and when they join the platform,” the company said in an emailed statement.Other tech companies have taken a more aggressive approach to Russian disinformation. Last year, Google blocked YouTube channels operated by Russian state media within Europe. The company also has initiated “pre-bunking” programs designed to blunt the effect of disinformation. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, also labels foreign state media and has exposed and eliminated sprawling disinformation networks tied to Russia.Once known largely for its popularity among teens, TikTok has emerged as a leading source of information — and misinformation. More than two-thirds of American teens are on the platform, which is among the world's most popular websites.Labels have become a common way for social media platforms to designate content from state-controlled media and alert users without removing the content. TikTok announced its labeling effort in March 2022, saying that “in response to the war in Ukraine, we’re expediting the rollout of our state media policy to bring viewers context to evaluate the content they consume on our platform.”While the labels may provide more information about an account, they aren't doing much to reduce overall engagement with Russian propaganda on TikTok, suggesting users either don't see or don't care about the labels.RT, one of Russia’s top state-controlled outlets, has more followers on TikTok than The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, despite a label classifying RT as ""Russia state-controlled media.”Another labeled TikTok account, RT en Espanol, has received more likes than other Spanish-language news outlets including Telemundo, Univision or El Pais.TikTok's use of labeling came up during a recent congressional hearing in which TikTok's CEO was questioned about the platform's ties to China and its record on safety and privacy. In his testimony, Shou Zi Chew said TikTok's labeling policy would also extend to Chinese state media outlets.Lawmakers were skeptical of his explanations.“I worry that TikTok is the world’s most powerful and extensive propaganda machine,” U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, said during last week's hearing.",2023/03/30,,World

In January 2023, grMail was named as a leader among email security service providers in Hong Kong and Singapore by market research company Frost & Sullivan. grMail provides comprehensive email security solutions that effectively intercept spam, viruses, malware, fake emails, phishing, CEO fraud, and other attacks via emails.        (From left) Mr. Kenneth Ma, Senior Vice President, Sales of Green Radar, and Mr. Alex Lau, CEO of Macro Systems       In recent years, various industries have faced multiple challenges on the I.T. front, such as a shortage of professional talent and resources. However, most companies have high requirements for I.T. efficiency and performance. Under this supply-demand problem, retaining professional I.T. talent has become extremely difficult. Companies lack of the workforce with relevant skills and knowledge to support the organization's drive to adopt advanced technologies.   Cyberattacks are becoming more complex, especially as 75% of attacks currently originate from email, and an increasing number of enterprise-phishing attacks disguise with local languages, BEC attacks, and trending topics, which are big challenges for in-house I.T. personnel. Green Radar's grMail is remediating such vulnerabilities shared by many companies. Through Green Radar's Security Operations Center (SOC) and Macro Systems' MSP service, A.I.-powered data can be seamlessly obtained from grMail. Operating 24x7 to enhance local threat intelligence, monitoring, and interception capabilities, establish security barriers, and diminish the impact of attacks, allowing enterprise customers to handle business without any concerns.   Mr. Kenneth Ma, Senior Vice President, Sales of Green Radar, said: ""We are pleased to join hands with Macro Systems. Green Radar's data shows that grMail has successfully intercepted many localized email attacks over the past year, protecting companies from unnecessary losses. On the other hand, hackers continue to launch attacks through a variety of patterns and content. Green Radar's Email Threat Index (GRETI) in Q4 2022 has slightly decreased compared to the previous quarter, but companies cannot take it lightly. Enterprises from all walks of life need to raise awareness of preventing network attacks and taking precautions.""   Mr. Alex Lau, CEO of Macro Systems, said: ""Cyberattacks and threat landscapes are constantly changing. Hong Kong enterprises will find it difficult to catch up and respond effectively solely based on their own hardware and software. Macro Systems provides customers with one-stop IT management services covering basic IT infrastructure, network security, the Internet of Things (IoT), A.I. etc. With Green Radar's unique and targeted technology, our advanced and proactive monitoring and problem-solving solutions can help customers actively combat cyberattacks and protect important information, reducing the cost of handling related problems for enterprises.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851444,China renews warnings as Taiwan's Tsai stops over in US,"BEIJING (AP) — As Taiwan's president began a stopover in the United States on her way to Central America, China said it was closely watching developments and would “resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and portrays the self-governing island democracy of 23 million people as the most sensitive issue in its increasingly fraught relationship with the U.S.On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated China's furious objections to any interactions between Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. officials.“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. “China will continue to closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.”China has particularly warned that a meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy planned for April 5 in Los Angeles would bring a strong but as yet unspecified response.In August, Beijing responded to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan by launching missiles, deploying warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of the island. China also temporarily suspended dialogue with the U.S. on climate and other major issues and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.Tsai's visit aims to show that Taiwan still has allies, despite China's military threats and attempts to isolate it diplomatically. Most recently, the Central American state of Honduras switched relations from Taipei to Beijing, leaving Taiwan with just 13 formal diplomatic allies. Tsai accused Beijing of using “dollar diplomacy” to poach another Taiwanese ally.Tsai is expected to meet with the American Institute in Taiwan chair, Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.While the U.S. terms relations with Taiwan as unofficial, it remains the island's chief source of military hardware and cooperation. U.S. law requires Washington to treat all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern,” but does not explicitly say whether the U.S. would commit troops.Tsai arrived in New York on Wednesday and was scheduled to spend Thursday in the city, but few details of the trip were made public.The U.S. typically foregoes any official meetings with senior U.S. leaders in Washington for transit stops, as is the case for Tsai's visit.The latest spike in tensions comes months after the passage of what the U.S. said was a Chinese spy balloon across the U.S., which heightened questions about China's intentions. China says it was a research balloon that was blown off course, but the Biden administration ordered it shot down over the east coast and canceled a planned visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China in the wake of the incident.Along with Taiwan and frictions over trade, technology and human rights, China’s close ties with Russia and its refusal to criticize Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine have also increased friction between Washington and Beijing.Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week, underscoring the warmth of the ""no-limits” relationship between the two authoritarian states announced just weeks before Russia's year-old invasion.China has provided Russia with an economic lifeline by buying up the oil-rich country's resources. U.S. officials say they've seen indications Beijing is considering selling military hardware to Moscow, although they say there is no evidence that has happened yet.Days after Xi's visit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press he hoped to meet with Xi in Kyiv. China, which has put forward a peace proposal that says nothing about Russia withdrawing from Ukrainian territory it has seized, gave no immediate response about whether such a visit would take place.Also Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei said Xi and Putin had reached “a number of important new points of consensus” during their Moscow meetings, laying out a ""blueprint for the future of relations.""“Strategic communication and practical cooperation between the two militaries have never ceased moving toward a higher level,” Tan said at a monthly briefing.While Tan repeated China's stance that its relations with Russia do not constitute a formal alliance and were not aimed at any third parties, the two have increasingly aligned their foreign policies in a challenge to the dominance of global affairs by the U.S. and other democracies.He also pledged regular joint air and sea patrols, exercises and training as the sides work together to implement ""global security initiatives (and) jointly safeguard international fairness and justice.""China has been steadily building up its 2-million-member armed forces — already the world's largest standing military — as well as latest-generation fighter jets, aircraft carriers and highly capable warships.U.S. military officials also say China is fast expanding its stockpile of nuclear weapons and recent tough-talk by Xi and other Chinese officials have heightened concerns over a potential attack on Taiwan or other U.S. interests.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851445,Report: Chinese state-sponsored hacking group highly active,"BANGKOK (AP) — A Chinese hacking group that is likely state-sponsored and has been linked previously to attacks on U.S. state government computers is still “highly active” and is focusing on a broad range of targets that may be of strategic interest to China's government and security services, a private American cybersecurity firm said in a new report Thursday.The hacking group, which the report calls RedGolf, shares such close overlap with groups tracked by other security companies under the names APT41 and BARIUM that it is thought they are either the same or very closely affiliated, said Jon Condra, director of strategic and persistent threats for Insikt Group, the threat research division of Massachusetts-based cybersecurity company Recorded Future.Following up on previous reports of APT41 and BARIUM activities and monitoring the targets that were attacked, Insikt Group said it had identified a cluster of domains and infrastructure “highly likely used across multiple campaigns by RedGolf” over the past two years.“We believe this activity is likely being conducted for intelligence purposes rather than financial gain due to the overlaps with previously reported cyberespionage campaigns,” Condra said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.China’s Foreign Ministry denied the accusations, saying, “This company has produced false information on so-called ‘Chinese hacker attacks’ more than once in the past. Their relevant actions are groundless accusations, far fetched, and lack professionalism.”Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, instead saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.APT41 was implicated in a 2020 U.S. Justice Department indictment that accused Chinese hackers of targeting more than 100 companies and institutions in the U.S. and abroad, including social media and video game companies, universities and telecommunications providers.In its analysis, Insikt Group said it found evidence that RedGolf “remains highly active” in a wide range of countries and industries, “targeting aviation, automotive, education, government, media, information technology and religious organizations.”Insikt Group did not identify specific victims of RedGolf, but said it was able to track scanning and exploitation attempts targeting different sectors with a version of the KEYPLUG backdoor malware also used by APT41.Insikt said it had identified several other malicious tools used by RedGolf in addition to KEYPLUG, “all of which are commonly used by many Chinese state-sponsored threat groups.”In 2022, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant reported that APT41 was responsible for breaches of the networks of at least six U.S. state governments, also using KEYPLUG.In that case, APT41 exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in an off-the-shelf commercial web application used by 18 states for animal health management, according to Mandiant, which is now owned by Google. It did not identify which states’ systems were compromised.Mandiant called APT41 “a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control.”Cyber intelligence companies use different tracking methodologies and often name the threats they identify differently, but Condra said APT41, BARIUM and RedGolf “likely refer to the same set of threat actor or group(s)” due to similarities in their online infrastructure, tactics, techniques and procedures.“RedGolf is a particularly prolific Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group that has likely been active for many years against a wide range of industries globally,” he said.“The group has shown the ability to rapidly weaponize newly reported vulnerabilities and has a history of developing and using a large range of custom malware families.”Insikt Group concluded that the use of KEYPLUG malware through certain types of command and control servers by RedGolf and similar groups is “highly likely to continue” and recommended that clients ensure they are blocked as soon as they are detected.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851446,Michel Der Zakarian sparks Montpellier's revival in France,"The old French saying “the best soups are made in old pots” certainly holds true for Montpellier.The family soccer club in southern France has a myriad of former players and coaches that are part of the organizational chart, or ready to come back and help out when things go wrong.That was the case in February when Michel Der Zakarian — known as “Der Zak” in the region — was reappointed as coach following the firing of Romain Pitau.The 2012 champions were only two points clear of the relegation zone following five losses in six matches and Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin thought the timing was right for a shakeup.“I hope and I think he is the man for the moment,” Nicollin said.His hopes have been fulfilled.Since Der Zakarian's return, less than two years after his departure, Montpellier is unbeaten, winning five of the six league games it has played. With 16 points taken, the club has been the best team in the league over that period.Ahead of Friday's trip to second-place Marseille, Der Zakarian's team looks all but guaranteed to stay in the top division next season, holding a 13-point lead over the highest relegation-zone club. With 10 matches left to play, Paris Saint-Germain has a seven-point lead over Marseille before hosting Lyon on Sunday.“To be sure of staying, we need two more wins,” Der Zakarian said.As a player, the 60-year-old former no-nonsense defender spent nearly a decade in Montpellier, getting the captain's armband when Laurent Blanc left for Napoli and leading the club to victory in the League Cup in 1992.After he retired, Der Zakarian joined Montpellier's technical staff and learned his trade as a coach with the reserve teams. Disappointed not to get the top coaching job, Der Zakarian left for Nantes in 2006.He finally was appointed Montpellier coach in 2017. His tenure lasted four seasons, leading his players to a sixth-place finish while building a team that was renowned for its defensive qualities.Der Zakarian returned with the same gritty philosophy and his current team has conceded only two goals in six matches.“The club has always had fighting values, that’s what I expect from the team,"" he said.The solid defending under Der Zakarian has been made possible by the recent addition of goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, another former Montpellier player who has already made 31 saves since his return to Stade de La Mosson. Two other recruits, left back Issiaga Sylla and center back Boubakar “Kiki” Kouyaté, have also impressed.Up front, Montpellier has found its firepower with 13 goals in six games as playmaker Teji Savanier recovered his influence in midfield while up-and-coming striker Elye Wahi piled up the goals.After scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Clermont before the international break, the 20-year-old forward has 12 league goals — his best tally over a single season. Gifted with speed and great technical skills, Wahi is reportedly sparking interest from top Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Tottenham.Der Zakarian has warned possible buyers they would need to spend a lot to secure Wahi's services.“The kid, he’s 20, and full of talent,” Der Zakarian told France Bleu Herault radio this week. “That costs a lot. For me, minimum 25 or 30 million (euros; $27-$32.5 million).”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851447,Finland says Russia spy operations weakened in Nordic nation,"HELSINKI (AP) — Expulsions of Russian intelligence officers and visa refusals have substantially weakened Moscow’s intelligence operations in neighboring Finland in the past year, the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service said Thursday.The intelligence agency, known by the abbreviation SUPO, said in a statement that Russian intelligence has been “squeezed” in the Nordic country because of the agency’s ability to compromise spy operations in 2022.“The Russian intelligence station (in Finland) shrank to about half of its former size last year,” SUPO Director Antti Pelttari said, adding that the main reason for the decline were expulsions of suspected spies and visa refusals on the advice of his agency.The falling number of intelligence officers and restrictions on travel across the Russian-Finland border amid Moscow's war in Ukraine have significantly undermined operating conditions for Russian spies in Finland, SUPO said.It noted that operations under diplomatic cover have traditionally been the main instrument of Russian intelligence abroad, and Moscow was seeking to use, among other methods, cyberespionge to make up for the shortfall in human intelligence.“While Russia is still seeking to station intelligence officers under diplomatic cover, it will have to find ways of compensating for the human intelligence shortfall, such as by increasingly adopting other forms of covert operation abroad,” Pelttari said.The agency said that Russia, China and “certain other countries” were the most active users of intelligence operations to acquire information for their own ends and against the interests of Finland.Finland, a nation of 5.5 million people, applied for NATO membership together with neighboring Sweden in May. It shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) land border with Russia, the longest of any European Union member.SUPO has earlier said that Finland’s future NATO membership will make the Nordic country a more interesting target for Russian intelligence and influencing operations, and Moscow may seek to acquire NATO-related intelligence through its neighbor.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851448,Tuchel's return heats up high-stakes Bayern-Dortmund clash,"BERLIN (AP) — Thomas Tuchel’s unexpected appointment as Bayern Munich coach has added even more spice to “der Klassiker.”Tuchel, who took over after Bayern fired Julian Nagelsmann last Friday, will face former club Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in his first match back in Germany.Dortmund fired Tuchel three days after the team won the 2017 German Cup because he had fallen out with club officials and players over his two seasons in charge. There were disagreements with chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke, sports director Michael Zorc, chief scout Sven Mislintat and others.“We couldn’t see a basis for continued work together built on trust,” Watzke said at the time.Bayern is gambling on Tuchel shaking up the team for the decisive part of the season after a 2-1 loss at Bayer Leverkusen dropped the 10-time defending champions one point behind Dortmund going into Saturday’s match in Munich.Dortmund’s visit is looming as arguably the biggest game of the season — a potential title decider with eight games remaining afterward. Only a win will ease fears of decline at Bayern and wrest the league outcome from Dortmund’s control.“The challenge can’t be any greater,” Tuchel said at his presentation on Saturday.Tuchel also fell out with club officials at Paris Saint-Germain before his dismissal in December 2020, and there were similar reports of disagreements before he was fired by Chelsea last year.Tuchel had had an immediate effect at Chelsea, winning the 2021 Champions League after only four months in charge, and Bayern is hoping for a similar impact. Bayern faces Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals 10 days after “der Klassiker.”Tuchel will only have a full team to work with from Friday because of the international break — Canada defender Alphonso Davies is expected to be the last player to return.The coach’s team talks are going to be important with players like Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka particularly close to Nagelsmann. The latter said Nagelsmann’s firing was a “shock for everyone.”The break was timely for Dortmund, which had to contend with a long injury list for its last game — a 6-1 win over Cologne.“We’ll have a few back at the weekend,” Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl said, referring to the absences of midfielder Julian Brandt, goalkeeper Gregor Kobel, and forwards Karim Adeyemi, Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and Youssoufa Moukoko.Germany defender Nico Schlotterbeck returned from international duty with a thigh problem but should be ready for Dortmund on Saturday. Jamal Musiala could return for Bayern.Kehl, who took over from Zorc last year, said Bayern’s appointment of Tuchel will have little influence on the game.“I don’t know if FC Bayern will be better Saturday with Thomas Tuchel than before under Julian Nagelsmann,” Kehl said. “I don’t think the coaching personnel will really affect this game.”The last time Dortmund faced an opponent that just hired one of its former coaches, Leipzig won 3-0 under Marco Rose in September. But that was early in the season and Dortmund has looked much better since the winter break.Dortmund was nine points behind Bayern at the turn of the year and has since won all but one of its 10 league games. Schalke grabbed a 2-2 draw in the Ruhr derby.Dortmund has struggled in Munich before, losing on its last eight visits in the league since a meaningless 3-0 win in April 2014 when Bayern was already champion. Kehl was still playing for Dortmund at the time.“The guys are really looking forward to the game because we have a big chance,” Kehl said of Dortmund’s title aspirations this season. “We can go there with a lot of confidence. We earned it in the last few weeks. We’re much more stable, more settled.”It’s also a chance for Bayern.The last time Dortmund arrived in Munich as league leader in April 2019, Bayern cruised to a 5-0 victory to retake the lead and go on to win another title. Dortmund could only win once in six visits as leader — in February 2012 when Robert Lewandowski scored for a 1-0 win to set Dortmund on its way to defending the title.Bayern has won every title since.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851449,"Tears, anger as Indonesian soccer fears FIFA sanctions","JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian soccer players and fans reacted with tears and outrage after the country was stripped of hosting rights for the Under-20 World Cup only eight weeks before the start of the tournament amid political turmoil over Israel’s participation, leaving Indonesian soccer at risk of further sanctions.The youth soccer event was expected to be a rare turn on the global soccer stage for a country that hasn't been to the World Cup since winning independence. But it was officially canceled Wednesday after two regional governors said they would not allow an Israeli team to play in their territories.FIFA said Indonesia was removed from staging the 24-team tournament scheduled to start on May 20 “due to the current circumstances,” without specifying details.In an emotional meeting with Indonesian youth players and their coach in Jakarta on Thursday, Zainudin Amali, deputy chair of the national soccer association, apologized. Some players were seen shedding tears while others looked down sadly.“It’s a heartbreaking decision that ruined our dreams, and now we are confused about our future as players if FIFA imposes sanctions,” said Hokky Caraka, a striker in Indonesia’s U-20 national team, “It's the players who suffer the most,” he said.Shin Tae-yong, a South Korean former professional footballer and manager who is coaching the Indonesia national football team, said Indonesia’s failure to host the U-20 World Cup is a big loss.“I am hurt!” he said, “I can feel the sadness and mental breakdown of the players. They have prepared tirelessly alongside me in the last three and a half years.""Popular social media were flooded with outraged comments from disappointed fans. Many blamed politics a year ahead of a presidential election. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel.“Indonesia’s name in international sports is tarnished, this is a bitter event in our soccer history,” said Andieka Rabbani, a university student in the capital, Jakarta.He added that Israeli delegations have been to Indonesia for sporting and diplomatic events before, including four Israelis who competed in the World Cycling Championship last month in Jakarta.A number of members of the Israeli Parliament also attended an Interparliamentary Union conference in Bali last year and were warmly welcomed by Indonesian House Speaker Puan Maharani, the granddaughter of Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno, and by Bali Governor Wayan Koster, who was the first to reject the Israeli youth soccer team.“Our stance on the U-20 World Cup is too politicized because a presidential election is coming,” Rabbani said.Arya Sinulingga, a national soccer association executive committee member, expressed concern about further repercussions.“This is a sign that we are not able to carry out what has been asked (by FIFA) ... among other things that there should be no discrimination,” Sinulingga said in an interview with local television. “What we are most worried about right now is that we will be ostracized from international events, especially from world soccer activities.”The Indonesian soccer federation could be further disciplined by FIFA. A suspension could remove Indonesia from Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The continental qualifiers start in October.The decision followed a meeting in Doha, Qatar, between Indonesian soccer federation president Erick Thohir and Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body.Thohir, the former president of Italian club Inter Milan and a former co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, said as a member of FIFA, Indonesia had little choice but to accept the decision.“I have tried my best,” he said in a statement. “After delivering a letter from President Joko Widodo and discussing it at length with the president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, we must accept FIFA’s decision to cancel this event that we were both looking forward to.”He said FIFA ""considered that the current situation cannot be continued.”Soccer and public authorities in Indonesia agreed to FIFA’s hosting rules, which require hosts to accept all qualifying teams, in 2019 before being selected to stage the 2021 edition of the Under-20 World Cup. The coronavirus pandemic forced the tournament to be postponed for two years.Indonesia has long had an uneasy relationship with FIFA, which rejected its long-shot bid to host the 2022 World Cup early in the campaign in 2010 because mandatory paperwork was not filed. FIFA also removed Indonesia from the 2018 World Cup qualification program over government interference in the domestic league.Thohir’s appointment this year to run Indonesian soccer was intended to bring more stability.President Widodo urged people to respect FIFA's ruling.“I know this decision has disappointed many people. I also feel the same, disappointed and sad,” Widodo said Thursday evening.“But don’t waste our energy by blaming each other. As a great nation we must look forward, not backward. Make this a valuable lesson for all of us, for Indonesian national football.”He said he has asked Thohir to make every effort so Indonesia will not be further sanctioned by FIFA.Israel qualified in June last year for its first Under-20 World Cup by reaching the semifinals of the Under-19 European Championship. The team went on to lose to England in that final.Israel has played in Europe since the 1970s after leaving the Asian Football Confederation for political and security reasons.___Dunbar reported from Zurich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851450,Russia to keep missile test notices under Cold War-era deal,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia will continue to give the U.S. advance notice about its missile tests despite suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the two countries, a top Russian diplomat said Thursday.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov's statement followed his comments on Wednesday, when he said Moscow had halted all information exchanges with Washington envisioned under the 2011 New START nuclear pact, including missile test warnings.On Thursday, he clarified that Russia intends to stick by its pledge last month to keep notifying the U.S. about missile tests in line with a 1988 U.S.-Soviet agreement, Ryabkov said.Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended the country's participation in the New START treaty last month, saying Russia couldn't allow U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow’s defeat in Ukraine as their goal.Moscow emphasized at the time that it wasn’t withdrawing from the pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty set.Earlier this week, the U.S. announced that Moscow and Washington have stopped sharing biannual nuclear weapons data as envisioned by New START. U.S. officials said Washington had offered to continue providing the information after Putin suspended Russia's participation, but Moscow told Washington it wouldn't share its own data.The termination of information exchanges under the pact marked yet another attempt by the Kremlin to discourage the West from ramping up its support for Ukraine by pointing to Russia’s massive nuclear arsenal. Last weekend, Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of Moscow’s ally Belarus.Along with data about the current state of the countries’ nuclear forces routinely released every six months, the parties to the New START treaty also exchanged advance warnings about test launches and deployments of their nuclear weapons.Such notices have been an essential element of strategic stability for decades, allowing Russia and the United States to correctly interpret each other’s moves and make sure that neither country mistakes a test launch for a missile attack.Ryabkov wouldn't say if the 1988 U.S.-Soviet agreement would cover all the missile tests that Russia was obliged to issue notices about under New START.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851451,Bolsonaro returns to Brazil after 3-month stint in Florida,"BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Former President Jair Bolsonaro returned Thursday to Brazil after a three-month stint in Florida following his election loss, and the right-wing populist told supporters he doesn’t think leftists will be in power in Brazil for long.Bolsonaro, who is the subject of several investigations that could stymie any attempts at a political comeback, arrived in a capital under tight security. Authorities sought to avoid any repeat of Jan. 8 events when supporters who didn’t accept his defeat stormed government buildings. Police in Brasilia blocked the main artery to those buildings.Hundreds of supporters dressed in Brazil's national colors of yellow and green chanted for Bolsonaro as they awaited his arrival, but his return did not draw the huge crowds many of his allies had expected. That appeared to please his opponents; current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's minister of institutional relations, Alexandre Padilha, called the reception a “flop.”The former president said in his first speech after touching down that his leftist successor and his allies “will not do whatever they want to the fate of our nation,” and added that the left will only keep power “for now, for a little while.”Speaking in front of a banner that read “today Brazil woke up stronger,” Bolsonaro said he would spend as much time as necessary at the headquarters of his Liberal Party to help the campaign for next year’s municipal races when the country elects 5,500 mayors nationwide.Bolsonaro left Brazil just before the end of his presidential term. In so doing, he broke with tradition by declining to hand the presidential sash to his successor, Lula, who won the October election with the narrowest finish since Brazil’s return to democracy over three decades earlier.While in the U.S., Bolsonaro mostly kept a low profile, although he delivered several speeches to Brazilian expats and conservatives, including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.The Brazilian leader said his three months in Florida had helped give him a vision for the future. ""Everything we saw there is what we want to implement here. The most important thing is liberty.”For the first time in three decades, the lawmaker-turned-president does not hold elected office.“I am coming here in the position of an elder, an experienced person who will be consulted by whomever wishes. I will give opinions,” Bolsonaro said.Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said Bolsonaro had to return to confront his many legal problems, and to fend off rivals who might claim his role as leader of the right. But the new political landscape will pose a challenge, Melo said.""It is hard for him to lead the opposition, because his career was as an outsider,” Melo said. “Now, he isn't an outsider and he isn't president. He will have to build a new path.”The hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters who gathered at Brasilia International Airport early Thursday did not not get to see the far-right leader come out the main exit and instead gathered outside his Liberal Party’s headquarters. The former president was welcomed at the airport by his son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, and Liberal Party chairman Valdemar da Costa Neto.“Bolsonaro was the best president we’ve ever had, I had never seen an administration like his,” said Marinalva Wanderley, 71, who brought five members of her family from Sao Paulo to the Liberal Party’s headquarters. “I think he was in the U.S. with Donald Trump to see what is best for Brazil and the U.S. We will have a much bigger opposition (to Lula), that’s for sure.""Bolsonaro’s statements will make headlines and his loyal following will turn out for public appearances, but the immediate political impact for Lula’s administration appears limited, Christopher Garman, managing director at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, wrote in a report.“I noticed he was more balanced today,” lawmaker Sóstenes Cavalcante, coordinator of Congress’ evangelical caucus and a Bolsonaro ally, said by phone. “I believe he will stay quiet and let Lula make mistakes on his own.”In next year’s municipal elections, Bolsonaro is expected to throw his support behind his Liberal Party’s mayoral candidates who, if victorious, can then use their stature to stump for him or his chosen standard-bearer. The party will begin setting up trips across the country for Bolsonaro and his wife, Michelle, who is coordinating party outreach to female voters.“His party understands that being away will do little to mitigate his legal woes and that he should be home to start playing the role of the leading opposition voice,” Garman wrote.Bolsonaro is the subject of a series of investigations, including whether he incited the Jan. 8 uprising. Recent revelations by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo regarding three boxes of expensive jewelry allegedly brought to Bolsonaro from Saudi Arabia have exposed the former president to greater legal jeopardy.In addition to probes into the diamonds, there are about a dozen investigations by Brazil’s electoral courts into his actions during last year’s campaign, particularly related to his unsubstantiated claims that the electronic voting system is susceptible to fraud. If Bolsonaro is found guilty in any of those cases, he would lose his political rights and be unable to run for office in the next election.On Thursday, the former president denied any wrongdoing regarding the jewels. “I didn't hide anything,"" he said.___Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro and Bridi reported from Brasilia.AP journalist Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Sao Paulo.",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851497,Exploring the Potential of Artificial Intelligence in Education and Learning,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many industries, and education is no exception. AI-based technologies are being employed to enhance learning experiences, assist teachers and administrators, as well as aid students in their studies more efficiently. In this article, we’ll look into some of the potential uses of AI in education and learning, along with some innovative technology solutions currently being employed in this area.One of the major advantages of AI in education is its potential to personalize learning experiences for students. AI algorithms can analyze data about a student’s patterns, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses to provide tailored recommendations on study materials, activities, and assessments. This allows learners to progress at their own pace while taking into account individual needs.Another potential application of AI in education is to assist teachers and administrators. AI-powered chatbots, for instance, can quickly answer common student queries or offer basic administrative help. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms could also be utilized to analyze student feedback and pinpoint areas where teachers could improve their instruction.In addition to these more general applications, there are also many technology ideas tailored for education. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), for instance, use AI algorithms to deliver personalized instruction and feedback to students. ITS systems can adapt according to individual learners’ learning styles and progress while offering targeted assistance when necessary. Automated essay scoring also uses machine learning algorithms to grade student essays based on criteria such as coherence, grammar, and content.AI is also being utilized to support distance learning and online education. Chatbots and virtual assistants can offer support to students learning remotely, while AI-powered speech recognition tools help language learners hone their speaking and pronunciation skills. Furthermore, AI-powered recommendation engines suggest courses, resources, and learning materials based on a student’s interests and prior learning history.Though AI offers many potential benefits in education, there are also some concerns and challenges that need to be addressed. Some people worry that AI could replace human teachers or be used for monitoring students without consent in an invasive or unethical way. Others worry about bias or discrimination within AI algorithms, particularly if they are used in making decisions regarding student outcomes or educational opportunities.To address these concerns, AI technologies must be designed and implemented ethically, transparently, and accountable. This includes guaranteeing algorithms are free from bias, protecting student privacy, and providing clear explanations and justifications for any decisions made by these systems.In conclusion, AI has the potential to revolutionize education in many exciting and innovative ways. From personalized learning to teacher support to online education, many technology ideas are being explored that could improve quality and accessibility of education for students worldwide. Nonetheless, it’s essential that we approach AI in education with caution and guarantee these technologies are used ethically and responsible ways.",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851499,Taiwan's National Palace Museum organizes exhibition to showcase repaired relics,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The National Palace Museum announced on Thursday (March 30) that it has repaired the three artifacts broken in 2022 and will present them in an exhibition highlighting the museum’s restoration work.In October 2022, reports about artifacts being broken at the National Palace Museum snowballed into a scandal that raised questions about the museum’s authority and procedures. The museum’s director at the time, Wu Mi-cha (吳密察), was accused of attempting to cover up the incidents, though he denied such claims.Wu admitted in a press conference on Oct. 29 that on Feb. 3, 2021 and April 7, 2022, while staff members were organizing artifacts, they discovered upon opening packages that a Ming dynasty (1368-1644) “yellow teacup with two green dragons” and a Qing dynasty (1636–1911) ""yellow teacup with dragon pattern” were damaged. Additionally, on May 19, 2022, due to staff mishandling, a Qing dynasty “blue-and-white floral plate” fell and broke.Wu said the three broken artifacts had never been put on display and were not insured. He estimated the value of the items did not exceed NT$2.5 billion (US$77.85 million).UDN reported Incumbent General-affairs Deputy Director Yu Pei-chin as apologizing for the controversy the museum had caused last year as well as the museum’s lost credibility. She said procedures at the museum have been adjusted to prevent similar incidents from occurring again, and the museum now regularly trains its staff in handling artifacts.From Friday (March 31) to June 10, the museum will hold the “Investigation and Restoration of Cultural Relics at the National Palace Museum” exhibition that demonstrates how artifacts ranging from calligraphy, painting, rare books, historical documents, objects, and textiles are conserved, maintained, and repaired.“In this exhibition, visitors will learn about the Museum’s conservation science and conservation techniques, and glimpse this cross-disciplinary practice that encompasses the humanities, technology and conservation,” the introduction reads.By organizing the exhibition, Yu said, the museum hopes to establish a new beginning.",2023/03/30,717,Culture

Samsung is building a chip plant in Texas that could cost more than $25 billion and has said it is reviewing the guidelines.However, funding applications may require detailed cost structure information as well as projected wafer yields, utilisation rates and price changes, which three Korean chip sources told Reuters was akin to revealing corporate strategy.""All of this is confidential information. The most important thing in chips is cost structure. Experts will be able to tell our strategy at a glance,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Speaking at an industry event in Taiwan, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, said it had concerns too.""We are still discussing with them. There are some conditions that cannot be accepted. We hope that they can be adjusted so there will be no negative effect. We will continue to talk to the U.S. government,"" Mark Liu told reporters.TSMC is investing $40 billion in a new plant in Arizona.The U.S. Department of Commerce will accept subsidy applications for leading-edge chip facilities from March 31, and for current-generation, mature-node and back-end production facilities from June 26.Also on Thursday, South Korea's parliament approved a bill offering large tax breaks to strategic industries - including the semiconductor industry - which invest at home, to strengthen supply-chain security while boosting the economy.The approval comes in the same month the government announced a 550 trillion won ($424 billion) private-sector investment plan to maintain the competitiveness of high-tech industries while other countries are actively bolstering theirs.",2023/03/30,1416,Business

Overall, the crime level last year was ""comparable"" to that of the last pre-COVID year, 2019, Münch argued.The release of the figures is likely to add fuel to an ongoing debate in Germany over whether to lower the age of criminal responsibility. Under German law, children reach the age of criminal responsibility at 14 — before which they can prosecuted for committing a criminal offense. In some other countries, the age of criminal responsibility is lower: In England and Wales, the age of criminal responsibility is 10, while in France children can be sentenced at 13.The debate was reignited by the killing of 12-year-old girl Luise F. from the town of Freudenberg in North Rhine-Westphalia on March 11. Two girls aged 12 and 13 are suspected of carrying out the killing. The authorities say the autopsy found multiple knife wounds and that the victim bled to death. The two girls, who are said to have confessed to the crime, have since been taken into the care of the Youth Welfare Office.The crime statistics from other German states released earlier last week reflect an overall trend of rising crime among young people. In the southern state of Baden-Württemberg, for example, the number of child suspects went up by 33.4% on the previous year. A total of 10,490 children aged 13 and under were suspected of crimes in the south-western state in 2022.The figures prompted Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Thomas Strobl and Justice Minister Marion Gentges, both from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), to write a letter to their counterparts in the federal government called for the age of criminal responsibility to be reviewed.In the letter, which referred to the Luise F., the ministers ask ""whether today the mental and moral maturity of young people begins earlier than it did in 1923"" when the law relating to the age of criminal responsibility was introduced.Calls to lower the age of criminal responsibility have also come from Rainer Wendt, the head of the German Police Union (DPolG). ""It's not about punishing children or sending them to jail, but about influencing their behavior, and criminal proceedings are very effective at doing that,"" Wendt told DW, adding that he believes children today mature much earlier than in previous decades.""Courts can impose orders, they can monitor those orders, they can issue restraining orders and impose curfews,"" Wendt said. ""The Youth Welfare Office can't do any of that without the support of the parents, and, depending on the milieu in which the parents operate, there could be no cooperation at all.""But the consensus among psychologists, social workers, and criminologists is largely against lowering the age of criminal responsibility.""I think [the debate] is completely inappropriate, unserious and unhelpful,"" Sibylle Winter, a child psychiatrist and senior consultant at Berlin's Charité hospital, told DW, adding that severe acts of violence such as the Luise F. killing were ""absolutely isolated incidents.""As far as the new statistics are concerned, Winter urges caution when it comes to identifying an overall trend showing more violence among children. In 2015, 79,371 crimes were committed by children under 14. That steadily declined until 2021 to reach 68,725. The number of crimes committed by 14 to 18-year-olds also fell from 218,025 cases in 2015 to 154,889 in 2021.""I can imagine that it is a peak following the COVID-19 pandemic, because the pandemic increased the psychological stress on children and young people, violence in family homes increased, but it will probably calm down again,"" Winter said.The child psychiatrist also rejects the idea that children today are more mature than in previous decades. Although children under the age of 14 are assumed to know the difference between right and wrong in simple situations, the evidence from developmental psychology shows that the same does not apply to more complex situations.""Cognitively they are definitely not more mature,"" she says. ""They are also definitely exposed to more risks through this whole social media situation that we have - they are online much more and are confronted with content that they can't process properly.""Winter argues that whether or not there are existing psychological issues, a range of effective measures can be applied independently of the criminal justice system.""Anyone who commits such a one-time act of serious violence must face some consequences, and these are also available within the framework of the youth welfare system and family court proceedings,"" Winter concluded.Torsten Verrel, the head of the Department of Criminology at the University of Bonn, is also against lowering the age of criminal responsibility. He says that the debate always reignites in aftermath of rare but extreme cases of child delinquency.""There's a nice adage from the US that says: hard cases make bad law,"" Verrel told DW, adding that the idea that lowering the age of criminal responsibility would be an effective deterrent for children is simply naive.""Child crime usually takes the form of shoplifting and damage to property, all that would come within the scope of criminal law and nobody wants that,"" he says. ""Thankfully our political system is stable and sensitive enough to realize that this is a very populist demand that would lead to huge problems in practice.""The evidence from countries such as the US, England and Wales shows that lowering the age of criminal responsibility does not prevent children from committing crimes, says Friedrich Lösel, former director of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology and now a professor of psychology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.""The key issue is that are no clear age thresholds in development. In fact, some are advocating that the threshold should now go up until early adulthood because the brain is not yet fully developed before 28 or so,"" Lösel told DW.""I think we must really protect these young people as far as possible, but we should not only see them as victims,"" he added. ""They have intentionally carried out a serious offense and we need very intensive rehabilitative measures, in some cases in secure units.""Edited by Ben KnightWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851528,Japanese high-tech toilet company eyes Europe,"Later this year, Eric Fior and his Japanese partner will visit France for the first time in more than three years.He is excited about seeing his friends and family once again — but he has one serious concern after living in Japan for more than a decade.He is dreading missing out on all the comforts and convenience of Japanese toilets.""We are spoiled in many ways in Japan — the food, trains that run on time, people always being polite to each other — but for me, one of the very best aspects of living here is the toilets,"" said 50-year-old Fior, who owns a language school in Japan's second-largest city, Yokohama.""After all this time I certainly take it for granted, but I know I am going to miss Japanese toilets when I use the ones my family have in their homes in and around Toulouse.""Toto is Japan's largest and most famous brand manufacturer of bathroom products, which has for decades been applying technology to perfect the humble lavatory.Toto pioneered the introduction of toilet seats that are warmed to the user's preferred settings, with the most advanced versions automatically adjusting to the ambient temperature and the time of day.Toilets, including some new public conveniences, incorporate panels on which the user can adjust the seat temperature, the strength of the flush to reduce the amount of water consumed, and even an option that plays music or other sounds to cover up any embarrassing noises.Arguably the most innovative design feature that Toto has come up with so far, however, is the ""Washlet"" shower function.At the touch of another button, an arm emerges from beneath the seat to spray water on the user's bare bottom. Naturally, the strength of the jet of water, its temperature and the direction of the spray can all be adjusted on the control panel.And when that delicate procedure has been completed, yet another function blows warm air over the user's behind to dry it off.American actor Leonardo DiCaprio was reportedly so taken by Toto's toilets that he shelled out $3,200 (€2,943) for a top-of-the-range Toto Neorest 500 lavatory, which is equipped with sensors that automatically lift the lid when someone approaches. It also incorporates, of course, the ""Washlet"" personal cleansing system.Toto's products are available in Europe but, in contrast to the product's homeland, they remain relatively uncommon. That, however, appears set to change.In an interview with Japan's Jiji Press at an international trade fair for interior home equipment in Frankfurt in mid-March, Toto President Noriaki Kiyota dropped a heavy hint that the company is looking to expand its presence in the European market.Kiyota said Toto intends to increase its overseas sales to account for more than 50% of its total sales by 2030 — and also noted that, at present, products for Europe are manufactured in Japan and India.""Ultimately, we will make products in the countries where they are used,"" Kiyota said, suggesting that a new production facility is being considered for Germany, where the company has its European base in Düsseldorf.A spokesperson for the company at its headquarters in Fukuoka, in southern Japan, played down the claim that a firm decision has been made but confirmed that local production for local markets is the ultimate aim.""We sell our toilets in Europe to all countries that are in the European Union, plus Switzerland and the UK,"" said Anja Giersiepen, senior marketing manager for Toto Europe.""Our 'Washlet' is getting more and more popular in Europe,"" she told DW.""Our biggest market is Germany, and in 2021 we did a little research about the reasons why customer purchased our products.""The study showed that the single most important reason for a Washlet purchase was cleanliness and personal hygiene, accounting for more than 50% of replies to the multiple-choice questionnaire. Around 40% cited the comfort of the equipment, with another 30% saying the sophisticated toilets gave a sense of luxury.Well over 20% said they were particularly impressed with the heated seat, while others praised Toto's bathroom equipment for being easy to clean and environmentally friendly.""Cleanliness and comfort were the two most popular reasons,"" Giersiepen said. ""And 40 years of experience in the production of 'Washlets' with 60 million units sold worldwide has proved to be a reliable argument for many first-time customers to buy our products.""For his part, Fior is considering a drastic solution to his upcoming two-week absence from heated toilet seats and a built-in bidets.""We always take something back as a souvenir, and this year I am seriously considering buying a Washlet so I will be able to use it while we are there,"" he said.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/30,,

How China continues to interact with Putin's war will be a determining factor for EU-China relations going forward,"" von der Leyen said.More pressing for Brussels would also be the difference with the United States on how to address China's growing economic power and military might.US President Joe Biden's administration has been trying to persuade the EU and its members to work together to confront China.However, von der Leyen, was clear, ""we do not want to cut economic, societal, political and scientific ties.""Instead, she said the focus should be on ensuring trade and investment relations promoting prosperity in China and in the EU.The European Commission would, however, present ideas later this year on measures that could control outbound investment to prevent certain sensitive technologies from going to China.""This would relate to a small number of sensitive technologies where investment can lead to the development of military capabilities that pose risks to national security,"" von der Leyen said.French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that von der Leyen would accompany him on an upcoming visit to China.After a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Macron said he had asked von der Leyen to come with him for part of the trip to present a ""united voice"" to China.It would be von der Leyen's first visit to Beijing as Commission president.""We must collectively show that our democratic system, our values, our open economy can deliver prosperity and security for people. And at the same time, we must always be ready to talk and work with those who see the world differently,"" von der Leyen said.The  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he would visit China soon, although the date of the trip is still to be finalized.The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, was in Beijing in December.lo/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/30,,

His colleague Francesca Abel noted on Twitter that he had been fully accredited by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and called ""an excellent thoughtful journalist who cares deeply about his work...these allegations are absurd.""Gershkovich, who has also worked for several other international media outlets in the past, has long covered Russia and Ukraine. His most recent series of articles for the Journal cover the economic distress of ordinary Russians as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, as well as highlighting the voices of disillusioned Russian soldiers and the clampdown against the anti-war movement across the country.Gershkovich was detained in the city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains. FSB has offered no evidence for its claims.If convicted of espionage, Gershkovich faces up to 20 years imprisonment.Russia has tightened censorship laws since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in what Moscow refers to as a ""special military operation.""Andrei Soldatov, who writes about Russia's security agencies from outside the country, said on social media: ""Evan Gershkovich is a very good and brave journalist, not a spy, for Christ's sake. [His detention] is a frontal attack on all foreign correspondents who still work in Russia. And it means that the FSB is off the leash.""This is not the first time Russian or foreign journalists have found themselves detained following critical coverage of the war. Last year, Russia jailed a former defense reporter, Ivan Safronov, for 22 years on treason charges.Moscow has also been accused of arresting US basketball star Brittney Griner for political purposes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851533,A warm winter threatens Europe's rivers — and energy security,"A relatively mild winter in Europe helped stave off an energy crisis there this past winter, but the warm weather itself is now threatening the energy system in other ways.""At the moment, we are in a more comfortable position than expected at the beginning of the winter: gas prices came down by over 80% compared to their August highs, and storage levels are more than double the ones in the same period last year,"" Gergely Molnar, Gas Analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA), told DW.""But caution is needed,"" he added.The European and global gas markets remain fragile. ""Any exogenous risk can destabilize them. This year, there is not much flexibility left in the system,"" Molnar explained.Gas demand in the European Union fell 13% year-on-year in 2022, the biggest on record. Meanwhile, electricity generated by hydropower, which is made from water flowing into turbines, registered an 18% drop in 2022, according to an IEA analysis. Without this decline, Europe could have saved even more gas, a necessity after major producer Russia cut off flows to the bloc last year.The fall in hydropower production led to an increase in gas consumption, Molnar said . Historically, hydropower is Europe's second-largest renewable electricity source. It provided 17% of the EU's electricity in 2020, according to Eurostat.Currently, the amount of water in the European reservoirs is almost 15% higher than levels registered in 2022, despite the dry winter in France and the little snow in the Alps, says Molnar.""But water reservoir levels can fluctuate significantly,"" he explained. ""There is a lot of uncertainty around hydropower output.""The International Hydropower Association (IHA) says that significant investments are needed for water facilities to support the energy transition, while acting like climate mitigators and adapters. ""The need for grid-level flexibility is only going to increase with the rise of solar and wind technologies,"" Alex Campbell, IHA's head of research and policy, told DW. New infrastructures can help manage floods and summer droughts, he added.Lower water levels and higher water temperatures over the summer can influence nuclear power production as well, as river water is often used to handle the nuclear waste heat discharge.""If the temperature of the rivers goes over certain levels, it can impact the nuclear fleet. We saw it last year, but also in the previous years, both in France and Belgium,” said Molnar.Rivers are also central for coal shipping. ""Once the Rhine levels drop, it can cause logistical issues to coal plants, but coal operators usually have stocks, so low water levels do not immediately translate into issues, "" the IEA analyst said.These long-term trends require attention and a profound rethinking of energy systems, says Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). January 2023 was the third warmest January on record in Europe, but this itself would not mean that much, Buontempo told DW.""2022 was one of the eight warmest years, "" he said, ""and the other seven all occurred in the last eight years. Winters in Europe are getting warmer, and there are consequences.""Accounting for snow melt requires an element of predictability in the energy field, as it accumulates in winter and is then available in summer. But over the last 30 years, the ice thickness of Europe's glaciers has decreased by 30 meters on average. The amount of snow, which includes snow in glaciers and other mountain sections, is equally alarming for water levels going forward.""This year, we are not in a situation dissimilar to last year. With respect to last year, there is an extra challenge: we are coming from a rather dry year, many parts of Europe are still in near-drought conditions,"" said Buontempo.Summer weather, alongside spring precipitation, is another key factor that will impact river levels. High summer temperatures increase water temperatures and evaporation while also pushing up electricity demand, especially in Northern Europe.""The rising temperatures demand air conditioning in cities and new geographies,"" said Buontempo. ""Peak domestic energy demand in northern Europe occurs in winter, but we are now seeing a second peak in summer.""Unexpected climate events are additional risks for the EU's energy security. Buontempo recalls how Europe experienced a wind drought in 2021. ""We can dig deep into our risks, using the worst-case scenario, and start from there as a reference point,” he said.Risk modeling and reliable data are particularly relevant to be prepared.""We have to leverage the information we have about what could happen this year, one being the snow in the Alps,” the C3S director said. ""The April-May forecasts could then give us better guidance for the summer. ""Edited by: Kristie Pladson",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851540,Japanese surfer nears 90 and talks of catching waves at 100,"FUJISAWA, Japan (AP) — A busy company owner for the early part of his life, Seiichi Sano began anew at 80 by climbing Mt. Fuji. Apparently not challenged enough by Japan's highest peak, he almost immediately took up surfing.Sano turns 90 later this year, and after being recognized by Guinness World Records as the oldest male to surf, he's ready for other tests.“Maybe I'll try bouldering,” he said, suggesting he might do it first in a gym. “Outside it might be a bit dangerous.”He ruled out bungee-jumping. “Too scary,” he said.Or maybe he'll just stick with what he knows.“I think it would be interesting to try to surf until I'm 100,” Sano said. “I think I take better care of myself when I have goals like this. Even now, I take better care of myself than I did before.”Sano lives about 20 minutes from Yokohama and gets out most weekends on the black-sand beach near Enoshima, the small island that hosted sailing for the recent Tokyo Olympics, and was the harbor for the 1964 Games.He said he was inspired by an employee at his local bank, who was always tan and didn't look like a typical banker. His secret, he said, was surfing. So Sano followed up and found a teacher.“I don't consider myself an old man,” he said in his wet suit, board standing alongside. “I have never thought of myself as an old person. I always feel that I can still move forward. I can still do it. I can still enjoy it.”Enoshima is an area of small waves, which suits Sano. He joined hundreds of other surfers on Thursday, waiting for the larger waves to come. All the surfers were younger, of course. Several were elementary school or junior high age who also work with Sano's surf instructor, 46-year-old Kazuto Shimizu.They couldn't wait to brag about their, so to speak, “great grandfather.”“I think age doesn't matter in surfing,” 12-year-old Iroha Shimabukuro said.Added her twin sister, Fuka: “He's more like a family member regardless of age.”“I think he's amazing,” said their younger brother, Shua.Rokka Saito, the other young surfer in the pack of four, summed it up.“I respect him,” she said.Sano paddles out and waits for a wave to approach. He catches it and stands, tries to do a few tricks on the board, and often tumbles over into the shallow water at the beach's edge.“I can only say that I just enjoy myself and do what I want without stressing out,” he said. “So if you try to be too good at it, or think that you have to do it this way or that way, I think you lose the fun.“I enjoy being swept up in the wave,” he added. “I am not a good surfer. So I call myself a ‘small-wave surfer’ — out of respect for those who surf well.""Sano still runs a business that supplies timber to construction companies, and still works 9-to-5 at the job. The surfing is a stress reliever, apparent as he takes a break far from shore and floats on his back with his legs draped over his blue and white board.“To be honest, I was surprised by his age,” said Shimizu, his instructor. “I was most worried that he would get injured. I did not know how fit he was, physically. So when I heard he was 80, I thought it would be a bit tough to think about whether my own grandfather could surf. I was surprised he was able to do it as well as younger people.""Sano joked about surfing in the delayed Tokyo Games, held just under two years ago.“I was hoping to participate in the Tokyo Olympics, not as a competitor but as an old-age demonstrator,"" he said.Sano goes through a serious stretching routine before going out; legs splayed 120 degrees, and hands touching his toes. When he stands, he's straight as his board — though at 5-feet-4 (1.65 meters), far shorter.“People often say that surfing is life, itself,"" he said. “If I describe it in one word, I think it really applies to me right now.”___Associated Press video journalist Koji Ueda contributed to this report.___Follow Japan-based AP sports writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851545,Lack of US Marine Corps amphibious capability puts Taiwan at risk,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, David Berger, warned that U.S. Marines are lacking in amphibious deployment capability, which would seriously hinder any military response in defense of Taiwan.Speaking to Newsweek, Berger explained the Marine Corps’ ability to field Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARG) has been drastically reduced in recent years. If the U.S. military does not improve the situation, China will certainly exploit this shortcoming in a war for Taiwan.According to Berger, the U.S. Marine Corp should be able to field three ARGs to different points across the globe at any given time. However, a lack of equipment, personnel, and financial resources means that only one ARG is ready for immediate deployment.Given China’s ability to rapidly produce ships and amphibious military vehicles, this is a logistical concern that must be addressed if the U.S. military hopes to be able to respond rapidly and effectively in a crisis moment. “If amphibious ships are not available, we cannot rapidly provide self-sustaining crisis response services on behalf of the U.S., and our competitors will fill that gap,"" said Berger.If the shortcoming is not addressed, and the U.S. Marine Corps is pressed to commit the majority of its amphibious vehicles and maintenance crew into service in the Taiwan Strait, the situation could have a ripple effect across the entire U.S. military and in multiple regions of the world.Berger notes that after two decades of land-based wars in Asia, the Marine Corps is actively retuning its strategic focus for amphibious operations. Despite these concerns, the Major Commandant emphasized “the Marine Corps is more than capable of fighting and winning right now,” but there must be increased attention given to amphibious operations and cooperation with the U.S. Navy.In February, Berger indicated that the Marine Corps is anticipating the deployment of a marine littoral regiment to islands near Taiwan by 2025.",2023/03/30,3541,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851556,Former Taiwan President Ma meets with China's Taiwan affairs head,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) said the governments of Taiwan and China must “cultivate mutual trust” through a process of ongoing exchanges to peacefully solve cross-strait issues, during a meeting with China’s Taiwan Affairs Office on Thursday afternoon (March 30).During Ma’s meeting with Song Tao (宋濤), the director of China’s government department for Taiwan related issues, the former president recalled his 2015 meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping（習近平) in Singapore, at which both leaders affirmed the importance of the ""1992 Consensus."" Ma said the ""1992 Consensus"" had allowed both sides to maintain communication, deepen connections, and was a “historical example of how to deal with difficult problems peacefully.”The Consensus was reached between the governments of Taiwan and China in November 1992 and stated that there is only one China, but there were different interpretations as to who the legitimate governing authority is. This interpretation remains highly controversial in Taiwan, and both Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council and President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) rejected the terms of the consensus in 2021, saying Taiwanese did not accept the idea of “one country, two systems.""During the meeting, Song said that China and Taiwan “are a family, and no one can separate us,” echoing Ma’s comments on March 28 in which he said “we are all Chinese,” referring to the people of China and Taiwan. During the meeting, Tao referred to Ma as “Mr. Ma,” as it has been agreed that he will not be referred to as “President Ma” during the China trip.The former KMT aligned president’s China trip is occurring at the same time as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) President Tsai Ying-wen (蔡英文) travels to the U.S. and Central America, highlighting the increasing division between Taiwan’s two major political parties. Ma also embarked on his trip soon after Honduras switched formal diplomatic recognition to China in a major blow for Taiwan’s international engagement, leading to speculation that the timing was intentional.On Tuesday (March 28) Ma visited the Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen (孫中山), the founder of the Republic of China — and a rare example of a historical figure revered on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.Ma traveled to China with a group of Taiwanese students, and will visit his ancestral hometown for the upcoming Tomb Sweeping Festival. His visit marks the first time any Taiwanese president has visited China since the end of the Chinese civil war.",2023/03/30,2015,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851573,"Minnesota train derailment, ethanol fire renew safety fears","PRINSBURG, Minn. (AP) — Hundreds of people had to evacuate their Minnesota town after a train hauling ethanol and corn syrup derailed and caught fire early Thursday, but authorities were hopeful that the quick response and cold weather would help limit the impact of this latest crash.Still, those pushing to improve rail safety said the derailment only added urgency to the debate over reforms that Congress and regulators are considering, even as officials seemed to apply some of the lessons learned after last month's fiery derailment near East Palestine, Ohio.Minnesota officials said the BNSF train derailed around 1 a.m. in Raymond, roughly 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of Minneapolis. That prompted the evacuation of essentially all of the town's 250 homes because they were within 1/2 mile (0.8 kilometers) of the derailment. The evacuation order was lifted around noon.The nation has been increasingly focused on railroad safety since the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern derailment that prompted several thousand evacuations in and around East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Residents in that town of about 5,000 remain concerned about lingering health impacts after officials decided to release and burn toxic chemicals to prevent a tank car explosion. State and federal officials maintain that no harmful levels of toxic chemicals have been found in the air or water, but residents remain uneasy.The major freight railroads have said they plan to add about 1,000 more trackside detectors nationwide to help spot equipment problems, but federal regulators and members of Congress have proposed additional reforms they want the railroads to make. A group of Ohio Representatives said at a news conference Thursday about their rail safety legislation that the Minnesota derailment reinforces the need for reform.While state and federal agencies were quick to respond to the Ohio derailment, Norfolk Southern's CEO and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg were slow to visit the town, and President Joe Biden has yet to survey the damage himself. The railroad even skipped one of the first community meetings because of fears about the safety of its employees. Contrast that with Thursday's response when BNSF CEO Katie Farmer showed up on day one to apologize and promise a thorough cleanup, and Buttigieg jumped on CNN within hours.“We will have our team here until this is cleaned up,” Farmer said at a news conference with Gov. Tim Walz and other Minnesota officials.Walz said the response from Burlington Northern was ""unprecedented, in my opinion” with the railroad getting in touch with state and local officials before 6 a.m.BNSF officials said 22 cars derailed, including about 10 carrying ethanol, and the track remained blocked, but no injuries were reported. The cause hasn't been determined, but EPA officials said on Twitter that four ethanol cars ruptured and the flammable fuel additive caught fire.ADM confirmed that the ethanol came from its corn processing facility in Marshall, Minnesota.Evacuees went to nearby Prinsburg — first to a school and a church where volunteers prepared food and distributed donated bottled water. Emergency responders retrieved three dogs from homes in Raymond in the morning and brought them to the church shelter.Darwin and Sharon Heida, both 81, said they received an evacuation alert on Darwin’s cell phone around 2:30 a.m. at their home about three blocks away from the train tracks.Darwin, who is a former volunteer firefighter for over 20 years, said the evacuation was “very orderly” and emergency personnel went door-to-door to relay the message. But it was unnerving to see flames above the tree line as they left home.“It happens in other places but not in our backyard,” Sharon said.Lawmakers pushing for railroad safety improvements say statistics show too many communities are dealing with these issues.“Three derailments per day on average. That’s way too many,"" Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson of Ohio said. ""When is the next one going to occur, and what is the next village or township or community in American that is going to have to be evacuated?”Walz and railroad officials said they aren't especially concerned about groundwater contamination from the latest derailment because much of the ethanol will burn off and the ground remains frozen. Plus, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says pure ethanol is biodegradable and breaks down into harmless substances if spilled.Environmental Protection Agency officials from the same regional office that responded to the Ohio derailment arrived on site and started monitoring the air for toxic chemicals by 6:30 a.m. Thursday.The Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board also responded to the derailment, and the NTSB said a team would conduct a safety investigation.It doesn't appear likely that this BNSF train would have been covered by the additional safety regulations for high-hazardous flammable trains, because those rules only apply when a train has either a block of 20 flammable liquid cars or more than 35 total. Those rules, which also require notice to states, were developed after a string of fiery oil and ethanol derailments a decade ago.Officials said the tank cars in Thursday's derailment were the upgraded triple-hulled DOT-117 cars required by those 2015 rules, designed to better contain the chemicals in an accident. The railroad said ethanol was the only hazardous material aboard.Since 2015 nearly 48,000 such cars have been built and some 41,000 older ones have been upgraded to meet the new standards ahead of a 2029 deadline set by Congress. But another 35,000 older tank cars still need to be replaced or upgraded.Buttigieg suggested speeding up those upgrades to complete them by 2025 after the Ohio derailment, but the Railway Supply Institute, which represents all the big tank car manufacturers that actually own most of the nation's tank cars, says that's not technically possible because of current labor and supply chain limits.Earlier this month another BNSF train derailed in Washington and spilled 3,100 gallons (about 11,700 liters) of diesel near the Swinomish Channel on that tribe’s reservation after a safety device meant to keep a train from crossing onto an open swinging bridge malfunctioned.The Association of American Railroads trade group likes to tout that 99.9% of all hazardous materials shipments that railroads haul reach their destinations safely and only 11 train accidents the Federal Railroad Administration recorded last year involved hazardous chemicals being released.The government data shows that derailments have declined in recent years and most don't cause significant damage, but there were still 1,049 last year. This Minnesota and Ohio derailments demonstrate how even a single crash involving hazardous materials can be disastrous.Hazardous materials, including about two-thirds of all the ethanol produced nationwide, account for about 7% to 8% of the 30 million shipments that railroads deliver across the country every year.Railroad unions believe the industry is getting riskier after the major railroads eliminated nearly one-third of jobs in recent years, because employees are spread thin, inspections are rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.BNSF, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, is owned by Warren Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate.___Funk reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

DiNapoli noted that bonuses last year returned to pre-pandemic levels.“Wall Street’s cash bonuses were expected to fall as several factors weighed on the securities’ industry profitability in 2022,” DiNapoli said in a prepared release.The comptroller said Wall Street’s pretax profits fell 56% in 2022 due to a sharp decline in investment-banking fees driven by inflation, interest-rate hikes and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The bonus pool for 2022 was $33.7 billion, down 21% from the previous year’s record of $42.7 billion, according to the comptroller.The securities industry plays a major role in state and city tax revenue, accounting for an estimated 22% of the state’s tax collections and 8% of collections for the city.""Employment in leisure and hospitality, retail, restaurants and construction must continue to improve for the city and state to fully recover,” DiNapoli said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851575,Blinken compares Bosnia Serb leader to Putin,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has compared the policies of the Bosnia Serb separatist leader to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin following his moves to curb dissent and LGBTQ rights.Blinken tweeted late Wednesday that “Milorad Dodik’s attacks on basic rights and freedoms in Republika Srpska show he is on President Putin’s authoritarian path.”Republika Srpska is the name for the half of Bosnia that is dominated by the country's Serbs. Dodik is the entity's president and leading politician who has repeatedly advocated for the breakup of Bosnia and clashed with Western officials in the Balkan country.Earlier this month, Dodik's government faced criticism from the U.S. and the European Union for pushing forward with a law to recriminalize libel and insult offences, which was seen as an attack on the freedom of expression and independent media.Dodik also announced a law in the upcoming months to prohibit access for LGBTQ activists to kindergartens, schools and universities. This came only days after a group of hooligans attacked LGBTQ activists and journalists in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska’s administrative center.Dodik, who is staunchly pro-Russia, has rejected Western criticism and said his entity would break off relations with the U.S. and British embassies in Bosnia. He has dismissed the need for U.S. support and blasted Washington's engagement in Bosnia, including continued financial backing.“It would have been better if they (U.S.) hadn't given a single dollar, if they hadn't gotten so involved,” he tweeted on Thursday.Washington and London have imposed sanctions on Dodik and his close associates for his policies of undermining Western efforts to promote reconciliation and democracy in Bosnia following the devastating ethnic conflict. Dodik has traveled often to Moscow and met with Putin there.Blinken said that the U.S. “represented by Amb. (Michael) Murphy, continues to advocate for the democratic and prosperous future that all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina deserve.”Bosnia's 1992-95 ethnic war erupted when Serbs launched a rebellion to break away from the country’s Bosniaks, who are mainly Muslims, and Croats. More than 100,000 people died in the conflict before the U.S. brokered a peace agreement in 1995.The deal divided Bosnia in two entities but kept them together by joint institutions. Fears have grown since the war in Ukraine that Russia could seek to stir trouble in Bosnia and elsewhere in the Balkans to avert attention from its full-scale invasion.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851576,US revises down last quarter's economic growth to 2.6% rate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy maintained its resilience from October through December despite rising interest rates, growing at a 2.6% annual pace, the government said Thursday in a slight downgrade from its previous estimate. But consumer spending, which drives most of the economy's growth, was revised sharply down.The government had previously estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.7% annual rate last quarter.The rise in the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — for the October-December quarter was down from the 3.2% growth rate from July through September. For all of 2022, the U.S. economy expanded 2.1%, down significantly from a robust 5.9% in 2021.The report suggested that the economy was losing momentum at the end of 2022.Consumer spending rose at a 1% annual rate last quarter, downgraded from a 1.4% increase in the government's previous estimate. It was the weakest quarterly gain in consumer spending since COVID-19 slammed the economy in the spring of 2020. Spending on physical goods, like appliances and furniture, which had initially surged as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, fell for a fourth straight quarter.More than half of last quarter's growth came from businesses restocking their inventories, not an indication of underlying economic strength.Most economists say they think growth is slowing sharply in the current January-March quarter, in part because the Federal Reserve has steadily raised interest rates in its drive to curb inflation.The resulting surge in borrowing costs has walloped the housing industry and made it more expensive for consumers and businesses to spend and invest in major purchases. As a consequence, the economy is widely expected to slide into a recession later this year.The central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate nine times over the past year. The Fed’s policymakers are betting that they can stick a so-called soft landing — slowing growth just enough to tame inflation without tipping the world’s biggest economy into recession.Yet as higher loan costs spread through the economy, analysts are generally skeptical that the United States can avoid a downturn. The main point of debate is whether a recession will prove mild, with only minor damage to hiring and growth, or severe, with waves of layoffs.The financial conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 and Signature Bank two days later — the second- and third-biggest bank failures in U.S. history — are also expected to slow the economy. Banks are likely to impose stricter conditions on loans, which help fuel economic growth, to conserve cash to meet withdrawals from jittery depositors.“The economy ended 2022 with marginally less momentum,'' Oren Klachkin and Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note. ”Looking ahead, the economy will face the full brunt of tighter credit conditions and Fed policy this year, and inflation is set to stay above its historical trend.""They added: ""We expect a recession to hit in the second half of 2023.''In the meantime, the job market remains robust and has exerted upward pressure on wages, which feed into inflation. The pace of hiring is still healthy, and the unemployment rate is near a half-century low. The confidence and spending of consumers remain relatively solid.Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department was its third and final estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2022. On April 27, the department will issue its initial estimate of growth in the current first quarter. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet have estimated that growth in the January-March quarter is decelerating to a 1.4% annual rate.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851577,US Navy deploys more chaplains for suicide prevention,"NAVAL STATION NORFOLK, Virginia. (AP) — On Navy ships docked at this vast base, hundreds of sailors in below-deck mazes of windowless passageways perform intense, often monotonous manual labor. It's necessary work before a ship deploys, but hard to adjust to for many already challenged by the stresses plaguing young adults nationwide.Growing mental health distress in the ranks carries such grave implications that the U.S. chief of naval operations, Adm. Michael Gilday, answered “suicides” when asked earlier this year what in the security environment kept him up at night.One recently embraced prevention strategy is to deploy chaplains as regular members of the crew on more ships. The goal is for the clergy to connect with sailors, believers and non-believers alike, in complete confidentiality – something that has allowed several to talk sailors out of suicidal crises.“That makes us accessible as a relief valve,” said Capt. David Thames, an Episcopal priest who’s responsible for chaplains for the Navy’s surface fleet in the Atlantic, covering dozens of ships from the East Coast to Bahrain.The families of two young men who killed themselves in Norfolk said chaplains could be effective as part of a larger effort to facilitate access to mental health care without stigma or retaliation. But they also insist on accountability and a chain of command committed to eliminating bullying and engaging younger generations.“A chaplain could help, but it wouldn’t matter if you don’t empower them,” said Patrick Caserta, a former Navy recruiter. His son Brandon was 21 when he killed himself in 2018, after struggling with depression and being “told to suck it up and go back to work.”—- EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. The national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org—-Mental health problems, especially among enlisted men under 29, mirror concerns in schools and colleges, which are also increasingly tapping campus ministry for counseling. The isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated depression and anxiety for many.But chaplains, civilian counselors, families of suicide victims, and sailors from commodores to the newly enlisted say these struggles pose unique challenges and security implications in the military, where suicides have risen for most of the past decade and took the lives of 519 service members in 2021, per the latest Department of Defense data.“Adjustment disorder” is the most common mental health diagnosis among sailors, Gilday said Wednesday at a budget hearing of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee. He asked to invest in chaplains and others onboard who can help “separate life stress from mental illness” and get sailors “at the tactical edge” the right care.“Mental health permeates every aspect of our operations,” Capt. Blair Guy, commodore for one of the destroyer squadrons based in Norfolk, said via email. ""Enhancing spiritual readiness enhances operations, it is not an either or discussion.”His squadron’s lead chaplain, Lt. Cmdr. Madison Carter, is working on recruiting others for the three ships still without permanent chaplains. In the next two years, leaders hope to have 47 chaplains on ships based in Norfolk, up from 37 today. Previously, chaplains — who are both naval officers and clergy from various denominations — were routinely deployed only on the largest aircraft carriers that have up to 5,000 personnel.Carter, a Baptist pastor, said most of his talks with sailors involve not faith but life struggles that can make them feel unfulfilled and lose focus.“How do I make sure that you have mind, body and soul all locked in?” is the question that drives his mission.The very real prospect of killing or being killed in combat provokes “God-sized questions,” in Thames’ words. He joined the Navy after 9/11 and served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.Sailors can carry the routine angst of teens and young adults, from political polarization to breakups to broken homes, which some enlist to escape. But onboard, disconnected from their real and virtual networks, they lack the usual coping mechanisms, said Jochebed Swilley, a civilian social worker who collaborates with chaplains and medical staff aboard the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship.Most communications are off-limits at sea for security – lest a Russian frigate show up while you’re texting mom, Thames said he explains to digital-native sailors.“Eighteen to 21-year-olds don’t know life without smartphones,” said Kayla Arestivo, a counselor and advocate for service members and veterans whose nonprofit serves more than 100 of them each week on her horse farm near Norfolk. “If you remove a sense of connection, mental health plummets.”Chief Legalman Florian Morrison, who’s served on the Bataan for more than two years tackling mental health cases at the ship’s legal office and as a lay leader for other Christian sailors, said faith is what helped him “re-center” after losing three shipmates to suicide.“It can be overwhelming... if you feel alone and you’ve nobody to reach out to,” Morrison said in the chapel set up in the ship’s bow. “You’ve got to catch it before you start going down that path. A streamlined pathway to mental health would help.”Petty Officer 3rd Class Benjamin Dumas, 21, who’s served for two months on the USS Gravely, a destroyer, hopes to become a nondenominational Christian lay leader to help the ship’s more than 300 other sailors navigate anxiety and depression.“I’ve seen a lot of brokenness,” he said.Even docked, ships are far from stress-free, as sailors constantly navigate steep ladderwells and pressurized, hulking doors under the glare of fluorescent lights and the constant hum of machinery.Berths can be stacked four people high and pieces of gear protrude ubiquitously. Space is so tight and regimented that a challenge across the fleet is where to squeeze in offices for new chaplains, said Cmdr. Hunter Washburn, the Gravely’s commanding officer.His crew looks forward to getting a permanent chaplain later this year who can interact “eyeball to eyeball, to check in and see how they’re doing,"" Washburn said.A Navy chaplain’s role is akin to a life coach, helping young sailors find their footing as adults in an environment that looks far more different from the civilian world than it did in previous generations.“A lot haven’t found that grounding yet. They’re looking,” said Lt. Greg Johnson, a Baptist chaplain who joined the Bataan in December. “A lot of people have resiliency. They just don’t know how to tap into it.”In the Navy, clergy need to engage with people of different or even no faith who might be initially turned off by the cross or other religious symbols on their uniforms — something that new chaplains need to be ready for if the effort to place more of them on ships is to succeed.“I want the people who can be uncomfortable and still be the bearers of God’s presence,” Carter said.Sailors call them “deck-plating chaps” — chaplains striking up a conversation with their shipmates in the mess decks or during night watches, in addition to keeping an open-door policy at all hours.“They’re accustomed to me making the rounds,"" said Thames. ""I’m going to find them when they’re eating meals, or it’s 3 a.m. and we’re making a high-risk transit through Hormuz,” a geopolitically crucial strait in the Middle East.Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Rice, a Pentecostal chaplain serving a destroyer squadron at Norfolk, estimates he did 7,000 hours of counseling over 12 years. Long lines of sailors waiting to talk often formed outside his door.“They’re grinding on a ship or serving food on a mess line, that’s not what they expected. So we help to find their meaning and purpose,” Rice said. “When their life is not going the way they think it should be going, I’ll be blunt and ask, ‘Why haven’t you killed yourself?’”Focusing on the answers — the “anchors” to the sailors’ will to survive — has helped Rice talk some down from the ledge, including one sailor who knocked on his door crying that he wanted to live and a corpsman who, while discussing suicide dreams, suddenly cocked his weapon and told Rice, “I could do it right now.”Lt. Cmdr. Ben Garrett has also diffused several suicide situations in the more than a decade he’s been a Catholic chaplain, for the past eight months on the Bataan, which when underway carries 1,000 sailors, 1,600 Marines and three other chaplains. But last fall, he officiated the memorial for a suicide victim.“There were sailors in the rafters,” he recalled. “It affects the whole crew.”Most profoundly, suicide impacts surviving families. Kody Decker was 22 and a new father when he killed himself at a maintenance facility in Norfolk, where he was transferred after struggling with depression on the Bataan, according to his father, Robert Decker.“He wanted to give to his country,” the father said at his home a dozen miles from the base. Pictures of Kody, his older brother and their grandfather — all in their Navy uniforms — rest on the mantelpiece next to the folded flag from Kody’s funeral.Robert Decker, a high school teacher and football coach, believes Kody might still be alive if he had better access to mental health care instead of being put on limited duty and deprived of his sense of purpose while assigned menial tasks.He’s not sure if talking to a chaplain would have made a difference with Kody, though speedy implementation of the Brandon Act might have. The bill, named after the Casertas’ son, aims to improve the process for mental health evaluations for service members.But Decker hasn’t given up on either the Navy or God.“My whole fight is about not having other families like us,” he said as a tear rolled down his cheek. “I pray to God every night, for help, for healing, for strength. I’m not a quitter. But it’s hard.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Onboard, disconnected from their real and virtual networks — most communications are off-limits at sea for security — they lack the usual coping mechanisms, said Jochebed Swilley, a civilian social worker on the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship.“Eighteen to 21-year-olds don’t know life without smartphones,” said Kayla Arestivo, a counselor and advocate whose nonprofit helps service members and veterans near Norfolk. “If you remove a sense of connection, mental health plummets.”Chief Legalman Florian Morrison, who’s served on the Bataan for more than two years, said faith is what helped him “re-center” after losing three shipmates to suicide.“It can be overwhelming... if you feel alone and you’ve nobody to reach out to,” Morrison said in the chapel set up in the ship’s bow. “A streamlined pathway to mental health would help.”Even docked, ships are far from stress-free, as sailors constantly navigate steep ladderwells and pressurized, hulking doors under the glare of fluorescent lights and the constant hum of machinery.Space is so tight and regimented that a challenge across the fleet is where to squeeze in offices for new chaplains, said Cmdr. Hunter Washburn, commanding officer of the destroyer USS Gravely.A Navy chaplain’s role is akin to a life coach, helping young sailors find their footing as adults in an environment that looks far more different from the civilian world than it did in previous generations.“A lot haven’t found that grounding yet. They’re looking,” said Lt. Greg Johnson, a Baptist chaplain who joined the Bataan in December.Clergy need to engage with people of different or no faith who might be initially turned off by the cross or other religious symbols on their uniforms.“I want the people who can be uncomfortable and still be the bearers of God’s presence,” Carter said.Sailors call them “deck-plating chaps” – chaplains striking up a conversation with their shipmates in the mess decks or during night watches, in addition to keeping an open-door policy at all hours.Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Rice, a Pentecostal chaplain serving a destroyer squadron at Norfolk, estimates he did 7,000 hours of counseling over 12 years. Long lines of sailors waiting to talk often formed outside his door.“They’re grinding on a ship or serving food on a mess line, that’s not what they expected. So we help to find their meaning and purpose,” Rice said. “When their life is not going the way they think it should be going, I’ll be blunt and ask, ‘Why haven’t you killed yourself?’”Focusing on the answers – the “anchors” to the sailors’ will to survive – has helped Rice talk some down from the ledge, including a corpsman who, while discussing suicide dreams, suddenly cocked his weapon and told Rice, “I could do it right now.”Lt. Cmdr. Ben Garrett has also diffused several suicide situations in the more than a decade he’s been a Catholic chaplain, for the past eight months on the Bataan, which when underway carries 1,000 sailors, 1,600 Marines and three other chaplains. But last fall, he officiated the memorial for a suicide victim.“There were sailors in the rafters,” he recalled. “It affects the whole crew.”Most profoundly, suicide impacts surviving families. Kody Decker was 22 and a new father when he killed himself at a maintenance facility in Norfolk, where he was transferred after struggling with depression on the Bataan, according to his father, Robert Decker.He’s not sure if talking to a chaplain would have made a difference with Kody, though speedy implementation of the Brandon Act might have. The bill, named after the Casertas’ son, aims to improve the process for mental health evaluations for service members.But Decker hasn’t given up on either the Navy or God.“My whole fight is about not having other families like us,” he said as a tear rolled down his cheek. “I pray to God every night, for help, for healing, for strength. I’m not a quitter. But it’s hard.”——Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851579,More Americans file for jobless claims; layoffs remain low,"U.S. applications for jobless benefits rose last week but remain at historically low levels despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and the job market in its fight against inflation.Jobless claims in the U.S. for the week ending March 25 rose by 7,000 to 198,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week fluctuations, rose by 2,000 to 198,250, remaining below the 200,000 threshold for the tenth straight week.Applications for unemployment benefits are broadly seen reflective of the number of layoffs in the U.S.Last week, the Federal Reserve extended its year-long fight against high inflation by raising its key interest rate by a quarter-point, despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system.Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that the central bank remains focused on fighting high inflation, which could require additional rate hikes.But Powell also signaled that the Fed might not need to impose a lengthy string of increases if more banks were to reduce their lending to conserve cash. This could slow the economy, hiring and inflation, Powell said, which could aid the central bank in its push to cool the economy, labor market and wages, thereby suppressing prices. So far, those things have not happened to the degree that the central bank had hoped.Inflation remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target, and the economy is growing and adding jobs at a healthy clip.Last month, the government reported that employers added a substantial 311,000 jobs in February, fewer than January’s huge gain but enough to keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. The unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, from a 53-year low of 3.4%.In its latest quarterly projections, the Fed predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its current 3.6% to 4.5% by year’s end, a sizable increase historically associated with recessions.Though the U.S. labor market remains strong, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies hired aggressively during the pandemic. IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.Amazon said last week that it would cut another 9,000 positions, adding to the 18,000 employees the tech giant said it would lay off in January.Earlier this month, Facebook parent Meta said it was slashing another 10,000 jobs in addition to the 11,000 culled in November.The real estate sector has taken the biggest hit from the Fed’s interest rate hikes. Higher mortgage rates — which have come down recently to 6.32% — had slowed home sales for 12 straight months before February’s 14.5% improvement.About 1.69 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended March 18, an increase of 4,000 from the week before. That number is close to pre-pandemic levels.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851580,"Responding to Indigenous, Vatican rejects Discovery Doctrine","VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican on Thursday responded to Indigenous demands and formally repudiated the “Doctrine of Discovery,” the theories backed by 15th-century “papal bulls” that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands and form the basis of some property laws today.A Vatican statement said the papal bulls, or decrees, “did not adequately reflect the equal dignity and rights of Indigenous peoples” and have never been considered expressions of the Catholic faith.The statement, from the Vatican’s development and education offices, marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers. It was issued under history's first Latin American pontiff, who was hospitalized Thursday with a respiratory infection, exactly one year after Francis met at the Vatican with Indigenous leaders from Canada who raised the issue.On Thursday, these Indigenous leaders welcomed the statement as a first good step, even though it didn't address the rescinding of the bulls themselves and continued to take distance from acknowledging actual Vatican culpability in abuses. The statement said the papal documents had been “manipulated” for political purposes by competing colonial powers “to justify immoral acts against Indigenous peoples that were carried out, at times, without opposition from ecclesial authorities.”It said it was right to “recognize these errors,” acknowledge the terrible effects of colonial-era assimilation policies on Indigenous peoples and ask for their forgiveness.The statement was a response to decades of Indigenous demands for the Vatican to formally rescind the papal bulls that provided the Portuguese and Spanish kingdoms the religious backing to expand their territories in Africa and the Americas for the sake of spreading Christianity.Those decrees underpin the “Doctrine of Discovery,” a legal concept coined in a 1823 U.S. Supreme Court decision that has come to be understood as meaning that ownership and sovereignty over land passed to Europeans because they “discovered” it.It was cited as recently as a 2005 Supreme Court decision involving the Oneida Indian Nation written by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.During Pope Francis’ 2022 visit to Canada, where he apologized to Indigenous peoples for the residential school system that forcibly removed Native children from their homes, he was met with demands for a formal repudiation of the papal bulls.Two Indigenous women unfurled a banner at the altar of the National Shrine of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré on July 29 that read: “Rescind the Doctrine” in bright red and black letters.Before that, Michelle Schenandoah of the Oneida Nation had called for the Vatican to rescind the papal bulls when she delivered the closing remarks of the First Nations delegation that met with Francis during a weeklong visit last year by Native groups from Canada. On Thursday, she called the Vatican statement “another step in the right direction,” but noted that it didn't mention the rescinding of the bulls themselves.“I think what this does is it really puts the responsibility on nation states such as the United States, to look at its use of the Doctrine of Discovery,” she said in a interview from Syracuse, New York, where she is a professor of Indigenous law at Syracuse University's College of Law. “This goes beyond land. It really has created generation upon generation of genocidal policies directed towards Indigenous peoples. And I think that it’s time for these governments to take full accountability for their actions.”In the statement, the Vatican said: “The Catholic Church therefore repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political ‘doctrine of discovery.’”Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada who was also part of the First Nations delegation that met with Francis at the Vatican, said the statement was “wonderful,"" resolved an outstanding issue and now puts the matter to civil authorities to revise property laws that cite the doctrine.“The church has done one thing, as it said it would do, for the Holy Father. Now the ball is in the court of governments, the United States and in Canada, but particularly in the United States where the doctrine is embedded in the law,” he told The Associated Press.The Vatican offered no evidence that the three papal bulls (Dum Diversas in 1452, Romanus Pontifex in 1455 and Inter Caetera in 1493) had themselves been formally abrogated, rescinded or rejected, as Vatican officials have often said. But it cited a subsequent bull, Sublimis Deus in 1537, that reaffirmed that Indigenous peoples shouldn't be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, and were not to be enslaved.Cardinal Michael Czerny, the Canadian Jesuit whose office co-authored the statement, stressed that the original bulls had long ago been abrogated and that the use of the term “doctrine” — which in this case is a legal term, not a religious one — had led to centuries of confusion about the church's role.The original bulls, he said, “are being treated as if they were teaching, magisterial or doctrinal documents, and they are an ad hoc political move. And I think to solemnly repudiate an ad hoc political move is to generate more confusion than clarity.”He stressed that the statement wasn't just about setting the historical record straight, but ""to discover, identify, analyze and try to overcome what we can only call the enduring effects of colonialism today.”It was significant that the repudiation of the ""Doctrine of Discovery"" came during the pontificate of history's first Latin American pope. Even before the Canadian trip, the Argentine pope had apologized to Native peoples in Bolivia in 2015 for the crimes of the colonial-era conquest of the Americas.Felix Hoehn, a property and administrative law professor at the University of Saskatchewan, said the Vatican statement would have no legal bearing on land claims in Canada today, but would have symbolic value.“The most that any papal repudiation of the doctrine (or the bulls, for that matter) can do in relation to Canadian law is to apply pressure on the Supreme Court of Canada to renounce the doctrine as part of Canadian law,” he said.Beyond that, though, is the hope that the statement could show that the Catholic Church wants to be an ally with Indigenous peoples as they fight for their human rights and their land, and to protect it, said the Rev. David McCallum, an American Jesuit who has worked with Indigenous peoples in the Syracuse area and was consulted during the drafting of the statement.“So now for the church to not only acknowledge the damage, but also to repudiate the whole mindset of cultural superiority, of racial superiority to, in a sense, renounce that whole way of thinking and say that forever forward the church wants to be an active ally in protecting Indigenous human rights along with all human rights, I think it’s a big statement,"" he said.___Rob Gillies contributed to this report from Toronto.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851581,Iowa's Caitlin Clark wins AP Player of the Year,"DALLAS (AP) — Caitlin Clark has put together one of the greatest individual seasons in NCAA history with eye-popping offensive numbers.Iowa's junior guard, though, saved her best performance for the game's biggest stage, recording the first 40-point triple-double in NCAA history to get Iowa to the Final Four for the first time in 30 years.Clark was honored Thursday as The Associated Press women's basketball Player of the Year. She received 20 votes from the 28-member national media panel that votes on the AP Top 25 each week. Voting was done before March Madness began.“It’s a huge honor,” Clark said. “I picked a place that I perfectly fit into and that’s allowed me to show my skill set. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t mean something. It’s not the reason you play basketball, it’s just something that comes along with getting to do what you love.”The Iowa coaching staff surprised Clark by sharing that she won the award while they were visiting the Iowa Children’s Hospital — a place near and dear to her. It also has huge ties to the Hawkeyes athletic department.They put together a video of some of the children in the hospital congratulating Clark on an outstanding season, and in the middle of it, Iowa coach Lisa Bluder popped on the screen to tell her she won.""I’m there for inspiring the next generation and being there for the people that you know are going through a hard time,” said Clark, who grew up in Iowa. “Being able to give joy to people that watch you play and watch your team play is amazing.”She averaged 27.0 points, 8.3 assists and 7.5 rebounds during the season to help Iowa go 26-6. Clark has 984 points, the sixth-most in a season by any player in Division I women’s history. She also has over 300 assists.“She is spectacular. I don’t know how else to describe what she does on the basketball court,” Bluder said.Clark accepted the award in front of her Hawkeye teammates. One of whom asked Clark who were favorite teammate was and the point guard deftly sidestepped it by saying that they “all were here favorite.”Indiana's Teri Moren earned the AP Coach of the Year honors to complete a Big Ten sweep of the awards.Next up for the Hawkeyes is undefeated South Carolina in the national semifinals. The Gamecocks are led by Aliyah Boston, last season's winner of the award. She garnered the other eight votes this season.“There’s so many great players, more than just me and (Aliyah),” Clark told the AP. “You can go on and on and list the tremendous players. I think that’s really good for our game when there’s a lot of great players. That’s what is going to help this game grow more than anything else.”Whether it’s hitting deep 3s from the Hawkeye logo at home games, hitting off-balance game-winning shots or throwing pinpoint passes to teammates for easy baskets, Clark has excelled on the court this year to get Iowa to a place it hasn’t been in a long time.“It’s funny, because the better the opponent, almost the better she plays,"" Bluder said. ""It’s like she locks in on those, when we’re playing against Top 25 teams. That’s when her statistics even go up even more, against great opponents.”Clark is the second Iowa player to win the AP award in the past few seasons, joining Megan Gustafson in 2019.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851582,"MLB opening day offers clocks, shift bans, Ohtani and Judge","A major shift in how Major League Baseball is played. About time, too.Aaron Judge aiming at his own home run record, Shohei Ohtani trending with every pitch and swing, Dusty Baker trying to win another World Series ring.All-Stars in different spots, a new scheduling concept featuring each team facing all 29 opponents.If it sounds like these plot lines are from a movie — ""Everything Everywhere All at Once” comes to mind — it's true.Opening day is Thursday and the full slate includes games at Dodger Stadium, Fenway Park, Wrigley Field and Yankee Stadium. And good news for fans — there's no snow in the forecast at any of them.TICK-TOCKManny Machado drew the first pitch clock violation in spring training and it was nuisance. A game between the Braves and Red Sox ended on a clock call and it was a novelty.Chances are, if Max Scherzer or Nolan Arenado or some other intense star gets timed out in a key spot, it could go nuclear.But MLB realized it had to do something to cut all the dead periods when absolutely nothing was happening. Well, except for hitters adjusting their batting gloves or pitchers pawing at the rubber. So with games routinely dragging on for more than three hours, the slowdown is getting sped up.The sport that never had a clock suddenly has them all over the park. Gerrit Cole, Max Fried and the rest of the pitchers get 15 seconds to throw with nobody on base, 20 seconds with runners on. Vladimir Guerero Jr., Mookie Betts and the hitters need to be ready.The early returns were good, spring training games lasted nearly a half-hour less this year. But remember, that was in Clearwater, Tempe and Lakeland — it might be a lot different, especially early in the season, when umpires begin pointing to their wrists at Busch Stadium, Camden Yards and Petco Park.VERY SHIFTYNL home run champ Kyle Schwarber, 2020 World Series MVP Corey Seager and a bevy of left-handed boppers should benefit hugely by this rule change. Because from now on, those pull hitters won't face a wall of three infielders on the right side.Defensive shifts dominated the game in recent years, a big reason why batting averages plummeted so sharply. José Ramírez, Cody Bellinger and other lefties increasingly found themselves being thrown out from shallow-to-medium right field.No longer. Realizing that shifts were a winning strategy on the field but a losing proposition with fans, MLB banned them. These days, two infielders must be standing on each side of second base. And no playing deep on the grass to rob hits, either — Dansby Swason, Jeremy Peña and other infielders need to be on the dirt.One likely effect: With more grounders sneaking through for singles, look for the number of no-hitters and near-gems to drop.SHO OR GO?All eyes will be on Shohei Ohtani when he starts for the Los Angeles Angels on opening day at Oakland. Here's what fans will really watch: Where will the two-way sensation wind up?Quite possibly the most popular and talented player on the planet, Ohtani clinched the World Baseball Classic for Japan and earned the MVP trophy by striking out Angels teammate Mike Trout.Ohtani can become a free agent after this year. He's never reached the postseason since joining the Halos in 2018 — Trout, a three-time MVP, has never won a single playoff game, but that's another matter.At 28, it's hard to imagine Ohtani sticking around Anaheim after yet another lost season. If they don't start winning soon, the Angels can either trade him to a very ambitious team or risk letting him walk away for nothing.STAR SCRAMBLETwo-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom bolted New York for a greener field in Texas. Three-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, a model of power pitching, now on the mound for the Mets.Trea Turner smoothly slid over to join pal Bryce Harper on the Phillies. Xander Bogaerts livened up a San Diego lineup that already included sluggers Manny Machado, Juan Soto and the suspended Fernando Tatis Jr.AL batting champion Luis Arraez was traded from Minnesota to Miami and former MVP José Abreu signed with the World Series champion Houston Astros.Maybe the most intriguing newcomer: Red Sox outfielder Masataka Yoshida. He powered Japan in the WBC and was penciled into the Boston cleanup spot even before his major league debut.EXTRA BAGGAGEWe get it: Stolen bases are for suckers, modern metrics show they're not worth the gamble. Miami's Jon Berti stole 41 last season and topped the majors; it was the lowest total for the MLB leader since 1963, when Maury Wills and Luis Aparicio each swiped 40.Execs hope bigger bases that are 18-inch squares, up from 15-inch squares, will help entice more speedsters to try. It cuts down the distance between the bags by a few inches. They “look like a pizza box,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. Pitchers also will be limited in how many pickoff throws they can make.Note to MLB: If you really want to get Randy Arozarena, Bobby Witt Jr. and Ronald Acuña Jr. on the run, see Andrés Giménez and others drop down more surprise bunts, open up hitting lanes and just increase overall offense, here's a better idea — shorten the bases to 88 feet.The NFL spruced up its game by moving back the extra-point line, making the PAT a more competitive play and prompting coaches to go for two. The NBA overhauled its sport way back by adding the 3-point arc. We know baseball has its hallowed distances — 90 feet and 60 feet, 6 inches — but they don't have to stay that way forever, especially not with younger audiences eager for more action.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851626,Several Specific Reasons Behind the Denial of Spouse Visa,"Getting married to a British national and applying for a spouse visa is a standard route to obtaining residency in the United Kingdom. However, the process of obtaining a spouse visa can be complicated and challenging. There are various spouse visa rejection reasons given by the UKVI. This can be a major disappointment for the couple and a significant barrier to starting a new life together in the UK. However, to skip the refusal step, you can get along with a spouse visa lawyer. They can help you immensely toIn this blog, we will discuss several specific reasons why a spouse visa application can be denied and what can be done to avoid these pitfalls.Financial RequirementsOne of the primary reasons for a spouse visa denial is not meeting the minimum financial requirements. The government of the United Kingdom requires that the sponsoring spouse must earn a minimum of £18,600 per annum or have sufficient savings to support themselves and the visa applicant. If the sponsoring spouse is unable to demonstrate that they have this level of income, the visa application may get refused by the UKVI. It is essential to note that if the couple has children, the required minimum income increases, so it is essential to clearly understand the financial requirements before submitting the application.Accommodation RequirementsAnother common reason for a spouse visa denial does not have adequate accommodation for the couple and any dependents. The UK government requires that the sponsoring spouse have a home suitable for the couple and any dependents and that there is enough room for everyone to live without being overcrowded. If the sponsoring spouse is unable to demonstrate that they have suitable accommodation, the visa application may get refused by the UKVI.Evidence of a Genuine RelationshipThe UK government requires the couple to provide evidence of a genuine relationship to support the spouse’s visa application. This can include photos, messages, emails, and letters demonstrating the relationship’s history and evolution. The UKVI is particularly concerned about sham marriages, so it is crucial to provide clear and comprehensive evidence of a genuine relationship to avoid a denial of the visa application.Criminal ConvictionsA criminal record can be a significant barrier to obtaining a spouse visa. The UK government requires that the visa applicant must not have any serious criminal convictions or pose a threat to national security. If the visa applicant has a criminal record, they must disclose it and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances of the conviction. Failure to disclose a criminal record or providing false information can result in a denial of the visa application.English Language RequirementsThe UK government requires the spouse visa applicant to have a basic understanding of English. This requirement is demonstrated by passing a test or providing evidence that the visa applicant has a degree taught in English. The visa application may be denied if the visa applicant does not meet the English language requirements as per the UKVI’s rules and regulations.Non-compliance with Immigration RulesIf the visa applicant has previously been non-compliant with UK immigration rules, this can result in a denial of the spouse visa application. This can include overstaying a previous visa, working illegally in the UK, or providing false information on an earlier visa application. It is vital to ensure that all previous immigration rules have been complied with to avoid a denial of the spouse visa application.Health RequirementsThe government of the United Kingdom requires that the spouse visa applicant not pose a hazard to public health or burden the National Health Service. If the visa applicant has a severe medical condition, they must provide a detailed medical report and evidence of private medical insurance. The visa application may be denied if the visa applicant does not meet the health requirements.ConclusionNow you must understand what could be the possible spouse visa rejection reasons. A spouse visa is the most common route to stay with your British partner in the United Kingdom. However, acquiring a spouse visa to join a British spouse in the UK is a complicated and challenging process. There are several specific reasons why a spouse visa application can be denied, including failing to meet the requirements mentioned above by the UKVI. To avoid the refusal of a spouse visa application, hiring a spouse visa lawyer is recommended to help you with the entire process and ensure a positive outcome from the UKVI. Several immigration law firms, such as A Y & J Solicitors, provide commendable assistance regarding visa applications. They have a panel of experienced and knowledgeable solicitors. Their experience and knowledge can help you in processing your application further and diminishes the chance of refusal as well.",2023/03/30,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851640,Study: Biggest Hollywood films still go mostly to white men,"NEW YORK (AP) — As Hollywood emerged from the pandemic, its biggest film productions dipped in diversity after years of incremental progress, according to a new study by UCLA researchers. Opportunities were notably greater for women and people of color on streaming platforms than in theatrically released films.The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published Thursday, presented one of the most detailed looks yet at how the film industry was shaped and, in many ways, set back during the pandemic. In analyzing 2022 movie releases, academics found that ethnic and gender inclusivity in theatrical films reverted back to 2019 or 2018 levels in many metrics, turning charts downward that had been slowly trending toward greater equity on screen and behind the camera.As the film industry sought to claw back moviegoers in 2022, it did so by leaning more on films starring and directed by white men, despite considerable evidence that more diverse films attract larger audiences. Black, Latino and Asian American moviegoers make up nearly half of all frequent moviegoers, and for the biggest hits, often account for the majority of ticket buyers.The film industry was still recovering in 2022, releasing fewer wide releases and seeing the box office return to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels. Though the 2022 movie year ended in triumph for Asian American representation at the Academy Awards with the best picture-winning “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” researchers see a potential turning point where opportunity for women and people of color is usually reserved for lower-budgeted streaming movies.“It definitely was not an industry that was back all the way. But I really think it gives a picture of a two-tiered system that’s been created,” says Ana-Christina Ramón, director of the Entertainment and Media Research Initiative at UCLA, which produces the report. “What will be interesting to see is what happens in 2023 if it continues to have this bifurcation.”“The fear is that diversity is something is temporary or could be easily cut at any point in either theatrical or streaming,” says Ramón, noting that streaming services, after years of torrid growth, are now pulling back on original productions.In theatrical releases, people of color accounted for 22% of lead actors, 17% of directors and 12% of writers. Women were 39% of lead actors and 15% of directors. While roughly double the percentages of a decade ago, the numbers are closer to those of five years ago, and still easily trail U.S. population demographics. Women have made gains in writing, composing 27% of writers in 2022 theatrical releases, up from 17% in 2019. Yet only one woman of color penned a top theatrical film in 2022.At the same time, streaming releases are more inclusive, accounting for more films with diverse casts and more female leads. Sixty-four percent of original streaming releases in 2022 had casts that were more than 30% non-white, as opposed to 57% of theatrical releases. About a third of leads in top streaming films went to people of color — nearly 12% more than in theatrical films but still about 10% below population demographics. Leads for women in streaming films (49%) nearly reached parity with men in 2022.But by considering budget levels, which tend to be higher in theatrical releases, researchers found some of the greatest disparities. Studios are overwhelmingly choosing white male directors for their biggest productions. They accounted for 73% of film directors in theatrical release, in films that usually (60%) had a budget above $30 million.Budgets tended to be lower for female filmmakers and directors of color. Films directed by white women were usually (56%) budgeted less than $20 million. For directors of color, 76% of their streaming films had budgets below $20 million.“With the industry unstable, what we could see was the culture that Hollywood has always relied on when in need of a surefire hit,"" says Ramón. “They think of surefire hits as a code for no diversity, for white-led. It’s something that they’re comfortable with.”___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851641,"Covering over well at Indian temple collapses, killing 11","NEW DELHI (AP) — A structure built over an old temple well in India collapsed Thursday as a large crowd of devotees prayed at a festival for Rama, one of the most widely worshipped Hindu deities, killing at least 11 people, officials said.Up to 35 people fell into the well in the temple complex in Indore in central Madhya Pradesh state when the structure collapsed and were covered by falling debris, police Commissioner Makrand Deoskar said.The structure apparently caved in because it could not handle the weight of the large crowd. The state's top elected official, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, ordered an investigation.Chouhan said 18 people were rescued and hospitalized with injuries.Rescue workers were pumping the water out of the well looking for any more people still trapped there, local news reports said.Temple authorities had stopped using the well years ago and covered it with the structure.Witnesses said a large crowd of devotees had thronged the temple to perform a fire ritual and celebrate the Hindu festival.Building collapses are common in India because of poor construction and a failure to observe regulations.In October, a century-old cable suspension bridge collapsed into a river in the western state of Gujarat, sending hundreds of people plunging into the water and killing at least 132 in one of the worst accidents in the country in the past decade.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851642,Napoli and Milan prepare for 1st of 3 meetings in 17 days,"MILAN (AP) — Over the next three weeks, AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli will have three chances to do something he’s only done once before: beat Napoli counterpart Luciano Spalletti.Milan visits runaway leader Napoli on Sunday in Serie A before taking on the southern team over two legs in the Champions League quarterfinals. The three matches will be played in 17 days.“Now there’s the Serie A match and that’s very important for us. Napoli has great players and is having a fantastic season,” Pioli said. “But the Champions League is different. All the teams are impressive and that gives us so much motivation to do well.""Pioli has only managed one win in 13 matches against teams coached by Spalletti. Three matches ended in draws.Two of Spalletti's nine victories, both when he was the coach of Roma, contributed to Pioli's departure first from Parma and later from Lazio.While another loss is unlikely to see Pioli lose his job this time, it could hurt Milan’s chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League. The team is in fourth place in Serie A — the final Champions League spot — one point ahead of Roma and three ahead of Atalanta. Only seven points separate second place from sixth.Napoli, meanwhile, is 19 points ahead of second-place Lazio and nearly assured of winning its first Serie A title since Diego Maradona led the club to its only two Italian league championships in 1987 and 1990.Napoli has won 23 of its 27 Serie A matches this season, losing only twice, while scoring a league-leading 64 goals. The team’s performance has astounded just about everyone.“In the summer they lost important players and brought in ones that were strong but little known,” Pioli said. “It was really hard to foresee that they would have a season like this.“Napoli has shown strength and continuity, the characteristics of a great team. But no one is unbeatable.”The league is one thing, but getting this far in the Champions League is unchartered territory for Napoli. The club has never before advanced to the quarterfinals of Europe’s main club competition.Milan has a much stronger pedigree, winning the European title seven times. But Milan hasn't played in the quarterfinals since 2012 and hasn’t gone beyond that since winning the last of their titles in 2007.“We are especially attached to this competition because of the tradition Milan has,"" Pioli said. ""We are trying to write our own history. Playing in the quarterfinals is something emotional. But in order to make sure this is a positive year we have to play in the Champions League next year, too, and that will need to happen via the league.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851644,CNN preaches patience as ratings tank during turnaround,"NEW YORK (AP) — CNN's leadership is preaching patience even though thousands of viewers are abandoning the network during its attempted turnaround, with no indication yet whether it will be rewarded.Cable news ratings are down across the board compared to 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine was fresh in the news. CNN's dip is most dramatic — 61% in prime time in March, with Fox News Channel down 27% and MSNBC off by 12%, according to the Nielsen company.Fox averaged 2.09 million viewers in prime time in March, with MSNBC at 1.14 million and CNN at 473,000, Nielsen said. In the key 25-54 age demographic for advertisers, CNN is seeing some of its lowest numbers in decades.CNN is a year into new corporate management with Warner Bros. Discovery, which hired ex-CBS producer Chris Licht to run the network. The chief goal has been to rebuild trust as a non-partisan news brand after years of criticism by former President Donald Trump and his followers, at a time Fox and MSNBC have profited handsomely by appealing to specific points of view.Licht's biggest programming move to date, a revamp of “CNN This Morning,” hasn't borne fruit in the ratings and has been beset by bad publicity, including co-host Don Lemon's ham-fisted reference to a woman's prime years.Changes to CNN's daytime look are imminent. Licht's vision for prime time is months away, though, and only beginning to take shape.His plans are to couple news coverage with hosts from different worlds, including entertainment, who can talk about the news without a specific partisan take. Licht is exploring several possibilities, and CNN is reportedly close to deals with CBS' Gayle King and former NBA star turned sportscaster Charles Barkley for shows that will air once a week, although the network wouldn't confirm that.If Licht's bet pays off, CNN will strengthen its reputation as a news brand while also attracting viewers who are now watching Netflix or HGTV — not just competing news networks.As those plans develop, CNN's prime-time lineup has largely been in flux after Anderson Cooper's hour at 8 p.m. Eastern. The network has experimented with some interviews, events and subject-focused hours at 9 p.m. Eastern. They include talks with first lady Jill Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and town halls with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and one focused on the Ohio train derailment.The news hours that follow, at least for now, are led by Alisyn Camerota and Laura Coates.“Viewers are a bit confused with all of the changes, particularly in the prime-time lineup,” said Jennifer Thomas, a former CNN producer who now teaches journalism at Howard University. She said CNN needs more news that impacts viewers and less analysis.CNN expresses pride in some of the efforts, while admitting some are duds. Last Friday, for example, only 295,000 people watched Jake Tapper's interview with “Ted Lasso” star Jason Sudeikis. It was less than a quarter of the people who saw Alex Wagner's MSNBC show at the same 9 p.m. Eastern time slot, Nielsen said.David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, delivered a pep talk to hundreds of CNN managers earlier this month to reinforce the message that he wanted to see a network focused on the news that didn't lean any way politically.CNN saw strong ratings under the leadership of Licht's predecessor, Jeff Zucker, and Zaslav said he recognized that a more partisan approach could bring more viewers and money, but that “it's not what I came here to do,” according to a transcript of Zaslav's speech.He said he hoped the network would be able to figure out what is working and what isn't. He urged the managers to not worry about outside noise.“Ratings be damned,” he said. “Let's focus on who we are. This is our mission. This is our legacy. And this is our journey together.”The question for Licht and his team, as it is often in similar situations, is “how much time do they really have?” said Mark Whitaker, a former executive at CNN and NBC News.Strong ratings mean more revenue, and more money to spend on programming, Whitaker said.Cable news viewership is often very habit-driven, with viewers drawn to personalities they know and trust, he said. For the first three days this week, CNN's 9 p.m. Eastern hour had three different hosts — Erin Burnett, Pamela Brown and Kaitlan Collins.CNN must wonder whether viewers will lose the habit of tuning in while waiting for the network's true personality to emerge under Licht. A new prime-time schedule is not likely until the fall.It doesn't help that many CNN viewers have long considered the network a utility to be used primarily when there are big stories, and it's a relatively quiet period now. An important test will be how many viewers will reflexively turn to CNN during big news events, where it has often dominated the ratings.MSNBC, in touting its biggest audience advantage over CNN in nearly four years, said that its viewers watched the network an average of 381 minutes per week during the first three months of 2023, compared to 183 minutes for CNN.“They're fighting against the toughest foe they can fight,” said Rick Kaplan, a former CNN president. “They're fighting against short attention spans. They're fighting against the fact that we're such a divided people, so angry at each other, that if you don't reflect that anger, the people don't have time for you.”Continued poor ratings “eats away at the fabric of the network, if you're doing great shows and nobody is watching,” he said.Kaplan said he believes CNN has the right executive in Licht, who has a strong track record as a successful programmer.“If there's a right way, he'll find it,” he said.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851645,"Hodgson, 75, determined to keep Palace in Premier League","In the 10 months since his last coaching job, it wasn’t unusual for Roy Hodgson to be stopped in the street and asked: “Are you enjoying your retirement?”Yet Hodgson never felt like he was retired, even at the age of 75.“I know my birth certificate tells me I am,” the former England coach said Thursday with a smile, “but the way I feel doesn’t really tell me that.”So when Crystal Palace — the love of his soccer life — came calling, asking him to return to Selhurst Park on a short-term basis to help keep the club in the Premier League, Hodgson was never really going to decline the offer.“I know very clearly what the project is, what the objective is, why I am here and what is expected of me,” said Hodgson, speaking publicly for the first time since returning to Palace. “Who knows? There might be another one that comes up.“The thing is, I don’t actively seek them. That’s the thing. No one is out there on my behalf looking for these things.”Hodgson was Palace manager from 2017-21 and preserved the team’s Premier League status each season. He couldn’t do the same when he was brought in by Watford on an emergency basis for the second half of last season, with its relegation with three games remaining leaving what Hodgson described as a “scar.”“I have to make certain that doesn’t happen again because I know what a painful and unpleasant experience it is for everyone,” he said. “But if anyone was to say, give us a guarantee, I’d say to them, ‘This is football.’ There are no guarantees. We are in a dogfight.”Indeed, even Hodgson — one of the game’s longest-serving and well-traveled managers — has never seen a relegation scrap like the one brewing in the Premier League right now.Palace is in 12th place in the 20-team league, only three points above the relegation zone with 10 games left. The bottom nine teams — from Palace all the way down to last-place Southampton — are separated by only four points.“You certainly don’t have so many teams where people would say, ‘They can’t get relegated. They are too big a club to get relegated,’” Hodgson said.Palace may just slot into that category. A team containing players such as talented forwards Wilfried Zaha, Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise and international center backs Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen has looked completely bereft of confidence, without a win in 13 games in all competitions in 2023.That’s why Patrick Vieira was fired, even though Palace had just finished a tough run of games and was about to start a more benign schedule starting with Leicester at home on Saturday.Hodgson’s first task is to lift the players' heads.“It’s so easy to let the black dog take over to some extent, and make you doubt all the things you think you were good at doing,” Hodgson said. “Really, our main task, as I see it, having taken over a group which is clearly stronger technically than the one we left behind, is to make certain those players don’t lose faith or think they are not capable.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851646,"Should you buy now, pay later for your wedding?","As wedding season approaches, couples are booking venues, compiling guest lists and hiring a dizzying array of vendors — and they’re digging deep into their pockets to pay for it.The average U.S. wedding cost $30,000 in 2022, a $2,000 increase from 2021 , according to a study from wedding website The Knot. Though weddings have long been expensive, inflation is pushing costs higher.Couples may turn to increasingly popular “ buy now, pay later ” payment plans to ease the burden. These plans let you divide the total cost of your purchase into installments, often with no interest and zero fees if you pay on time.But they have risks, and there may be better ways to fund your nuptials.HOW BUY NOW, PAY LATER WORKS FOR WEDDINGSPopular buy now, pay later providers like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna partner with thousands of merchants, including retailers in the wedding industry.Affirm partners with David’s Bridal, Men’s Wearhouse, Kay Jewelers and Zales , among others, to offer its pay-later plans to customers. By opting into Affirm when they check out online or in store, couples can break up payments on a wedding-related purchase at no additional cost, depending on the retailer.“Wedding planning can really get out of control, and an option like Affirm helps couples regain that financial control,” says Katrina Holt, senior vice president of operations at Affirm. “It’s a way to pay in bite-sized amounts that fits into how couples are used to budgeting.”Repayment terms for buy now, pay later plans range from pay-in-four, which divides your total cost into four equal payments due every two weeks, to monthly payment plans that extend up to five years.Getting approved for these plans is often easier than for traditional credit. Applications are short, and most providers run only a soft credit check with no minimum credit score requirement.While providers like Affirm can help couples fund smaller purchases, others focus on big wedding expenses.Maroo, a payment processing platform with a pay-later option, lets couples pay wedding vendors — think photographers, musicians, caterers, even the venue — over three, six or 12 months.“If you can buy your Peloton in installments, why shouldn’t you be able to pay for big pieces of your wedding in installments?” says Anja Winikka, co-founder and chief marketing officer at Maroo. “They’re huge expenses, and what ends up happening is couples run into cash-flow issues and throw their wedding invoice amounts onto high-interest credit cards.”Maroo doesn’t charge interest and, like other providers, requires only a soft credit check to qualify.RISKS OF BUY NOW, PAY LATER FOR WEDDINGSThough these plans can help you break up purchases, they tend to encourage overspending, and couples should be careful.If you’re successfully sticking to a budget but want help managing your monthly cash flow, using a buy now, pay later plan may be a good option, says Natalie Slagle, a Minnesota-based certified financial planner who works with couples.“But the people who can’t afford the wedding unless they do this? That’s who I do not think these payment plans are for,” she says.Slagle urges couples to also think about their wedding in the context of other plans, like buying a house or having a child.“Is this going to be the only hurdle coming your way financially over the next few years? Because from what I see in my professional experience, it’s not,” Slagle says. “How are you setting yourself up for financial success after the wedding?”The industry is also facing federal scrutiny. In September 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a study on buy now, pay later that cited inconsistent consumer protections, data security and debt accumulation among its concerns.A second study, released in March, identified buy now, pay later users as more likely to show signs of financial distress compared with nonusers.OTHER WAYS TO PAY FOR YOUR WEDDINGThe best way to pay for your wedding is through savings, Slagle says. Another option is a gift or no-interest loan from a family member.If you need to finance, there are choices besides buy now, pay later.Credit cards can help you earn cash back or points, which can offset other costs, like a honeymoon. You’ll want to pay off your balance each month to avoid compounding interest.Another option is a wedding loan, which is an unsecured personal loan from a bank, credit union or online lender that covers wedding expenses. These loans charge fixed interest and have predictable monthly payments, but rates can be high depending on your credit score.___________________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851647,How 'swatting' calls spread as schools face real threats,"A spate of threats and false reports of shooters have been pouring into schools and colleges across the country for months, raising concerns among law enforcement and elected leaders.Schools in Pennsylvania and Utah were the latest targeted by so-called swatting. Computer-generated calls on Wednesday made claims about active shooters, but it was all a hoax. One day earlier, nearly 30 Massachusetts schools received fake threats.School officials are already on edge amid a backdrop of deadly school shootings, the latest Monday at a Christian school in Nashville.Here is a look at the issues involved:WHAT IS SWATTING?Hundreds of cases of swatting occur annually, with some using caller ID spoofing to disguise their number. The goal is to get authorities, particularly a SWAT team, to respond to an address.An FBI official said in November that they believe the wave of false threats focused on schools may be coming from outside of the country.Officials said at the time that they had identified calls to about 250 colleges, 100 high schools and several junior high schools just since early June falsely reporting explosive devices being planted at the schools or saying that a shooting was imminent.The FBI said in a statement Thursday that the agency was monitoring the situation as the swatting cases continued to wreak havoc at schools.“While we have no information to indicate a specific and credible threat, we will continue to work with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to gather, share, and act upon threat information as it comes to our attention,” the statement said.WHERE ARE SWATTING CALLS HAPPENING?Few regions of the country have been spared from such calls and the disruptions they cause.The false calls Wednesday in Pennsylvania led to lockdowns or evacuations in several counties, according to state police. Law enforcement had to take each one seriously no matter how dubious it seemed.Police in Pittsburgh, for instance, searched every room at Central Catholic High School, even after getting word that a report of people being hurt inside wasn't true within a minute, said Thomas Stangrecki, the interim police chief.“We treated it as a real incident,” Stangrecki said. Another threat at a nearby Catholic school had worried parents gathered outside.At one Utah school, a social media post sought to reassure families: “Repeat: This is a hoax. No students have been harmed.”In Iowa, so many schools were targeted earlier this month that Gov. Kim Reynolds complained at a news conference about the toll it was taking to confirm the terror-inducing calls are fake.“It's what no governor, it's what no parent or anybody — superintendent, teachers, kids — want to hear,” Reynolds said. “And we're grateful and just so thankful that is what it was.”And in Minnesota, the state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension issued a warning last month after fake calls forced eight schools into lockdown over two days.DO FAKE THREATS HINDER RESPONSE TO REAL SHOOTINGS?Authorities are grappling with the false alarms in a country where mass shooters have killed hundreds of people throughout history. Shooters have attacked in places like stores, theaters and workplaces, but it is in schools and colleges where the carnage reverberates perhaps most keenly.At U.S. schools and colleges, 175 people have been killed in 15 mass shootings that resulted in the deaths of four or more people, not including the perpetrator — from 1999′s Columbine High School massacre to Monday’s shooting in Nashville, Tennessee. That’s according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University, in addition to other AP reporting.DO EVEN FALSE THREATS POSE A RISK?Such calls have proven dangerous and even outright deadly.In 2017, a police officer in Wichita, Kansas, shot and killed a man while responding to a hoax emergency call. Just this month, the city agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit, with the money to go to the two children of 28-year-old Andrew Finch.The hoax call that led to his death began as a feud between two online gamers. One of the gamers recruited Tyler Barriss to “swat” the other gamer. But the address used was old, leading police to Finch, who was not involved in the dispute or playing the video game.Barriss was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison, while the other two gamers were sentenced to 15- and 18-month terms.Police in Maryland also shot a 20-year-old Maryland man in the face with rubber bullets after a fake hostage situation was reported at his home.The FBI in Pittsburgh nodded to the risk, noting in a statement about the school threat cases that it “takes swatting very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk.”___Peter Smith in Pittsburgh, Ron Todt in Philadelphia, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851648,500 winner Ericsson intends to stay in IndyCar title picture,"In the days leading up to the IndyCar season-opening race, Chip Ganassi made clear that Marcus Ericsson was a valued member of the organization.“I want him here beyond this year,” Ganassi said of the Swedish driver.Ericsson then went on to win the March 5 race on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, with a late pass of Pato O'Ward to pick up the fourth win of his IndyCar career. Ericsson heads into Sunday's race at Texas Motor Speedway as the points leader and determined to be a serious championship contender.He is the reigning Indianapolis 500 winner — a victory that pushed him into last year's championship fight before he faded and finished sixth in the final standings. But as Ericsson begins his fourth season with a powerhouse organization, Ganassi believes the Indianapolis victory changed the career trajectory for the 32-year-old former Formula One driver.The win propelled Ericsson on a monthslong media tour that included a weeklong celebration in Sweden — which has gone IndyCar mad for Ericsson and fellow IndyCar countryman Felix Rosenqvist of McLaren — with the famed Borg-Warner Trophy.“He seems to have gotten more out of winning the Indy 500 than anyone else has of recent time,"" Ganassi said. ""He’s been everywhere. It’s been a really positive thing for Marcus, the team, the series. He’s grown with that as well.”So much so that Ericsson is adamant that people take the No. 8 team seriously this year.“It seems whatever I do, people are thinking maybe I don’t deserve it or stuff like that,” he said. “I won a lot of races and been at the top of the championship the last couple years, so I’m just going to keep doing that.“I’m here to win. I want to win a championship. I want to win another 500. That’s our goals, and what other people say doesn’t really matter. But I think we’ve proven last year and the year before that we can be up front and run, fighting for a championship. We just need to keep doing that, and what people say, I don’t really mind too much.""Oh, but he does care. If he didn't, then “not bad for a pay driver” wouldn't have been among the first things Ericsson said after winning the 500 last May.When his F1 days ended after 97 winless races at the end of the 2018 season, Ericsson made the move to American racing in the IndyCar Series, initially with what is now Arrow McLaren Racing. But he wasn't retained after one season and Ericsson had to secure the sponsorship — through Huski Chocolate, a Swedish brand that isn't even sold in the United States — to buy a seat at Ganassi.But it took him nearly two seasons in Ganassi cars to win, and when he finally got that first victory, it came in Detroit when race leader Will Power couldn't get his car restarted after a late red flag stoppage. In fact, all four of Ericsson's wins have been in races that were red-flagged, and it was teammate Scott Dixon who had the dominant car at Indianapolis last year until a speeding penalty on Dixon gave Ericsson a chance.Winning in weird ways could be part of the reason why Ericsson doesn't get the championship consideration he craves, but he believes eeking out victories under strange circumstances is a show of strength for his team.“It seems when a lot of things are happening in the race, and people are making mistakes, we seem to be able to stay cool,” Ericsson said. “Both me and the car, and the guys on the strategy and pit stops and everything. And we seem to be able to get everything together in those situations. All those races are very high-intensity races. It’s not sort of straightforward races.""There’s a lot of things happening. You need to be ready to adjust your strategy, pit stops, restarts. There’s a lot of things going on, and we seem to be very good at that. That’s definitely one of our strengths. Not saying we cannot win without the red flag, but it’s definitely been working for us.”Ericsson, who began oval racing only when he moved to IndyCar in 2019, finished a career-best third at Texas last year in what turned out to be a warmup for his Indy 500 run. Josef Newgarden is the defending race winner and Ericsson teammate Dixon is the winningest driver at Texas with five victories. Dixon has won three of the past six and four of the past nine stops at Texas.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851649,‘Gone wrong’: Doubts on carbon-credit program in Peru forest,"SAN MARTÍN, Peru (AP) — The Cordillera Azul National Park on the eastern flank of the Peruvian Andes takes in a sweep of Amazon rainforest, mountains and waterfalls in a territory about the size of Connecticut, so precious that tens of millions of dollars in carbon credits have been sold in a program that supporters said would protect its trees.But an analysis by independent experts and reporting by The Associated Press raises doubts about whether the project has delivered on its promise to counter-balance emissions by oil companies such as Shell, TotalEnergies and others. And the tree loss has more than doubled, according to satellite analysis.Experts say the Cordillera Azul project was flawed from the beginning, with far too many carbon credits generated and exaggerated benefits that allowed the nonprofit running the park for the Peruvian government to make more money — even as the tree canopy shrank.Defenders of the project dispute that benefits were inflated. They say the tree loss was virtually all from natural causes, even as satellite analysis shows it’s concentrated on the western and northern borders of the park near large population centers and largely along rivers. These are places far easier to reach and illegally log than elsewhere in the mostly primordial landscape.“It is clear something has gone wrong in this project,” said Edward Mitchard, an expert in deforestation and carbon credits at the University of Edinburgh School of Geosciences.Skeptics of forest protection carbon credit programs note the market is largely self-regulated, and it’s easy for participants to exaggerate the benefits of a given project. But done correctly, they are supposed to allow a company to break even on carbon emissions by preventing them in one place — such as a rainforest — while the company emits a comparable amount elsewhere. And demand for the projects is growing as companies come under pressure to be carbon-neutral, with one database showing the number of programs has nearly doubled in the past two years.Peru's forests have long come under frequent pressure from people migrating into new areas to clear land for farming. In Cordillera Azul, the carbon credit program raises money that pays for forest patrols and education of local communities to stop deforestation, which releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change. Documents show more than 28 million credits have been sold for the Cordillera Azul project, enough to offset 28 million tons of carbon dioxide — and raising millions of dollars in a process that Indigenous Kichwa tribes have complained did not recognize their ancestral claim to the land.Founding documents say the project, launched in 2008 and among the world’s largest such ventures, aimed to prevent “all deforestation” in the park.But Mitchard’s company, Space Intelligence, found tree canopy loss jumped from an average of 262 hectares (650 acres) per year in the five years before the project launched to an average of 572 hectares (1,400 acres) per year from 2009 to 2021, the last year for which data is available. Space Intelligence is a for-profit company that undertakes satellite mapping that is used to verify carbon credits.Some of the tree loss in the park can be seen in satellite images taken in 2010 and 2019 and provided to AP by Planet, a company that makes such images for governments, businesses and researchers.CIMA, the Spanish acronym for the independent non-profit set up to run the park, said natural phenomena such as landslides caused the tree loss, not logging, farming or mining.Inspection of satellite data does show many landslides, but deforestation is a major cause of landslides because tree roots help hold steep slopes in place. Academic modeling has found landslides happen up to 13 times more often in deforested areas. It’s impossible to know what caused the Cordillera Azul landslides without site inspections, but forest loss within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of a park boundary or rivers — the most accessible and logging-vulnerable areas of the park — was about double that of the rest of the park, Space Intelligence found. More than a third of all the tree loss mapped in the gigantic park was in these narrow bands of territory.That “does suggest that there has been human disturbance of the forest, making these landslides more likely,” Mitchard said, though he noted that natural causes could not be ruled out.Mitchard also said data showing that annual tree canopy loss inside the park rose at about the same rate as tree loss outside the park after 2008 suggested the carbon credit project afforded little protection to Cordillera Azul. The data implied “the same human pressures” operating inside and outside the park, he said.Forest carbon credits each represent a ton of CO2 kept from entering the atmosphere by protecting trees. They are supposed to be minted only if a forest is at risk — and the Cordillera Azul was legally protected by presidential decree in 2001. But official documents show that CIMA pushed for the program, arguing that it was necessary to pay for enforcement and education because the law alone wouldn’t have saved its forests from slash and burn agriculture, logging or mining. They also cite the program as a more reliable source of funding for the park than depending on donations.“Existence of a national park title in a country like Peru is not sufficient to halt deforestation,” Gonzalo Varillas, executive director of CIMA, said by email in response to questions from AP. He also said the sale of the credits brought in enough money to cover 90% of the park’s operating costs, making up for difficulty obtaining international donations. Peru’s government began letting nonprofits run some parks on the theory that they might better be able to attract foreign funding.Steve Zwick, a spokesman for the nonprofit Verra, a certifier for forest carbon projects including this one, defended the program as a “lifeline” for the park. Without income from the carbon credits, CIMA would have been dependent on unreliable funders, he said. Carbon savings were thus “crystal clear.”But experts said the project inflated projected benefits from the start.In 2008, CIMA said without the carbon credit program, almost 29 million tons of CO2 would be released from illegal deforestation in the park over the next decade. To calculate those “prevented emissions,” under industry standard guidelines, CIMA compared the project to a reference area to predict what would happen without its protection.Simon Counsell, who has been assessing forest carbon credit projects for nearly 15 years, analyzed the areas CIMA selected for Friends of the Earth Netherlands. He found that CIMA’s reference area artificially boosted the figure by oversampling lowland valleys and floodplains far more attractive to farmers — and thus vulnerable to logging — than the park’s more rugged terrain.The bigger the figure for prevented emissions, the more credits could be sold — even as the supposed benefits were overstated, Counsell found.Counsell said CIMA’s numbers were also distorted by questionable estimates of population growth in the reference area — another data point used to estimate prevented emissions, since more people typically means more forest destruction.For example, in the district of Pampa Hermosa, CIMA used estimates that population would grow by more than 700% in the decade following the program’s launch. But the park’s own figures showed population had grown on average by only 2.2% per year between 1993 and 2002.Compensate, a company that assesses and sells carbon credits, rejected Cordillera Azul for its portfolio in 2020. Its evaluation, shared with AP, also flagged both the population growth and deforestation estimates. It described the latter as “one way to inflate” the program’s prevented emissions.Will Lock, an expert in the voluntary carbon market and Peruvian Amazon conservation at the School of Global Studies in the University of Sussex, said predictions employed a “heavily exaggerated, worst-case scenario approach” that resulted in a “worrying tendency to overemphasize threats” and maximize claims of carbon saved.Zwick, from Verra, said the reference region was chosen by peer-reviewed processes, the best then available, and certain areas were excluded. He said people can and do farm on steep slopes, and topography was factored into the assessment. Questions raised at the time by independent auditors were addressed, he said, while population data was the best available then.Verra has recently said it will bring in a new rainforest carbon credit methodology by 2025.The project was carried out to the “highest quality,” said CIMA’s Varillas. Some of the observed deforestation was from natural causes, he argued, and population estimates were based on robust modeling.The project’s biggest buyers, Shell and TotalEnergies, defended their participation.A TotalEnergies spokesman said by email that comparing tree loss before and after the project gave the misleading impression it had failed, because deforestation cannot be halted instantaneously. The company only invests in carbon projects meeting “international standards and methodologies of the highest quality,” said the spokesman, who declined to allow his name to be used.A Shell spokesman also cited protection of the park as a benefit of its credit purchases, and said “catastrophic deforestation” would have occurred without the program. But the spokesman, who also declined to allow his name to be used, said Shell will conduct an additional review before further purchases.___Follow Ed Davey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EdDavey1___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851650,Takeaways from AP examination of Peru carbon credit program,"SAN MARTÍN, Peru (AP) — In the nearly 15 years that a carbon credit program has been run to safeguard one of Peru's most valuable national parks, more than 28 million credits have been sold to fossil fuel producers like Shell and TotalEnergies.The project was supposed to stop deforestation in the Cordillera Azul National Park, helping to stem carbon emissions contributing to climate change.But an analysis by independent experts and reporting by The Associated Press raises doubts about whether the project has delivered on its promise to counter-balance emissions by oil companies and others. And the tree loss has more than doubled, according to satellite analysis.Some takeaways from the AP's investigation:LAUNCH OF THE PROGRAMCordillera Azul National Park covers more than 5,000 square miles (12,950 square kilometers) on the eastern flank of the Peruvian Andes. The national park designation in 2001 gave it legal protection, but the carbon credits program was launched in 2008 after supporters argued that the park designation alone wasn’t enough to protect it from pressures including migrants seeking to clear land for farming. It is thought to be the world’s fifth-biggest forest protection carbon credit project.Money raised from sale of the credits pays for forest patrols and education of local communities to try to stop deforestation. The more than 28 million credits sold for the Cordillera Azul project, in theory, offset 28 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted by their buyers.WHAT HAPPENED WITH TREE LOSSA stated goal of the project was to prevent “all deforestation” in the park. But satellite mapping shows tree canopy loss has actually increased.Space Intelligence, a company that maps forest carbon credit projects to aid in verification, found tree loss more than doubled to an annual average of 572 hectares (1,400 acres) after the program launched until 2021, the last year for which data is available.CIMA, the Spanish acronym for the independent nonprofit that runs the park for the Peruvian government, said natural phenomena such as landslides caused the tree loss, rather than human activity like logging, farming or mining.The satellite data does show many landslides, but deforestation is a major cause of landslides, which are far more likely where deforestation has occurred. Forest loss was also double in areas close to a park boundary or rivers — areas that are most accessible, and therefore more vulnerable to logging or agriculture, than the rest of the park. More than a third of all the tree loss mapped in the gigantic park was within 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) of park boundaries or rivers. Experts say natural causes cannot be ruled out, but the evidence suggests “human disturbance of the forest” that made the landslides more likely.DUBIOUS EMISSIONS ‘SAVINGS’Experts say the Cordillera Azul program inflated projected benefits from the start. They doubt CIMA's claims in 2008 that almost 29 million tons of carbon dioxide would have been released from deforestation there over 10 years without the project.Coming up with the figure was complicated. Industry standard guidelines required CIMA to compare the project to a reference area to come up with estimates of what would happen without its protection.Simon Counsell analyzed the areas CIMA selected for this comparison for Friends of the Earth Netherlands. He said CIMA’s reference area oversampled lowland valleys and floodplains, which are far more attractive to farmers than the rest of the park's more rugged terrain.That led to an inflated estimate of land likely to be cleared for farming, leading to a higher figure for prevented emissions. That enabled more credits to be sold.Counsell also said CIMA's numbers overestimated population growth in the reference area, also boosting estimates of prevented emissions.IN DEFENSE OF THE PROGRAMCIMA's executive director, Gonzalo Varillas, said selling credits brought in enough money to almost fully fund the park's operating costs and robustly defended the way it was set up.Steve Zwick is a spokesman for the nonprofit Verra, which nets a fee for each credit certified in forest carbon projects including Cordillera Azul. He said the program was a “lifeline” for the park.Zwick also said estimates for prevented emissions were chosen by the best available processes and with the best available data.Verra has recently said it will bring in a new rainforest carbon credit methodology by 2025.The project’s biggest buyers, Shell and TotalEnergies, defended their participation. A TotalEnergies spokesman said by email that comparing tree loss before and after the project gave the misleading impression it had failed, because deforestation cannot be halted instantaneously.

He added that the decision came from the powerful Hezbollah group that he represents in the Cabinet.The announcement came a week after the project was announced and sparked a stream of criticism from media outlets over awarding the contract to an international company without holding a public tender. The airport has operated at full capacity, serving up to 8 million passengers a year.The would-be Terminal 2 was to handle 3.5 million passengers annually starting in 2027. It was to have added six docking stands as well as remote ones, Hamie said in a ceremony at government headquarters. The plans called for Terminal 2 to be built where the airport’s old cargo building used to stand.Lebanon is in the throes of its worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class.Experts and critics have blasted Lebanon’s rulers for lack of transparency and squandering public money by giving bloated development contracts to businessmen in their circles over recent decades.Lebanon’s economic crisis that began in October 2019 has left three-quarters of the country’s 6 million people, including 1 million Syrian refugees, in poverty.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851657,Prince Harry back in court for phone hacking hearing finale,"LONDON (AP) — A London judge said Thursday he would rule as soon as possible on whether to throw out or limit a phone hacking lawsuit brought by Prince Harry, Elton John and other well-known figures against a British tabloid publisher.The Duke of Sussex made a late arrival and early departure for the finale of a four-day High Court hearing on his invasion of privacy case against the company that publishes The Daily Mail. His surprise appearance during three days of the legal wrangling indicates the lawsuit’s importance in the prince’s broader battle against the British press.Harry, John, and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost are among a group of seven people suing Associated Newspapers Ltd. for allegedly paying private investigators to illegally bug homes and cars and to record phone conversations.The publisher denied the allegations and has argued that lawsuits based on alleged incidents dating as far back as 1993 should be thrown out because the cases were not filed within a six-year limitation period.Attorney David Sherborne, who represents Harry and the other famous claimants, argued that the deadline for filing the lawsuits should be extended because the alleged snooping was covert and the publisher concealed evidence of it through denials “likely to lead the claimants off the scent.”The claimants said they were unaware of phone hacking done for Associated Newspapers until private investigators, including Gavin Burrows, came forward in the last couple of years to disclose the covert work they allegedly did.Burrows, who said in a 2021 witness statement that he came forward to “do the right thing” and help the people he targeted, has since issued another sworn statement saying he had not been commissioned by Associated Newspapers to do unlawful work.In his earlier admission, however, he described how much he charged for different jobs and how Harry, John and his husband, David Furnish, and Hurley and Frost were “just a small handful of my targets.”He said he “must have done hundreds of jobs"" between 2000 and 2005 for a Mail on Sunday journalist whose name is redacted.In one section cited by Sherborne, Burrows described tapping Hurley's home phone, hacking her voicemail and digging up travel and medical details on her when she was pregnant. Burrows said that John didn't have a mobile phone but he got a lot of information about the singer from Hurley's phone because she was close friends with him, and through the phone of John's gardener.“I hacked, tapped and bugged Liz a number of times,” Burrows said in his earlier statement. ""She (like Hugh Grant) was a huge earner for me. I could get an itemized phone bill for Liz and Hugh and sell each one for 5,000 pounds (about $6,185), much more than the average price on my menu.""Until she read Burrows statement, Hurley did not know who had been the source of the information about her, Sherborne said.""That’s the trigger. That’s when the scales fall from her eyes,” Sherborne said.Attorney Adrian Beltrami said the claims had been brought “far too late” and should be tossed out. He argued that a national scandal on phone hacking by journalists at other papers a decade ago could have inspired the claimants to look into articles written about them and file their lawsuits alleging wrongdoing within the time limits.Justice Matthew Nicklin said there was a difference between applying time limits to discovery of the alleged unlawful information gathering and the articles that resulted from some of those acts.""It’s clear what the claimants are not entitled to pursue because of limitation,” Nicklin said. “But what they are entitled to pursue is slightly more nuanced than simply striking out reference to the articles.”Attorney Steven Heffer, who is not involved in the case, said the defense is unlikely to prevail at this stage if they concealed the unlawful activity.“Other newspaper groups emphatically denied phone hacking or any unlawful information gathering, but have had to pay millions in damages and costs,” Heffer said.The publisher is also seeking to have evidence of payments to investigators barred from being used by claimants because it was protected by confidentiality rules when it was turned over by the publisher to a government inquiry into media law breaking.Sherborne argued the evidence is in the public domain.Attorney Michael Gardner, who also is not involved in the litigation, said Harry and the other claimants face an uphill battle on several fronts.“First, the events in question took place so long ago that they may now be statute barred,” Gardner said. “Secondly, the evidence they are relying on includes material that may be inadmissible. Thirdly, a key witness in the case appears to have signed two completely contradictory statements.”",2023/03/31,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851666,QMC Supports Canada-U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chain,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - March 30, 2023 -  QMC Quantum Minerals Corp., (TSXV: QMC) (FSE: 3LQ) (OTC Pink: QMCQF) (""QMC"" or ""the Company"") is encouraged by the recently announced 2023 Canadian Federal Budget (""Federal Budget"") and its endorsement of investment in the green economy. The Federal Budget features multiple measures aimed at combatting climate change, transforming the nation's economy and fostering the development of future net-zero industries. The latest federal measures include investment tax credits, low-cost strategic financing, and targeted investments and programs to address the distinct requirements of industries or projects with national economic importance. Of particular importance to the Company is the newly introduced Investment Tax Credit for Clean Technology Manufacturing, estimated to cost CAD $11.1 billion over a 12-year period.    The Federal Budget builds on last week's meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and United States President Joe Biden, reaffirming that Canada and the United States will work together to create a strong, environmentally responsible, and resilient North American critical mineral supply chain. Through the Canadian Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, CAD $1.5 billion will be made available to support clean energy and transportation infrastructure projects necessary to accelerate critical minerals production. An additional CAD $1.5 billion will be made available through the Strategic Innovation Fund to support advanced manufacturing, processing, and recycling.   The Federal Budget also highlights the importance of establishing major battery manufacturing in Canada. Further information about the incentives offered to Powerco, a Volkswagen subsidiary, which plans to construct a battery gigafactory in St. Thomas, Ontario, will be released in due course. This facility constitutes a substantial part of the North American manufacturing industry.   ""We at QMC are thrilled with the 2023 Canadian Federal Budget's emphasis on green economy investments. The variety of measures introduced demonstrates the government's commitment to addressing climate change and progressing towards net-zero emissions. Our Irgon Lithium Mine project will be an important part of Canada's critical mineral supply chain.""   PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:    Historic Resource:  Between 1953 and 1954, the Lithium Corporation of Canada Limited (""LCOC"") reported a historical resource estimate on the Irgon Dike of 1.2 million tons grading 1.51% Li20 over a strike length of 365 metres and to a depth of 213 metres. This historical resource is documented in a 1956 Assessment Report by B. B. Bannatyne for LCOC (Manitoba Assessment Report No. 94932). This historical resource estimate is believed to be based on reasonable assumptions and both the Company and QP has no reason to contest the document's relevance and reliability.         Existing Underground Development: During 1956/1957 a complete mining plant was installed, and since removed, on site designed to process 500 tons of ore per day and a three-compartment shaft was sunk to a depth of 74 metres. On the 61-metre level, lateral development was extended off the shaft for a total of 366 metres of drifting from which six crosscuts transected the dike.         Excellent Historic Recoveries: Historic metallurgical tests reported an 87% recovery from which a concentrate averaging 5.9% Li2O was obtained.         Excellent Local Infrastructure:  The Irgon Property is transected by Manitoba Highway 314 with access to hydro, water, nearby rail head and is located only 20 kilometres north of the Sinomine Rare Metal Resources Group's TANCO Mine which is currently mining spodumene and producing a lithium concentrate on site.         Pending NI 43-101 Report: A NI 43-101 technical report is nearing completion which will update the historical lithium resource to current NI 43-101 standards.        The mineral reserve cited above is presented as a historical estimate and uses historical terminology which does not conform to current NI43-101 standards. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Although the historical estimates are believed to be based on reasonable assumptions, they were calculated prior to the implementation of National Instrument 43-101. These historical estimates do not meet current standards as defined under sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43-101; consequently, the issuer is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.   Qualified Person and NI 43-101 Disclosure    The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Daniel Leroux, P. Geo. who is a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.   About the Company    QMC is a British Columbia based company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of resource properties. Its objective is to locate and develop economic precious, base, rare metal resource properties of merit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851696,Olympic head slams 'deplorable' government views on Russia,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Criticism by European governments of the push to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes into world sports before the 2024 Paris Games was called “deplorable” by the International Olympic Committee leader on Thursday.IOC president Thomas Bach also suggested those governments – which seemed to include his own home country Germany – had “double standards” for focusing on athletes from countries involved in just one of about 70 wars and armed conflicts ongoing in the world.Bach detailed IOC advice on Tuesday to individual Olympic sports bodies of conditions by which they could decide to approve individual Russian or Belarusians to compete as neutral athletes, while continuing a ban from team sports.The IOC said sports should exclude athletes who have military links, though Bach clarified on Thursday this likely should not apply to those who did one year of mandatory service.“We have taken note of some negative reactions by some European governments in particular,” Bach said at a news conference after an IOC executive board meeting.Germany sports minister Nancy Faeser said the IOC’s shift from its position one year ago to exclude all athletes and teams from Russia and Belarus as “a slap in the face of Ukrainian athletes.”“Those who let the warmonger Russia use international competitions for its propaganda are damaging the Olympic idea of peace and international understanding,” Faeser said, echoing comments from other Ukrainian allies including Poland.Bach responded it was deplorable that some governments “do not want to respect the majority within the Olympic movement and of all the stakeholders nor the autonomy of sport which they are praising and requesting from other countries.”“It’s deplorable that these governments don’t address the question of double standards with which we have been confronted,” the German lawyer said.“We have not seen a single comment from them about their attitude about the participation of athletes whose countries are involved in the other 70 wars and armed conflicts in the world.”Criticism of sports officials was only hardening their stance against lawmakers, Bach suggested, and “strengthened the unity.”“It cannot be up to the governments to decide which athletes can participate in which competition,” he said.The final decision on which Russian and Belarusian teams can compete in international events, including qualification for the Paris Olympics, is for the governing bodies of individual sports.However, World Athletics said last week it will continue its more than year-long exclusion for “the foreseeable future.”___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851697,Used car prices are surging. Here's why you should buy now,"Well, it was nice while it lasted.For nearly a year, the average used vehicle in the United States had been edging toward affordable again for millions of people. The relief felt belated and relatively slight, but it was welcome nonetheless.From an eye-watering peak of $31,400 in April of last year, the average price had dropped 14% to $27,125 early this month.Now, with the supply of used vehicles failing to keep up with robust demand, prices are creeping up again, with signs pointing to further increases ahead. So many buyers have been priced out of the new-car market that fewer trade-ins are landing on dealer lots. Deepening the shortage, fewer used vehicles are coming off leases or being off-loaded by rental car companies.Average list prices for used car have edged up by about $700 in the past month, and Alex Yurchenko, chief data officer for Black Book, which tracks prices, expects them to keep rising at least into summer.“If you have to buy a used vehicle,"" he suggested, ""right now would be a good time.”Pete Catalano, a dealer in Independence, Missouri, near Kansas City, has been struggling to get his hands on enough affordably priced cars. Typically, Catalano and his daughter, who co-own Stadium Auto, would have about 50 vehicles on their used-car lot near Arrowhead Stadium. They now have only about half as many. Some of their rival dealers, Catalano said, enjoy a competitive advantage because they can afford to offer financing to buyers with poor credit.Squeezed by higher prices for gasoline, groceries and utilities, many of Catalano's customers can’t afford either new or late-model used vehicles. Some would-be buyers he knows are using tax refunds just to make ends meet instead of buying a needed car.“A used inexpensive car is now becoming more and more of a luxury,” Catalano said. “What the market wants right now is not available, and that’s $3,000, $4,000 and $5,000 cars.”Behind the vehicle shortage and inflated prices is simple supply and demand. Much of the problem stems from the surging prices of new cars. In February, according to Edmunds, the average new vehicle in the United States sold for nearly $48,000 — beyond the reach of many consumers.Though the supply of new vehicles has inched up, they remain relatively scarce and expensive. Automakers still lack sufficient computer chips to produce enough vehicles to meet demand, a lingering consequence of pandemic-related supply shortages. Sales of new vehicles last year were about 3 million below normal levels. Fewer new-car sales mean fewer trade-ins, which mean fewer used vehicles for sale.With used prices rising again, analysts say buyers who can afford to do so should buy soon. Auto loan rates may continue rising this year as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates.On used lots these days, bargains are hard to find. Even after accounting for the price drops of the past year, the average used vehicle remains about 35% above where it was before the pandemic erupted three years ago. At that time, the average price was $20,425.Once the government sent stimulus checks to most American households, demand for autos rose as many people spent their money. As they did, the supply of used vehicles fell and prices surged. By early last year, the average used-vehicle price was more than 50% above its pre-pandemic point.Worsening the shortfall was a scarcity of affordable new vehicles. Automakers were using their tight supply of computer chips to build pricier and more profitable SUVs and pickups. They built fewer affordable new models — a trend that sent more buyers to used-car lots. The result was increased demand and higher prices for used vehicles.All of which left people like Carol Rice struggling to find a decent affordable used vehicle. Rice, 65, endured a long period of frustration while shopping for a used small pickup for her farm near Carbondale, Kansas. For six months, she found little.“I'm retired, and I can't afford to buy a new vehicle,” she said. “There weren't that many used vehicles, and if there were used vehicles, they were quite expensive.”Last month, she finally found a 2003 Ford Ranger on Catalano's website that she liked and could afford. She bought it for $7,700. Though it’s 20 years old and has 140,000 miles on it, the Ranger is in solid condition and has the all-wheel-drive that Rice wanted.“It was a good-looking vehicle, and the price was right,” she said.In the immediate future, few analysts expect price declines for used vehicles. Catalano doesn’t foresee any sustained price drops for perhaps the next year or two.Others say it's hard to predict. Amy Gieffers, a senior vice president at Vroom, an online auto buying site, notes that some market forces could continue to keep supply down and prices up: Fewer trade-ins, less leasing, lower fleet sales by rental car companies.On the other hand, she says, more expensive vehicles and higher loan rates could depress buyer demand. Eventually, dealers might be forced to cut prices.“It’s really complex right now,"" she said, “because you have some competing forces.”Both Yurchenko of Black Book and Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive, say they expect used-vehicle prices to rise through summer before easing slightly as part of a normal late-year depreciation cycle.At the start of this year, Chesbrough said, he thought higher loan rates would chase away buyers from both the new and used markets. Instead, robust demand from affluent buyers for pricey late-model used vehicles has strengthened sales in the United States.Many of these buyers are paying cash to avoid higher interest rates. Edmunds.com says the average loan rate on a used vehicle is now 11.3%, up from 8.1% when the Fed started raising rates a year ago.Because demand is intense and vehicle supplies short, Chesbrough doesn't foresee sales dropping even if the economy were to slide into a recession. Though many buyers with lower credit scores have left the market, sales remain solid.With used-car inventories likely to remain crimped for the foreseeable future, Chesbrough doesn't expect prices to ever fall back to near their pre-pandemic levels“We just haven't been creating enough personal transportation in the last couple of years,” Chesbrough said.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851698,Germany criticizes Russian role in French nuclear fuel plant,"BERLIN (AP) — German officials have criticized plans by French firm Framatome to produce nuclear fuel in a joint venture with Russia's Rosatom at a facility in western Germany, and said Thursday that they will consider whether an application to do so can be rejected.Officials in the state of Lower Saxony have received a request for the Framatome-owned ANF facility in Lingen, near the German-Dutch border, to be allowed to produce hexagonal fuel rod arrangements used in Soviet-designed water-water energetic reactors. Such reactors, known by the Russian acronym VVER, are common in Eastern Europe and the fuel production would take place under license from state-owned Rosatom.“Doing business with (Russian President) Putin must stop, and that also and especially applies to the nuclear sector,” Lower Saxony's Energy Minister Christian Meyer said.He added that it would be wrong to cement the nuclear industry's dependence on Russia through a direct or indirect involvement of Rosatom at the Lingen facility “in view of Putin’s brutal energy war against Europe.”A senior German nuclear official said the request by ANF is now being closely scrutinized by federal and state authorities due to Rosatom's involvement.“We view the influence of Rosatom in Europe with particular concern,” said Gerrit Niehaus, who heads the nuclear safety department at Germany's Environment Ministry. “Rosatom is an arm of the (Russian) state, which is involved in the military nuclear administration and the production of nuclear weapons. Naturally we want to push back against that influence.”Rosatom has been accused of involvement in Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, which is Europe’s largest.Niehaus noted that the European Union has not imposed the same sanctions on the Russian nuclear sector as it has on Russia's fossil fuel industry. This poses a legal problem for German authorities in blocking Rosatom's involvement.“However I can announce that our oversight concerning nuclear laws will go as far as legally possible,” he said. “Particularly when it comes to the question of the conditions for approval and the grounds for refusal we will examine very carefully what options we have to consider the negative influence of a state company like Rosatom.""Neither Framatome nor its owner, EDF, immediately responded to a request for comment.",2023/03/30,,World
