Denver, US - News Direct - 22 March 2023 -  Velocity Global, the leading provider of global talent solutions, today announced new financial metrics and corporate momentum to include:        Crossed the      $200M ARR threshold.            More than      40% organic growth YoY.        Profitable YTD in 2023, as it has been seven of the last nine years.            Nearly 1,500 customers, including      Databricks,      Penguin Random House,      Linksys, International Justice Mission,      Crunchbase,      Dragonfly, and Schwans International.        Enhancements to the employee and employer experience through partnerships with companies like      Upflex and strategic integrations with leading HR technologies like      BambooHR,      Greenhouse,      HiBob, and      Namely.            Platform updates including      automated quoting and      faster, self-service employment contract creation, which is already helping early customers experience 50% faster onboarding times as well as a forthcoming      simplified UI to improve the customer experience.                  The increase in demand for technology platforms that make it possible to compliantly hire and pay talent around the world has provided significant tailwinds for Velocity Global. That demand has been accelerated by economic uncertainty and other macroeconomic issues that make remote work, global expansion, and access to talent mission critical. Earlier this month, nearly 20% of Velocity Global’s client base was directly affected by Silicon Valley Bank, accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in payroll. The good news: redundancies built directly into the Global Work Platform - alongside a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity - allowed us to ensure our clients' payroll would not be disrupted.   “Velocity Global’s growth is a testament to our team’s commitment in building a solution that is defining the future of work, while navigating the complexities of compensating employees across the world in a compliant way,” said Ben Wright, CEO and co-founder. “In our industry, being right is just as important as being fast, and that’s reinforced by 70% of our customers who cite compliance measures as to why they chose our platform. The fact is that recent developments in the financial sector reminded us that building redundancies around payroll and compliance are non-negotiable. We are building a platform that isn’t just reactionary to the industry, but pioneering its future.”   Other Notable Milestones & Company Updates:    Key Technology & Product Hires: Across design, engineering and technology including      Winnie Wong, Vice President of Design,      Kumar Ramanathan, Vice President of Engineering & Chief Architect, and      Chuck Kim, Vice President of Cloud and Corporate Infrastructure.        Global Expansion: Offering support in more than 185 countries with more than 7,500 supported employees across more than 60 entities around the world. This includes recent additions like Ghana, Egypt, Uruguay, Ukraine, and Argentina, with several more planned for Q2.        Customers: Velocity Global continues to expand its enterprise clientele with more than a dozen major universities, 50+ global retail brands, dozens of nonprofits including three NGO’s, and thousands of other large companies in every major industry spanning rocket builders to amusement parks to publishers to technology companies to cutting-edge investment firms.        New Partnerships: With Upflex, whose platform gives people access to 10,000 locations from more than 1,250 providers - including Wework, Industrious, and The Office Group, Velocity Global now has the capabilities to offer non-traditional benefits options for clients and supported employees.        Industry Analyst Recognition: Velocity Global was named as a leader in      NelsonHall’s Vendor Evaluation & Assessment Tool (NEAT) for global employer of record (EoR) services as well as      Everest Group’s PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2022 for employer of record (EoR) solutions.        Integrations: New integrations with Bamboo HR, Greenhouse, HiBob, and Namely to source talent, onboard, and manage the workforce, remove the friction of dealing with multiple systems and data transfers. Most companies already use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and HR Information Systems (HRIS), so by integrating these into Velocity Global’s EoR solution, Global Work Platform, expanding and maintaining a global workforce becomes as easy as a click away.        “We’ve seen double-digit growth in the EoR market over the last few years and expect this growth to continue as the model addresses a very real need for companies to attract and retain top talent anywhere in the world,” said Jeanine Crane-Thompson, Principal HR Analyst at NelsonHall. “As an early player in the industry, Velocity Global stands out with its deep in-country expertise and continued technology innovation providing its customers with peace of mind and speed as it comes to employing talent across the globe.”   For more information, visit  www.velocityglobal.com.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843704,"A 5,000-mile seaweed belt is headed toward Florida","WASHINGTON (AP) — A 5,000-mile seaweed belt lurking in the Atlantic Ocean is expected in the next few months to wash onto beaches in the Caribbean Sea, South Florida, and the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt — as the biomass stretching from West Africa to the Gulf of Mexico is called — contains scattered patches of seaweed on the open sea, rather than one continuous blob of sargassum. It's not a new occurrence, but satellite images captured in February showed an earlier start than usual for such a large accumulation in the open ocean.Once it washes ashore, sargassum is a nuisance — a thick, brown algae that carpets beaches, releasing a pungent smell as it decays and entangling humans and animals who step into it. For hotels and resorts, clearing the stuff off beaches can amount to a round-the-clock operation.Here's a look at this year's sargassum seaweed bloom:WHAT IS SARGASSUM?A leafy brown seaweed festooned with what look like berries. The seaweed floats on the open ocean and — unlike other seaweeds — reproduces on the water's surface, helped by air-filled structures that give it buoyancy.Sargassum originates in a vast stretch of the Atlantic Ocean called the Sargasso Sea, which lies well off the southeast U.S. The Sargasso has no land boundaries; instead, four prevailing ocean currents form its boundaries.The matted brown seaweed stretches for miles across the ocean and provides breeding ground, food and habitat for fish, sea turtles and marine birds, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“It’s a dynamic, constantly changing set of pieces of this large mass,” said Rick Lumpkin, director of the Physical Oceanography Division at NOAA. “It’s not one big continuous blob heading straight to South Florida.”WHY IS IT A PROBLEM?Sargassum piles up on beaches where it quickly decomposes under hot sun, releasing gases that smell like rotten eggs.In recent years, sargassum has carpeted beaches on some Caribbean islands and Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula in the spring and summer months. Beach towns and cities and hotels have struggled to keep up with the huge amounts of seaweed that wash ashore.WHAT ABOUT THIS YEAR?Some sargassum has already reached beaches in Key West, said Chuanmin Hu, a professor of oceanography at the University of South Florida. But most of it will arrive in the summer, Hu said.“What is unusual this year compared to previous years is it started early,” Hu said. The algae generally blooms in the spring and summer, but “this year, in the winter, we already have a lot.""Southern Florida, the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula typically see sargassum piling up in the summer months and could expect the same this year, Hu said.IS THIS MUCH SARGASSUM UNUSUAL?It's a lot, but it's been worse.Scientists estimate there's more than 10 million metric tons of sargassum in the belt this year. Lumpkin called it “one of the strongest years, but not the strongest"" since scientists began closely observing the biomass via satellite imagery in 2011.He said there was more in 2018. The years 2019 and 2021 also saw a great deal of sargassum, he said.WHAT CAUSES IT?Scientists aren't exactly sure, in part because it wasn't closely monitored until 2011.“We do know that to get a lot of seaweed, you need nutrients, and you need sunlight. Of course, as you get close to the equator, there’s going to be more sunlight,” said Mike Parsons, a professor of marine science at Florida Gulf Coast University.Parsons and other experts say agricultural runoff seeping into the Amazon and Orinoco rivers and eventually the ocean could explain the increased growth of the belt on the western side. Parsons said warming waters likely help the seaweed grow faster. Changes in wind patterns, sea currents, rainfall and drought could also affect blooms.“It may be the entire belt is fed more some years than others by dust that contains iron and other nutrients that comes from the Sahara Desert,” said Lumpkin, of NOAA.It's not clear whether climate change is playing any part. Hu said extreme weather that is happening more frequently due to climate change — high wind events, storms, more precipitation — could be a contributor.IS SARGASSUM HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH?It can be. When sargassum decomposes, it releases ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which accounts for the rotten-egg stench. Brief exposure isn't enough to make people sick, but prolonged exposure — especially for those with respiratory issues — can be dangerous, scientists say.Hu said it could be an issue for hotel workers and others who may spend hours removing the decomposing sargassum from beaches.Left to rot on the beach, sargassum can turn into a problem. It can harm coastal marine ecosystems and also supports the growth of fecal bacteria.___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843705,Report: 119K people hurt by riot-control weapons since 2015,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — More than 119,000 people have been injured by tear gas and other chemical irritants around the world since 2015 and some 2,000 suffered injuries from “less lethal” impact projectiles, according to a report released Wednesday.Physicians for Human Rights and the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, which produced the report, called it “the most comprehensive study on crowd-control weapons to date.”The report on casualties from a largely unregulated industry cites an alarming evolution of crowd-control devices into more powerful and indiscriminate designs and deployment, including dropping tear gas from drones.Produced in collaboration with the Omega Research Foundation, the report took 2 1/2 years to compile and used medical literature. Some of the injuries were fatal but it was impossible from the data to estimate the total number of deaths, said the report’s lead author, Rohini Haar, an emergency room physician and researcher at the University of California School of Public Health in Berkeley.The vast majority of the data comes from cases in which a person came to an emergency room with injuries from crowd-control weapons and the attending doctor or hospital staff made the effort to document it, Haar said in an interview.The report calls for bans of rubber bullets and of multi-projectile devices in all crowd-control settings and tighter restrictions on weapons that may be used indiscriminately, such as tear gas, acoustic weapons and water cannons, which in some cases have been loaded with dyes and chemical irritants. Governments should also ensure these weapons are subject to rigorous independent testing, with testing, evaluation and approval involving law enforcement, technical specialists and health professionals, among others, the report said.U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said the study underscores serious issues.“These troubling global numbers echo the concerns I raised locally when Donald Trump first dispatched armed troops to Portland in 2020 with no guidance on their use of chemical munitions near schools and against protesters when most were peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights,” Wyden said. “The report’s recommendations are very worthy of consideration by the Department of Homeland Security.”Portland, Oregon, was an epicenter of racial justice protests after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May 2020. Police and protesters clashed, with officers firing tear gas, pepper spray and other devices, turning parts of the city into battle grounds.Then-President Trump sent militarized federal agents to protect federal property and the violence escalated, with agents dousing the crowds with tear gas and other irritants. Bystanders and nearby residents choked on the fumes, their eyes watering and burning. Some protesters launched fireworks at agents and shined lasers in their eyes.Portland Police Bureau spokesperson Terri Wallo Strauss noted that the department's updated policy emphasizes “the goal of avoiding the use of force, when feasible.”This month alone, crowd-control weapons were used in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, France, Georgia, Greece, Israel and the Palestinian territories, Italy, Kenya, Mozambique, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United States, the rights groups said.Police say the devices are, if used properly, an effective tool for dispersing rioters.“Rallies basically spin out of control when they’ve been hijacked by individuals that have come in with a nefarious purpose to create the riots, the looting, those type of things. And then, obviously, law enforcement has to come in and try their best to create a safe resolution and try to restore order,” Park City, Utah, Police Chief Wade Carpenter said during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests.Carpenter is also an official with the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which has more than 32,000 members in more than 170 countries. The group declined to comment on the new report. But in 2019, it recommended guidelines on crowd management.Pepper spray, or oleoresin capsicum, may be used against “specific individuals engaged in unlawful conduct or actively resisting arrest, or as necessary in a defensive capacity,” the guidelines state. “OC spray shall not be used indiscriminately against groups of people where bystanders would be unreasonably affected, or against passively resistant individuals.”But the internet is full of instances in which pepper spray was used against non-resisting people, including against Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death by Memphis police in January.Tear gas “may be deployed defensively to prevent injury when lesser force options are either not available or would likely be ineffective,” the IACP guidance states. Projectiles that are supposed to hit a surface like a street before impacting a person “may be used in civil disturbances where life is in immediate jeopardy or the need to use the devices outweighs the potential risks involved.”Direct-fired impact munitions, including beanbag rounds, ""may be used during civil disturbances against specific individuals who are engaged in conduct that poses an immediate threat of death or serious injury,” the guidance says. Protesters have been blinded and suffered brain damage from beanbag rounds.Numerous lawsuits have been filed over use of force by police during protests.In November, the city of Portland reached a $250,000 settlement with five demonstrators in a federal lawsuit over police use of tear gas and other crowd-control devices during racial justice protests.But last month, a federal judge threw out an excessive force claim against an unnamed federal agent who fired an impact munition at the forehead of protester Donavan La Bella, fracturing his skull, as he held up a music speaker during a racial justice demonstration in Portland in 2020. La Bella continues to struggle with a severe head injury.Haar, who is a medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, said the number of injured is far greater than what she compiled from medical reports.“Basically, we knew we're capturing sort of the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""This is just a tiny fraction of what the world is experiencing on a daily basis. The vast majority of injuries — even significant severe injuries — go unreported.”___Associated Press writer Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843706,Holy month of Ramadan begins for Muslims across the world,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Muslim holy month of Ramadan began at sundown on Wednesday, as the faithful prepared for a month of dawn-to-dusk fasting intended to bring them closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate.For the next 30 days, Muslims will refrain from eating or drinking anything — even the tiniest sip of water — from sunrise to sunset. Many will strictly observe prayers, read the Quran and donate to charity as they seek to draw closer to God. Family and friends will gather for joyful nightly feasts.This year many will struggle to afford holiday treats amid soaring prices fueled in part by the war in Ukraine. Iran, Egypt and Lebanon are grappling with economic crises that have weakened their local currencies, making things even more expensive.The holy month will also be shadowed by the suffering in Turkey and Syria, where an earthquake last month killed more than 52,000 people, and in conflict zones across the Muslim world, though there have been some encouraging signs of possible reconciliation.“We used to look forward to Ramadan as the most beautiful month of every year,” said 19-year-old Rama Jamal, recalling how her family would decorate the house and sit together reading the Quran.Now she lives alone in the war-ravaged northern Idlib province of Syria. After surviving more than a decade of war, her parents and brother were killed in the earthquake.“Now I’m by myself, and there’s no mood of Ramadan, there’s no joy,” Jamal said. “I’m missing my family all the time, every hour.”In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade since the militant group Hamas seized power there in 2007, residents struggling to cope with higher prices also fear another war amid months of soaring Israeli-Palestinian violence.“The prices of many staples have increased crazily,” said Mohammed Forra, a grocery store owner in the Gaza City. He said the price of cooking spices has doubled since last year.More than 1.8 billion Muslims, who account for around a quarter of the world’s population, are expected to observe Ramadan. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the month begins a week and a half earlier each year, cycling through the seasons, including the long days of hot summers.The start of the month depends on the sighting of the crescent moon by local religious authorities and astronomers, and can sometimes vary from country to country. But this year there was broad agreement that it began Wednesday evening, with Thursday declared as the first day of fasting.In Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, worshippers flooded mosques for evening prayers after authorities declared that several Islamic astronomy observer teams had sighted the crescent moon in different regions. Muslim authorities in Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern countries have also announced that Ramadan will begin Wednesday night.Muslims believe God began revealing the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad during Ramadan more than 1,400 years ago.The fast is one of the five pillars of Islam and is required for all Muslims, though exceptions are made for young children and the sick, as well as women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or menstruating. Travelers are also exempt, including athletes attending tournaments away from home.Those observing the fast must refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise to sunset. They are also encouraged to refrain from cursing, fighting, gossip or road rage throughout the holy month.Many Muslims, particularly those who live in the U.S. and Europe, are accepting and welcoming of others around them who are not observing Ramadan. They also are not expecting shorter work hours, as is the case in the public sector across much of the Arab world during Ramadan.Eating or drinking in public during the day is generally frowned upon in Muslim-majority countries. In some, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — home to a large expatriate population in Dubai and Abu Dhabi — it can be punished by fines or imprisonment.The normal bustle of cities dies down by late afternoon, with streets emptying and shops closing early. Muslims traditionally break the fast at sunset as the Prophet Muhammad was said to have done, with a sip of water and a few dates. Some can be seen happily indulging in a long-awaited cigarette.After sunset prayers, family and friends gather for “iftars” — feasts with local holiday treats like candies and nuts. Mosques and charities set up outdoor banquets where the poor can eat for free each night of Ramadan. Muslims then wake up early for “suhoor,” a small meal eaten just before dawn.Five-star hotels, particularly in wealthy Arab Gulf countries, host lavish iftars, and cable networks unveil big-budget soap operas, raking in millions in advertising. Both practices have been criticized by conservatives who fear Ramadan is becoming too commercial.Ramadan culminates in Laylat al-Qadr, or the Night of Destiny, during the last 10 nights of the month, when Muslims engage in intense late night worship. Muslims believe this was the night God sent the Angel Gabriel to the prophet to reveal the first verses of the Quran.After the last day of fasting, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a festive three-day holiday in which children are often given new clothes and gifts.___Associated Press writers Ghaith Alsayed in Idlib, Syria, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843707,"Racism, gambling, goals; the remarkable rise of Ivan Toney","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — No matter how many blows Ivan Toney takes, the goals just keep on coming.There has been the racist abuse on social media and a potential ban after he was charged with 262 breaches of English soccer's gambling laws.There was also his exclusion from England's World Cup squad last year, despite his prolific scoring form for unfashionable Brentford.Toney, however, continues to find the back of the net at such a rate that only Erling Haaland and Harry Kane have scored more than him in the Premier League this season.As such, England coach Gareth Southgate could not ignore the 27-year-old striker when naming his squad for the European Championship qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine this week, even with so much uncertainty surrounding the player's future.Should Toney be found guilty of the gambling charges that date back to 2017, he is likely to face a lengthy ban.""There hasn’t been a trial as yet or any judgment so I don’t know on what basis we wouldn’t pick him,” Southgate said after his selection last week.While Toney's form arguably made it impossible for his national team to overlook him, Southgate has no way of knowing his availability for the remainder of the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign in light of the charges.Former Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton was banned for 18 months in 2017 after admitting placing 1,260 soccer-related bets over a period of more than 10 years. That was later reduced by almost five months on appeal.Former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge received a four-month suspension in 2020 for breaching rules on inside information related to gambling.Toney's punishment could fall somewhere between those two cases if he is found guilty.His England call-up was perhaps even more surprising after he publicly questioned the FA's handling of his case following reports he could be ruled out for six months. Writing on Instagram this month, he said he was ""worried about the process.”If a potential ban is weighing on his mind, it has not been evident when playing for Brentford this season.He has scored 17 goals in 27 appearances in all competitions for the London club, which has confounded expectations by holding its own in the top flight since Toney helped lead it to promotion two years ago.His 16 goals in the league have only been bettered by Manchester City’s Haaland, with 28, and England captain Kane, who has scored 21.Even if, as is likely, Toney remains benched against Italy and Ukraine, his ascent during such a turbulent time is remarkable, with his form apparently unaffected by the noise surrounding him.He demonstrated his resilience in November, when, just days after learning he would not be part of England's World Cup squad, he outshone Haaland by scoring twice in a shock 2-1 win against City.“He’s having a brilliant season, playing well for Brentford, scoring a lot of goals,” said England teammate and Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell on Tuesday. “As someone to come up against as a player, he is obviously a handful, a very physical player, but technically very good as well and in front of goal he’s potent.”Toney has also had to contend with racist abuse.In October he shared a screenshot of an Instagram direct message containing racist language.“I wasn’t even going to post this but I woke up angry,” he wrote on his Twitter account.A man has since been banned from every soccer stadium in Britain for three years after Toney's tweet led to a police investigation.But Toney was the target of more online racist attacks after scoring against title-chasing Arsenal last month.“We are disgusted and saddened that Ivan has had to deal with this yet again,” Brentford said at the time.That Toney has shown such strength of character is not surprising given the setbacks he had to endure in his early career after failing to make it at Newcastle.He was sent out for six separate loan spells at lower-league clubs, including Barnsley, Shrewsbury and Scunthorpe, and less than three years ago was playing in England’s third division for Peterborough.Brentford provided his route to the Premier League, but only after his 33 goals helped the club secure promotion in 2021.He has proved he belongs in the top flight and, ordinarily, his form would have seen leading English clubs make their move.For instance, Manchester United is in the hunt for a prolific striker this summer, with Kane and Napoli's Victor Osimhen potential targets. Toney would represent a cheaper alternative.Newcastle could also look to strengthen in attack at the end of the season, paving the way for a potential return for Toney.It would be difficult, however, for any team to make a bid before the FA charges are resolved.Any thoughts of a big transfer will have to be put on hold for now, with Toney's career in something of a state of limbo despite his reputation growing game by game.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843708,"Once a TV show, 'Smash' to make its Broadway bow in 2024","NEW YORK (AP) — The glitzy, fictional Broadway musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe that formed the heart of the TV show “Smash” will make the leap to an actual Broadway stage next season.Producers said Wednesday that “Smash” is slated for Broadway in the 2024-25 season, welcome news to many of the show's fans and the Broadway community who embraced its look at the inner workings of their industry.“'Smash' is near and dear to my heart, and it was always my hope that a musical inspired by the show would eventually come to the stage,” said lead producer Steven Spielberg in a statement.The new book for “Smash” will be co-written Tony-nominated Rick Elice, who penned “Jersey Boys,” and Tony-winner Bob Martin, who won for “The Drowsy Chaperone.”No casting for the Broadway version was revealed. The series on NBC lasted two seasons starting in 2012 and starred Megan Hilty, Jeremy Jordan, Katharine McPhee, Leslie Odom Jr., Krysta Rodriguez, Christian Borle and Debra Messing. The songs included ""“History is Made at Night,” “Let Me Be Your Star” and “Hang the Moon.”Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman, who wrote many of the songs for the TV show and whose credits include the Tony-winning score for the 2007 musical “Hairspray,” will continue with the stage adaptation, as will original choreographer Joshua Bergasse, who has gone on to choreograph “On The Town” and “Gigi.”In the series — created by playwright Theresa Rebeck, who left after the first season — viewers watched the long process of casting, composing, mounting and rehearsing a Broadway-bound musical, “Bombshell.”In the second season, a gritty, low-tech off-Broadway show called “Hit List” competed with “Bombshell” for the Tony Award. Since “Hit List” songs included writing credits for Drew Gasparini, Joe Iconis, Andrew McMahon, Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Lucie Silvas — in addition to Shaiman and Wittman — it seems that the “Hit List” part of the fictional tale will not make it to “Smash” on Broadway.The new musical will be helmed by five-time Tony-winning director Susan Stroman. Robert Greenblatt and Neil Meron join Spielberg as lead producers.“Ever since the show ended in 2012, not a week goes by that someone doesn’t ask us when will they see Smash as a musical. We think we’ve come up with something the die-hard series fans will love but that will also be exciting for people who never saw an episode of the show,"" Meron said in a statement.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/22,,World

He posted a photo of himself wearing Algeria's national jersey on Instagram.“L'OL (Lyon) offers its support to @HoussemAouar along with all the other people who are victims of racism and discriminatory acts because of their origins and life choices,” Lyon posted on Twitter, adding that it “condemns hatred.”Aouar played once for France in a friendly match against Ukraine three years ago. He has also represented France at the youth level and with the under-21 team.Aouar, who was jeered by some of his home fans during a league game against Nantes last Friday, posted a screenshot on Instagram on Wednesday showing some of the racist abuse he has been receiving.Last November, Aouar posted a photo of himself holding up a red card on Twitter to join the campaign against cyber harassment.He is one of several players to have come through Lyon's renowned youth academy and has scored 46 goals in 251 games for Lyon.His contract with the seven-time French champions ends in June.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843710,Deputies: Alabama player drove 141 mph to evade traffic stop,"BONIFAY, Fla. (AP) — Suspended Alabama freshman defensive back Tony Mitchell drove over 141 mph (227 kph) while trying to evade deputies before his arrest on drug charges in the Florida Panhandle last week, authorities said.Mitchell and another man, who was a passenger in Mitchell's car, were arrested last week and charged with possession of marijuana with the intent to sell or deliver, according to a Holmes County Sheriff’s Office arrest report. The other man also was charged with carrying a concealed gun without a permit. Holmes County is located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Panama City and shares its northern border with Alabama.According to the report, a deputy spotted Mitchell's black Dodge Challenger traveling 78 mph (125 kph) in a 55 mph (88 kph) zone on a rural highway north of Bonifay last Wednesday night and attempted to pull the vehicle over. The deputy reported that the Challenger accelerated to over 141 mph (227 kph), and the deputy discontinued pursuit after several miles. Less than 10 minutes later, the deputy spotted the Challenger again while sitting at an intersection in Bonifay. The deputy activated the patrol car's lights and resumed pursuit. The Challenger eventually pulled into a residential area and stopped.During the traffic stop, deputies reported smelling marijuana and noted that Mitchell appeared confused. During a search of the car, deputies recovered 8 ounces (226 grams) of marijuana, $7,040 in cash, a set of scales and a loaded 9mm handgun, the arrest report said.Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said Monday after the first practice of spring that Mitchell was suspended from the team “and all team activities until we gather more information about the situation and what his legal circumstance is.""“Everybody’s got an opportunity to make choices and decisions,” Saban said. ""There’s no such thing as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843711,Sakamoto leads after short program at figure skating worlds,"SAITAMA, Japan (AP) — Defending champion Kaori Sakamoto took the lead after the women’s short program at the world figure skating championships on Wednesday.Aiming to become the first Japanese skater to win back-to-back world titles, Sakamoto received 79.24 points at Saitama Super Arena for a routine that featured a double axel, a triple lutz and a triple flip, triple toeloop combination.Russia’s typically dominant skating team has been excluded from the world championships for the second straight year because of the invasion of Ukraine. That ruled out Olympic champion Anna Shcherbakova and teammates Alexandra Trusova and Kamila Valieva from the women’s event.Sakamoto is 5.62 points ahead of Lee Hae-in of South Korea going to Friday’s free skate. Mai Mihara of Japan was third with 73.46 points.“Hearing the crowd cheering reminded me of the last time the worlds were held here four years ago,” Sakamoto said. “I was pleased with today’s short program and will just try to stay focused for the rest of the competition.”American teenager Isabeau Levito was fourth. The 16-year-old Levito, last year’s world junior champion, received 73.03 points for a strong routine that featured a triple flip, a double axel and a triple lutz, triple toeloop combination.Loena Hendrickx of Belgium, the reigning world silver medalist, cleanly landed her first two jumps — a triple flip and a double axel — but fell at the end of her combination jump to finish fifth with 71.94 points.Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara of Japan skated to the lead in the pairs short program. The world silver medalists received 80.72 points, a new personal best, to finish comfortably ahead of defending world champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier of the United States.Knierim and Frazier produced a triple twist, throw triple flip and three level-four elements on their way to receiving 74.64 points.“Today I thought we did a really great job of performing the program from beginning to end, skating strong, and bringing the characters to life,” Knierim said. “I‘m really proud of us. I think we’ve endured a lot recently and we put out the best today.”European champions Sara Conti and Niccolo Macii of Italy were third with 73.24 points.The men’s short program is on Thursday. Shoma Uno of Japan will be looking to defend the title but will be challenged by Grand Prix Final runner-up Sota Yamamoto and 18-year-old American Ilia Malinin, who made history this season by successfully performing the first quad axel in competition.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843712,Transgender youth: 'Forced outing' bills make schools unsafe,"TULSA, Okla. (AP) — Al Stone-Gebhardt worked hard in school to make sure he graduates in May, and he spent hundreds of dollars on commencement regalia, but he is fully prepared not to participate in the ceremony.The 17-year-old, who is transgender, said he feared his high school, Tulsa Union, might use his deadname — the name he was given at birth but no longer uses — on his diploma and during the ceremony instead of his legally changed name. He has had teachers call him by his birth name, sometimes inadvertently, and said he finds the experience traumatizing.“Being deadnamed just immediately makes you feel belittled, weak and insignificant,” Stone-Gebhardt said. “I didn’t want to be in the classroom. I didn’t trust the teacher.”The Associated Press contacted the school about Stone-Gebhardt’s fears, as well as concerns from his mother, who felt she was getting the runaround when she tried to discuss the issue with the school officials. A spokesperson said the school will work with his parents to make sure his correct name is used.As hundreds of bills nationwide take aim at nearly every facet of transgender existence, from health care to athletics to bathroom access, trans kids and their families say certain proposals could eliminate one of the last remaining safe havens to explore their identities: K-12 public schools.Several “ parental rights ” proposals, which aim to give parents greater control over their children's education, would formally allow or require schools to deadname trans students or out them to their parents without consent. While some parents and teachers argue they have a right to know, others warn it could jeopardize the mental health and physical safety of gender-nonconforming children and place educators in the crosshairs.More than 25 proposals introduced across 14 states include provisions permitting teachers or fellow students not to honor the name and pronouns that align with a student’s gender identity. Some of those proposals and other standalone measures, including at least two at the federal level, would require parental permission to use different identifiers. At least a dozen would also require schools to alert parents of gender identity changes in most circumstances, which trans students like Stone-Gebhardt say would strip them of their privacy and autonomy.The Oklahoma State Department of Education proposed new rules this year that would require parental notification if a child begins expressing gender identity questions. A similar proposal in the North Carolina legislature, where Republicans are just one seat shy of the supermajority they need to override any veto from the Democratic governor, passed the Senate last month and is now in the House.They mirror laws enacted last year in Florida and Alabama, and guidelines in Virginia, that prohibit schools from withholding gender identity information. Florida Republicans advanced legislation this week that would expand the law critics dubbed “ Don't Say Gay ” to prohibit schools from addressing students with pronouns that don't align with the sex they were assigned at birth.North Dakota passed and sent to the governor a similar bill Wednesday barring public schools and state agencies from referring to students and employees by any pronouns that don’t reflect the sex assigned to them at birth. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum hasn't said if he supports the measure.Some education officials support the idea of notifying parents about identity changes. Education guidelines on social transitioning, including when to involve parents, vary widely across states and school districts. Such proposals would provide uniformity that some educators say is currently lacking.“As a parent, I’d absolutely want to know that, and I think most parents do,” said Ginger Tinney, executive director of Professional Oklahoma Educators, a nonpartisan association that represents educators from across the state. “When it comes to serious stuff like this, this tells me the child is struggling with some major issues, and they need their mom and dad to know.”But others, like Emilly Osterling, a high school special education teacher in Wake County, North Carolina, say the reporting requirements force teachers to betray their students’ trust or risk losing their job. While collaboration with parents is essential to her work as a special educator, she said, it cannot come at the expense of any student’s safety or scare teachers away from building bonds with their students.“Students wouldn’t trust teachers anymore,” Osterling said. “You’re putting educators in a very, very bad position. It’s kind of taking pieces of our job to a different level. A job is your source of income, I mean, it’s your livelihood.”When Renee Sekel’s nonbinary teenager first requested a different name on their Christmas stocking, she responded with “absolutely not” in what she now considers “the wrong reaction.” The mother of three and local activist in Cary, North Carolina, said she took about six months to accept the new name.After hearing her child’s teacher call them by that name in a parent-teacher meeting, Sekel said, she realized her child was already happily out at school. In time, she grew thankful that the public school had been a safe and affirming place for her child to express their identity before it was fully accepted at home — and that they were able to tell family on their own terms.“I failed as a parent in not giving them the freedom and the safety they needed at home,"" Sekel said. ""But they were able to find it at school.”Now, Sekel said, it’s worth sharing her own shortcomings to preserve that safe space for other kids. Proposals with forced-outing provisions could create life-threatening situations for those with unsupportive families, she said.“I’m not LGBTQ or anything, but I was abused as a child, and school was the place where people didn’t call me names or didn’t hit me. School was safe for me,” she said. “Forcing teachers to call home and tell the parent things that those children have told them in confidence is going to hurt kids, it’s going to get kids beat.”Supporters of the North Carolina bill have repeatedly pointed to an exception that would prevent parents from accessing school records if there’s reason to believe it would lead to abuse or neglect. But Osterling said teachers are not always able to spot signs of abuse and cannot predict how every parent will react. Her concerns echo those of several psychologists who have testified against the bill.Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign, said bills that explicitly mention gender identity are not the only ones that could out an LGBTQ student. Broad language in parental rights proposals in states like Idaho, which would require that parents be informed of any change in their child's emotional health or well-being, could be interpreted to apply to sexual orientation or gender identity, she said.Idaho parent Kris Huntting consoled their teenage son, who is trans, after most of his teachers deadnamed him on the first day of school, in accordance with a new policy. Huntting said he had spent the day terrified for his closeted trans friends with disapproving parents who had been told they needed parental permission to be called a name other than the one they were assigned at birth.The Nampa high school rolled back the policy after Huntting raised concerns. But Huntting still worries the bill, which passed both chambers and was sent last week to the Republican governor, could be broadly interpreted to make it a statewide standard.“Your child is a whole human,"" Huntting said. “If they want you to know this thing about their existence, they'll tell you. But using the ‘I have a right to know' ... it's based on the assumption that being trans is harmful and something to be helped.”___Schoenbaum, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Local police urged the public to avoid the area to allow access for emergency services.Photos from the scene showed the ship leaning to the side at a 45-degree angle. Adam McVey, a local official, tweeted that it became dislodged due to strong winds.The 76-meter (250-feet) long vessel, named the Petrel, was a research vessel previously bought and outfitted by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The Petrel is equipped with deep-sea exploration technology and has led several high-profile missions to locate historic shipwrecks, including the discovery of the USS Indianapolis in 2017 in the Philippine Sea.The BBC reported the ship had been moored since 2020 due to challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843714,Sen. Scott poised to give 2024 'political update' to donors,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is inching ever closer to a presidential bid in 2024, scheduling his latest swing through early-voting states before returning home afterward to give donors a “political update.""According to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press, Scott will meet with donors to hold what's being advertised as a “Faith in America Summit” next month in Charleston. The schedule notes a reception and dinner on April 14, as well as “breakfast, policy discussions, and political update” the following day.The event, characterized by a person familiar with Scott's plans as a gathering of “high-level fundraisers and supporters,” directly follows Scott's stops in Iowa and New Hampshire. The schedule was first reported by Politico.The senator is expected to soon make a decision on whether to launch a 2024 campaign, according to the person familiar with his plans who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Scott, the Senate's sole Black Republican, would join others already in the race, including former President Donald Trump, tech investor Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012.Scott's donor gathering coincides with the filing deadline for first-quarter federal disclosures, providing a window into how Scott and others in the potential field are faring with contributors. After being reelection in November to what he has said would be his final Senate term, Scott ended the year with nearly $22 million on hand, according to federal filings, and that money could be transferred to another federal campaign.The senator also has built a national network, with Opportunity Matters Fund, a pro-Scott super political action committee, spending more than $20 million to help Republicans in 2022 and reporting $13 million-plus on hand to start 2023. Tech billionaire has Larry Ellison has donated at least $30 million to the organization since 2021, according to federal filings.With “faith in America"" emerging as a theme for his anticipated presidential bid, Scott has been aiming to articulate a vision that sets him apart from some possible GOP rivals who have focused more on railing against cultural divides.“I see 330 million Americans getting back to celebrating our shared blessings again, tolerating our differences again, and having each other’s backs again,” he said in a speech to about 100 students and Republicans last month in Iowa. ""We need new leaders who will lift us up, not tear us down.”Last weekend, he joined other Republicans, including Haley and Ramaswamy, on stage at a conservative forum in North Charleston, where there was much focus on arguing against a “woke ideology” against which many in the party have railed.“The radical left is trying to get people hooked on victimhood,” Scott said that even, adding that, according to Democrats, “if you’re white you must be an oppressor. If you’re Black or brown, you are the victim.”Chad Walldorf, a longtime Scott supporter and donor, said Wednesday that he would attend the Charleston gathering next month and plans to support him in 2024, if he does run.“I look forward to hearing Tim’s thoughts on the political landscape and learn more about what he’s thinking in terms of a potential presidential run,"" Walldorf said.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843715,Quick spring refreshes: Making the old place feel like new,"Maybe you had hoped to be in a new home this year but were deterred by high housing prices. Maybe it's just the arrival of spring that's got you looking around your rooms and wanting something fresh.To make the old place feel like a new place, or just an updated place, designers and home editors say there's lots you can do without spending a lot of money. Those include switching out a few furnishings or decorative items, rearranging others, and perhaps changing the purpose of a room.A DIFFERENT VIEWNew perspectives are often just as refreshing as new stuff.Caroline Utz of the home and lifestyle website The Spruce says that for renters in particular, there’s a simple trick that costs nothing but time.“I love leaning art on top of dressers, desks, mantels or bookshelves. When I’m looking for a change, I move the art to different rooms until I find a fresh combination,"" she said. ""The best part is that no nails, drywall repair kits or hanging equipment are needed.”Real Simple’s home director, Erica Finamore, also likes to rethink where she places art in her home.""It can really make a difference when you add it in an unexpected place,” she said. “I took a small 8-by-8-inch piece of art, framed it, and hung it on my kitchen backsplash right above my coffee station. It makes my little galley kitchen feel more elegant.”She stuck the art up with super-sticky gel tape – Duck Brand makes a version — and can easily remove it when she wants.The right large-scale artwork can function almost like a window. But big art can be pricey.“Here’s an affordable option,” said Better Homes & Gardens editor Amy Panos. “Dig through your photo roll to find an outdoorsy shot, like flowers, sky or a landscape,"" and have it printed — big. She took a photo from a recent beach vacation and had online retailer Parabo Press print it on 24-by-36-inch paper for about $30, she said.You can buy big frames, or follow Panos’ lead and use wooden rails top and bottom to hang the art.Another option: Get your photo made into an unframed canvas print at sites like Snapbox, Vistaprint and Canvaspop, or local retailers.STACK AND SORTJessica Dodell-Feder of HGTV Magazine adheres to three classic steps of spring cleaning: sort, donate, organize.“Rethinking your junk drawer or cleaning out your closet is a must if you want to feel calm at home,” she says. ""If you don’t have a system, you can feel overwhelmed fast.”To begin, she says, take every single thing out of the closet or drawer before you start sorting.“It looks messy at first, but it’s so helpful to actually look at everything at once. You realize you can probably get rid of more than you think,” she says.After the sorting is done, set up a system going forward. Dodell-Feder has an “outbox” — a box or bin kept handy for donations or returns. “Items that need to leave your home.”DEFINE WITH DRAPERYJessica Shaw, interior design director at the architecture and interiors firm The Turett Collaborative, in Brooklyn, New York, uses curtains to create “soft walls” for storage areas and to delineate spaces.“A design trick I often use to make a storage space a bit more appealing is using a wall of drapery to conceal it. Hang a roll-ceiling track or tension wire – IKEA has affordable options. This floor-to-ceiling drapery creates a textural addition and acts as an effective room divider.”LITTLE DETAILSSurprisingly small changes in texture or color can make your home feel new, says Utz.“Peel-and-stick tile is the little sister to the more popular wallpaper version, but it can do wonders on a budget by creating an instant kitchen backsplash or adding a fun pattern to your bathroom floor,” she says.She also suggests switching out cabinet hardware: “Anthropologie is my secret source for the most unique knobs and drawer pulls, but any hardware store or thrift shop can do the trick.”Refreshing soft furnishings in the bedroom can be transformative, Finamore says.“Replacing the duvet cover or comforter, changing it to a bold color or a funky fabric like velvet, can make a huge difference in the look and feel of this space,"" she says.Dimmer switches or smart lightbulbs are another big-impact/low-effort way to make a room feel luxurious and hotel-like.Got dated sliding doors? Covering them with a stylish removable paper is an instant update.“Or, if you have janky wooden ones like I did,” Fenimore says, take them out and replace them with a tension rod and curtains.SWITCH STUFFSpring is a good time to lighten the look of rooms, and besides bedding, there are many items that can easily be switched out. Try a less bulky flatweave rug. Bring more light in with window coverings made of cream-colored opaque fabric, or airy wovens like rattan.“Your sofa is likely the largest thing in the room,” says Panos. “and it could probably stand to lighten up for spring. A large textile will do the trick. Check the bedding aisle for a nubby bedspread. Tablecloths sometimes work, too.""Panos advises looking for something with a visible weave, which will stay in place better than a silkier, finer material when wrapped and tucked around cushions.One more option: Reconsider how you use a space. Maybe relocate your home office to a different room, or position your desk for a different view. The new perspective and purpose will feel fresh.However you tweak your home’s look, there’s one last thing the experts agree should be part of the process: Clean everything. Give furniture a good vacuum or polish, and scrub windows, door frames, mirrors, and all the nooks and crannies.You’ll be starting the new year with fresh — and refreshed — energy.—-New York-based writer Kim Cook covers design and decor topics regularly for The AP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843716,Presidential waiting game: GOP hopefuls hold off campaigns,"NEW YORK (AP) — They are meeting with campaign donors and giving frequent interviews on cable news. They’re delivering speeches in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire and hobnobbing with local Republican groups. Some are even quietly discussing campaign jobs with political operatives.But don't call them presidential candidates — at least, not yet.From Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, there appears to be little rush to join the field of official presidential candidates. The reluctance reflects the unsettled nature of U.S. politics as Republicans game out whether Donald Trump will maintain his grip on the party, particularly if a criminal indictment is leveled against the former president in New York as early as this week.While such a move would mark a historic moment in American politics, the presidential campaign still moves forward with the first debates slated for August and Iowa's leadoff caucuses less than a year away. That, some Republicans say, means that most candidates can't linger too long.For any Republican candidate right now, “If your name isn’t Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis, you start really far behind,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican political strategist. “If you’re one of these folks that’s kind of looking at it, you don’t really have the luxury of time.”At this point during the last presidential election in 2020, more than 15 Democrats had jumped into their party’s open presidential race, animated by a desire to defeat Trump. But as Republicans aim to regain the White House, just three major candidates have officially come forward, including Trump. He's joined by former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.Beyond navigating the political fallout of an indictment, some candidates may also be weighing the potency of attacks from Trump. DeSantis, who is seen as Trump's strongest rival and is widely expected to run, has already attracted derisive nicknames and criticism from the former president despite having not announced a campaign.After largely remaining quiet, DeSantis is beginning to step up his response to Trump, criticizing the former president's leadership in an interview with British journalist Piers Morgan.“At the end of the day, as a leader, you really want to look to people like our Founding Fathers,” DeSantis said. “It’s not saying that you don’t ever make a mistake in your personal life, but I think, what type of character are you bringing?""DeSantis already has broad name recognition and goodwill among the Republican Party’s base for the way he steered his state through the coronavirus pandemic and championed conservative causes on issues around race, gender identity and immigration. That gives DeSantis the most time to wait, GOP political strategists say, but others need to start raising money pretty quickly, building out the complex machinery of a presidential campaign and hiring workers.“There is not an unlimited supply of quality staff,” said Republican strategist Jesse Hunt, who worked on the 2016 presidential campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.Hunt said White House hopefuls who currently hold elected office tend to already be generating some media attention and have a bit more time to wait.“If you’re struggling to get that sort of attention, it behooves you to jump into the race early,” Hunt said.Beyond raising money and getting their names out there, candidates need enough time to win the support of voters.“There’s a difference between getting your name out there and actually building up trust with these voters,” Jennings said. “You build that up over time.”Some potential candidates have been working on that for a few months, even without announcing a decision.Pence, Scott, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have all acknowledged they’re each considering a campaign, have been making visits to states that will vote first on the party’s presidential nominee next year, and have had discussions with political operatives about job openings.Pence and Hutchinson are expected to announce decisions in the coming weeks. It’s widely anticipated that Scott will soon make his decision known, and Pompeo said in an recent interview with The Associated Press that he would make a decision “within a couple of months.""Other possible candidates have been slower to make moves.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has taken quiet but steady steps to raise his profile, stepping up his national media appearances, including appearing in a primetime townhall on CNN, and has resumed out-of-state travel that includes a recent trip to New York City to meet with influential Republican donors and political figures. He's set to make appearances next month to speak to the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Texas.But Youngkin has not yet scheduled visits to early presidential nominating states this year or had conversations with prospective campaign staffers in those states. Every time he’s asked if he plans to run for president in 2024, he gives a similar response, saying he’s “very humbled” by the question but is focused on his on his state, where he’s still working with the legislature to wrap up a budget.DeSantis, who is expected to hold off on any announcement of a potential campaign until legislative business is wrapped up in his state, has only recently started holding events in early voting states Iowa and Nevada.His meetings with donors and outreach by his allies to potential staff prompted Trump’s supporters last week to file a complaint with Florida ethics officials, accusing DeSantis of being “a de facto candidate for president of the United States” and running a “shadow” presidential campaign, which a DeSantis spokeswoman called “frivolous and politically motivated.”Launching before the Florida Legislature adjourns May 5 would be disadvantageous because his moves as governor are precisely what drew voters to him, said former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who is now heading up Never Back Down, a super PAC aimed at encouraging DeSantis to run.""There’s no way he should do this before session ends, until he’s gone through all that legislation, whatever vetoes they’re going to have,” Cuccinelli said. “He’s got to work his way through all of that. I think that makes perfectly good sense, and then probably just catch his breath before the world’s longest, most intense sprint.”___Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843718,Supreme Court chews on Jack Daniel's dog toy dispute,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A dispute between Jack Daniel's and the makers of a squeaking dog toy that mimics the whiskey's signature bottle gave the Supreme Court a lot to chew on Wednesday.The question for the court involves whether the toy's maker infringed on Jack Daniel's trademarks, and the justices were largely on their best behavior, not picking up on the toy's poop humor and puns.Still, with three of the justices either completely or almost totally silent, it wasn't clear from the arguments whether Jack Daniel's case is on the rocks or whether the makers of the Bad Spaniels toy had been, well, bad.Justice Samuel Alito expressed skepticism for Jack Daniel's arguments. “Could any reasonable person think that Jack Daniel’s had approved this use of the mark?” he asked at one point, suggesting the toy was an unmistakable parody and legally acceptable.When the company's lawyer pushed back on the justice's knowledge about dog toys, Alito responded in part with: “I had a dog. I know something about dogs.” His late springer spaniel Zeus sometimes visited the court.But Justice Elena Kagan seemed more ready to rule against the toy's manufacturer. “Maybe I just have no sense of humor,"" Kagan said to laughter. “But what's the parody?”Kagan, whose dry wit is often on display in the courtroom and in her writing, suggested the toy is simply an “ordinary commercial product” that is trading on the look of the liquor company's bottle.Arizona-based VIP Products has been selling its Bad Spaniels toy since 2014. It's part of its Silly Squeakers line of chew toys that mimic liquor, beer, wine and soda bottles. They include Mountain Drool, which parodies Mountain Dew, and Heini Sniff’n, which parodies Heineken.While Jack Daniel's bottles have the words “Old No. 7 brand” and “Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey,” the toy proclaims: “The Old No. 2 on Your Tennessee Carpet.” The original bottle notes it is 40% alcohol by volume. The parody features a dog's face and says it’s “43% Poo by Vol.” and “100% Smelly.”The packaging of the toy, which retails for around $20, notes in small font: “This product is not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery.”Jack Daniel's, based in Lynchburg, Tennessee, isn't amused.""Jack Daniel’s loves dogs and appreciates a good joke as much as anyone. But Jack Daniel’s likes its customers even more, and doesn’t want them confused or associating its fine whiskey with dog poop,"" wrote the company's attorney Lisa Blatt in a filing with the high court.Blatt wrote that Jack Daniel’s “welcomes jokes at its expense” but that the toy VIP sells misleads customers, profits “from Jack Daniel’s hard-earned goodwill” and associates its “whiskey with excrement.”At the heart of the case is the Lanham Act, the country's major trademark law. It prohibits using a trademark in a way “likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of ... goods."" Jack Daniel's says that's what the dog toy does. It says a lower court was wrong to side with VIP.But VIP Products' lawyer, Bennett E. Cooper, told the justices in a court filing that Jack Daniel's ""seeks to use the Lanham Act to muzzle even VIP Products LLC’s playful dog-toy parody.""Nike, Campbell Soup Company, outdoor brand Patagonia and jeans maker Levi Strauss were among those urging the justices in court filings to side with Jack Daniel's. The company also has the support of the Biden administration.___Associated Press reporter Mark Sherman contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843750,"Credit Suisse customers feel mix of anger, relief after sale","GENEVA (AP) — Fury at top Credit Suisse managers. Lament over damage to Switzerland's image as a stable, reliable banking center. Relief that authorities stepped in to help protect deposits, but worry about keeping cash invested in a bank that failed to manage its own money adequately.On Swiss streets, emotions were running the gamut among Credit Suisse customers after the government this weekend orchestrated a takeover of the country's second-largest bank by rival UBS — a bid to prevent further upheaval in the global financial system that began with the collapse of two U.S. banks.How the merger, with a fire-sale price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), will play out and its impact on worldwide finance are largely unknown. That has left those stuck in the middle — customers and bank workers — uncertain about what comes next in the deal to create one Swiss megabank.“My money is already invested in two or three banking establishments,” customer Elisabeth Pictet said after exiting the biggest Credit Suisse branch in central Geneva. ""I am not a millionaire, but it is true that in the long run maybe I will even more favor local, regional banking establishments.”Pictet — whose husband hails from a legendary banking family in Switzerland — said she's not gotten any communication from the bank about how to proceed but praised the government for a “wise decision” that reassured many Swiss residents like her. She said Tuesday that she's had no trouble withdrawing cash.“I feel a lot of anger at Credit Suisse managers because in the end, their employees will lose their jobs — many employees who did their work professionally,"" said Pictet, 59, who is transitioning into retirement from a health care job. “Now, we'll only have a single big bank — UBS — and that is not good: It's good to have competition, and we won't have that anymore.”Asked if Credit Suisse had told customers how to manage their assets since the deal emerged Sunday, a bank spokeswoman said that “until the transaction has closed, business continues as usual for Credit Suisse and its clients.”That likely won't be the case for Credit Suisse's 50,000 workers, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland, as the two banks combine. The Swiss bank employee’s association is demanding that job losses be held to a minimum, that no layoffs happen until year's end, and the government provide an unspecified jobs guarantee.“It is impermissible that the companies are secured by tax dollars but the employees come away with nothing,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""The billions in guarantees from the federal government must be linked to conditions favorable to the employees.”The impact of the merger is extensive. Many of Switzerland's 8.5 million people have accounts in either UBS or Credit Suisse.“I myself am grateful as a customer that this worked out,” said Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter at a news conference Sunday to announce the hastily arranged deal.She said she has accounts at both banks.“I think what we have done now is really to protect those people who have money at Credit Suisse,"" Keller-Sutter said, with small- and medium-size companies able to keep paying their workers, carry out transactions and access their savings.Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, agreed that Credit Suisse depositors need not worry about their money now — though he noted reports of snap withdrawals worth billions of dollars last week amid confusion about the bank's future.The Swiss central bank and government have since guaranteed loans to the combined bank worth hundreds of billions of dollars.“Basically, the Swiss National Bank has stepped in and said, ‘Your deposits are safe,'"" said Marenzi, whose firm focuses on capital markets.Bank runs are a risk for even the biggest and safest banks, but ""with Credit Suisse, things look very, very safe indeed at this stage in terms of deposits. So I wouldn’t be in a rush to move money out of there,” he said.It's a different story for those who entrusted their money to Credit Suisse for wealth management or investment advice.“Those customers are scratching their heads and saying, ‘Well, if you can’t manage your own money, why would you be able to manage mine?’ And that’s a fair question,” Marenzi said.Swiss regulators and officials, reportedly under intense pressure from other Western governments and ultra-rich investors, forged the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS in a bid to stop more banking-sector turmoil.Credit Suisse's problems — ranging from big losses on hedge fund bets to a spying scandal and failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring — predated the recent collapse of U.S. banks but drew fears about its vulnerability.For some in Geneva, there was sentimentality about the looming disappearance of a storied Swiss bank whose origins date to the budding railroad industry in the mid-19th century.Credit Suisse customer Mokhtar Zada, 78, a retired former financial-sector worker originally from Afghanistan, said the demise of Credit Suisse wouldn't affect him because he too has an account at UBS and could just transfer money to it if necessary.“But what a waste,"" said Zada, clutching a Credit Suisse savings booklet that he first received in 1965 and had shown as a sort of souvenir to bank employees. “It’s really too bad that a bank with 170-odd years of history is going to vanish just like that.”___Courtney Bonnell reported from London.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843752,"In boost to opposition, Kurdish party won't field candidate","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s pro-Kurdish political party and its allies said Wednesday that they won't field a candidate to run in the country's May 14 presidential election, a move that could boost an opposition bloc's chances of unseating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.With Turkey entangled in economic turmoil and in the midst of a difficult recovery from a devastating earthquake last month, Erdogan is facing the toughest reelection bid of his two-decade rule as prime minister and as president.A six-party opposition coalition known as the Nation Alliance has united behind the candidacy of Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the secularist Republican People’s Party. The coalition has vowed to dismantle a presidential system that has concentrated a vast amount of powers in Erdogan’s hands. Critics say the system amounts to a “one-man rule” without checks and balances.In announcing that the Peoples’ Democratic Party, or HDP, wouldn't put up its own candidate for the presidency, co-chairperson Pervin Buldan didn't express outright support for Kilicdaroglu, but the decision was widely seen as the party's tacit backing of the anti-Erdogan bloc.The HDP is the No. 2 opposition party in Turkey's parliament and commands about 10% of the vote, so its support is crucial for the opposition’s bid to defeat Erdogan. In 2019, HDP’s support helped Kilicdaroglu’s party win the municipalities of Ankara and Istanbul in 2019 local elections.However, the party was excluded from the Nation Alliance, which includes Islamists and nationalists as well as Kilicdaroglu’s center-left party. HDP instead formed an alliance with a group of left-wing parties.“We are determined to hold the government and those responsible for the great destruction ... accountable,” Buldan said. “For these reasons, we are declaring to the public that we will not nominate a candidate in the presidential elections.”The government has accused HDP of colluding with the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Dozens of elected HDP lawmakers and mayors, including former party co-chairs Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, and thousands of party members have been arrested on terror-related accusations.Critics say the actions are part of a crackdown on the party, which faces closure.Meanwhile, Erdogan suffered a setback this week after a small Islamist party refused to join his ruling party’s alliance with two nationalist parties and announced it would field its own presidential candidate.In another upset, respected former economy minister Mehmet Simsek reportedly rejected an offer to return to the post.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843753,"March Madness: Athletes balance privacy, online profile","Aliyah Boston recalls her parents prodding her to be more active on social media, to extend her brand as her basketball prowess began to draw national attention.She said she would be more active — and then post just one photo in two months, which is no way for an athlete influencer to earn big money in the era of name, image and likeness compensation.Eventually, the South Carolina superstar saw the light — and the green.“With the NIL, my mom and my dad were like: this is the time for social media to continue to brand yourself,” Boston said. “That’s when I really started to post more.”The NIL age has opened a vast new world of earning potential for athletes. Social media platforms, once solely windows into smaller worlds, are now heavily trafficked gateways to wider audiences and revenue streams. Social media also turbocharged March Madness, an event that already had communal elements — think bracket and office pool — before the internet even existed.Taking advantage of this chaotic social media explosion to cash in requires a bit of savvy, discernment and engagement — lots of engagement.“Some things you think will go viral and it goes nowhere,” said Jeffrey Weiner, senior vice president of sports marketing firm GSE Worldwide. “Some things you think are silly and no one’s going to care about and it goes viral. You never know. You shouldn’t worry about the ‘like’ numbers and things like that. Just post, post, post.”Finding the right fit is key when it comes to NIL deals.If an athlete hawks something they don’t believe in, it will show in their posts. No one is going to buy a product or solicit a business if the person promoting it appears to be going through the motions or comes off as a used car salesman — unless that’s the schtick they’re going for.“I don’t want my page to turn into full of advertisements and me shoving things down people’s throats,” said Nebraska pole vaulter Jess Gardner, who has partnered with about 15 different brands and has more than 300,000 combined followers on TikTok and Instagram.“That’s not why people are coming to my page,"" she said. ""I make fun and lighthearted content, and so I can do that if I’m working with brands I actually love. That’s where I want to take the NIL route.”Personality sells.The tendency when promoting a product is to switch personalities, like a TV anchorperson shifting to an on-air persona. Many of the most successful influencers find a balance, staying true to their identity while still promoting the product.Authenticity with a dash of amusement is the best bet.“End of the day it’s a video distribution platform and it allows athletes to showcase their personality however they see fit,” said Julian Valentin, head of customer success for NIL platform Opendorse. “I always say with student athletes to only do what you’re comfortable with.”That's the way Shaylee Gonzales approaches it.The Texas guard has 206,000 TikTok followers on, 93,000 more on Instagram. Her posts are a mix of basketball, fashion, personal life and products she has deals with.“The more you are yourself, the more people will like to follow you and feel like they know you,” she said. “I love posting things that I enjoy doing or hobbies I like to do.”Find the right balance of business and whimsiness and social media opens the the NIL revenue stream.Miami twin basketball players Haley and Hanna Cavinder are social media sensations who have cashed in on their online fame. Hanna Cavinder noted that the twins carefully choose what they post online.“Everybody thinks they know you, but they only know the things you want to show them,” she said. “Obviously, I love connecting with my audience and my fans and being organic. They love the twin thing, so we love sharing that. But honestly, I live a more private life than people think.”“You pick and choose what you want people to see,” she added. “And that’s just kind of how I go about it. Now, social media is more of my business, not more of my life.”With more than 4.4 million followers on their shared TikTok account alone, they have become millionaires through NIL deals.Those deals will likely increase during March Madness, especially after the Hurricanes upset No. 1 seed Indiana in the NCAA Tournament.“I think what I love the most is it’s setting me up so much for the future,” Haley Cavinder said. “And name, image and likeness, all athletes, especially female athletes, if you use it the right way and to your advantage and you remain consistent, it’ll help you in the future.”That's what got Boston's attention — well, after her parents noticed first.The All-American has promoted Buick, Crocs, Orange Theory, Under Armour and Six Star Nutrition, among other brands. She will likely be one of the WNBA's top draft picks and could have a lucrative overseas career as well, but has already set a firm financial foundation.“I have people in my corner who help me be able to work with brands, agencies,” she said. “It's been smooth.”And lucrative.___AP National Writer Eddie Pells, AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP Sports Writer Eric Olson contributed.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843773,Cambodian court charges activists with insulting king online,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Two anti-government activists in Cambodia were charged in court Wednesday with insulting the king and incitement to commit a felony for comments they made on social media about Prime Minister Hun Sen and King Norodom Sihamoni.Yim Sinorn and Hun Kosal, both associated with the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved by court order in 2017, could face up to seven years in prison if convicted by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court.The two men were arrested after Hun Sen, who has held power for 38 years, claimed to be offended by their online observations about watching a Tuesday television broadcast of him and the king attending a torch-lighting ceremony for the 32nd Southeast Asian Games, which Cambodia will host in May.Hun Sen claimed their comments about how he interacted with the king implied he was showing disrespect and usurping the king’s status. He accused the two of trying to drive a wedge between him and the monarch, who is the head of state but wields no real political power.Speaking at a graduation ceremony in the capital Phnom Penh, Hun Sen declared he made no disrespectful signs or gestures and told all television stations to replay video of the ceremony so the Cambodian people could watch and make their own judgments.“Why would you have ill-intentions against us? What is your real purpose?” Hun Sen asked. He charged that the comments were intentional and slanderous, and he would not forgive them.The actions against the two activists drew criticism from New York-based Human Rights Watch.“Freedom of expression is going extinct under PM Hun Sen’s government as the national election approaches in July. Simply sharing opinions on Facebook about a government ceremony should not be considered a crime, so the truth of the matter is political activists Yim Sinorn and Hun Kosal did nothing that they should be detained for,” said Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy Asia director, in a statement.Robertson said the two activists “are likely to face a long period in detention followed by a kangaroo court trial on fabricated, politically motivated charges.” He called for their immediate and unconditional release.Earlier this month, prominent opposition leader Kem Sokha was convicted of treason and sentenced to 27 years of house arrest, another in a long series of blow in a campaign by the government to silence its critics or drive them out of the country.Kem Sokha’s arrest in September 2017 marked the beginning of a fierce campaign by Hun Sen’s government to use the courts — widely considered to be under its influence — in a crackdown on dissent. Since then, most other top government critics have fled Cambodia to escape what were generally seen as politically inspired prosecutions.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843774,Vote on Biden's pick to run FAA delayed amid GOP opposition,"A vote on President Joe Biden's choice to run the Federal Aviation Administration was delayed indefinitely Wednesday in the face of an opposition blitz by Republicans, who say the nominee lacks enough experience in aviation to lead the agency, which is under pressure to stem a surge in dangerous close calls between planes.The Senate Commerce Committee was scheduled to vote on Denver International Airport CEO Phillip Washington, whose nomination has languished since Biden announced his choice last July.Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., an ardent supporter of the nominee, said the vote would be delayed to gather information requested by senators. She gave no date for a vote, ""but we would like to do it soon.”Democrats hold a 14-13 edge on the committee, so the defection of one could derail the nomination if all Republicans oppose it. The GOP has targeted Democrats and independents from swing or red-leaning states.Most Democrats on the panel say they will support Washington, but it isn’t clear if there are enough votes to move the nomination forward. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a Democrat until she switched to independent in December, and a moderate Democrat, Jon Tester of Montana, have not said how they will vote.“I don't know that we're even (going to) vote on him, so I didn't even have to take a stand,” Tester told reporters after the committee meeting.Sinema's office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. At Washington's nomination hearing this month, she praised his service in the U.S. Army and work at transit agencies, but said he had “comparatively less experience working in aviation,” which she said was “important for this position.”White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated the administration's support for Washington, saying he “has the qualifications” for the job.“He has led the Denver International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, managed a large transportation-safety organization, has served as a command sergeant major in the military. This is a role with a key safety mandate,” she said. “We are going to continue to urge the Senate to move swiftly on his confirmation.”The FAA has not had a Senate-confirmed administrator since March 2022, when Stephen Dickson stepped down midway through his term. The agency is being led by an acting administrator, Billy Nolen.The FAA administrator is not a cabinet-level job, but Republicans have turned the nomination into a high-profile contest with Biden and Senate Democrats.Washington ran transit agencies in Denver and Los Angeles, but his only aviation-related experience has come since taking the top job at the Denver airport in July 2021. Washington has strong ties to the administration — he led the incoming Biden administration's transition team for the Transportation Department, which includes the FAA.Republicans argue, however, that he lacks experience in FAA's core mission of aviation safety. They note that he is not a pilot.“This is a job for someone with specialized knowledge needed to ensure the safety of the flying public,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Tuesday on the Senate floor. ""Phil Washington is objectively, indisputably unqualified to lead the FAA.""Republicans have also seized on Washington’s name appearing in search warrants related to a corruption investigation in Los Angeles. At his hearing three weeks ago, Washington said he had not heard from anyone in law enforcement about the matter.The FAA is struggling to repair its reputation since approving Boeing planes that crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people; to deal with understaffing that contributes to flight delays; and to replace an aging safety-alert system that briefly grounded flights nationwide in January. And now it is trying to reassure travelers that there won't be more frightening incidents of planes coming too close together around runways.The National Transportation Safety Board is examining six recent close calls between planes. In one, an incoming FedEx plane came within less than 100 feet (30 meters) of a departing Southwest jet after an air traffic controller cleared both to use the same runway in Austin, Texas.On Wednesday, the FAA issued an alert urging pilots and others in aviation to stress the importance of following safety procedures after a “number of notable and high visibility events” this year.“While the overall numbers do not reflect an increase in incidents and occurrences, the potential severity of these events is concerning,” the FAA said in the alert.The FAA held a “safety summit” last week, at which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and others said airlines, pilots and regulators need to learn from recent close calls to prevent accidents.___Zeke Miller and Stephen Groves in Washington contributed to this report.___This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the transportation secretary's last name.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843775,What made Beethoven sick? DNA from his hair offers clues,"NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven's death, researchers pulled DNA from strands of his hair, searching for clues about the health problems and hearing loss that plagued him.They weren't able to crack the case of the German composer's deafness or severe stomach ailments. But they did find a genetic risk for liver disease, plus a liver-damaging hepatitis B infection in the last months of his life.These factors, along with his chronic drinking, were probably enough to cause the liver failure that is widely believed to have killed him, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology.This Sunday marks the 196th anniversary of Beethoven's death in Vienna on March 26, 1827, at the age of 56. The composer himself wrote that he wanted doctors to study his health problems after he died.“With Beethoven in particular, it is the case that illnesses sometimes very much limited his creative work,” said study author Axel Schmidt, a geneticist at University Hospital Bonn in Germany. “And for physicians, it has always been a mystery what was really behind it.”Since his death, scientists have long tried to piece together Beethoven's medical history and have offered a variety of possible explanations for his many maladies.Now, with advances in ancient DNA technology, researchers have been able to pull genetic clues from locks of Beethoven’s hair that had been snipped off and preserved as keepsakes. They focused on five locks that are “almost certainly authentic,” coming from the same European male, according to the study.They also looked at three other historical locks, but weren't able to confirm those were actually Beethoven's. Previous tests on one of those locks suggested Beethoven had lead poisoning, but researchers concluded that sample was actually from a woman.After cleaning Beethoven's hair one strand at a time, scientists dissolved the pieces into a solution and fished out chunks of DNA, said study author Tristan James Alexander Begg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge.Getting genes out was a challenge, since DNA in hair gets chopped up into tiny fragments, explained author Johannes Krause, a paleogeneticist at Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.But eventually, after using up almost 10 feet (3 meters) of Beethoven’s hair, they were able to piece together a genome that they could “quiz” for signs of genetic disease, Krause said.While researchers didn't find any clear genetic signs of what caused Beethoven’s gastrointestinal issues, they found that celiac disease and lactose intolerance were unlikely causes. In the future, the genome may offer more clues as we learn more about how genes influence health, Begg said.The research also led to a surprising discovery: When they tested DNA from living members of the extended Beethoven family, scientists found a discrepancy in the Y chromosomes that get passed down on the father's side. The Y chromosomes from the five men matched each other — but they didn't match the composer's.This suggests there was an “extra-pair paternity event” somewhere in the generations before Beethoven was born, Begg said. In other words, a child born from an extramarital relationship in the composer's family tree.The key question of what caused Beethoven’s hearing loss is still unanswered, said Ohio State University's Dr. Avraham Z. Cooper, who was not involved in the study. And it may be a difficult one to figure out, because genetics can only show us half of the “nature and nurture” equation that makes up our health.But he added that the mystery is part of what makes Beethoven so captivating: “I think the fact that we can’t know is OK,” Cooper said.———AP journalist Daniel Niemann contributed to this report from Bonn, Germany.———The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843776,'Deeply troubling': UN rights chief on Uganda anti-gay bill,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The United Nations rights chief on Wednesday urged Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to block an anti-LGBTQ bill that prescribes harsh penalties for some homosexual offenses, including death and life imprisonment.“The passing of this discriminatory bill — probably among the worst of its kind in the world — is a deeply troubling development,” Volker Turk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement.And in the U.S., National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said if the law were enacted Washington would “have to take a look” at imposing economic sanctions on Uganda. He noted that this would be “really unfortunate” since most U.S. aid is in the form health assistance, especially anti-AIDS assistance.Uganda's legislature passed the bill late Tuesday in a protracted plenary session during which last-minute changes were made to the legislation that originally included penalties of up to 10 years in jail for homosexual offenses.In the version approved by lawmakers the offense of “aggravated homosexuality” now carries the death penalty. Aggravated homosexuality applies in cases of sex relations involving those infected with HIV as well as minors and other categories of vulnerable people.According to the bill, a suspect convicted of “attempted aggravated homosexuality” can be jailed for 14 years, and the offense of “attempted homosexuality” is punishable by up to 10 years.The offense of ""homosexuality"" is punishable by life imprisonment, the same punishment prescribed in a colonial-era penal code criminalizing sex acts “against the order of nature.”The bill was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish “promotion, recruitment and funding” related to LGBTQ activities in this East African country where homosexuals are widely disparaged.The bill now goes to Museveni, who can veto or sign it into law. He suggested in a recent speech that he supports the legislation, accusing unnamed Western nations of “trying to impose their practices on other people.”“If signed into law by the president, it will render lesbian, gay and bisexual people in Uganda criminals simply for existing, for being who they are,"" Turk, the U.N. rights chief, said in the statement. ""It could provide carte blanche for the systematic violation of nearly all of their human rights and serve to incite people against each other.”White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday the United States had “grave concerns” about the bill, adding that it would hamper tourism and economic investment, and “damage Uganda’s reputation.”Jean-Pierre added: “No one should be attacked, imprisoned, or killed simply because of who they are, or who they love.”Anti-gay sentiment in Uganda has grown in recent weeks amid alleged reports of sodomy in boarding schools, including a prestigious one for boys where a parent accused a teacher of abusing her son. Authorities are investigating that case.The recent decision of the Church of England to bless civil marriages of same-sex couples also has inflamed many, including some who see homosexuality as imported from abroad.Uganda’s LGBTQ community in recent years has faced growing pressure from civilian authorities who wanted a tough new law punishing same-sex activities.The Ugandan agency overseeing the work of non-governmental organizations last year stopped the operations of Sexual Minorities Uganda, the most prominent LGBTQ organization in the country, accusing it of failing to register legally. But the group’s leader stated that his organization had been rejected by the registrar of companies as undesirable.Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries.",2023/03/23,,World

I don’t know yet,” Swiatek said Friday.Instead of playing Swiatek, Liu will go up against 94th-ranked Julia Grabher, who lost in qualifying but now gets to move into the draw.Liu advanced Tuesday when her first-round opponent, Katerina Siniakova, stopped playing in the second set because of a hurt wrist.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843778,Brazil police foil gang plot targeting Carwash judge Moro,"SAO PAULO (AP) — Federal police raided locations in several states Wednesday to crack down on a gang accused of plotting assassinations and kidnappings of public officials including a former judge who presided over Brazil’s biggest corruption case.One of the suspects' targets was Sen. Sérgio Moro, who as a judge presided over the Carwash bribery and money laundering investigation that began in 2014, Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters in Sao Paulo. The suspects had rented out houses near Moro's home and office in Parana's capital, Curitiba, and had erected walls to create rooms that could be used for stowing hostages, he said.Dino told reporters that authorities are investigating whether the criminals intended to kill or kidnap Moro. The operation was launched Wednesday because investigators determined the suspects were already setting up teams to execute their plans, he added.Moro said on Twitter he had been targeted for retaliation by one of Brazil’s most notorious drug trafficking gangs, known as the First Capital Command. He thanked the police forces and said he would issue a statement later Wednesday.From 2014 to 2018, Moro was the lead judge in the Carwash trials, which led to the arrest of prominent politicians including then former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who spent over a year in jail. Lula's conviction was later annulled. In 2019, Moro became former President Jair Bolsonaro’s Justice Minister, and quickly oversaw the transfer of the First Capital Command's leader and almost two dozen gang members to federal prison.Moro left the government in April 2020 and secured a Senate seat in last year's general elections. Lula was also elected president.Federal police last year investigated a plan by the First Capital Command to kidnap federal public servants, aiming to exchange them for the release of Marco Willians Camacho, the gang’s imprisoned leader, according to a report from online media UOL.Federal Police said in their statement Wednesday that the criminals aimed to use their kidnapped hostages for extortion.Wednesday's police operation entailed 120 agents carrying out 24 search and seizure warrants and 11 arrest warrants in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rondonia, police said in a statement, which did not name the suspects nor their intended targets.Dino told reporters that another target was a public prosecutor in Sao Paulo state’s organized crime unit.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843779,Swedish lawmakers vote to endorse country joining NATO,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Swedish lawmakers overwhelmingly voted Wednesday in favor of Sweden joining NATO, signing off on the country's membership along with the required legislation.The 349-seat parliament authorized Sweden’s accession to NATO in a 269-37 vote, with 43 lawmakers absent. It was the last required domestic hurdle to the country becoming part of the 30-member Western military alliance.Six of the eight parties represented in parliament were in favor of NATO membership, and the vote that followed a nearly seven-hour debate was seen as a formality.“Membership in NATO is the best way to safeguard Sweden’s security,” Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said during the deliberations. He called it “a historic event” and “one of the most important security policy decisions ever for our country.”Speaking of the timetable for Sweden’s possible accession, Billström told lawmakers during the debate that “it goes without saying that we will be able to become members in Vilnius,” the Lithuanian capital, where a NATO summit is to be held in July.“The backing we have is so tangible that I can make that assessment,” he said.Both Sweden and neighboring Finland applied to join NATO in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Morgan Johansson of the Social Democrats — Sweden’s largest party, which once opposed NATO membership — said that joining the alliance was “about seeking in every situation the solutions that provide maximum security for the people of Sweden.” The party was in power when Sweden applied for membership.Two NATO countries, Turkey and Hungary, have yet to ratify the Nordic nations' applications. Admitting new countries requires unanimous approval from existing members.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that his government would move forward with ratifying Finland 's bid, paving the way for the country to join the alliance before Sweden. Erdogan said Sweden still must resolve the Turkish concerns that had delayed action on the joint application.The Turkish government accused both Sweden and Finland of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations, but expressed more reservations about Sweden. The government in Ankara cited demonstrations on the streets of Stockholm by supporters of Kurdish militants.A series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, also angered Turkish officials.“It is problematic to enter a military alliance with countries that are not democratic and where we constantly see democracy shrinking,” Hakan Svenneling of the Left Party said, referring to Turkey and Hungary.His party and the small environmentalist Green Party both condemned the Russian invasion but were against joining NATO, saying it would mean Sweden was moving a step closer to either hosting nuclear arms or being part of an alliance using such weapons.The bids of the Nordic neighbors, which are close partners culturally, economically and politically, are historic as Sweden has not been in a military conflict in the past 200 years and Finland has remained military non-aligned since World War II.On March 1, Finnish lawmakers also approved Finland — which borders Russia — joining NATO.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843780,Texas' Morris plays amid misdemeanor domestic violence case,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — In a season when Texas fired coach Chris Beard after a felony domestic violence arrest, it has allowed a reserve guard to keep playing while he awaits trial on a misdemeanor charge of assaulting an ex-girlfriend.Second-seed Texas has advanced under interim coach Rodney Terry to the program's first Sweet 16 since 2008, and the Longhorns play No. 3 Xavier on Friday night in Kansas City, Missouri.Arterio Morris, a freshman who was one of the top recruits in the country last year, was initially scheduled to stand trial March 29, three days before Final Four weekend. Denton County prosecutors on Tuesday were granted a delay to an unspecified date.Beard was fired Jan. 5, about three weeks after he was arrested on suspicion of a felony charge of choking his fiancée in a fight during which she also told police he bit, and hit her. She later recanted the choking allegation and the Travis County district attorney dismissed the case, saying prosecutors were following her wishes not to got to trial and that the charge could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Morris is charged with Class A misdemeanor assault causing bodily injury to a family member, which in Texas includes dating relationships. It stems from a June 2022 confrontation in the Dallas suburb of Frisco. The charge carries penalties ranging from probation and fines to up to a year in jail if convicted.Morris' attorney, Justin Moore, said the charges against Beard and the player are different.“(Beard) was charged with a felony family assault,” Moore said. “That was far more serious as to what Arterio was alleged to have to committed. We maintain Arterio's innocence.”According to police, the ex-girlfriend said Morris grabbed her arm and pulled her off a bed, and later pulled the front of her sports bra, causing an injury to her neck and shoulder area. Police reported seeing a sizable bruise or scratch.Texas officials declined comment. Beard said before the season that school officials he would not identify determined the freshman could play this season.Moore defended Texas officials’ decision to not suspend Morris.“I do believe Texas has taken this seriously. They’ve also allowed Arterio to enjoy his due process rights,” Moore said.Morris has played in all 36 games this season, although his minutes and have been limited on a senior-dominated team. He averages nearly 12 minutes and 4.7 points per game. His biggest moment was a soaring alley-oop dunk against Kansas in the Big 12 Tournament championship game.Attempts to reach Morris' ex-girlfriend through family members were not successful. According to online records, prosecutors sought the trial delay to “procure witness availability."" Assistant district attorney Jamie Beck said prosecutors have offered Morris a plea deal and that the trial delay was not unusual.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843792,Kim Raver on how 'Grey's Anatomy' puts women at center,"“Grey’s Anatomy” has long championed women’s rights and female leadership on and offscreen — not only does the long-running hospital drama cover contentious topics like abortion, but it also offers women on the show a chance to expand their roles behind the scenes.Kim Raver is the latest cast member in that spotlight, playing both the new hospital chief in front of the camera and a first-time director behind it. Raver, who portrays surgeon Teddy Altman, has directed “Training Day,” an episode airing Thursday with a storyline that discusses reproductive rights.This season, the series has not shied away from addressing the conflict between anti-abortion and abortion-rights advocates stirred up by the overturning of Roe v. Wade last June, and the resulting change in abortion access. At the start of season 19, the gynecology staff at Grey Sloan Memorial swapped from pink scrubs to black, as one character explained: “the female body has become a war zone in this country and pink is a peacetime color.”“I feel fortunate that we can bring these stories to light. They’re not easy,” Raver said in a recent interview.She believes that show creator Shonda Rhimes has always had the power to deliver hot topics — “hot not like trendy but hot that kind of ignite very extreme feelings on both sides.”Then the audience is left to decide for themselves how they feel.“That’s really important in storytelling and that we have that, that we have that freedom to approach different uncomfortable storylines where we’re all bound to, you know, disagree,"" Raver said. ""But I think it’s discussions that we need to have.”For the actor, directing is the accumulation of over three years' work shadowing directors on set and being mentored by actor, director and executive producer Debbie Allen, who plays Catherine Fox.“There’s this thing that we say on ‘Grey’s’ in terms of in medicine, ‘see one, do one’ and that’s what doctors do, right? That’s what the interns do with the attendings,” Raver explained. “There are many women doing many different roles on set. So ‘see one, be one,’ right? I see other female directors, I see female editors, I see female boom operators, I see female camera operators and female DPs.”She said that the feeling of possibility is fostered by showrunners, executives, writers and producers of “Grey’s” like Allen, Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff and Meg Marinis, which Raver appreciates after coming up in a time when she says female performers were expected to “stay in that lane.”“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, well, you know ... let’s give her a tiny little episode and see,’” she said. “They gave me a huge episode with like two stunts, a birth ... (guest star) Kate Walsh came back. It was massive. And all the while they were like, ‘You’ve got this. We know you can do it.’""Not only is the actor calling the shots on set as director, she is also running things in the show, as Altman is the new chief of surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial.She takes over as boss from Meredith Grey, the woman who has been at the heart of the hospital series for nearly two decades. As star Ellen Pompeo stepped back from the show, her character moved to Boston.Raver doesn’t see huge changes happening with both Pompeo’s departure (she stays an executive producer and possible guest star) and showrunner Vernoff leaving at the end of this season, as the majority of the team who work on the show will remain.Raver laughs off the suggestion of taking over Meredith’s iconic voiceovers or rebranding the show as “Altman’s Anatomy,” calling it an ensemble series — although she is enjoying being in charge.“It is really fun being chief,” Raver says. “That’s a really fun thing to explore of what is it being a woman kind of leading the troops and juggling motherhood and work and also still being a surgeon and wife and friend.”“How do you want to be a leader?”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843793,Wichita State hires ORU's Paul Mills to lead hoops program,"Wichita State hired Paul Mills away from Oral Roberts on Wednesday to turn around its languishing men's basketball program, landing what has been one of the hottest names among mid-major coaches.The 50-year-old Mills led the the Golden Eagles to two of the past three NCAA Tournaments, engineering upsets of Ohio State and Florida as a No. 15 seed in 2021 before going 30-5 this past season and losing to Duke as a No. 5 seed.He replaces Isaac Brown, who was fired after three seasons as the Shockers slowly slipped toward mediocrity.""My family and I are extremely excited about being a part of Wichita State,” said Mills, who will be introduced during a news conference Thursday at Charles Koch Arena. “The rich history, winning tradition and unbelievable community support will keep us working on behalf of the greatest fans in all of college basketball.”Mills got his break in coaching when he joined Scott Drew's first staff at Baylor in 2003, working alongside future Kansas State coach Jerome Tang in helping to turn around a program that had been mired in controversy. Mills stayed for 14 years, helping to reach seven NCAA Tournaments, before replacing Scott Sutton at Oral Roberts before the 2017 season.“I absolutely love Paul Mills. He’s like a brother to me. So happy for him and his family, for Wendy and the girls,” said Tang, who has Kansas State playing Michigan State in the Sweet 16 on Thursday night. ""He’s going to be incredible because he is passionate about young people and about developing young men.“There’s no throttle, like, hold-back governor on him in terms of love and what he pours into his guys.”Mills went just 11-21 each of his first two seasons in Tulsa, but the seeds of a turnaround had been planted, and the Golden Eagles have not had a losing season since. The biggest step came two years ago, when Mills led Oral Roberts to the Sweet 16 of an NCAA Tournament played entirely within an Indianapolis “bubble environment” because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Golden Eagles slipped to 19-12 the following year before winning 30 games and the Summit League title this past season, when they were led by high-scoring guard Max Abmas, an honorable mention All-American selection.“He’s the one that told me, he said, ‘Tang, 10s hangs with 10s and one hangs with ones,’” Tang said, “and he’s a 10 and he’s going to have some 10s around him.”The hiring of Mills comes as the Shockers try to position themselves at the forefront of a new-look American Athletic Conference. Perennial powerhouse Houston is joining Central Florida and Cincinnati in leaving for the Big 12 after this season, and six new schools are due to arrive from Conference USA for the start of next season.Wichita State, a power under Ralph Miller and Gene Smithson in the 1960s, returned to prominence when Mark Turgeon took over in 2000. But it was under Gregg Marshall, who resigned in November 2020 amid allegations of verbal and physical abuse of players, that it began to soar. The Shockers advanced to the Final Four in 2013, finished the regular season unbeaten the following year and at one point went to seven consecutive NCAA Tournaments.Brown, who was Marshall's top recruiter, led them back to the NCAA Tournament in his first year. But the Shockers were just 15-13 last year and 17-15 this past season, leading Saal to decide that a coaching change was necessary.Turns out the answer Saal was looking for was just a few hours south at Oral Roberts.“Paul Mills’ heart for people, passion for life and approach to the development of young people and programs is energizing,” Wichita State athletic director Kevin Saal said in a statement. “He aligns with Shocker Athletics’ core values, facilitates a first-class student-athlete experience and fuels broad-based competitive excellence.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843795,Israeli foreign minister visits Poland to restore ties,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The foreign ministers of Israel and Poland hailed a meeting they had Wednesday as a breakthrough in restoring a relationship that has been badly damaged for years due to disagreements over how to remember Polish behavior during the Holocaust.The ministers signed an agreement that they said would allow for the resumption of Israeli youth trips to Poland, one of several tension-causing points of contention between the two countries.Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen's visit to Poland was the first at that level since 2018. Poland's Foreign Ministry said Israeli President Isaac Herzog plans to attend observances next month for the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, an armed 1943 revolt by Jews in German-occupied Poland .“I came here to restore the relationship between our countries, and I found in you, my distinguished colleague, a trusted partner,” Cohen said at a news conference alongside Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, whom he referred to more than once as his friend.“This is an important moment in the relations between our countries,” Cohen said.Poland has been one of Israel’s closest allies in Europe over the years, and Israel appears eager to restore that relationship. Israel is also trying to shore up foreign alliances at a time when its new far-right government, which took office in December, has seen its relations with the United States and European Union deteriorate.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited France, Italy and Germany in recent weeks and is scheduled to head to Britain in the coming days.The tensions of the past years were marked by a withdrawal of ambassadors and Poland's prime minister canceling a planned visit to Israel in 2019. Israel has since returned an ambassador to Poland, but there is still no Polish ambassador in Israel.In Israel, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement Wednesday saying the diplomatic crisis with Poland was over.Cohen said that Poland has agreed to return an ambassador to Israeli, and Netanyahu said that “this decision marks a positive step forward in our diplomatic relations.”But Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina told The Associated Press that there is still no decision about the naming of a new ambassador to Israel.The disagreements between the nations are rooted largely in the Holocaust and how to remember Polish involvement in the killing of Jews by German forces during World War II.Nazi Germany occupied Poland in 1939 and killed millions of Jews and non-Jews. Unlike other countries occupied by Germany, there was no collaborationist government in Poland. While some Poles risked their lives to save Jews, others helped the Germans hunt down and kill them.Poland's governing nationalists have sought to depict Polish crimes as a marginal phenomenon and focus almost exclusively on remembering the Polish heroes who helped Jews. Historians, Israeli authorities and Jewish survivors who suffered persecution at Polish hands before, during and after the war have condemned the nationalist position and accuse the government of seeking to whitewash history.For years, young Israelis made pilgrimages to Auschwitz and other Holocaust sites, as well as historic Jewish sites in cities like Krakow and Warsaw. But Israel canceled the trips last year, claiming the Polish government was trying to control the Holocaust-studies curriculum taught to Israeli children.Poland, in turn, rejected Israel's demand to have security guards join organized Israeli school visits to Poland. The Polish officials argued that Poland was a safe country and the presence of armed guards perpetuated an image of it as an antisemitic place where Jews need protection.Cohen and Rau signed an agreement that will allow for the immediate resumption of youth delegations.Rau said the agreement “opens prospects for relations that are balanced, equal and based on reciprocity.”He said he received “with satisfaction” Israel showing understanding for Poland’s view that it was unnecessary to have armed Israeli guards in addition to Polish security, which will be provided to the groups whenever needed.Ties began to deteriorate when Poland passed a Holocaust speech law in 2018 that made it illegal to blame Poland as a nation for the Holocaust. The legislation eventually was watered down, and it still has not been applied in practice.Three years later, Poland's parliament passed a law that effectively left Holocaust survivors and their descendants unable to reclaim property seized by the post-WWII communist regime.Poland for centuries was home to a large Jewish community that numbered 3.3 million on the eve of the Holocaust. Only about 10% survived, and postwar persecution drove out many more. Today's Jewish community is very small but has seen some growth since the end of communism more than three decades ago.Israel was founded in the wake of the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews. It is home to a large but rapidly dwindling population of Holocaust survivors and its annual Holocaust memorial day coincides with the memory of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.___Monika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843796,Republicans invoke Soros to steer narrative on Trump probe,"NEW YORK (AP) — As former President Donald Trump braces for a potential indictment related to hush money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 campaign, Republicans blasting the case as politically motivated are blaming a frequent target: George Soros.The 92-year-old billionaire investor and philanthropist — who has been falsely accused of everything from hiring violent rioters to committing election crimes — doesn't know and didn't donate directly to the New York prosecutor steering the probe. But that hasn't stopped Trump and other high-profile Republicans from accusing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who convened the grand jury investigating Trump, of acting on Soros' behalf.Trump on Monday used his Truth Social platform to misleadingly claim that Bragg “received in EXCESS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS” from Soros. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance tweeted that the prosecutor was “bought by George Soros.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the case a “manufactured circus by some Soros-DA.”Experts say the claims exploit a gray area of campaign fundraising, where tenuous connections between PAC donors and the candidates who ultimately receive the funds can be unclear.Scapegoating Soros, who is Hungarian American and Jewish, also perpetuates deep-rooted false ideas about Jewish people and immigrants to underscore the conspiracy theory that he is a shadowy villain orchestrating world events.The misleading claims about Soros' link to the Trump case stem from a real donation the philanthropist made in 2021. Soros gave $1 million to Color of Change PAC, a political group that ran an independent expenditure campaign to support Bragg’s district attorney run.But Soros spokesman Michael Vachon confirmed the wealthy donor's contribution to the PAC was not earmarked to be used for Bragg. Soros didn't donate to Bragg’s campaign directly, and the two have never met in person, by phone or virtually, Vachon said.Soros' contribution to Color of Change PAC, which told The Associated Press it supports prosecutors looking to change the criminal justice system, follows a pattern for the investor, who “has made numerous contributions in support of reform-minded prosecutors across the country since 2015,” Vachon said. Soros wrote in an op-ed in 2022 that he supports these candidates because they invest in changes he supports, including mental health programs and treating drug addiction as a disease instead of a crime. Personally and through another PAC, Soros donated about $4 million to Color of Change PAC between 2016 and 2022, Vachon said.Still, Republicans and social media users have sought to use the 2021 donation to link Soros to the looming potential charges against Trump. Some widely shared posts have even falsely claimed that Soros donated directly to Bragg’s campaign or personally prompted the probe.In a situation like this, when a donor gives non-earmarked funds to a PAC whose spending he doesn’t control, “there’s no connection between the original contributor and the ultimate beneficiary the PAC has chosen to support,” said Jerry Goldfeder, a New York campaign finance expert and special counsel at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.But even as it's false to suggest Soros directly contributed to Bragg’s election effort, it’s fair to say Soros-linked entities invested a significant sum to see Bragg elected, said New York political consultant Hank Sheinkopf. Soros' son and daughter-in-law, Jonathan Soros and Jennifer Allan Soros, gave directly to Bragg's campaign, according to public contribution data.That gives political cover for Republicans to tie Bragg to Soros — a name that “makes people on the populist right lose their minds,” Sheinkopf said.Soros has given billions of dollars to liberal and anti-authoritarian causes all over the world, and as a result, he's long been a boogeyman for conservatives. Unfounded conspiracy theories over the years have falsely cast him as backing violent protesters and interfering with elections. They've also falsely accused him of having family ties to political figures ranging from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.These attacks give people partial to conspiracy theories a simple answer for a complicated world — but one that promotes damaging antisemitic ideas, according to Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University.“We need to understand that this has nothing to do with Soros,” Sarna said. “But it has everything to do with a very old, antisemitic view that even though Jews are small in number, they really control everything. The idea that behind the scenes, and barely visible, look for the Jew.”The spread of such narratives has been linked to real-world harm. In 2018, a Florida man mentioned Soros dozens of times on social media before mailing pipe bombs to newsrooms, top Democrats and Soros himself.“What has been so dispiriting for many American Jews is that they really thought we had put a lot of those antisemitic tropes behind us,” Sarna said. “And now, lo and behold, they’re back.”As Trump awaited possible charges Wednesday, he continued to push Soros rhetoric in an email to supporters. He has denied any wrongdoing amid the hush-money probe.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843797,"Police: 5 dead, including three kids, at South Carolina home","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A former soldier shot and killed three children as they slept in their South Carolina home Tuesday night while their mother frantically sought help, authorities said. The ex-soldier then killed himself.Charles Slacks Jr. also killed an Army soldier who worked with the children's mother and happened to be at the home, Sumter Police Chief Russell Roark said at a news conference Wednesday.Slacks and the woman were divorced, but he still had a key to the home in Sumter and let himself in around 10 p.m. Tuesday, Roark said.Slacks shot the co-worker in the backyard as the mother tried to stop him, pushed past her to go upstairs and shot the children, ages 5, 6 and 11, in their beds, the police chief said.“Little children were sleeping in the comfort of their own bed,” Roark said.The mother's cellphone was upstairs charging, so she ran to see if her wounded co-worker had a phone she could use. She heard the gunshots, came back inside and saw her ex-husband at the top of the stairs, where he shot himself, Roark said.The soldier who was killed had no relationship with the woman outside of work, and investigators haven't figured out why Slacks came to the home or whether he was supposed to have a key, Roark said.“Anybody who has children — anybody who has empathy toward a child dying so violently could understand how that mother is feeling,"" the police chief said.Slacks, 42, killed his own children, 5-year-old Aayden Holliday-Slacks and his 6-year-old brother Aason Holliday-Slacks, and also killed their half-sister, 11-year-old Ava Holliday, Sumter County Coroner Robbie Baker said. Before the divorce, Slacks had been Ava's stepfather.“It was a long night. This was just an awful thing,” the coroner said.The identity of the soldier killed has not been released because officials are still trying to determine his next of kin, Baker said.Slacks was a civilian assigned to U.S. Army Central at Shaw Air Force Base, while the solider killed was also assigned there, according to information from the Army.The Sumter School District is grieving the loss of three students, including two siblings who attended Millwood Elementary School and a third who attended Alice Drive Middle School, Superintendent William Wright said in a statement.State Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843798,Murdaugh trial gives unsolved death investigation a boost,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) —A mother whose son was found dead in the middle of a South Carolina road eight years ago is opening a private investigation into his death after raising almost $90,000 amid the publicity surrounding the murder trial of Alex Murdaugh.There is no current evidence linking Stephen Smith's death to the Murdaugh family, the lawyers for the mother say. State investigators, who are also looking into Smith's death, have also remained tight-lipped about taking over the case around the same time police said Murdaugh killed his wife and son. He is serving a life sentence for those killings.But the lack of evidence hasn't stopped speculation. And that attention in turn helped Sandy Smith raise in less than two weeks more than $87,000 through Go Fund Me. Her goal was $15,000 — enough to pay to exhume her son's body and have a private autopsy.“It's important to me because I love my son and since I couldn’t protect him, I’m going to fight for him,” Sandy Smith told reporters Monday as her lawyers announced the private investigation.Stephen Smith was found dead in the middle of a two-lane Hampton County road on July 8, 2015. His car with the gas cap removed and his wallet still inside was found a short distance awayThe trooper who responded didn't think it was a hit and run, but the pathologist who did the autopsy theorized Smith was hit in the head by the side mirror of a passing truck that did not stop.Police said it appeared he ran out of gas and was walking for help, but attorney Eric Bland, who is representing the Smith family, said Smith didn't make any calls on his cellphone and his shoes, which were tied loosely, were still on his feet. People hit by cars are often found without their shoes from the force of the wreck.Smith's family thinks his injuries, including head injuries and a dislocated arm bent behind him, indicate he was beaten to death and dropped on the highway. There were no skid marks on the road or debris like broken glass or mirror parts found nearby, said Ronnie Richter, another lawyer for the Smiths.State agents took over the case in 2021, though they have never said why they decided to do that or whether it is linked to information found during the investigation into the death of Alex Murdaugh's wife and son. Troopers typically investigate traffic deaths in South Carolina, where state agents typically investigate other crimes.State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel reached out to Smith’s new lawyers to ask if they will share any new information they find through the autopsy or any other investigation, agency spokesperson Renée Wunderlich said.“We do believe it was a murder,” Keel told The State newspaper on Tuesday night. “We don’t believe it was a hit-and-run.”Investigators think people might be more willing to talk now that the murder trial is finished, said the Smith family attorney Bland.The first step for the private investigation will be getting permission from a judge to exhume Stephen Smith's body. The backing of state agents would likely help that request.Bland also hopes the private investigators can gather and analyze cellphone data from Smith and the people he was communicating with to reconstruct who he was hanging out with and what he was doing not just right before his body was found but also in the weeks before his death.“Stephen had to live a secret life. Being young and gay in the Lowcountry was not an easy thing to do,"" Bland said.Smith and Alex Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster, went to the same high school, leading to rumors that the Murdaugh family was involved in his death. Richter went out of his way this week to say they have no evidence Buster Murdaugh was involved in anything with Smith.The talk has gotten so loud, Buster Murdaugh issued a statement Monday, saying he could no longer ignore the “vicious rumors” as he grieves “over the brutal murders of my mother and brother. I love them so much and miss them terribly. ”He said he is being harassed and targeted by defamatory comments.""These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false,"" Buster Murdaugh wrote in his statement. “I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death, and my heart goes out to the Smith family.""",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843799,AP sources: Manhattan DA postpones Trump grand jury session,"NEW YORK (AP) — Manhattan prosecutors postponed without any explanation a scheduled grand jury session Wednesday in the investigation into Donald Trump over hush money payments during his 2016 presidential campaign, at least temporarily slowing a decision on whether to charge the ex-president.The postponement was confirmed by four people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name. It was not immediately clear why the proceedings were postponed, but the grand jurors were told to be on standby for Thursday, another day when the New York panel has been meeting in recent weeks.When the grand jurors next meet, they may hear from yet another witness, according to a person familiar with proceedings that appear to be nearing a decisive vote on whether or not to indict Trump.The panel has been probing Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump years earlier. Trump has denied the claim, insisted he did nothing wrong and assailed the investigation, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, as politically motivated.Wednesday's abrupt development, which a person familiar with the matter said was not connected to security concerns, came amid growing anticipation that Trump could soon be charged. Grand jury proceedings are shrouded in secrecy, making it hard to predict with certainty what action might be taken and when.As the panel has been hearing from final witnesses, Trump has contended his arrest is imminent and law enforcement officials have accelerated security preparations in the event of unrest accompanying an unprecedented charge against a former U.S. president.The district attorney's office declined to comment on the postponement, which was earlier reported by Business Insider.Prosecutors had recently invited Trump himself to appear before the grand jury, and on Monday heard from a witness favorable to his case as a way to ensure that the panel would be presented with any information that could conceivably be considered exculpatory.Trump over the weekend stated that he expected to be arrested Tuesday, though the day came and went without that happening._____Tucker reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843800,Why TikTok's security risks keep raising fears,"The battle between the U.S. and China over TikTok came into full view on Thursday when the social media platform's CEO testified before Congressional lawmakers.Shou Zi Chew's hearing in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is happening at what he's called a “pivotal moment” for the hugely popular short video sharing app. TikTok is owned by parent company ByteDance, which has offices in Beijing. The platform has 150 million American users but it's been dogged by persistent claims that it threatens national security and user privacy, or could be used to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation.Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to pursue a ban on the app or force its sale to new owners.So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones?Here’s what to know:WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT TIKTOK?Both the FBI and officials at the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with China’s authoritarian government.Officials fear that TikTok, which like many other social media platforms collects vast amounts of data on its users, would be forced to give it to Beijing under a 2017 law that compels companies to turn over any personal data relevant to China's national security.Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company.HOW IS THE U.S. RESPONDING?In a rare, bipartisan effort to reign in the power and influence of a major social media platform, Republican and Democratic lawmakers pressed Chew during Thursday’s hearing on a host of topics, ranging from TikTok’s content moderation practices, how the company plans to secure American data from Beijing, and that it admits spying on journalists.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. — known as CFIUS and part of the Treasury Department — is also carrying out a review, and has reportedly threatened a U.S. ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. China’s Foreign Ministry in turn accused the United States itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks.White House officials have said there are “legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity.""Some U.S. senators urged CFIUS last year to quickly wrap up its investigation and ""impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok's American operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies.At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration's authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support.HOW HAS TIKTOK ALREADY BEEN RESTRICTED?Authorities in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific have banned the TikTok app, mostly on government-issued phones or devices used for official business, citing cybersecurity concerns. Last week Britain imposed a government phone ban while New Zealand restricted lawmakers and other workers in its Parliament from having it on their phones.The European Union’s three main institutions, the executive Commission, Parliament and Council, have ordered staffers to remove it from their work phones. So has Denmark's defense ministry. The Canadian government said its ban includes blocking civil servants from downloading the app in the future. Norway and Netherlands warned this week against installing TikTok on government devices.The White House ordered U.S. federal agencies to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states had already banned the app.WHAT DOES TIKTOK SAY?Chew, a 40-year-old Singapore native, told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that TikTok prioritizes the safety of its young users and denied allegations that the app is a national security risk. He reiterated the company’s plan to protect U.S. user data by storing all such information on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.Under a $1.5 billion project dubbed Project Texas that's underway, data from U.S. users is being routed through servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it partnered with in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban.Older U.S. user data stored on non-Oracle servers will be deleted this year. Under this arrangement, there's no way for Beijing to access the data, Chew said in prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing.TikTok has also sought to portray ByteDance as a global company, not a Chinese one. Executives have been pointing out that ByteDance's ownership consists of 60% big global investors, 20% employees and 20% Chinese entrepreneurs who founded the company. TikTok itself is headquartered in Singapore.ARE THE SECURITY RISKS LEGITIMATE?It depends on who you ask.Some tech privacy advocates say while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information.“If policy makers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit advocacy group Fight for the Future.Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles.Others say there is legitimate reason for concern.People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the United States is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said.IS THERE PRECEDENCE FOR BANNING TECH COMPANIES?The U.S. has banned the communications equipment sold by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing national security risks. But banning the sale of items is easier than banning a free app.Such a move might also wind up in courts on grounds that it could violate the First Amendment, as some civil liberties groups have argued.Another possibility, albeit remote, is forcing a sale. That's what happened in 2020 when Beijing Kunlun, a Chinese mobile video game company, agreed to sell gay dating app Grindr after an order from CFIUS.Beijing Kunlun said it signed a ""national security agreement” with CFIUS to sell Grindr to San Vicente Acquisition for $608.5 million, promising not to send sensitive user data to China, cease its operations there and maintain its headquarters in the U.S.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843801,"Russia, Belarus barred from next season's ice hockey worlds","ZURICH (AP) — Russia and Belarus teams were excluded by the International Ice Hockey Federation on Wednesday from all its world championships next season, including the women’s event in the United States.The IIHF cited security concerns for players, competition staff and fans — because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — to extend the exclusion that will stretch beyond two years when the 2023-24 season is over.“It is too soon,” IIHF president Luc Tardif said about letting Russia return. “Too many risks.”The women’s worlds is set to be played in U.S. cities in March or April next year and the men’s event in the Czech Republic is scheduled next May.Ice hockey is a favorite sport played by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.The Russian Hockey Federation dismissed the IIHF's security concerns as a “contrived reason” to keep its teams out of competition.“It is a decision which is neither constructive, nor beneficial for world hockey,” the federation said in a statement.The IIHF has followed guidance given by the International Olympic Committee within days of Russia starting the war in February last year to remove Russian teams from international competitions and to find new hosts for events the country was to stage.However, the IOC is now pushing Olympic sports governing bodies to find ways to include Russian and Belarusian athletes as neutrals in qualifying events for the 2024 Paris Games. The international governing bodies for judo and fencing have said this year that they are prepared to readmit Russian and Belarusian athletes.The IOC executive board is due to discuss the Russian issue at a meeting next Tuesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.Tardif, speaking after a decision by the ruling council he chairs, said the IIHF must decide in the next year if Russia and Belarus can take part in the 2026 Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter Games.___Winter Olympics news: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843802,War on gangs forges new El Salvador. But the price is steep.,"SOYAPANGO, El Salvador (AP) — With semiautomatic weapons pressed to their chest, a pack of camouflage-clad police officers marches through rows of small brick homes winding up hills on the fringes of El Salvador’s capital.They rap sharply on door after door, pushing into homes with dozing teenagers listening to music or toddlers eating breakfast and watching cartoons.Stepping foot in La Campanera, once one of El Salvador's bloodiest neighborhoods, would have been unthinkable before the government suspended constitutional rights and started an all-out offensive on the gangs one year ago.Today, police march past skeletons of ransacked homes, abandoned by those fleeing the bloodshed that marked these streets for decades. Officers demand men strip off their shirts so they can examine their bodies for tattoos, and flip through deeds and energy bills, once unpaid under gang rule. Residents scrape together any evidence they can to prove they aren't members of Barrio 18, the gang that once dominated here.Neighbors look on not with surprise, but resigned acceptance.“Now it’s normal,” Katherine Zaldivar said after her house was searched, her 4-year-old daughter peering up at the two officers as she sat on the floor finishing her cereal. “They’re always here.”El Salvador has undergone a radical transformation since President Nayib Bukele – the self-described “world’s coolest dictator” – ordered a state of emergency in response to an alarming surge in gang violence. Bukele has imprisoned over 65,000 of the nation's 6.3 million people, packing thousands inside a “ mega-prison ” that's set to be one of the world’s largest. Bloodshed has faded away in places like La Campanera as the presence of the most fearsome gangs dwindles.Police stops like the one at Zaldivar's home are the new norm. The national homicide rate, the highest in the world as recently as 2015, has dipped to numbers more comparable to Maine or New Hampshire, though some analysts question the integrity of the government data.Small freedoms mark the monumental shift for many Salvadorans. They enjoy traversing San Salvador by night, order pizza from delivery services newly entering former gang territories, and open businesses without gangs extorting them for money.For others, the transformation comes at a steep price.Tens of thousands of children are torn from their parents, who have been taken to prisons with conditions fueling a flood of reported human rights abuses. Observers raise alarms about the slipping of a delicate democracy, a decay threatening to ripple across the region. For many, fear of the gangs has been replaced by fear of the very government claiming to protect them.“The long term question, and what I fear, is: Is this going to become a police state?” said Michael Paarlberg, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University researching El Salvador.Bukele’s government declined various requests by The Associated Press for interviews, written comment or access to the prisons.And despite the relative calm, the gangs still lurk.Yet for the family of 44-year-old Maritza Pacheco, opening a corner shop outside their home four months ago was a small miracle.On the dusty streets of the Primero de Diciembre neighborhood, they lived in a state of constant panic. Members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha gang, or MS-13, would war with nearby Barrio 18 rivals, sending gunfire ringing out over flimsy tin-sheet homes.The gangs were formed in Los Angeles in the 1970s and ’80s by migrants fleeing war in Central America. After many members were deported, the groups took root in El Salvador and flourished. Before the crackdowns, the government said 118,000 gang members were on the streets nationwide.They long terrorized and extorted poor communities. To scrape by, Pacheco and her daughter secretly sold fruits and vegetables in a market in another neighborhood, avoiding gang payments simply referred to as “rent.”The family of 11 tried to isolate themselves, determined not to get sucked into the lawlessness around them. But the gangs began closing in on her teenage son. Early last year, Pacheco paid to have him and his sister smuggled to the U.S.“As he got older, those guys would go looking for him, and that scared me,” Pacheco said. “Raising a child only to lose him to this? No way.”Then, in May, two months after the state of emergency came into effect and police stormed the neighborhood, something unprecedented happened: Pacheco watched as the truck of a local soda provider, SalvaCola, rolled by their house.Then came fruit vendors. Then banks, one of which gave them a loan to start her own business.Today, Pacheco sells candies, sodas and pastries to neighborhood kids playing nearby. The family went from earning $15 a day, just enough to subsist, to $60, enough to save for the future.“Things have changed a lot,” she said. “People come and stay sometimes until 12 or 1 in the morning. And it’s so safe that we can stay open.”That change is painted across San Salvador. As the sun sets, families amble through the streets in a religious procession, instead of hiding away at the first hint of darkness. Cradling candles, they drift past packed pupuserías and bustling karate gyms. Police trucks on patrol roar past as dozens of elderly Salvadorans doing aerobics in a park; nearby, gangs were known to pile bodies in mass graves. Prisoners, under careful watch, slap brown paint over faded blue MS-13 graffiti on a brick wall.Such graffiti, once speckling the city, has all but disappeared in Bukele’s efforts to erase any trace of the gangs. Less visible is the damage left by the crackdown.Bukele’s administration has suppressed critics and journalists, wielding a robust disinformation machine and a tightly controlled communications strategy. Nowhere is that more evident than inside prisons, likened to torture chambers by two government officials and a former prisoner who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution by the government and gangs.They describe cells so packed that inmates can’t sit down, struggling to go to the bathroom. Prisoners rarely see the light of day, and cells reek of unwashed inmates. Many of them cough, including women and elderly prisoners. One former inmate described watching others carried away in body bags.The government confirmed in November that at least 90 have died in custody, but since has been largely tight-lipped about death counts.Little is known officially about the facilities outside of highly produced videos Bukele plasters on social media layered over dramatic, action-movie music. One video released last week shows police packing their new “mega-prison” with 2,000 more tattooed young men. Bukele’s government says it could fit up to 40,000 people.“This will be their new house, where they will live for decades, mixed together, unable to do any more harm to the population,” Bukele tweeted following the opening of the prison, referring to prisoners as “terrorists.”Pressure to make detentions was so great that in December, extra Christmas vacation days were offered to those who could get the highest capture counts, said one of the officials who spoke to AP — an officer who has worked for decades in gang-controlled zones.“We received specific orders that we in the streets had to arrest a certain number of people, whether they were gangsters or not,” the officer said. “Many innocents were detained and their rights were violated.""We’ve committed crimes.”Nearly one in six people who have been imprisoned are innocent, estimates the country’s police union tracking detentions.Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 children as young as 12 have been detained. The organization accused Bukele’s government of due process violations, targeting marginalized communities with “indiscriminate” raids, torturing detainees and overpacking prisons.Local rights group Cristosal documented 3,344 cases of human rights violations in the first 11 months of the state of emergency. Still, advocates say people are often too scared to report cases.But most civilians who spoke to AP view human rights concerns as collateral damage for a greater good. And the president’s approval rating has soared to 91%, according to a March poll by LPG Data. So, too, has approval for the crackdown.“The president is doing what no one has been able to. You know there are a lot of innocent people caught in the middle,” said Jorge Guzmán, a pastor of a church in a former red zone. “But you accept what’s happening as something that had to happen.”Bukele has harnessed his approval to further consolidate power, according to the officials who spoke to AP, as well as watchdogs and analysts.“It’s a very attractive model,"" said Abraham Abrego, a leader of Cristosal. ""It’s a model that sells a kind of punitive populism to gain popularity and stay in power.”The government has extended Bukele’s state-of-exception measures a dozen times. In September, he announced he would run for reelection despite El Salvador’s constitution banning presidents from consecutive terms.When asked what she thought of Bukele, Pacheco, the owner of the corner shop, responded: “I’ve never voted in my life. Now, I would vote for him.”While Bukele has dealt a historic blow to the gangs, they still quietly linger in the areas they once controlled, according to locals, law enforcement and government personnel.The police official told AP that in the push to stack arrest counts, many of those captured by the government were low-level foot soldiers, people collecting “rents,” or lookouts.Many gang members remain free in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. It's in part, critics say, due to Bukele’s reported negotiations with MS-13, though he denies making any deals with gangs. The officer said that in Bukele's ranks, there is a widespread fear that the gangs are biding their time, and that they will then become targets.And inside prisons, officials and former prisoners say, gang members simmer with a sort of vengeful rage. The second official who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity, a social worker, called it “a time bomb.”In many areas, locals are still being extorted and paying gangs. In others, small-scale drug operations are still active. Across San Salvador, people speak about the groups in hushed voices.Many, like Jennifer Luna de Diaz, Pacheco’s 27-year-old daughter who helps run the corner shop, believe the gangs are still quietly monitoring their barrios. Family members and girlfriends of gang members have a strong presence in former gang territories.“They’re still here. All day. Listening, overseeing things,” Luna de Diaz said. “I’m scared for my kids, my two boys.”Most recently, watchdogs have raised alarms about the government’s anonymous tip line being weaponized to seek revenge and intimidate those no longer paying the gangs.In late February, someone made such a call about Pacheco’s family, accusing them of being affiliated with gangs, they said.Police arrived and forced them to strip to search for tattoos, and eventually let them go, the family said. It scared Luna de Diaz enough that she decided to use money she’s saved to send her 12-year-old son to the U.S. like her brothers.Other families agonize over the unknown: Is my son alive? Why did my mother get detained? Will I ever see my brother again?Gisel was 17 when the police came for her parents chasing an anonymous tip. She and her 8-year-old brother, Brayan, lived a quiet life in a coffee-growing town. Her construction-worker father was never involved with the gangs, she said. On weekends, they played soccer together in the park, said Gisel, who spoke to AP on condition that her family's full name not be used, over fears of government retribution and to protect her minor brother.Six months ago, she returned from class to find her small community teeming with dozens of soldiers. Her parents sat handcuffed on the side of the road. She rushed home and found Brayan sitting alone. It was the last they heard of their parents.For more than 45,100 children nationally, at least one parent has been detained, according to internal data from the country’s social services entity shared with AP. At least 1,675 children have been left without any parents or extended relatives to care for them.The social worker who spoke to AP described traumatized children. Confused kids as young as 3 sink into depression thinking their parents don’t love them, the social worker said. Teenagers get angry and lash out.“Emotionally they feel totally abandoned, and economically they have no support. So what’s waiting for these kids down the line?” she said.Gisel and Brayan's aunt would bus four hours from San Salvador to care for them, giving up her job to do so. Their extended family pools money for their care.Gisel started having nightmares. One night, she awoke to her brother sobbing next to her.“The pain eats him from the inside,” Gisel, now 18, said. “Before he was a more caring person … Now, he doesn’t share his feelings; he isolates himself. He suffers, I know he suffers.”While they await news of their parents, their family has asked courts to do a psychological examination to assess the trauma from the separation.She clings to small pieces of their past life, flipping through a photo book in their home that now feels empty.“I miss the love that we can’t get from them now. Hugs from my mom, hugs from my dad,” Gisel said.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843804,Getting safe water a struggle for many of Venezuela's poor,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Everyone knows Franklin Cáceres in his neighborhood on the far east side of Venezuela’s capital. A roadside vendor directs a visitor downhill, past a curve and to the left. A middle school student points to Cáceres’ home and business.There, in a space flattened on the mountain by Cáceres, some meager cinderblock walls and a tin roof protect four 1,000-liter (264-gallon) blue plastic tanks in one corner. There is also a stove and a noisy flock of roosters.“Fran! Fran!” neighbors yell as he walks up and down a winding, dusty road untangling and tugging a seemingly endless hose. The hose, which is more like a network of hoses that measure about a mile in length, has transformed their lives by bringing clean water to their poor district.Water has long been a luxury in the sprawling low-income neighborhoods that surround Caracas. The problem preceded the socialist-led government of the late President Hugo Chavez. But like many other issues under the watch of his successor, Nicolas Maduro, the shortages have intensified in communities like Cáceres’ and expanded to other parts of Venezuela.Compounding the problem is the decreasing value of wages after years of runaway inflation that has driven consumer prices ever higher amid Venezuela’s economic and political crisis. Those who buy water through formal or informal vendors must pay exorbitant fees in relation to wages. Many just can't afford it.At least half of Venezuela's population lives in poverty.The homes that cover a steep hill in this corner of Petare once had running water. When that stopped 13 or 14 years ago, the government would sporadically send a tanker trailer. Then that stopped, too. Next came the private dealers with tankers or smaller vehicles who these days sell 200 liters (53 gallons) for $2 — that's two-fifths of the country’s monthly minimum wage.No celebrations are planned in Petare for Wednesday's World Water Day. But many will long praise Cáceres' ingenuity.“He is famous,” said a neighbor, Gregoria Morao.Cáceres’ place is 700 meters (0.4 miles) uphill from the well of an abandoned quarry. For a time, he and his neighbors would walk to the well, fill all sorts of containers and carry them back up to their homes.As the need grew, both for water and an income source, Cáceres said, he saw a business opportunity and a way to help his neighbors.With both his own and borrowed money — and a water pump donated by the local government — he connected a series of hoses until he reached the well and began feeding the tanks at his home. He then connected more hoses until they were long enough to reach his neighbors’ tanks.“I see it as a service to the community,” Cáceres said.His listed price is $1.50 for 200 liters (53 gallons), but he accepts whatever his neighbors can pay, even taking a cold or burned arepa. Occasionally, he also gives water for free to some families.“This gives people peace of mind,” he said.Only about 27% of Venezuelans whose homes have water pipes have daily, round-the-clock service, according to a December survey of 7,683 people by the non-profit group Venezuelan Observatory of Public Services. Of those surveyed 9.4% reported having service just once a month, while 5% never get water.The infrastructure failures are such that part of the international humanitarian assistance provided in Venezuela to ease its protracted crisis is specifically designated for potable water projects.The complex political, social and economic crisis has driven more than 7 million Venezuelans to migrate and created a hellscape of inequality for those who remain in the country.At his current rate, Cáceres’ customers pay $7.50 for a cubic meter of water. In a middle-income neighborhood in Caracas, an apartment building can pay 0.04 cents for the same amount.Morao, 66, and five other people live off her son’s $180 monthly income from a kitchen helper job in a sushi restaurant. She said they typically need their 1,400-liter (370-gallon) plastic tank filled up once a week.She remembers when water flowed through her sink faucet and all the promises politicians have made to restore service. She laughs at that prospect.“Where is the water? And this year, they are also going to promise us water, they just haven’t come yet,” she said. “Why would we be hopeful? That’s a lie.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843805,Hezbollah chief refuses comment on infiltration into Israel,"BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group refused to comment directly Wednesday on last week’s killing of a man suspected of entering Israel from Lebanon. He said the Iran-backed group's silence is part of a psychological war.Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah refused to say whether his group had anything to do with the attacker, who was carrying explosives and was killed dozens of kilometers (miles) south of the border with Lebanon.Last week, the Israeli army said soldiers killed an armed man suspected of entering the country from Lebanon and blowing up a car, raising the risk of renewed tensions with Hezbollah.The incident unnerved Israelis, who questioned on social media and elsewhere how someone with explosives could travel dozens of kilometers inside Israel and set off a roadside bomb before being detected.“Our silence is part of the psychological, media and military battle with the enemy,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech adding that it is not Hezbollah’s responsibility to respond to what “is confusing the enemy.”“Sometimes our answer is by not commenting on the incident,” he added. Responding to Israeli threats that if Hezbollah turns out to be responsible, Israel will retaliate against the group, Nasrallah said: “Go to hell.”Thee was no immediate response to Nasrallah's comments from the Israeli military. The army this week said it had determined how the man crossed the border. But it gave no details, saying only that it had ruled out a tunnel infiltration. It says the incident is still under investigation.The Israeli army said soldiers stopped a car carrying the bombing suspect at a checkpoint on March 13, shortly after a roadside explosion seriously injured a driver near Megiddo Junction in the country’s north. The suspect was wearing a suicide vest and had a rifle and another gun when he was stopped. The army said it shot and killed the man and is questioning the driver.The army said the device exploded at a 90-degree angle, which is unusual for the area. That led officials to suspect that the man infiltrated from Lebanon and may have been linked to Hezbollah.The Lebanon-Israel border has remained quiet but tense since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 that ended with a draw.Commenting on Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said in Paris that the notion of a Palestinian people was artificial, Nasrallah said it seems that the Israeli official “does not know history.”",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843825,NYC neighborhood carries on during wait for Trump grand jury,"NEW YORK (AP) — As the world waits to see whether a grand jury in lower Manhattan indicts former President Donald Trump, neighborhood resident Barbara Malmet decided to give up her front-row seat.While police erected barricades around the courthouse where any criminal case would be brought, the retired New York University professor packed a bag and prepared to leave town.Malmet, 70, lives a few blocks from the city’s civic center and said she is concerned about “a smaller repeat of Jan. 6” if Trump incites “his cult followers into violence.” She wants ”a little more peace of mind not being within walking distance of the courthouse.”So far, Trump's call for protests has not resulted in any lawlessness, and life has generally gone on as usual in the neighborhood of government buildings and office towers on the edge of Chinatown. Another day passed Wednesday without any decision on possible legal action.Asked if the situation was straining city resources or the New York Police Department, Mayor Eric Adams said it had not.“The NYPD is fully equipped to deal with whatever circumstances may come about in the city,” he said. “We’ve shown that throughout the years.”TV camera tripods and lights have sprouted on the sidewalks. Metal barricades are in place to keep people out of the streets. Small groups of demonstrators — some supporting Trump, some opposing him — have come and gone.Some television drama overlapped with the real-life drama as scenes from “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” were filmed in the area. More filming was planned for the weekend, with notices announcing that a feature film titled “Juliet” would be shooting nearby.Every block in New York City “has its own universe,” said Alli Coates, 35, while kicking a small ball for Trinity, an English springer spaniel, on Tuesday in a park behind the courthouse. “There’s always so much happening that the fact that there’s 50,000 reporters a block away, I don’t even know that.”Plenty of others were out enjoying the sunshine as news crews waited for word on whether Trump will be charged in an investigation of payments to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump.A trickle of activists visited the courthouse for demonstrations that were partly performance art. One person tried to enter the building carrying a large cross, like Jesus.Another man sat on the ground wearing a Trump flag as a cape and a hat with antlers. A demonstrator on a nearby bench held a placard saying “Trump is over.""Philippe Lejeune, 38, of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, walked up and down the street carrying a handmade sign chastising Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.""There’s some people here for the cameras,"" he acknowledged, but said it was too important to let the moment pass without speaking out. “You want to skate by in a pink flamingo costume? You can do that.""Brinley Cobden and Moustafa Ibrahim have followed the grand jury developments, but the couple had an entirely different reason to keep an eye on the media.They were concerned that the crowds could make them late to an important appointment at the city’s marriage bureau, which is in the same building where the grand jury has been meeting.They received their marriage license the day before and needed to tie the knot Tuesday, according to the rules.They had no trouble getting in. Asked on her way out of the clerk's office what she would remember about the day, Cobden said simply, “We got married.”",2023/03/23,188,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843826,Body found near Denver high school shooting suspect's car,"DENVER (AP) — A body was found Wednesday night in the Colorado woods near the abandoned car that belonged to a 17-year-old student accused of shooting two administrators at his Denver high school earlier in the day, a sheriff said.Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw said the body was discovered not far from the car in a remote mountain area about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Denver, near the small town of Bailey, in Park County. The town had been ordered to shelter in place while while officers from a number of agencies including the FBI combed the forest.But, authorities said they have not yet identified who it was and McGraw declined to say if it was a man or reveal the cause of death.Earlier in the day, Denver police identified the suspect as Austin Lyle.The shooting occurred at East High School in Denver while two administrators searched Lyle for weapons, a daily requirement because of the boy’s behavioral issues, authorities said. Lyle fled after the shooting.It occurred at a school shaken by frequent lockdowns and violence, including the recent killing outside the school of a classmate that prompted East High School students to march on the Colorado Capitol earlier this month. Parents who converged on the 2,500-student campus on Wednesday voiced frustration that officials had not done enough to protect their children.“I am sick of it,” said Jesse Haase, who planned to talk with her daughter about taking her out of classes for the rest of the school year.Amid the flurry of criticism over lax security, Denver school officials said after the shooting that they would once again put armed officers into the city’s public high schools.There were no school resource officers on campus at the time of Wednesday’s shooting, said Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas.The shooting happened just before 10 a.m. in an office area as Lyle was undergoing a search as part of a “safety plan"" that required him to be patted down daily, officials said.The gun used in the shooting was not immediately recovered, Thomas said.One of the wounded administrators was released from the hospital Wednesday afternoon and the second remained in serious condition, said Heather Burke, a spokesperson for Denver Health hospital.Hundreds of students on March 3 skipped class and marched in support of stricter gun laws following the death of Luis Garcia, 16, who was shot while sitting in a car near East High School.In June 2020, amid a summer of protests over racial injustice following the murder of George Floyd, Denver Public Schools became one of the districts around the US that decided to phase out its use of police officers in school buildings. That push was fueled by criticism that school resource officers disproportionately arrested Black students, sweeping them into the criminal justice system.After Wednesday’s shooting, two armed officers will be posted at East High School through the end of the school year, and other city high schools also will each get an officer, said Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero.In a Wednesday letter to the city's Board of Education, Marrero said his decision violated district's policies but added he “can no longer stand on the sidelines.”“I am the leader of this district who is charged with keeping our scholars and staff safe every day,” he wrote. The school board said it supported the decision.Gun violence at schools has become increasingly common in the U.S. with more than 1,300 shooting incidents recorded between 2000 and June 2022, according to government researchers. Those shootings killed 377 people and wounded 1,025, according to a database maintained by the researchers.Students from East High School had been scheduled to testify Wednesday afternoon before the Colorado Legislature on gun safety bills.“This is the reality of being young in America: sitting through a shooting and waiting for information just hours before you’re scheduled to testify in support of gun safety bills,” said Gracie Taub, a 16-year-old East High School sophomore and volunteer with Students Demand Action in Colorado.Lyle transferred to East High School after being disciplined and removed from a high school in nearby Aurora last school year because of unspecified violations of school policies, said Cherry Creek School District spokesperson Lauren Snell.Marrero said safety plans for students are enacted in response to “past educational and also behavioral experiences,” adding that it’s a common practice throughout Colorado’s public schools. Officials did not give further details on why Lyle was searched daily.But daily pat downs are rare, said Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver professor specializing in school violence prevention.“Clearly they were concerned,” said Crepeau-Hobson. “I can’t imagine they’d do that if there wasn’t a history of the kid carrying a weapon.”Safety plans often follow threatening or suicidal behavior from a student, said Christine Harms with the Colorado School Safety Resource Center.East High School, not far from downtown, was locked down as police investigated the shooting, and hundreds of parents lined up along a road outside the school.Some parents and students vented frustration over violence at the school as they surrounded the police chief. Thomas listened quietly, nodding and promising to engage with the school board.At the edge of the crowd, a man said the city's school board members should be recalled for getting rid of police in school, telling a nearby officer “I just want you to be able to do your job.”In response to the shooting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated President Joe Biden’s called for stricter gun laws, including bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and for Congress to “do something” on gun control.Wednesday was also the second anniversary of 10 people being shot and killed at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.__Associated Press reporters Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland and Matthew Brown in Billings, Mont. contributed.__Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843827,Prince William visits Poland to support ally helping Ukraine,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Prince William made a surprise visit to Poland on Wednesday that underscored Britain’s support for a nation on the front line of efforts to help refugees displaced by Russia's war in Ukraine and to assist the Ukrainian military in fighting off the invasion.The heir to the throne met with British and Polish troops in Rzeszow, a city of 200,000 people in southeastern Poland that has become a hub for shipments of military and humanitarian aid bound for Ukraine.“I just wanted to come here in person to say thank you for all that you’re doing, keeping everyone safe out here and keeping an eye on what’s going on,'' William said as he spoke to the troops.“You’re doing a really important job out here and defending our freedoms is really important, and everyone back home thoroughly supports you,” he said.Located just 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Rzeszow is also a key transit point for refugees.William later landed in Warsaw, where he visited a center that houses about 300 recent arrivals from Ukraine, meeting Ukrainians and playing table tennis with children.He praised the strong ties between the people of the U.K. and Poland, and the cooperation undertaken in support of Ukraine.“I also want to pay tribute to the inspiring humanity of the Polish people,'' the prince said. ""You have opened your hearts as much as your homes.''The U.K. has been one of the most outspoken supporters of bolstering NATO’s eastern flank in the face of Russia's aggression. The country sent troops to Poland and the Baltic states and provided more than 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of military aid to Ukraine. It also has pledged 220 million pounds ($269 million) of humanitarian assistance.But deploying the popular 40-year-old prince, a military veteran who also worked as a civilian air-sea rescue pilot, offers a more personal touch. While British political leaders have visited Poland regularly to trumpet their support for NATO and the Ukrainian cause, a senior royal like William is a symbol of the nation who can thank military personnel for their service without the baggage of party politics.The prince’s planned meetings with refugees and volunteers also shine the royal spotlight on efforts to shelter the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have settled in Poland over the past year.On Thursday, he is also scheduled to meet with President Andrzej Duda and to talk with young Ukrainians who are working and studying in Poland.“Our nations have strong ties,'' William said Wednesday. ”Through our cooperation in support of the people of Ukraine and their freedom, which are also our freedoms and yours, these ties are further strengthened.''___Kirka contributed from London.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843828,UN chief urges 'game-changing' commitments on clean water,"UNITED NATION (AP) — The United Nations chief urged the first world conference on water in over 45 years on Wednesday to address the “21st century emergency” that is wasting the world’s most important resource and has left billions of people without clean water and basic sanitation.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the opening session that water is “humanity’s lifeblood” and a human right, but the world is draining it “through vampiric overconsumption and unsustainable use and evaporating it through global heating.”In a challenge to all nations and the broader international community, he said the three-day conference must represent “a quantum leap” in recognition of the vital importance of water and the need for action to ensure its sustainable use.Guterres called for “game-changing commitments” toward U.N. goals, including ensuring that all people have access to drinking water and sanitation by 2030.The U.N. World Water Development Report, issued on the eve of the conference, says 26% of the world’s population — 2 billion people — don’t have access to safe drinking water and 46% — 3.6 billion people — lack access to basic sanitation. U.N. research also shows that almost half the world's people will suffer severe water stress by 2030.The U,N. secretary-general called for major investments in water and sanitation systems and efforts to address climate change, stressing that “climate action and a sustainable water future are two sides of the same coin.”According to conference organizers, such commitments will be the key outcome of the conference. Already, more than 500 commitments have been registered from governments, U.N. agencies, business leaders and civil society, they say.Just before the conference opened, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced a new commitment from the Biden administration, of $49 billion to be put toward ""equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation investments at home and around the world.”She said the new U.S. funding “will help create jobs, prevent conflicts, safeguard public health, reduce the risk of famine and hunger, and enable us to respond to climate change and natural disasters.”But the U.S. envoy stressed the need for global cooperation and urged the U.N. Security Council to take up the issue of water scarcity, which exacerbates conflicts and disrupts peace and security.The U.N. Water Conference is co-hosted by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon. There are 171 countries, including over 100 ministers, on the speakers list.Rahmon said Tajikistan has abundant drinking water, although 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers have completely melted in the last few decades. Noting that the last U.N. water conference was held in 1977 in Argentina, he proposed holding the next one in Tajikistan in 2028 to monitor implementation of the commitments being made during the current meeting.Willem-Alexander stressed that over the next three days “we went to get the water wheel spinning” and ensure that the alarming state of the world's water resources is given a high place on global agendas.“Water security is one of the defining concerns of our time and it will determine our collective sustainable future,” the Dutch king said.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843829,Michael Jordan considering sale of Hornets; no deal imminent,"Michael Jordan is considering selling the Charlotte Hornets.The six-time NBA champion is in negotiations to sell at least a portion of the franchise to a group that includes Hornets minority owner Gabe Plotkin.“Four years ago, Michael Jordan sold a stake in the Charlotte Hornets to a Gabe Plotkin-led group,” Jump Management, which is Michael Jordan’s family office, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday. “As a natural step in a process due to that transaction, Michael and Gabe are in discussions about his group potentially buying an additional stake.”No deal is imminent.“At this time, it is unclear whether an additional sale will take place,” the statement read.Jordan declined interview requests to discuss the potential sale of the team through his spokesperson, Estee Portnoy.In 2019, Jordan sold a portion of the Hornets to Plotkin, a founder of Melvin Capital, and Daniel Sundheim of DI Capital, but Jordan still controlled the majority of the team’s equity.It’s unclear at this point if Jordan is looking to sell his entire majority stake in the team, or just a portion of it.Jordan is the NBA’s only Black owner. He purchased the expansion team from Bob Johnson for $180 million in 2010. The team had a net worth of $1.7 billion after the 2021-22 season, according to Forbes.Jordan experienced plenty of success as an NBA player, leading the Chicago Bulls to three-peat championships twice while being named an NBA All-Star 14 times. He also has had success with his Jordan Brand line of merchandise and has a current net worth of $2 billion, per Forbes.But the 60-year-old Jordan hasn't had much success as an NBA owner.Since 2010, the Hornets are 419-595 and they will miss the playoffs this season for the seventh straight year. The Hornets have reached the playoffs only twice in 13 seasons under Jordan and have never advanced to the second round.The Hornets are listed as the 27th-most valuable NBA franchise in the 30-team league.But franchises are a hot commodity.Mat Ishbia, a mortgage executive, agreed to purchase the majority stake of the Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury from embattled owner Robert Sarver for $4 billion in December. The league approved the sale last month.And Joe Tsai, the co-founder of Alibaba, agreed in 2019 to buy the remaining 51% of the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center for about $3.4 billion. Tsai had previously purchased 49% of the team from Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov in 2018, with the option to become controlling owner in 2021.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843830,Study: Most women's NCAA teams are still coached by men,"Women comprised less than half the head coaching positions and just over half of the assistant coaching spots for women's college teams in the 2021-22 school year, according to a diversity study released Wednesday.Women held just 42% of head coaching positions of women’s teams in NCAA Division I — a slight increase from the previous season — as well as 35.6% in Division II and 43.8% in Division III. For all three divisions combined, women filled 41.2% of head coaching positions and 50.3% of assistant coaching positions for women’s teams.The annual report by the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) gave schools a “C” for overall racial and gender hiring practices. But TIDES director and report author Richard Lapchick called the representation of women coaches in women's sports “the most depressing statistic that we report every year.”“It doesn’t even make any sense to me, that nearly 60% of women’s teams are coached by men 50 years after the passage of Title IX,"" Lapchick said, referring to the federal law best known for its role in gender equity in athletics and preventing sexual harassment on campuses.A month earlier, a separate TIDES report showed that the number of women working as athletic directors at Football Bowl Subdivision programs dropped from 13 to 10 in 2022, with only six of them in Power Five conferences (Duke, Missouri, Pittsburgh, Vanderbilt, Virginia and Washington).From a racial hiring and employment standpoint for coaches, white people continue to fill the vast majority of head coaching positions at all levels.But Wednesday's report did note slight increases in the percentages of Black head coaches of men’s teams between the 2020-21 school year to the 2021-22 school year — 9.9% in Division I (up from 9%), 6.6% in Division II (up from 6.2%) and 6.3% in Division III (up from 5.9%).White people hold 84.1% of the men's head coaching positions in Division I, 85.2% in Division II and 89% in Division III. For women's teams, it's 80.6% white head coaches in Division I, 84.5% in Division II and 88.1% in Division III. Those figures represent slight decreases in all three divisions for both men’s and women’s teams.In all three divisions, white people made up 70.6% of the men’s basketball head coaches, 86.8% of the football head coaches and 92.8% of the baseball head coaches.Lapchick noted that the lack of racial and gender diversity within the athletic director ranks could play a part in the lack of diversity among coaches overall, since athletic directors do much of the hiring.“I’m not saying they’re all racist or sexist,"" Lapchick said. ""I’m just saying that the likelihood is they’re going to continue to move within the circles that they’ve moved in, and that’s overwhelmingly going to be white men.”Almost 25% of Division I men's basketball head coaches were Black, up from 24.3% in 2020-21 but short of the record high of 25.2% in 2005-06. Black student-athletes made up 52.4% of the Division I men’s basketball rosters.“An ideal goal ... is to be representative of the student-athletes that are playing, or at least close to that,” Lapchick said. “We’re not close to that.”TIDES gave the the NCAA’s national office a B-minus for racial diversity and an A-plus for gender diversity in senior leadership and professional positions.“Our marks are reflective of an intentional effort to develop an inclusive culture that recognizes and values organizational excellence,"" said Felicia Martin, the NCAA senior vice president of inclusion, education and community engagement. ""By now, the importance of diversity in leadership is clear. When organizations embrace diversity, equity and inclusion, the data supports better company culture.”Lapchick said the next step is to get NCAA member schools to have a similar level of diversity as the national office.“It’s a parallel to pro sports, where the league offices all do well, and then with the individual teams, the grades go down pretty dramatically,” Lapchick said. “If the schools follow the national office’s hiring practices, we’d have much more diverse leadership positions, including coaches, at the college level.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843831,DeSantis to expand 'Don't Say Gay' law to all grades,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration is moving to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades, expanding the controversial law critics call “Don't Say Gay” as the Republican governor continues to focus on cultural issues ahead of his expected presidential run.The proposal, which would not require legislative approval, is scheduled for a vote next month before the state Board of Education and has been put forward by the state Education Department, both of which are led by appointees of the governor.The rule change would ban lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity from grades 4 to 12, unless required by existing state standards or as part of reproductive health instruction that students can choose not to take. The initial law that DeSantis championed last spring bans those lessons in kindergarten through the third grade. The change was first reported by the Orlando Sentinel.DeSantis has leaned heavily into cultural divides on his path to an anticipated White House bid, with the Republican aggressively pursuing a conservative agenda that targets what he calls the insertion of inappropriate subjects in schools.Spokespeople for the governor’s office and the Education Department did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the proposal saying “It’s wrong, it’s completely, utterly wrong.” She called it “part of a disturbing and dangerous trend that we’re seeing across the nation” of targeting LGBTQ people.Last year's Parental Rights in Education Act drew widespread backlash nationally, with critics saying it marginalizes LGBTQ people and their presence in society. President Joe Biden called it “hateful.”DeSantis and other Republicans have repeatedly said the measure is reasonable and that parents, not teachers, should be broaching subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children.Critics of the law say its language — “classroom instruction,” “age appropriate” and “developmentally appropriate” — is overly broad and subject to interpretation. Consequently, teachers might opt to avoid the subjects entirely for fear of being sued, they say.The law also kicked off a feud between the state and Disney, one of the state's largest employers and political donors, after the entertainment giant publicly opposed the law and said it was pausing political donations in the state.At the governor’s request, the Republican-dominated Legislature voted to dissolve a self-governing district controlled by Walt Disney World over its properties in Florida, and eventually gave DeSantis control of the board. The move was widely seen as a punishment for the company opposing the law. The board oversees municipal services in Disney’s theme park properties and was instrumental in the company’s decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s.Disney later this year will host a large conference on LGBTQ workplace representation with the group Out & Equal, continuing a longstanding relationship with the organization.DeSantis has faced calls from at least one Republican presidential contender to go even further than the existing law, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley last month saying the prohibition could be more stringent and extended into later grades.The proposed rule change this year also signals the governor's willingness to bypass even the compliant state legislature and instead leverage state boards in order to accomplish his high-profile political goals. Late last year, at DeSantis' urging, state medical boards voted to ban children from receiving hormones or undergoing surgeries to treat gender dysphoria.“Everything he does is about what can further his own career ambitions,” said Brandon Wolf, press secretary for the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Florida. “And it's clear he see the anti-LGBTQ movement as his vehicle to get him where he wants to go.”___Associated Press reporter Aamer Madhani contributed from Washington.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843832,"Musicians fight threat of Tennessee anti-LGBTQ, drag bills","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — When Tennessee lawmakers passed legislation this month targeting drag performances and transgender youth, many musicians living and working in the state felt their community, their audiences and their artistic expressions were also under fire.The trend of conservative-led legislatures introducing laws limiting LGBTQ rights or using hateful rhetoric about trans people has led the tightly knit musical community in Tennessee to use their voices and songs to raise awareness and money, as well as encourage music fans to get out and vote.Love Rising, a concert held on Monday in Nashville, featured Grammy-winning artists like Sheryl Crow, Jason Isbell, Maren Morris, Hayley Williams and Brittany Howard alongside drag performers and trans and queer singer-songwriters. The following night, the effort continued with a second show, We Will Always Be, featuring a showcase of LGBTQ artists in collaboration with Black Opry.“No one is in danger from our community, from our beautiful greater rainbow coalition of those of us who identify as LGBTQ+ or a drag performer or trans or just a loving ally or just someone who enjoys music,” said Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Allison Russell, one of the organizers of Love Rising.LGBTQ people have long been a part of the state’s lucrative musical and entertainment industries and drag performers and shows have a storied history in Nashville and beyond.Artists like Reba McEntire, Dolly Parton and Elvis Presley have inspired — or been inspired by — drag performances for decades. Parton once told an interviewer that she entered a drag show alongside performers dressed like her — and lost. Nashville has a street named after drag queen Bianca Paige, who was an advocate for those living with HIV.But in a state that long championed its artistic and creative communities, some musicians now feel threatened by its laws. The bill that passed this year changes the definition of adult cabaret as “harmful to minors” and says that “male or female impersonators” now fall under adult cabaret, along with topless dancers and strippers.On Monday night backstage at the Love Rising concert, Adeem the Artist, a non-binary singer-songwriter living in East Tennessee, pointed to their flowery blouse and their plum-colored lipstick and wondered if their stage outfit would run afoul of the new law starting April 1.“I don’t always wear dresses, but I don’t even know if this is OK,” they said. “Am I allowed to wear lipstick? What does it mean to be dressed as the wrong gender?”Adeem explained that only a few weeks ago, they had been invited by the state to an event honoring songwriters. They politely declined.“You don’t honor me. You’re challenging my livelihood, you’re challenging the safety of my kid,” they said.The bill bans adult cabaret from public property or anywhere minors might be present. While the ACLU of Tennessee has said the bill does not directly prohibit drag performance and that drag is not inherently obscene, the intent still has had a chilling effect on performers. Drag artist Justine Van De Blair wondered if just walking from a venue to the parking lot where minors might see her would be cause for arrest.“I’m able to support myself. Drag is my creative outlet,” she said. “Unfortunately it’s so vague right now, we don’t know what’s going to happen.”At Love Rising, the drag artists earned some of the biggest cheers as they rallied the audiences in between musical sets with passionate speeches arguing that the bills were a harmful overreach of government and a fear-based campaign to roll back rights. They walked through the crowds to greet and take photos with fans, blowing air kisses and waving.The money raised at the concerts was directed to LGBTQ support organizations such as Tennessee Equality Project,Inclusion Tennessee, OUTMemphis and the Tennessee Pride Chamber. Donations were being matched by foundations created by Grammy-winner Brandi Carlile and the family of the late Nashville singer-songwriter John Prine.Artists have found other ways to show their opposition to the record number of anti-trans bills introduced last year, as well as other legal rulings regarding bodily autonomy. Rock band Yo La Tengo came out in drag during a recent tour stop in Nashville. Aaron Lee Tasjan, a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, is in the middle of working on his next record and wrote a song that reflects the “nightmare” that queer and trans people are experiencing.“I’m seeing people in a great amount of mental and emotional distress over it,” he said.Izzy Heltai, a pop singer-songwriter from Massachusetts, said he moved to Nashville recently because of the industry connections that were there. But he soon fell in love with the welcoming people and friends he met, which he found at odds with the state's politics. As a trans man who transitioned when he was in his teens, he called the bans on gender-affirming care for youth life-threatening for a population already at high risk for suicide.“There are a lot of kids that are going to die in the state because of these laws,” said Heltai, who played both benefit concerts. “It’s not theoretical anymore. It’s just that these laws are murdering people.""But even with the benefit shows, artists said the music industry in Nashville — still dominated by white men at the executive level and on the stages — should be doing more to support marginalized artists who are facing discrimination.Black Opry founder Holly G started her organization to give Black artists more opportunities to perform and grow their audiences because the mainstream country music industry was not willing to open those doors. Those barriers also exist for LGBTQ singers, musicians, songwriters, producers and others, she said.“The fight for racial equality is also the fight for LGBTQ+ equality,” she said. “We have to do all of that at the same time and together.”Backstage at the Bridgestone Arena, drag queen Cya Inhale said she initially thought that her drag community would have to stand alone, but has felt that ""the entire arts community in Nashville standing up saying, ‘No, that’s not OK.’”Besides, Inhale argued, drag and country music have often run in the same circles.“Do you think Dolly Parton is wearing all those rhinestones because a straight guy told her to? I don’t think so,” she said.___Follow Kristin M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843833,"For top-seeded Houston, basketball is a family affair","HOUSTON (AP) — Lauren Sampson remembers riding on the team bus in frigid winters as a preschooler during her father’s first head coaching job at Montana Tech, athletic tape affixed around the windows in a losing effort to stave off the cold.Her family told her the team’s games were her parties and let the little girl run the show.“They gave me a mic and I’d say: ‘Welcome,’” she recalled. “And then they would sew bells into my game dresses so they could hear me as I was wandering around.”Her younger brother, Kellen, remembers using Washington State facilities as his personal playground when dad ended up there a few years later. He once slipped into the UCLA locker room when the Bruins came to town — he was no older than 5 — and wasn’t discovered until coach Jim Herrick was midway through his pregame speech.“He looked at me and said: ‘Hey, little fella’s got to go,’” he said.Decades later, the siblings are at their father’s side and both play key roles on coach Kelvin Sampson’s staff as Houston makes a run at its first championship.Kellen Sampson is the team’s top assistant and Lauren Sampson is the director of basketball operations for the top-seeded Cougars (33-3), who meet No. 5 seed Miami in the Sweet 16 on Friday in Kansas City, Missouri.The 67-year-old Sampson has turned around the once-proud program in his nine years at the school on the edge of downtown Houston. The Cougars have risen to heights not seen since t he days of Hakeem Olajuwon and Phi Slama Jama and have become perennial championship contenders.Having Kellen and Lauren with him, he says, has made all the difference.“It’s probably why I’m here,” he said. “There’s not a day goes by that I don’t think how lucky I am to be working with my family.”The 40-year coaching veteran said having his children as part of a carefully cultivated staf has helped him last this long in the game. He once thought he had to do everything himself, now he delegates. And his children aren’t afraid to speak up.“Kellen and Lauren, they know my idiosyncrasies, they come back at me, they disagree with me,” he said. “They tell me no, they say: ‘that’s not the right way,’ and they just help me. They’ve made me better.”For Kellen Sampson, the path to where he is today was a linear one, as he knew from a young age exactly what he wanted to do: “I don’t know if I’ve spent a single second thinking about being anything other than this.”He talked with dad about his college options and the elder Sampson wasn’t shy with a suggestion.“The conversation was based on who do you think will prepare you to be the best college coach you can be,” Kellen Sampson said. “And he was really honest and said: ‘Look, I think I can prepare you to do that better than anybody.’ And I chose to play for him.”After playing at Oklahoma and beginning his career there, he took jobs elsewhere — away from his father — to build his own path before rejoining him at Houston in 2014.Lauren Sampson worked in sports for years before moving to pharmaceutical sales. It wasn’t long before dear old dad lured her back to the family business.“The first year that my dad was at Houston, my grandfather had just passed, and he had always been the first phone call after a game,” she said. “And that first season at Houston, for a lot of games, I turned into that phone call, and he would kind of ask me questions throughout that first season.”With her marketing background, he’d ask her what she would do to get more people at games, improve the arena atmosphere and other such scenarios. After a year of this back and forth he asked if she’d consider moving to Houston to work with him; in 2016, she did.The elder Sampson seems just as fierce and engaged as ever on the sidelines. But his children have seen a change in a man whose storied career includes baggage brought up every time his teams make a big run. There have been no such headaches at Houston.Just time with family, a lot of wins and more time for Coach Sampson with grandchildren Maisy and Kylen.“He doesn’t spend hardly any time worrying about things that don’t matter anymore,” Kellen Sampson said. “And that allows him to be my daughter’s best friend. That allows him to be my son’s favorite jungle gym.”“I think this is the most fun he’s ever had,” he added. “He’s not this big wound-up ball of stress. He allows himself to enjoy the journey way more now than he did 25 years ago, which is awesome. And I do think that the fact that we’re doing it as a family has given him more longevity.”It’s also given the Cougars an advantage aside from the Xs and Os of basketball as they look to make another deep tournament run after reaching the Final Four in 2021.“We all have so much love for each other,” star Marcus Sasser said. “From the coaching staff, the players, the managers, the trainers, everybody. Like this whole organization just love everybody. So, it’s like a big family, really.”Kellen Sampson, 37, has had opportunities to become a head coach elsewhere in recent years. But in the end took the advice of his wife, Tonya, who asked what job was worth giving up what the family has now.“'You’ve got the rest of your life to be a head coach. You’ve only got this small window to do it next to your dad and with your family,'"" he recounted. ""'Whatever you accomplish as a head coach on your own is going to pale in comparison to these memories you’re creating every day with your family.'”It’s hard not to look ahead to the Final Four next week and the possibility of Houston playing near home. Lauren Sampson, ever the coach’s kid who was there when her father took the Sooners to the Final Four in 2002 and was there two years ago, is cautious.“It’d be great, but I’ve been a part of two Final Four runs and God, it’s so hard,” she said. “Winning a game in the tournament is so, so hard. I never take for granted the work that goes into just one game. So, I very purposely don’t look past the next one up.”___March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843834,NWSL embarks on 11th season boosted by World Cup excitement,"The National Women's Soccer League embarks on its 11th season this weekend with players looking to capitalize on the excitement building ahead of the Women's World Cup while also trying to move on from the turbulence of the last two seasons.“It’s a big year of women’s soccer with the World Cup and a really exciting NWSL schedule and NWSL teams this year, so hopefully it stays that way,” OL Reign defender Alana Cook said. ""And hopefully the narrative can just be about that.”The pro women's league has been rocked for the past two seasons by a series of allegations of misconduct and abuse by coaches. The fallout has been a reckoning for soccer in the United States, with U.S. Soccer and the NWSL both having launched investigations into the scandals.The NWSL has put several programs in place to prevent abuse, including a reporting system and the professionalization of the league's human resource department, which visited every team in the preseason. All 12 teams must designate a player safety officer.Commissioner Jessica Berman said she's spoken with players who say they're exhausted from having to address the misconduct — they're ready to put the focus on the soccer. And it's a big year for the game because of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand starting on July 20.“I think it’s their hope that we at the league and through ownership and management can really take on the burden and work behind the scenes to offer the playing environment that meets the standard that certainly I’ve committed to, which is a place that makes the players proud to play,” Berman said.The Portland Thorns are the defending NWSL champions, having won their third league title with a 2-0 victory over the Kansas City Current last year.Portland is also among the favorites this season because of a loaded roster that includes national team players like Sophia Smith, Crystal Dunn and Becky Sauerbrunn. Smith was the NWSL's Most Valuable Player and also the title game MVP.“This is a special group. It's hard to put a word on what it is. I think it's the character of all the players. We all love each other, we're close and we trust each other,"" Smith said. ""It's a similar group coming back from last year so we know what it takes. And the new players, we've made clear what it takes. It's going to take all of us and it's going to take a lot of work but it's also an exciting and fun process.”RIDING THE WAVEThe San Diego Wave became the first expansion team to make the playoffs last season, paced by forward Alex Morgan with a league-leading 16 goals.The Wave also set an NWSL record for attendance at a standalone match when the club drew a sellout crowd of 32,000 to Snapdragon Stadium for a match against rival Angel City in September.“This team and club has high hopes and has just set the bar and we want to continue to do that with the home opener attendance record, and just continue on that run of of breaking records,” Morgan said.EXPANSIONThe NWSL this month announced its 13th team, a reboot of the Utah Royals.The first Royals team played from 2018-20 but folded when owner Dell Loy Hansen announced he was selling the Royals and Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake amid scandal. That Royals then became the Kansas City Current.As part of the deal to buy RSL, the new owners had rights for an NWSL expansion team. The new Royals will join the league next season.The league is expected to announce another expansion club in the San Francisco Bay Area for 2024, while another franchise is expected to be awarded to Boston in the future.NEW COACHESMike Norris was promoted to head coach of the Thorns after Rhian Wilkinson parted ways with the team because of inappropriate communication with a player. Sam Laity, an OL Reign assistant, has taken over at the Houston Dash, and Juan Carlos Amoros is now coach at Gotham.Seb Hines, an interim coach with the Orlando Pride for part of last season, earned the job outright in the offseason, and Mark Parsons, who coached the Washington Spirit from 2013-15, has returned to the club after stints with the Thorns and the Dutch national team.YOUTH MOVEMENTTeams are taking advantage of a new rule that opened the door for players younger than 18 to sign with league clubs.The Wave on Tuesday signed the league's youngest-ever player, 15-year-old Melanie Barcenas. At 15 years and 138 days, Barcenas is younger than Chloe Ricketts, who was 15 years and 283 days old when she signed with the Washington Spirit earlier this month. Olivia Moultrie was 15 years and 286 days when she signed with the Thorns in June 2021.Under the rule, young players must live with a parent or legal guardian until they're 18. They cannot be traded to another team without the consent of a parent or guardian.VARThe league is adding a video assistant referee this season to review certain plays, including goals and penalties.“This is a really big deal. Not just because we know that we have to, and are committed to elevating the officiating, the quality of officiating, in our game, and that it requires significant investment and our board has authorized that investment. But also because we are the first ever women’s professional league to commit to invest in VAR for the professionals,"" Berman said.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843835,Stylist Law Roach working on his health post-retirement,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Celebrity stylist Law Roach, who helped reinvent Zendaya and turned Celine Dion into a fashion icon, shocked the industry last week when he announced his retirement from dressing the rich and famous.“My Cup is empty,"" he wrote in part March 14 on Instagram, explaining: ""If this business was just about the clothes I would do it for the rest of my life but unfortunately it’s not! The politics, the lies and false narratives finally got me! You win … I’m out.”Without further clarification on the since-deleted post, the 44-year-old Roach followed up his huge red “RETIRED” graphic with a round of interviews, telling The Associated Press on Tuesday night: “I was just going through something and I just needed to, to release everything I was going through.”The retirement part, from celebrity styling at least, is real, he said on the red carpet at the Fashion Trust US Awards.“I felt like that was the best way for me to walk away from the industry for a while to just, you know, work on my mental, my mental health and my physical health,” Roach said.Over 13 years, Roach has dressed Kerry Washington, Anya Taylor-Joy, Megan Thee Stallion, Ariana Grande, Dion and many other top celebrities. He helped transition Zendaya from Disney kid to grownup A-lister and the two enjoy a close bond.After the Oscars, just two days before his surprise retirement announcement, Roach put Ann Demeulemeester in a tiny white feather top for the Vanity Fair afterparty and worked with several others on Hollywood's big night. He won't be dressing anybody for the upcoming Met Gala in May after years of having his hand in on fashion's biggest night.Roach, a rare Black stylist in Hollywood, has also been a judge on television's “Legendary” and was named the Council of Fashion Designers of America's inaugural stylist of the year in 2022.He told the AP the decision to step back from celebrity styling was a hard one that “took a lot of courage and I’m actually proud of myself that for the first time in years, I put myself first.”Roach said the industry has rallied around him.“I've had nothing but good support and comments. So it's making this transition a little bit easier for me,” he said.Roach earlier told Vogue he's not stepping away from fashion altogether. He walked as a model for Boss at a Miami show soon after dropping his retirement news.Personal tragedy, Roach told The Cut, has taken a toll on his life. In 2021, his 3-year-old nephew fell to his death from a 17th floor window in Chicago.“I had only been able to see him three times in his whole life. Not being able to ever know who he would be, I was on the verge of suicide, honestly. The guilt of not being in his life enough and not really knowing him enough had put me into a really dark depression,” he said.As a Black stylist in Hollywood, Roach told The Cut, fighting white nepotism in the early days was a struggle.“It's so strong because these stylists, these white female stylists, they grew up with these white publicists and agents,” he said. ""It’s this network that I was able to penetrate.”So what's next?“I just wanna breathe. I wanna fly. I wanna be happy,” Roach said. ""I wanna figure other things out.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843836,"Mississippi initiative proposal, minus abortion, in limbo","JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Senate leaders are not saying whether they will support a new initiative process that would allow voters to put proposed state laws — but nothing dealing with abortion — on the ballot.Senators face a Thursday deadline. They could accept a House proposal to create a new process, which appears unlikely. They could seek final negotiations between the two Republican-controlled chambers. Or they could let the issue die during a year when most lawmakers are seeking reelection.On Wednesday, Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and a key senator would not tell reporters whether they will keep the issue alive. Hosemann said he and other Senate leaders are making “good progress,"" but he would not specify what that meant.Senate Accountability, Efficiency and Transparency Committee Chairman John Polk, a Republican from Hattiesburg, said he is talking to Hosemann and Senate colleagues about the House proposal.“I’ve got a lot of thinking to do and reading and talking to people,” Polk said. “I’m not doing it in a vacuum.""In May 2021, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the state's previous initiative process, which had been in place since the 1990s, was outdated and invalid because it required initiative sponsors to gather an equal number of signatures from five old congressional districts. Mississippi went from five districts to four after the 2000 Census because of slow population growth, but legislators never updated the initiative process.Since the court ruling, Mississippi residents have been unable to petition to put issues up for statewide votes.Proposals being considered this year would require petition sponsors to gather an equal number of signatures from the four congressional districts.In February, the Senate voted to require signatures from 12% of the state’s registered voters as of the last presidential election. That would be about 240,000 signatures.In early March, the House voted to require the same number of signatures as the previous initiative process — at least 12% of the total votes in the most recent gubernatorial election. That would be about 106,000 signatures. Polk said Wednesday he is unwilling to accept that part of the House proposal.The prohibition on abortion initiatives was added by the House, and Polk said Wednesday: “I don't have a problem with that.”The U.S. Supreme Court used a Mississippi case last June to upend abortion rights nationwide, and Mississippi now bans most abortions.In 2011, Mississippi voters rejected a personhood initiative, which would have defined life as beginning at conception. That surprised many abortion rights opponents, including Republican Phil Bryant, who was elected governor the same day the initiative failed. Bryant had said days earlier that if voters were to reject the life-at-conception initiative, “Satan wins.”Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling in June, voters in six states have either expanded or protected existing abortion rights through ballot initiatives. Kansas protected abortion rights in August, and five other states have either enshrined those rights or rejected constitutional restrictions on abortion.The resolution to create a new Mississippi initiative process would allow proposed laws to go on the ballot. The previous process allowed initiatives to propose state constitutional amendments.Once a constitutional amendment is approved, any attempt to revise or repeal it would need to go back on the statewide ballot for voters to consider. Changing a state law is simpler: That can be done by a majority vote in the Mississippi Legislature.____Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843837,Princeton's journey becomes face of March Madness' COVID era,"Princeton forward Tosan Evbuomwan spent his first three college seasons enduring one disappointment after another.Reaching the NCAA Tournament and advancing to the Sweet 16 made it all worthwhile.After the 2020 Ivy League Tournament was canceled, after the entire 2020-21 season was canceled, after losing by two points in the conference's 2022 tourney title game and after watching three friends transfer just to keep playing in 2022-23, this resilient 6-foot-8 Brit has taken the Tigers on their deepest NCAA Tournament run since 1967 and has emerged as survivor of one of college basketball's strangest journeys.“I think it did start with that COVID year,"" Evbuomwan said. ”There was a togetherness with that group. One of my favorite things about that time was the Zooms with one another, the Face Times, just talking about what we wanted the next season. We wanted a championship.""Now, the Ivy League tourney champions are the talk of the nation and an illustration of the impact two pivotal COVID years have had on the college basketball world.Nobody outside the Princeton locker room expected this run — especially when three of last year's top five scorers left to take advantage of the NCAA's extra season. League rules allowed them only to use that season at a non-conference school.But these Tigers pride themselves on perseverance. So instead of allowing the obstacles to derail their dreams or steal their spirit, they dug in, stuck around, forged a bond and finished the job.“We missed out on a whole year. That hurt, watching essentially every other team in the country play,"" Princeton guard Matt Allocco said. ""But I think it actually helped us in the long run. We were able to get together in the spring and practice, be with each other, build those relationships. It ended up being a great experience.”Not everyone remembers the COVID years fondly.San Diego State and Dayton saw their 2020 title hopes dashed by the NCAA's announcement. Michigan State coach Tom Izzo thought he had a Final Four team, too.Northern Kentucky coach Darrin Horn's long-awaited return to March Madness was extended by three more years, prompting him to acknowledge two weeks ago that winning the 2020 Horizon League crown almost seemed like it never happened.There's no way to replace what was lost — even for this year's 16 regional semifinalists.Just ask San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher, whose team faces top-seeded Alabama on Friday in the Louisville Regional. The Aztecs were supposed to be a top-two seed three years ago.""As I said all those years ago, as good as Malachi Flynn and KJ Feagin and Yanni Wetzell were, they never played in the NCAA Tournament one time in their careers. That’s unbelievable,"" Dutcher said. ""Sometimes we take for granted just going and losing in the first round. Just to have a chance to play would have meant the world to those guys so I feel bad for that, that they never got a taste of March Madness.”Meanwhile, at Creighton, it was a different scenario.In 2021, the tourney provided the Bluejays with a bittersweet memory: Celebrating their first Sweet 16 appearance since 1974 inside the lonely Indianapolis “bubble.”So when sixth-seeded Creighton knocked off third-seeded Baylor 85-76 last weekend to return to the Sweet 16, something suddenly felt far more satisfying about Friday's matchup against 15th-seeded Princeton in Louisville.“We had a lot of fans there to celebrate at the end of the game with us (in Denver) and then you go back to the hotel with family and friends and have a chance to celebrate rather than go back to your room and eat another piece of rubber chicken out of a Styrofoam box, which is what we did in Indianapolis,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “To get to the Sweet 16 is a difficult thing to do, it was just a little more fun to celebrate that particular night.""What about 2021 national champion Baylor? Of course, the Bears had no complaints.Kansas State coach Jerome Tang was an assistant on that title team and has used the lessons from that run as the model for his third-seeded Wildcats, who take on Izzo's seventh-seeded Spartans on Thursday at Madison Square Garden.Tang believes the similarities in roster composition will help Kansas State this weekend.“We spent 30 days in the ‘bubble,’ right? And if you don’t like each other, nobody wants to spend that amount of time together,” Tang said. “That team, we really liked each other. We loved being together. I mean, it was fun to be around them. I feel the same way around these guys. We could be in a bubble for 30 days and we’ll be just fine. We’re going to have a great time.”But nobody will have more fun than Princeton.Just two years after watching everyone else's games, the Tigers need two wins to end a 48-year Final Four drought, two wins to become the first Ivy League team in the national semifinals since Penn in 1979 and two wins to cement their status as one of the greatest and most compelling advance-and-survive stories in tourney history.And it might not have happened without Princeton's COVID experience.“Having to watch those games on TV, the tournament, hurt. I think looking back on it, it fueled us for the next year,” Princeton guard Ryan Langborg said. ""I think this year, this Sweet 16 run so far, it’s more than making up for it.”___AP Sports Writers Dan Gelston in Philadelphia, Josh Dubow in San Francisco, Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Bernie Wilson in San Diego, Larry Lage in Detroit and Eric Olson in Omaha, Nebraska, also contributed to this report.___AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843838,GM to stop making the Camaro but a successor may be in works,"DETROIT (AP) — The Chevrolet Camaro, for decades the dream car of many teenage American males, is going out of production.General Motors, which sells the brawny muscle car, said Wednesday it will stop making the current generation early next year.The future of the car, which is raced on NASCAR and other circuits, is a bit murky. GM says another generation may be in the works.“While we are not announcing an immediate successor today, rest assured, this is not the end of Camaro's story,” Scott Bell, vice president of Chevrolet, said in a statement.The current sixth-generation Camaro, introduced in 2016, has done well on the racetrack, but sales have been tailing off in recent years. When the current generation Camaro came out in 2016, Chevrolet sold 72,705 of them. But by the end of 2021 that number fell almost 70% to 21,893. It rebounded a bit last year to 24,652.GM said last of the 2024 model year of the cars will come off the assembly line in Lansing, Michigan, in January.Spokesman Trevor Thompkins said he can't say anything more about a future Camaro. “We're not saying anything specific right now,” he said.If GM revives the Camaro, it almost certainly will be electric, said Stephanie Brinley, an associate director with S&P Global Mobility. “It would be unlikely to see another internal combustion engine vehicle,” she said.GM has said it plans to sell only electric passenger vehicles worldwide by 2035.Brinley said the push to sell more electric vehicles makes it likely that all new muscle cars will be powered by batteries. But if there's still a mixed combustion and battery fleet on sale in 2030 or 2040, some gas-powered muscle cars could survive.Thompkins said GM has an understanding with auto-racing sanctioning bodies that the sixth-generation car can continue racing. GM will have parts available and the Camaro body will stay on the race track, he said.NASCAR said that because the Generation 6 Camaro was in production when GM originally got permission to race, it remains qualified to race in NASCAR Cup and NASCAR Xfinity Series races.GM will offer a collector's edition package of the 2024 Camaro RS and SS in North America, and a limited number of high-performance ZL-1 Camaros. The collector's edition cars will have ties to the first-generation Camaro from the 1960s and its GM code name “Panther,” the company said without giving specifics.GM's move comes as traditional gas-powered muscle cars are starting to be phased out due to strict government fuel economy regulations, concerns about climate change and an accelerating shift toward electric vehicles.Stellantis, will stop making gas versions of the Dodge Challenger and Charger and the Chrylser 300 big sedan by the end of this year. But the company has plans to roll out a battery-powered Charger performance car sometime in 2024.Electric cars, with instant torque and a low center of gravity, often are faster and handle better than internal combustion vehicles.Stellantis, formed in 2021 by combining Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot, earlier this week announced the last of its special edition muscle cars, the 1,025 horsepower Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170. The company says the car can go from zero to 60 mph (97 kilometers per hour) in 1.66 seconds, making it the fastest production car on the market.In addition, Ford rolled out a new version of its Mustang sports car in September.The Camaro was first introduced in 1966, two years after Ford's wildly popular Mustang.GM retired the Camaro nameplate in 2002, but revived it as a new 2010 model with hopes of appealing to enthusiasts and younger buyers. The 2010 version was similar to its predecessors, with a long, flat front and side “gills” that evoke the original, while still sporting a modern overall design._____AP Auto Racing Writer Jenna Fryer contributed from Charlotte, North Carolina.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843839,NHL players: Crosby most complete; McDavid tops for clutch,"Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby continues being regarded by his peers as the NHL’s most complete player, though he takes a backseat to Edmonton’s Connor McDavid in having the best chance to produce in the clutch.Those are among the findings in the National Hockey League Players’ Association releasing its sixth annual and eighth overall survey of players on Wednesday. Overall, 625 players participated in answering 14 questions.Crosby, a two-time regular-season and two-time playoff MVP, earned just over 30% of the vote in the most complete player category which he’s now won or shared first place for a fourth consecutive year. Boston’s Patrice Bergeron, with 18.8% of the vote, and Florida’s Aleksander Barkov (17.1%), finished in the top three for a fourth straight year, with McDavid ranking fourth.The tables turned when it came to McDavid — who is running away with the NHL points race — earning 59.3% of the vote in who players would want next to them in a must-win situation, with Crosby finishing second (11%).In other categories, for the second straight year, Tampa Bay’s Andrei Vasilevskiy gained 314 votes as being the preferred choice among players on who they would want in net in a must-win situation. Colorado’s Cale Makar, last year’s Norris Trophy winner, was the runaway leader as top defenseman, earning nearly 64% of the vote, with Tampa Bay’s Victor Hedman second (11%).Edmonton’s Leon Draisaitl was regarded as the NHL’s best passer. Newly acquired New York Rangers forward Patrick Kane finished second in the best passer category, while being voted as the league’s top stickhandler for a third straight year.Dallas Stars veteran Joe Pavelski, with 21.4% of the vote, beat out the Rangers’ Chris Kreider (14.6%) as the player who affects the game most around the net.Barkov, a seven-time 20-goal scorer, was regarded as the league’s most underrated player.For a second straight year, Boston’s Brad Marchand was voted as the person players least want to face, but want on their team.As for the NHL’s best ice surface, Montreal’s Bell Centre won out for a fifth time with 35% of the vote, followed by Edmonton (14.7%), Winnipeg (10.3%), Minnesota (8.6%) and Vegas (6%).And there was a split regarding which current or former women's players that NHLers would like to play alongside, with Canada’s Marie-Philip Poulin gaining 27.9% of the vote, ahead of American Hilary Knight (20.5%).In off-ice categories:— Las Vegas (31.7%) was the preferred road city players most enjoy having a day off, followed by New York (16.4%) and Sunrise, Florida (11.8%).— Minnesota goalie Marc-Andre Fleury earned 3.8% of the vote as being the best locker room guy, followed by Vegas' Phil Kessel, Philadelphia’s Kevin Hayes and Arizona’s Jakub Voracek, who each finished at 2.7%.— And Toronto’s Auston Matthews was voted as the NHL player with the best shoe style at 9.1%, ahead of Boston’s David Pastrnak (3.4%).___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

(AP) — Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose testimony against his own gang helped convict two high-ranking members, was assaulted by several people at a gym in Florida, officials said Wednesday.An “altercation between several individuals"" brought Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies to an LA Fitness outlet in Lake Worth on Tuesday night, the sheriff's office said in a social media post.The assault left the rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, with several injuries. He was taken to a hospital but his injuries were not considered life-threatening, officials said.A motive for the assault, including whether it was connected to his cooperation with prosecutors, was unclear. No arrests have been made, and investigators have asked anyone with information to contact them.The rapper's attorney, Lance Lazzaro, did not respond to an email from The Associated Press. But he told other news outlets that Hernandez was attacked by three or four people in the gym's sauna.Tekashi 6ix9ine, known for his rainbow-colored hair and “69” tattoo on his forehead, previously faced decades in prison as part of a racketeering case in wich he was accused of using a violent gang as a “personal hit squad.”Instead, his sentence was reduced to about two years after his testimony against the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, earning him a label as a “snitch.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843841,Review: Despair in Jersey in Zach Braff’s ‘A Good Person’,"All filmmakers should be so lucky to have Florence Pugh in their movies. She so consistently delivers the best version of whatever she’s handed — whether good, mediocre or downright preposterous — that you may even start to wonder if the quality of the film around her really matters in the end. It does, of course, but her performances make whatever she’s in difficult to dismiss wholly.In Zach Braff’s “ A Good Person,” Pugh is a New Jersey 20-something named Allison whose life is upended in a flash. On her way to try on wedding dresses in the city, she's involved in an accident that leaves her future sister- and brother-in-law dead and her addicted to opioid painkillers.Braff wrote the part specifically for her. The two dated for three years, a relationship that was scrutinized by many onlookers for their 21-year age difference, which she often defended. Last year, they quietly broke up.In the past several years, Braff has suffered significant losses — his sister, his father, one of his best friends. He is an actor and filmmaker who has directed only four features, including his debut “Garden State,” which — however it may have aged 19 years later — was promising and captured a moment for a specific white hipster set.Now in his mid-40s and a lifetime away from sitcom fame and indie-darling debuts, Braff still has that spark and promise. This time, he wanted to write about grief, which was the birth of “A Good Person,” an ensemble piece about tragedy, mourning, addiction, forgiveness and people who keep messing up despite their best intentions.It takes him back to a familiar area — suburban New Jersey — and themes (aimlessness and prescription painkillers), but broadens the demographics and scope. And it is so earnestly done, with genuinely good writing and performances, that it seems unduly cruel to nitpick. But, even after reading interviews and Braff’s statements, it’s still a bit baffling why, with all his lived experience, he has chosen to tell this story about these people.Allison is just one part of the equation. The other is her fiance Nathan (Chinaza Uche) and what remains of his family: His 10-years-sober, Vietnam veteran, cop father Daniel (Morgan Freeman) and his orphaned teenage niece Ryan (Celeste O’Connor). What would be a normal teenage rebellion has curdled under the unfathomable rage and sorrow of having suddenly lost both parents. Daniel is out of his depth trying to care for her, while Nathan is largely absent.“A Good Person” seems to belong to a uniquely Dan Fogelman-esque subgenre of hyper sincere melodrama that sometimes clicks (“This Is Us”) and other times does not (“Life Itself”). Braff’s film is worlds better than “Life Itself,” but there are some similarities in how it strives for cosmic significance and ultimate tearjerking within a construct that the film tries to sell as authentically specific. In execution, it’s a bit more strained and contrived.Allison is a good character for an actor. She’s one that was clearly written out of love for the woman he knew would be playing her, allowing Pugh to cry, to sing (the Velvet Underground’s “After Hours”), to be funny high and depressing high, to be delusional and selfish in one moment and relatable and true in the next.When Allison finally decides to seek help, she ends up at the same Alcoholics Anonymous meeting as Daniel. She tries to flee, but he encourages her to stay and the two develop a tenuous friendship leading to some nice moments between Pugh and Freeman, who has his own world of regret and guilt to grapple with. This is borderline believable, but things really go off the rails (there is also a forced model train set metaphor) when Allison and Ryan develop their own ill-advised relationship.“A Good Person” at times feels overstuffed with misery and despair, and oddly decides to fast-forward through the recovery part with a montage and a song. There are cliches (woman on the edge cutting her hair in the mirror) and curious choices (not nearly enough is made of a statutory rape incident) and a very contrived climax. Sometimes it feels like maybe this is a story that could have been better served by a series than a too-long feature (it’s telling that I haven’t even mentioned that Allison’s mom is played by Molly Shannon or that her AA sponsor is Zoe Lister-Jones).And yet there are enough moments of grace and threads that defy the obvious cliche to keep you interested, even if you're not wholly buying or invested in every character. Who doesn’t want to be told that you’re never in too deep to start over, to apologize, to forgive or to be honest with yourself and others?“A Good Person,” an MGM release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for “drug abuse, some sexual references, language throughout.” Running time: 125 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.___MPA Definition of R: Restricted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843842,AP source: Browns bringing back LB Walker on 1-year deal,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Free agent linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. is returning to the Browns after missing most of last season with an injury that rocked Cleveland's defense, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Walker has agreed to a one-year contract with the Browns, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal hasn't been signed.The 27-year-old Walker tore a quadriceps tendon in Week 3 against the Pittsburgh Steelers and missed the rest of 2022. Without him, Cleveland's defense not only lost an experienced player but one of its top communicators and leaders.ESPN first reported Walker's return.Walker posted a photo on Twitter of himself on the field with the Browns with the caption: Nobody cares; WORK Harder!!""The Browns sustained a rash of injuries at linebacker last season with Walker, Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and Jacob Phillips all suffering season-ending injuries. Those losses along with some other problems led to Cleveland's 7-10 record and led to the firing of coordinator Joe Woods, who has been replaced by former Lions coach Jim Schwartz.Walker signed with the Browns in 2021 as a free agent and started 12 games after spending four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. After getting hurt, Walker stayed around the Browns while undergoing therapy to support his younger teammates.Cleveland has focused primarily on fixing its defense during free agency with several prominent signings, including tackle Dalvin Tomlinson, end Ogbonnia Okoronkwo and safety Juan Thornhill.The Browns also re-signed linebacker Sione Takitaki, who stepped in and played well following the other injuries.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/23,,World

They end the regular season on April 9 at Phoenix, a team they could meet in the first round of the playoffs, which begin six days later.Even if George recovers before the playoff opener, he'll need time to get back in the swing after not seeing game action for a couple of weeks.George got hurt after going down hard late in a 101-100 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night. His knee made contact with the Thunder's Luguentz Dort, who was going for a rebound with 4:38 remaining.George needed help to leave the court, appearing unable to put any weight on his right leg, and once inside the tunnel he was carried to the locker room. He later left the arena on a cart with his right leg extended.“Appreciate y'all,” George tweeted Wednesday.Losing George for any length of time would be a major blow to the Clippers. He is averaging 23.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.1 assists for a team that has championship aspirations.The Clippers did not practice Wednesday.Asked Tuesday night how the team would adjust without George, Kawhi Leonard said: “Next man up. We've got a group of guys that still want to win and like to play basketball, so we'll see what happens.”The 32-year-old George has been out for extended periods of time in his career because of major injuries.He sprained his right elbow in December 2021. A couple of weeks later, the Clippers said he suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow. He was out for three months and returned to play the final few weeks of the season.George had twin surgeries in his right and left shoulders in spring 2019 while with Oklahoma City. A few months later, he was traded to the Clippers and missed the first 11 games of the 2019-20 season while recovering.Leonard suffered a partial ACL tear in his right knee during the 2021 Western Conference semifinals and didn't return. The Clippers recovered and advanced to the conference finals for the first time in franchise history before losing to Phoenix in six games.Leonard missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from the ACL injury. Without him, the Clippers went 42-40 and lost in the play-in tournament.He has been mostly healthy this season, although the team regularly gives Leonard games off to rest as part of his load management.The Clippers already are without reserve Norman Powell, whose shoulder injury could keep him out at least until next week.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843846,Credit card debt is at record high as Fed raises rates again,"NEW YORK (AP) — As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again, credit card debt is already at a record high, and more people are carrying debt month to month.The Fed’s interest rate increases are meant to fight inflation, but they’ve also led to higher annual percentage rates (APRs) for people with credit card debt, which means they pay more in interest. The Fed announced Wednesday that it would increase rates another quarter of a point.With inflation still high, people are leaning on their credit cards more for everyday purchases.“It’s the economy, inflation, gas prices, and food costs,” said Lance DeJesus, 46, kitchen manager at the Golden Corral in York, Pennsylvania. “A year ago, you could go to the grocery store with a hundred bucks and come out with a bunch of bags. Now, I come out with just one bag.”DeJesus said he carries a credit card balance of roughly $2,600 from month to month over several cards, which have interest rates from 16.99% to 21.99%.Early in the pandemic, when DeJesus lost his job, he said that unemployment payments, stimulus checks, and child tax credits (which went to his household via his wife, who has three children) all helped him stay afloat. Now, with COVID-era emergency relief and stimulus policies ending, he uses credit for emergencies.He’s not alone: 46% of people are carrying debt from month to month, up from 39% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com, an online financial information site.Bankrate says the average credit card interest rate, or annual percentage rate, has reached 20.4% — the highest since their tracking began in the mid-1980s.A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 35% of U.S. adults report that their household debt is higher than it was a year ago. Just 17% say it has decreased.Roughly 4 in 10 adults in households making under $100,000 a year say their debt is up, compared with about a quarter in households making more than that. About half of Black and Hispanic adults say their household debt has increased, compared with about 3 in 10 white adults.Data also shows more people are now falling behind on payments, according to Bankrate analyst Greg McBride. He sees this as evidence of a so-called “K-shaped recovery” from the pandemic, in which the distance between the haves and the have-nots grows larger.“The more than half who pay in full each month are clearly doing a lot better than the almost half who don’t,” McBride said. “Those who tend to carry balances tend to be younger people, people making lower incomes, and those with lower credit scores. Another factor contributing to rising debt is inflation, which means the cost of day-to-day living is outpacing paychecks.”Typically, on a national scale, it takes something pretty extraordinary for credit card balances to fall, economists agree. The Great Recession, beginning in 2008, and COVID, beginning in 2020, are two periods when they fell sharply.During the early pandemic, credit card debt dipped 17%, Bankrate said — thanks in part to stimulus programs, emergency relief, and a decrease in consumer spending.But in the last three months of 2022, credit card balances in the U.S. increased $61 billion to $986 billion, surpassing the pre-pandemic high of $927 billion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Using a credit card can provide protections for people who can pay off the balance every month. But the cost for those who can't is high.“What’s not good is carrying balances, paying interest, and falling behind,” McBride said. ""No one wants to be paying 20% every month.""For Gary Deuvall, 68, of Walls, Mississippi, who worked servicing and repairing motorcycles, stimulus checks brought some financial relief even though the pandemic hurt his business.Now retired and on Social Security, Deuvall and his wife still have some credit card debt, he said, “in the five figures,” but they've also transferred that balance to a zero percent interest card to help contend with high rates.Zero percent interest offers are generally available only for a limited period, sometimes up to 21 months, and banks sometimes charge a flat fee, such as 3% of the balance transferred.“We'd hoped to build or buy a house,” Deuvall said. “But interest rates are so high, that's on pause. Meanwhile, I'll just rent.""Dan Stokes, 31, a special education teacher based in Richmond, Virginia, said that a pause on student loan payments that began during the pandemic has helped him make ends meet, but he still carries about $8,000 in credit card debt from month to month across at least three cards.Of that, Stokes said he’s moved about $1,200 to a zero percent interest card for the next twelve months.“Honestly, it feels really good that I don’t have to make those student debt payments at the moment,” he said of the emergency policy, which has been extended until the summer. “My pay as a teacher hasn’t kept up with inflation, so there are times when I’m swiping my credit cards just to get by and make it through.”Credit card rates are one of the fastest ways higher interest rates hit consumers.“Most car loans and mortgages are fixed-rate. So if you’re new to the market, it has a big effect, but if you have an existing loan, it’s not affecting you,"" McBride said. ""With credit cards, the higher interest rate gets passed through pretty much right away.”___The poll of 1,081 adults was conducted Mar. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Maura Healey issued a written statement citing guidance from the state board overseeing pharmacies that says they must maintain “a continuous, sufficient supply of all family planning medications, including mifepristone, misoprostol, emergency contraception, and contraceptive prescriptions.”Misoprostol is also used as an abortion drug.Healey said Massachusetts will always protect abortion access.“At a time when states are rushing to ban medication abortion and some pharmacies are irresponsibly restricting access to it, we are reminding Massachusetts pharmacies that they have an obligation to provide critical reproductive health medications,"" Healey said in the statement.Medical abortion is the country’s most common method for ending pregnancies. Massachusetts in 2020 passed a law expanding access to abortion in the state.If U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk rules against the Food and Drug Administration in the Texas cases, it’s unclear how quickly access to mifepristone could be curtailed. Revoking or suspending approval of a drug after more than 20 years would also be an unprecedented challenge to the agency.More than a dozen states banned abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.Healey said yielding to what she described as “coercive tactics” will further “strip pregnant people of their agency and rights and will violate the responsibility of pharmacies and pharmacy departments to provide critical healthcare services.”",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843850,What the Fed rate increase means for your credit card bill,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve raised its key rate by another quarter point Wednesday, bringing it to the highest level in 15 years as part of an ongoing effort to ease inflation by making borrowing more expensive.If you have money to save, you’ll probably earn a bit more interest on it, but the increase will make it even costlier to borrow for homes, autos and other purchases. The interest rate increase comes at a time when credit card debt is at record levels.Here's what the increase means for your credit card bill and what you can do if you're carrying debt:HOW DOES THE FED DECISION AFFECT CREDIT CARD DEBT?The Federal Reserve doesn't directly dictate how much interest you pay on your credit card debt. But the Fed's rate is the basis for your bank’s “prime rate."" In combination with other factors, such as your credit score, the prime rate helps determine the Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, on your credit card.The latest increase will likely raise the APR on your credit card 0.25%. So, if you have a 20.4% rate, which is the average according to Bankrate, it might increase to 20.65%.If you don't carry a balance from month to month, the APR is less important.But if, for example, you have a $4,000 credit balance and your interest rate is 20%, if you only make a fixed payment of $110 per month, it would take you a bit under five years to pay off your credit card debt and you would pay approximately $2,200 in interest.If your APR increases by a percentage point, paying off your balance would take two months longer and cost an additional $215.HOW DO I FIND OUT THE APR ON MY CREDIT CARD?Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, said that knowing the Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, on your card is an important first step for anyone looking to get out of credit card debt.“If you are carrying a balance month to month, that balance just got more expensive,” she said.To figure out your APR, you can log in to your online banking account, look at your financial statement, or call the number on the back of your credit card, Alev says.WHAT DO I DO IF MY APR IS HIGH?After that, both Alev and analyst Greg McBride of Bankrate.com advise signing up for a credit card that offers a zero percent interest or low interest balance transfer promotion. These allow you to transfer your higher interest credit card debt to a low interest credit card, and some offer promotions up to 21 months.Banks do sometimes charge a flat fee, such as 3% of the balance transferred.“It doesn’t make sense to pay 20% in interest just to get 2% in cash back,” McBride said. “Put your interest rate first and pursue rewards once you’re debt-free.”Other debt payoff strategies include taking a low-rate personal loan as a form of consolidation and pursuing a debt management plan offered by a reputable nonprofit credit counseling agency such as Money Management International, he said.HOW CAN I REDUCE MY CREDIT CARD DEBT?If your income just covers your necessities, reducing credit card debt can be challenging. Elena Pelayo, educator at How Money Works, a financial literacy organization, recommends that even if you live paycheck to paycheck, you might want to add at least $10 above the minimum payment of your credit card with the highest interest rate.And if you can afford it, she recommends paying 10% more than the minimum payment per month.A well-known payment method is the “ debt snowball ” where you pay down your debts from smallest to largest, to build momentum and good habits. Once the smaller debts are paid off and you have built a habit of paying off debt, the money you were used to putting aside every month can then go toward larger debts. NerdWallet offers a calculator to use this method.Another small way to tackle debt is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’s recommendation to “use cash when it’s under $20” to avoid overspending on your credit card.___Find all of AP's financial wellness coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/financial-wellness___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843851,Red Cross says violence displaced more Colombians in 2022,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The number of internally displaced people in Colombia increased significantly last year as several armed groups fought for control of rural pockets of the country, the Red Cross said Wednesday.In its annual assessment of humanitarian challenges in the South American country, the organization said that while confrontations between Colombia’s army and rebel groups decreased last year, fighting among rebel groups continues to take a heavy toll on civilians.Some communities are increasingly being affected by landmines, death threats and attacks on health workers, the humanitarian group said.The Red Cross’s findings come as Colombia’s recently elected leftist President Gustavo Petro tries to broker cease-fire agreements with rebel groups who are fighting for control of illegal mines, drug trafficking routes and other resources abandoned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, following their 2016 peace deal with the government.The peace deal ended five decades of conflict in which more than 450,000 people were killed, but it was also followed by power struggles between smaller groups in remote stretches of the country. They include the resource-rich Choco province and a region that is carpeted with coca fields near the border with Venezuela.“The situation is complex, and it will take time” for it to improve, said Lorenzo Caraffi, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Colombia.He noted however, that Colombia’s current conflict “is not comparable” to what the country was experiencing two decades ago, when rebel groups staged regular attacks on police stations in small towns, while bombings and kidnappings affected thousands of people in cities like Bogota and Medellin.However, some indicators suggest that violence is increasing.According to the Red Cross’ 2022 report more than 123,000 people had to flee their homes in rural areas last year to escape conflict, a 60% increase from 2021. An estimated 39,000 people were confined in their villages for days or weeks, due to threats from armed groups.The humanitarian group said that 515 people in the country were injured by landmines and other explosive devices, a 5% increase from 2021.Caraffi said that the Red Cross is currently monitoring seven conflicts in Colombia that include the conflict between the Colombian army and the National Liberation Army, but also fighting between two rebel organizations led by former FARC fighters who gave up on the 2016 peace deal.He said that while political solutions are found to these conlicts it is important for humanitarian organizations to carry out impartial work, and have access to affected communities.“War is an unhappy, cruel and sad reality” Caraffi said. “In this reality we are asking armed groups to respect international humanitarian law, so that communities don’t suffer from this situation.”",2023/03/23,,World

The $100,000 payment is due by April 15, he said.Separately, Baldwin and weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed are confronting felony involuntary manslaughter charges in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in October 2021.Authorities say Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed have pleaded not guilty, and an evidentiary hearing is scheduled in May to determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Baldwin was both a lead actor and coproducer on “Rust.” The charges carry a punishment of up to 18 months in prison.The state's final workplace-safety order states that Rust Movie Productions “did not furnish a place of employment free from hazards in that employees were exposed to being struck by discharged rounds or projectiles when firearms were used on the set of the motion picture production.”Safety violations are categorized as “serious” — and not “willful-serious,” as initially alleged.In April 2022, New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau slapped Rust Movie Productions with a maximum $136,793 fine while distributing a scathing narrative of safety failures in violation of standard industry protocols, including testimony that production managers took limited or no action to address two misfires on set before the fatal shooting.The bureau also documented gun-safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.Rust Movie Productions previously announced that filming would resume this year on “Rust” at a ranch in Montana, with Hutchins’ widower, Matthew Hutchins, serving as the film’s new executive producer.In court proceedings, prosecutors say assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on the set, has signed an agreement to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon. A judge is scheduled to consider approval of the plea agreement next week.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843853,Review: A compassionate immigrant drama in 'Tori and Lokita',"It's one of the great ironies of cinema that many — not all, but many — of the most seemingly arthouse filmmakers make some of the most approachable films.Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne are imposing names in cinema. The Belgian brothers have twice won the Palme d'Or. But you would be hard pressed to find many filmmakers who have beaten a more humanistic path, trailing working-class protagonists with handheld cameras and deep wells of empathy. They've stuck resolutely near home, shooting in and around their native Seraing, often with unprofessional actors. Yet they've found global acclaim for their humble, neorealistic masterworks.It's been nearly a decade, though, since the Dardennes made a real impression. But in “Tori and Lokita,” a heart-wrenching immigrant drama that opens in theaters Friday, they make a thrilling return to form.It's about 11-year-old Tori (Pablo Schils) and 16-year-old Lokita (Joely Mbundu), two African immigrants living in an unnamed Belgian city. Only Tori has the necessary papers to stay, and immigration authorities are pressing Lokita. We're plunged directly into her desperate situation, as she pleads to stone-faced bureaucrats that she and Tori and siblings. If proven — a DNA test is threatened — Lokita could stay. But their story isn't convincing.So tender is the connection between Tori and Lokita that you wonder initially if they are, in fact, brother and sister. But their bond is something more profound than blood, a product of shared circumstance and mutual perseverance. How they have gotten to Europe from Benin and Cameroon is never specified but it's clear enough that they've been hardened by journeys that were solitary before they became intertwined. Lokita is still aggressively hounded for regular payments by the man who helped her flee. She sends home everything else to a family skeptical of how hard she's working.Yet Lokita's doing everything she can, including delivering drugs for a backroom-dealing chef Betim (Alban Ukaj). He rarely misses a chance to take advantage of Lokita's situation. Tori is there alongside her through nearly it all, sticking up for her to Betim, requesting their pay and soothing Lokita when she's been abused. “You're sweet, Tori,” she says. “There's no one like you.”The Dardennes' movie, a prize-winner at last year's Cannes Film Festival, resides overwhelmingly in their relationship, portrayed affectionately and unsentimentally by Mbundu and Schils. Tori and Lokita are welded together, a small but stubborn bulwark against a predatory world. When Lokita takes a job that separates them, the lengths to which Tori goes to reunite them is cleverly ingenious, deeply dangerous and one of the more moving things you're likely to see in a movie this year.The Dardennes are at their best when their crushing contemporary worlds are navigated by young characters of gritty courage: the trailer-park teenager of “Rosetta,” the abandoned boy of “The Kid With a Bike.” “Tori and Lokita"" also at point features another kid on a bike, making his way against the odds. It may be the abiding symbol of the directors' films: In this world, survival is self-propelled. Their taut and straightforward films can be heartbreaking — and “Tori and Lokita,” which grows increasingly, almost unbearable tense is no exception. But in the bleak, everyday struggles the Dardennes dramatize, they are always, thank god, keenly on the lookout for grace.“Tori and Lokita,” a Sideshow and Janus Films release, is not rated by the Motion Picture Association of America but contains scenes of child peril and suggested sexual abuse. In French with subtitles. Running time: 88 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843854,Williamson out for at least 2 more weeks amid playoff push,"METAIRIE, La. (AP) — All-Star forward Zion Williamson will not return for at least two more weeks, jeopardizing whether he will be a part of the New Orleans Pelicans’ playoff push.The Pelicans announced Wednesday that Williamson, who has not played since straining his right hamstring Jan. 2, “has been cleared to return to on-court activities” and “will be re-evaluated in two weeks.”The latest re-evaluation will come April 5. New Orleans plays host to Memphis that night and will have two more regular-season games on April 7 and April 9.“I can’t confirm whether he’ll be back or not,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said after practice Wednesday.Green said the organization is “taking a slower approach” with Williamson’s rehab after the team’s leading scorer suffered a “re-injury” in February.New Orleans briefly had the best record in the Western Conference in December and had a 23-14 mark after Williamson was injured during a 120-111 loss at Philadelphia. Since then the Pelicans are 12-23.Going into Wednesday, New Orleans was tied with the Lakers, a half-game behind Utah and Minnesota, which are tied for the final two play-in spots. The Pelicans have 10 games remaining, starting with a home game against Charlotte on Thursday.“We feel like we’re getting to a good place for the final 10 games,” Green said.Brandon Ingram, the Pelicans’ second-leading scorer, had 32 points in a 119-84 victory against San Antonio on Tuesday, but he has missed 37 games this season due to injuries.“It’s been a constant adjustment all season,” Green said. “There’s some frustration because every team in the league comes in with expectations and goals and excitement based on knowing what your team would look like full.“We haven’t been full for the majority of the season. But now you look at where you are and keep trying to improve and continue to try and instill confidence in our group and stay focused on winning games.”New Orleans has played just 10 games this season with its projected starting lineup, winning six of those games.Williamson, who missed all of last season because of foot surgery, is averaging 26 points per game, is second on the team in rebounding (7), third in assists (4.6) and is shooting 60.8% from the floor.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843855,A hectic week for abortion policy with laws and lawsuits,"Nine months after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to an abortion, the landscape is far from settled, with lawmakers considering broader bans or stronger protections and legal challenges popping up nationwide.It's been a hectic week for abortion policy with Republican-dominated states seeking to tighten restrictions, Democratic lawmakers trying to protect abortion access — and court fights playing out on multiple fronts.Here’s what’s happening:WHAT'S THE STATUS OF ABORTION PILLS?This question lies at the heart of the most closely watched current abortion-related lawsuit.A combination of two drugs is the nation's most common method for ending pregnancies.But Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposed abortion, has asked a Texas judge to revoke or suspend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 2000 approval of one of the drugs, mifepristone. The legal question looms as the Biden Administration is working on rules to make the pills more widely available, and pharmacies and states sort out whether that will happen.After a hearing last week, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, sitting in Amarillo, Texas, said he would rule “as soon as possible.”In the meantime, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon became the first in the nation to sign a bill specifically banning abortion pills. It's to take effect July. Thirteen states already had blanket bans on all forms of abortion and 15 had limits on access, such as requiring that the pills be dispensed only and directly by doctors.The same day Gordon signed that, California Democrats introduced a measure intended to offer legal protection to doctors who mail abortion pills to patients in other states. A handful of other Democrat-controlled states have proposed or adopted similar laws already.WHAT NEW BANS ARE IN PLACE?Wyoming's Gordon also allowed a separate ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy to take effect Sunday without his signature. However, a judge on Wednesday halted enforcement, at least for now.Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens blocked an earlier ban last year hours before it was to take effect. Her order on the first ban remains in effect as courts decide whether it complies with the state's constitution.ANY OTHER NEW COURT RULINGS?This week, the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a narrow part of that state's abortion ban.The court ruled that a woman has the right to an abortion if her doctor finds that continuing her pregnancy risks her life, not just when she's in the midst of a life-threatening medical emergency.ARE THERE OTHER NEW ANTI-ABORTION MEASURES?The Kansas House on Wednesday passed a bill declaring that when an abortion procedure inadvertently results in a live birth, medical personnel must try to preserve the newborn's life. The legislation now goes to the state Senate, where it's also expected to pass.At least 18 other states have similar laws on the books. Opponents say it's a circumstance that very rarely happens — but that the law would create additional trauma for women who seek abortions.A similar measure was on the ballot in Montana last year and voters rejected it.WHAT STATES ARE PROTECTING ABORTION?Oregon lawmakers heard testimony this week on a bill that would protect abortion providers and patients from criminal and civil liability in other states and would allow a person to bring a lawsuit against a public body for interfering with their reproductive health rights. The measure also seeks to protect gender-affirming care in the state.Minnesota lawmakers passed bills to prohibit enforcement in the state of laws, subpoenas, judgements or extradition requests from other states for people who obtain, provide or assist with abortions there. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed a similar measure on Wednesday. As in other states, Minnesota's current governor and Hawaii's former governor signed executive orders extending similar protections.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843856,World Bank puts cost of rebuilding Ukraine at $411 billion,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A World Bank report released Wednesday puts the cost of Ukraine's recovery and rebuilding from Russia's invasion at $411 billion over the next decade, with the cost of cleaning up the war rubble alone at $5 billion.The report details some of the toll of Russia's war in Ukraine: at least 9,655 civilians confirmed dead, including 461 children; nearly 2 million homes damaged; more than one out of five public health institutions damaged; and 650 ambulances damaged or looted.In all, the World Bank calculated $135 billion in direct damage to buildings and infrastructure so far, not counting broader economic damage.The damage would be even worse if not for the strong defense mounted by the Ukrainian forces, Anna Bjerde, the World Bank vice president for Europe and Central Asia, noted in a call with reporters. She said the worst damage has been confined to the front-line regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk and Kherson.As it is, the World Bank said, Russia's invasion has undone 15 years of economic progress in Ukraine, cutting Ukraine's gross domestic product by 29% and pushing 1.7 million Ukrainians into poverty.The assessment was carried out by the government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission and the United Nations. The findings are meant to guide planning for financing and carrying out what is an ongoing recovery effort in Ukraine.The report said it was essential to keep Ukraine's government and private business and recovery efforts going even as bombs fall and fighting persists. Postponing rebuilding and support “risks settling into a situation of low or no growth and facing huge social challenges once the war ends,” it said.Ukraine's energy sector has seen the greatest surge in damage recently, as a result of Russia's targeted strikes on the electrical grid and other energy hubs during the winter. Total damage to the energy sector is now five times greater than it was last summer, the World Bank said.Longer term, the officials estimated a cost in the trillions of dollars to Ukraine's economy just from the many ways the war has interrupted education. That includes the more than 2 million children estimated to have fled the country.___This version corrects that the World Bank has confirmed 461 children killed in the war, not 465.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843857,Nevada to add gas plant as drought tests US West power grids,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Utility regulators in Nevada gave the state’s largest power provider clearance to start work on a $333 million project to build a natural gas plant in the state for the first time in nearly 15 years, signaling yet another consequence of the extreme drought conditions in the southwestern U.S.The two gas-fired turbines to be erected north of Las Vegas by NV Energy are expected to come online by July 2024 amid hotter summers and longer wildfire seasons in a state that aims to have a carbon-free power grid by 2050.Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission approved the plans last week. It said the turbines are needed to address peak electricity demand in the summer months, as ever-drying conditions in the West continue to stress the region’s power grids and slash hydroelectric output, including the behemoth power producers on the Colorado River — the Hoover Dam and Glen Canyon Dam.But environmental advocates have argued that the turbines mark a major step backwards for Nevada's climate goals.“Both the state and the utility have set strong goals to transition to renewable energy,” said Angelyn Tabalba, a spokesperson for the Nevada Conservation League. “Instead of doubling down on fossil fuels, they should be leaning into a clean energy future.”Mike O’Boyle, senior director of electricity policy at the Bay Area-based Energy Innovation firm, said the commission’s decision underscores a growing tension across the American Southwest.“We’ve always dealt with annual variability when it comes to hydroelectric power in the West. How much of it we have really depends on the snowpack and what happened in the winter and spring,” O’Boyle said. “It’s not a new issue, but it’s been exacerbated by the drought. Unfortunately it’s a new major contingency that utility providers have to plan for.”At least 21 other states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have goals to reach 100% clean energy between 2040 and 2050, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance.But as those deadlines approach, scientists say the megadrought gripping the southwest is the worst in 1,200 years, putting a deep strain on the Colorado River. If states don’t begin taking less out of the river, major reservoirs threaten to fall so low they can’t produce hydropower or supply any water to farms that grow crops for the rest of the nation and cities like Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix.Last March, for example, Lake Powell in Utah and Arizona dipped below a critical threshold, raising new concerns about the Glen Canyon Dam, a source of power that millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. If power production ceases at the dam, rural electric cooperatives, cities and tribal utilities would be forced to seek more expensive options that could include fossil fuels.Already, Nevada has retired its largest coal plant, while the North Valmy coal plant is scheduled to shut down its remaining units by 2025.Another coal plant was expected to be converted by early this year for natural gas output. Representatives for the TS Power Plant, which runs the facility, did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking an update on the project.About 60% of Nevada is now powered by natural gas and 30% by renewable energy resources. Natural gas is composed primarily of methane, a greenhouse gas about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.But NV Energy said the turbines will have minimal carbon dioxide emissions because they will only operate in the summer months — or for about 700 hours annually — and therefore won’t hinder the state’s carbon-free goals.“Along with our commitment to reduce emissions, NV Energy is committed to providing reliable and affordable energy for our customers,” Katie Nannini, a spokesperson for the power company, said in a statement. “This decision ensures that NV Energy can reliably provide energy for Nevadans, especially during the State’s hottest months from June to September.”Ratepayers will foot the project's bill once the plant is operational, according to NV Energy's plans submitted to the Public Utilities Commission.The turbines will be built at NV Energy's existing Silverhawk Generating Station gas plant in Moapa, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Las Vegas. The Harry Allen Generating Station, also in Moapa, was the last gas-powered plant constructed by the energy provider in 2011.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843858,Cooperating ex-guard gets 6 years in Illinois inmate's death,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — A contrite Willie Hedden, the last of three ex-correctional officers convicted in the beating death of an Illinois prison inmate, was sentenced Wednesday to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to civil rights violations and obstruction and testifying against his codefendants.U.S. District Judge Sue Myerscough gave Hedden, 44, a sentence nearly one-quarter the length of the 20 years she handed 31-year-old Alex Banta and Todd Sheffler, 54, for a violent attack on Larry Earvin, an inmate at Western Illinois Correctional Center, in 2018.Hedden, an 18-year Department of Corrections veteran, admitted punching, stomping and kicking the 65-year-old Earvin, who was handcuffed behind his back, in the entryway to a segregation unit where there are no surveillance cameras.Speaking to the court before sentencing, Hedden turned to Earvin's son, Larry Pippion, 51, and apologized.“What I brought upon them is a horrible tragedy that did not need to happen. For that I am truly sorry. ...,” Hedden said. “I chose this. Mr. Earvin didn't have a say. Other than an apology, I thought the only thing I could give Mr. Pippion is the truth, despite how horrible and graphic it was to hear, at least he'd know what happened that day.”Pippion sat through two trials, testified at sentencing for Banta and Sheffler and questioned a system that incarcerated his mentally ill father on a theft charge. He said he accepted Hedden's apology.“He was the only one who didn't go to trial. He was real sincere,” Pippion told The Associated Press. ""He realized he made a terrible mistake and he accepted responsibility.“That was the big deal. The others lied all the way through.”In December 2019, Hedden, Sheffler and Banta were charged with deprivation of civil rights resulting in death, conspiracy to deprive civil rights, obstruction of an investigation, falsification of documents and misleading conduct.On May 17, 2018, Earvin was late in reporting for outdoor yard time and was ordered back to his cell at the prison in Mount Sterling, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. He allegedly became combative, and an “officer in distress” call summoned dozens of guards. Outside the housing unit, Banta, Hedden and Sheffler escorted Earvin, handcuffed behind his back, to the segregation unit.Security video captured the bulk of Earvin’s “seg walk” and he was upright as he entered the segregation vestibule. Out of sight of security cameras, the three officers threw Earvin head-first into a wall, then kicked, punched and stomped him, Hedden and others testified.Myerscough decreed that Banta delivered “the most serious and depraved blow” by jumping up and landing on Earvin’s mid-section with both knees. Inside segregation, staff members picked him up and carried him, incoherent and bleeding from the head, to the “cage,"" or the unit's holding cell.Finally, vomiting and dropping blood pressure prompted officials to get Earvin airlifted to Springfield for emergency surgery. Earvin suffered 15 broken ribs and abdominal injuries so severe that a portion of his bowel was surgically removed. He died June 26, more than a month after the beating.“Mr. Hedden became the government's surveillance video,” Hedden's lawyer, Mark Wykoff, told Myerscough.On cross-examination in the first trial, Hedden got tripped up on facts and was forced to acknowledge his testimony that day differed on several particular facts from previous statements. He admitted that before his guilty plea, he had lied “numerous times"" about his culpability and told defense attorneys he would not find credible anyone who lied to the FBI.But Myerscough allowed jurors to ask questions of each witness, and Hedden's tearful response to one asking why they should believe he changed was moving. Wallowing in self-pity, Hedden said he realized he should direct his distress to Earvin's family and thus completed a cycle of emotions that went from invincibility through fear, self-preservation and acceptance.In requesting a 10-year sentence, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Bass reminded Myerscough of oft-repeated testimony about a prison environment that condones roughing up prisoners and keeping quiet about it, but that Hedden had broken “that culture of obstruction.”Myerscough sentenced Hedden to 72 months each on the civil rights counts and 72 months on a witness tampering charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. She dismissed the other charges.Sheffler and Banta both received concurrent 15-year sentences for the civil rights violations and 5-year concurrent sentences on each of the other charges.“You were a crucial witness to as well as a participant in this assault,” Myerscough said. “But you came forward and you were as honest as you can be.”___ Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843859,Biden administration plans revamp of organ transplant system,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday it will attempt to break up the network that runs the nation’s organ transplant system as part of a broader modernization effort.More people than ever are getting new organs, with a record 42,888 transplants last year — but that’s not nearly enough to meet the demand. More than 100,000 patients are on the national transplant list, thousands die waiting and critics have long urged an overhaul to save more lives.The United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, is a nonprofit organization that has run the transplant system, under a government contract, for nearly four decades. That includes overseeing the groups that retrieve organs, helping set policies for how organs are distributed and patients are prioritized – and running the massive computer system that matches organs with patients.Now the government aims to end that monopoly and divide those duties among more than one group. Exactly how that will work isn’t clear. The Health Resources and Services Administration will issue bids for new contracts in the fall but wouldn’t say how many.However, a top focus is modernizing that organ-matching technology and improving accountability in the complex transplant system, including greater independence of the boards that set organ policies.Patients will be better served “by ensuring there’s competition in this process and that we’re getting best-in-class” to handle the different transplant functions, HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson said in an interview.Also Wednesday, HRSA took initial steps to translate some of the government’s data on organ donation and transplantation into an easier-to-understand website for patients and families, data that can help them decide how to pursue care.The Biden administration also has requested that Congress more than double HRSA’s funding for transplant oversight, to $67 million next year.Wednesday’s announcement doesn’t directly address some tougher problems, such as that potentially usable organs too often aren’t retrieved from would-be donors –- and that hospitals often decline to use less-than-perfect organs that could help the right patient. An influential science panel last year urged the government to set performance goals addressing those and other challenges.UNOS announced its own set of planned improvements to the transplant system in January and in a statement Wednesday, said it was committed to working with the government.“We believe we have the experience and expertise required to best serve the nation’s patients and to help implement HRSA’s proposed initiatives,” the nonprofit said in a statement.Asked by senators Wednesday about complaints against UNOS, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra pledged that “we're going to require transparency. ...

In the aftermath, President Joe Biden directed that a broad review examine ""every aspect of this from top to bottom.”It was originally set to be released at the one-year anniversary of the withdrawal but was delayed while agencies continued their work.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that the work was nearly complete and that the administration was readying the release next month.“We expect to be able to share those takeaways with the public by mid-April,” Kirby said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843861,Analysis: China's sway over Russia grows amid Ukraine fight,"MOSCOW (AP) — It was a revealing moment during Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s tightly scripted visit to Moscow: Standing in the doorway of the Grand Kremlin Palace, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the two of them were “witnessing the changes that haven't been seen in more than a century, and we are pushing them together.”“I agree,” Putin responded.The remarks — caught on a Kremlin camera over a bodyguard’s shoulder — offered a rare glimpse into Xi’s ambitions and his relationship with Russia after more than a year of fighting in Ukraine.While Moscow increasingly looks like a junior partner to Beijing, Xi is likely to offer a strong lifeline to Putin, his key partner in efforts to reshape the world to try to limit U.S. domination.Xi’s unusually blunt statement capped more than 10 hours of Kremlin talks, which ended with long declarations filled with florid rhetoric about expanding the “comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation” between Russia and China, pledges to champion a multilateral approach to global affairs and criticism of Washington.In his concluding statement, Putin hailed the Chinese proposal for a settlement in Ukraine, which the West had all but rejected as a non-starter. The Russian leader also rolled out a slew of initiatives that cemented his country's role as a key source of energy and other raw materials for China’s giant economy. He proposed building new energy pipelines, invited the Chinese to fill the niche left after the exodus of Western businesses, and vowed to boost the export of agricultural products to China.Xi remained tight-lipped, avoiding any firm commitments regarding specific projects and mostly sticking to general and vague rhetoric about expanding ties.“A lot of things that Vladimir Putin would have liked to happen did not, in fact, happen,"" Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, told The Associated Press. ""There was no point at which Xi explicitly said that he accepted Russia’s position on the Ukraine war over the position of Ukraine.”In fact, there was ""a sense that China was reserving for itself the right to step away from a complete endorsement” of the Russian position, Mitter added.Moscow and Beijing said they would increase contacts between their militaries and stage more joint sea and air patrols and drills, but there wasn't even the slightest hint from China about helping Russia with weapons, as the U.S. and other Western allies feared.Speaking Wednesday before a Senate committee, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China so far has heeded strong U.S. warnings against providing lethal material support for Russia in Ukraine. “We have not seen them cross that — cross that line,” he said.A top analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said Beijing wants to be seen as a peacemaker and diplomatic heavyweight.“So I think China would be very reluctant to be seen openly supporting Russia with lethal aid,” said Doug Wade, head of the DIA's China mission group. “It would undermine their whole narrative about their role in the world that they’re trying so hard to sell.”U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the Putin-Xi relationship as “a marriage of convenience,” in which they pool efforts to challenge U.S. leadership, and the Russians “certainly are the junior partner.” He added at a briefing earlier this week that Putin sees Xi as “a lifeline of sorts” amid the fighting in Ukraine.Many commentators argued that the summit marked Putin’s failure to win any specific aid from Beijing and cemented Russia’s increasingly subordinate role in the alliance with China.“China’s domination of Russia is complete,” tweeted Sam Greene, professor in Russian politics at King’s College London. “While there were undoubtedly agreements we are not meant to know about, there is no indication here of a significant increase in military support for Russia — nor even of a willingness on Xi’s part to ramp up diplomatic support. A swing and a miss for Putin.”After more than a year of fighting in Ukraine and bruising Western sanctions, Russia’s dependence on China has increased significantly. Facing Western restrictions on its oil, gas and other exports, Russia has shifted its energy flows to China and sharply expanded other exports, resulting in a 30% hike in bilateral trade.Western price caps on Russia’s oil forced Moscow to offer it to China and other customers at a sharp discount, but despite those lower prices, the vast Chinese market ensured a stable flow of oil revenue to the Kremlin’s coffers.As long as Russia can trade with China and other Asian states, it will face ""no danger of running out of money or being forced to concede on the battlefield, said Chris Weafer, CEO of the consulting firm Macro-Advisory.While profiting handsomely from Moscow’s desperate situation, Beijing would be certain to ramp up its support if it sees Russia dangerously weakened.“The nightmare scenario for China is that collapse of Russia militarily leads to collapse of the regime and installment of some pro-Western government,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.Gabuev argued that Beijing would be unlikely to provide any direct military assistance to Moscow anytime soon simply because it doesn’t feel the pressing need to do so. “Russia is not doing great on the battlefield, but it’s obviously not losing it, so the need to support the Russian military efforts so far is questionable from both sides,” he said.More than ammunition, tanks and rockets, Russia badly needs China's help in skirting Western sanctions to maintain the flow of high-tech components for its weapons industries and other economic sectors. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, predicted that China could be expected to act more resolutely to help Russia get them.“Russia doesn’t need weapons from China,” Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. “It needs microchips and components, and they will come.”Some observers say that while Beijing has been coy about supporting Moscow, it has vital interest in shoring up its ally to avoid being left alone in any potential confrontation with the United States.Mikhail Korostikov, an expert on Russia-China ties, said in a commentary for the Carnegie Endowment that China has been closely watching Russia’s experience in facing massive Western sanctions. “For Beijing, a close study and partial use of instruments and decisions used by Russia is a reasonable course in a situation when China’s confrontation with the West looks inevitable,” he said.Korostikov noted that while Moscow’s dependence on Beijing is growing, China’s room for maneuvering is also shrinking.“There is no alternative to Russia as a partner providing resources that China will critically need in case of an escalation in its confrontation with the West,” he said. “It helps balance the situation and allows Moscow to hope that Beijing will not overuse its newly-acquired economic levers.”___Isachenkov has covered Russia and other former Soviet nations for The Associated Press since 1992.___Associated Press writers Michael Weissenstein in New York, and Matthew Lee, Zeke Miller and Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843875,Ed Cooley takes over at Georgetown with lofty aspirations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Ed Cooley's task at Georgetown is to bring a once-storied program back to prominence in a competitive conference that has three teams still part of March Madness in the Sweet 16.Cooley's lofty aspirations go beyond lifting the Hoyas up from the bottom of the Big East Conference. After leaving Providence, which he took to the NCAA Tournament seven times in 12 years, he already is talking about trying to coach Georgetown to its first championship since 1984.At his introductory news conference Wednesday that felt like a pep rally, Cooley said he wanted current and former players to envision cutting down nets and watching “One Shining Moment” with the nets hanging around their necks. He promised wins — many of them — and plotted a path forward that he knows will involve some tough times.“It’s a process, and the process now, because you have a changing landscape in athletics, you’ll have an opportunity to probably move it quicker than you would have 10, 20 years ago,” Cooley said. “We’re going to lose some games. It’s OK. Losing’s part of growth. But over the course of time, it will pay off.”Georgetown has lost a lot the past couple of years under Patrick Ewing, who was fired earlier this month after six seasons. The team went 7-25 this season after going 6-25 last season and lost 37 of 39 games in Big East play.While Cooley at Providence was responsible for four of those defeats, the 53-year-old distanced himself from Georgetown's recent run of losing.“I don’t have anything to do what happened yesterday,” he said. “My job is to move us forward from today.”Cooley's mere presence is an acknowledgement that Georgetown needed a major change to become relevant again. After late Hall of Fame coach John Thompson's 27-year-old run led to longtime assistant Craig Esherick succeeding him and then son John Thompson III and Ewing getting the head job, Cooley is the school's first outsider in the position in a half-century.His only connection to the Hilltop — beyond coaching in the Big East — is his daughter, Olivia, attending Georgetown. Cooley, a Providence native, said her desire to live in the Washington area played into his decision to leave for a conference rival.It was certainly no accident that athletic director Lee Reed and school president John J. DeGioia used phrases like “new era” and “new chapter"" when discussing Cooley. DeGioia said he believes Cooley will ""uplift and restore this team"" to compete at the highest levels of the sport.“He has a proven record of success,” Reed said. “We knew we needed a leader, someone who understood our identity and could reimagine Georgetown basketball to fit today’s unique basketball landscape.”That landscape, including players being able to profit off the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) and more easily transfer schools, are the biggest changes Cooley has seen since landing his first head job at Fairfield in 2006. He expects to be aggressive, and given the high volume of Georgetown players coming and going via the transfer portal, could rebuild the roster in his image sooner rather than later.“You have to find student-athletes that fit the way you want to play, your style of play, that fit you as a coach,” Cooley said. “We need to find players that can play for me that can attend Georgetown, not the other way around.”Cooley acknowledged that some luck is needed but also stressed recruiting local talent to keep the best players in the region around. That's just one building block to putting Georgetown back on the map, which Cooley wants the time and latitude to do.“The word patience is always hard because everybody wants it and they want it right now,” he said. “Everybody wants it right now. Have a little bit of patience.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843876,Ex-Haitian mayor found liable in killings charged with fraud,"BOSTON (AP) — A former Haitian mayor was criminally charged Wednesday with lying on his application to become a legal resident of the U.S., just one day after he was found liable for a killing and two attempted slayings in his homeland.Jean Morose Viliena, 50, was indicted on three counts of visa fraud, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston. Conviction on the charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.“Gaining lawful entry into our country is a privilege, not a right,"" U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a statement. ""Our nation offers protection, assistance and asylum to those who are persecuted. People that perpetrate acts of violence and harm — and then allegedly lie about their conduct to U.S. immigration officials — in their countries are not welcome here.”An email seeking comment was sent to Viliena's attorney.Viliena went to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in June 2008 to apply for a visa that would gain him entry to the U.S., federal prosecutors said.When asked on the application form whether he was excluded from admission to the U.S. for having “ordered, carried out or materially assisted in extrajudicial and political killings and other acts of violence against the Haitian people,” he said he was not, prosecutors said.He then swore that his application was true and signed it, authorities said. The visa was approved the next day. He moved to the U.S. in July 2008 and was granted a Permanent Resident Card, also known as a green card.Viliena has been living in Malden, just north of Boston, authorities said.But federal prosecutors allege that while mayor of the town of Les Irois — a community of about 22,000 on Haiti's western tip — Viliena was involved in acts of violence against political foes.In 2007, prosecutors said, he led a group of his allies to the home of a political opponent, where he and his associates shot and killed the opponent's younger brother, then smashed his skull with a rock.Prosecutors also allege that in 2008, Viliena and his allies went armed with guns, machetes, picks and sledgehammers to a community radio station that he opposed to shut it down. He allegedly pistol-whipped and punched a man and ordered an associate to shoot and kill the man and one other person.Both survived, but one of the men lost a leg and the other was blinded in one eye.Viliena was found liable by an American jury in a civil trial on Tuesday for his role in the killing and the two attempted killings and assessed $15.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.The suit was filed by the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability on behalf of David Boniface, Juders Ysemé and Nissage Martyr in Boston in 2017. Nissage Martyr died, and his son, Nissandère Martyr, replaced him as a plaintiff.The suit was filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allows lawsuits to be filed in the U.S. against foreign officials who allegedly committed wrongdoing in their homeland if all legal avenues in their country have been exhausted.“The Center for Justice and Accountability welcomes action by the Justice Department but calls for human rights criminal charges to be brought given the strong evidence presented against Viliena for torture and other abuses during the civil trial,"" the center said in a statement Wednesday.The center also called on the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to work with the government of Haiti to ensure the safety of their clients and family members, who have been subjected to retaliation and intimidation.Boniface, Ysemé and Martyr continue to live in hiding and said in statements Wednesday that while pleased with Viliena's arrest, they are concerned about their families.Martyr's mother and sisters still live in Les Irois.“His associates in Les Irois have said that if Jean Morose Viliena is arrested, what they have done before will be nothing compared to what they will do now,"" Martyr said in a statement that was translated from Haitian Creole into English. “They said they will burn the city of Les Irois and the families of the people who sought justice.""",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843877,"Astros star Altuve has surgery on broken thumb, a WBC injury","Houston Astros star Jose Altuve had surgery Wednesday on his broken right thumb, an injury that occurred in the World Baseball Classic and will significantly delay the second baseman's 2023 debut.The Astros announced that the 32-year-old Altuve had the procedure done in Houston and will stay there to begin his rehabilitation, with only one week left in spring training. The Astros will fly there on Sunday following their final Grapefruit League game in Florida, before playing a pair of exhibitions against their Triple-A team, the Sugar Land Space Cowboys, in Texas.Altuve was hit by a pitch on Saturday while playing for Venezuela in the WBC. He might not be ready to return to the lineup until at least late May. The eight-time All-Star and 2017 American League MVP batted .300 with 103 runs, 28 homers and 18 steals for the World Series champion Astros last season. Mauricio Dubón and David Hensley are the leading candidates to fill in for Altuve at second base.Altuve isn't the only Major League Baseball star who was hurt in WBC play, of course. Mets closer Edwin Díaz will miss the 2023 season because of a torn patellar tendon in his right knee as the freak result of an on-field celebration following a WBC win by the Puerto Rico national team.BROWN DOWNThe Astros also scratched right-hander Hunter Brown from his scheduled start Wednesday against the Mets in Port St. Lucie, Florida.Manager Dusty Baker told reporters that Brown, who is ranked by MLB as the organization's top prospect and competing for the last spot in the rotation, has discomfort in his lower back.THE BUXTON PLANThe Minnesota Twins have been bringing center fielder Byron Buxton along slowly, after the oft-injured star had arthroscopic surgery last September on the right knee that hindered him last season, but he made an immediate smash in his first exhibition game Tuesday night with a double in his first at-bat right before Carlos Correa drove him in with a homer.Buxton, who played in a minor league game Wednesday, is at full strength. But the Twins are being cautious by limiting his activity to designated hitter duty for now, a plan that will continue into the early part of the regular season.“The best thing to do is to make sure he’s in the lineup as much as possible, continue to keep him in a great spot physically, and then see what the rest of April and what May brings,” manager Rocco Baldelli told reporters in Fort Myers, Florida.NOT QUITE READYThe New York Mets sent catcher Francisco Álvarez to Triple-A Syracuse, quashing for now the possibility of putting the prized 21-year-old on the opening day roster.Álvarez, who made his major league debut with the Mets near the end of last season, had just three hits in 28 at-bats in Grapefruit League exhibition games. Ranked by MLB as the third-best prospect in baseball, Álvarez batted .260 with 27 homers and 78 RBIs in a combined 112 minor league games in 2022 at Double-A and Triple-A.The Mets have newcomer Omar Narváez, a 2021 All-Star with the Milwaukee Brewers, as their primary catcher with Tomás Nido likely to play mostly against left-handed pitchers.Speaking of the Mets, Díaz turned 29 on Wednesday — a rather subdued milestone for the right-hander considering his situation. Diaz nonetheless posted in Spanish an upbeat message on his Twitter account, thanking God for another year of life and describing his health as good and his outlook as positive in this initial stage of the roughly eight-month rehabilitation process.TIGER BEATDetroit Tigers right-hander Michael Lorenzen told reporters in Lakeland, Florida, that he's optimistic about an efficient recovery from a mildly strained left groin muscle. Manager A.J. Hinch said Lorenzen's status in the season-opening rotation is “going to go down to the wire.""Matt Manning, another expected member of the starting five, turned in a strong performance in his final spring training start Wednesday against the Atlanta Braves with six strikeouts and one unearned run allowed in four innings.POTENTIAL SETBACK FOR A’SOakland Athletics right-hander Drew Rucinski has been scratched from his scheduled start Thursday because of tightness in his left hamstring. Manager Mark Kotsay told reporters in Mesa, Arizona, that there’s no timeline established yet for his return.Rucinski, who returned to the major leagues on a $3 million contract after four seasons in the Korean Baseball Organization, is in line for a spot in the A’s rotation. The group is supposed to be steered by 2022 All-Star Paul Blackburn, but he will start the season on the injured list because of a torn fingernail on his right middle finger.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843878,Senators press Moderna CEO on COVID-19 vaccine price hike,"Moderna’s CEO on Wednesday defended a plan to more than quadruple the company’s COVID-19 vaccine price, but he also said the drugmaker will work to ensure patients continue paying nothing at drugstores or clinics.Stephane Bancel told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that the drugmaker will charge a list price of around $130 per dose for the vaccine in the U.S.That price is expected to go into effect later this year. Until now, the federal government had been Moderna’s lone U.S. customer, buying doses in bulk to make sure that people weren’t charged anything.The government paid around $15 per dose in 2020 and more than $26 last summer for Moderna’s bivalent booster, according to an analysis by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation.More than 270 million doses of Moderna’s original COVID-19 vaccine and booster shots have been administered in the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That makes it the second most popular coronavirus vaccine, trailing the shot made by Pfizer, which is also raising prices.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., noted that Moderna has made more than $20 billion in profits over the past two years, and the federal government contributed billions of dollars toward the vaccine’s development.The hike will hit government payers like Medicaid and cost taxpayers, Sanders said as he pressed Bancel to reconsider the price.The CEO said Moderna gave the government a discount with its initial prices. Now, the company must assume more costs and risk, he said.He said, for instance, that the drugmaker will switch to single-dose vials from ones that held 10 doses.He also that Moderna will have to make more doses than it anticipates using to ensure enough is available. The company will then have to eat the cost of unused doses, something the government has done.“The volume we had during the pandemic gave us economies of scale we won’t have anymore,” he said.Sanders later asked Bancel if Moderna was prepared to negotiate the price with Medicare, Medicaid and other agencies. Bancel replied that Moderna was “having discussions with all the different customers.”While Moderna’s list price for its Spikevax vaccine will soar, company leaders have emphasized that people with insurance will continue to pay nothing out of pocket for the shots. Moderna also has a patient assistance program that will cover shots for people without coverage or who are underinsured.Senators noted during Wednesday's hearing that these programs can involve complex paperwork and be difficult to use.“We want that (patient assistance program) to be something that works for patients and is not just something that’s like, ’Oh yeah, we have it, but no one can use it,'” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor.Bancel said Moderna will announce more details this fall on plans to help the uninsured, and the company was working to make the program as “easy as possible to access.”Pfizer also has said it will charge $110 to $130 for a dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. It also cited the cost of switching to single-dose vials and commercial distribution in explaining the new prices. Pfizer used no government funding to develop its vaccine.____Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thpmurphy___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843879,Trump lawyer ordered to turn over Mar-a-Lago case documents,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court in a sealed order Wednesday directed a lawyer for Donald Trump to turn over to prosecutors documents in the investigation into the former president's retention of classified records at his Florida estate.The ruling is a significant win for the Justice Department, which has focused for months not only on the hoarding of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago but also on why Trump and his representatives resisted demands to return them to the government. It suggests the court has sided with prosecutors who have argued behind closed doors that Trump was using his legal representation to further a crime.The order was reflected in a brief online notice by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case is sealed, and none of the parties in the dispute is mentioned by name.But the details appear to correspond with a secret fight before a lower court judge over whether Trump lawyer M. Evan Corcoran could be forced to provide documents or give grand jury testimony in the Justice Department special counsel probe into whether Trump mishandled top-secret information at Mar-a-Lago.Corcoran is regarded as relevant to the investigation in part because last year he drafted a statement to the Justice Department asserting that a “diligent search” for classified documents had been conducted at Mar-a-Lago in response to a subpoena. That claim proved untrue as FBI agents weeks later searched the home with a warrant and found roughly 100 additional documents with classified markings.Another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told investigators last fall that Corcoran had drafted the letter and asked her to sign it in her role as a designated custodian of Trump’s records.A Justice Department investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith and his team of prosecutors is examining whether Trump or anyone in his orbit obstructed its efforts to recover all the classified documents, which included top-secret material, from his home. No charges have yet been filed. The inquiry is one of multiple legal threats Trump faces, including probes in Atlanta and Washington over his efforts to undo the election result and a grand jury investigation in New York over hush money payments. The New York case appears to be nearing completion and building toward an indictment.Last week, Beryl Howell, the outgoing chief judge of the U.S. District Court, directed Corcoran to answer additional questions before the grand jury. He had appeared weeks earlier before the federal grand jury investigating the Mar-a-Lago matter, but had invoked attorney-client privilege to avoid answering certain questions.Though attorney-client privilege shields lawyers from being forced to share details of their conversations with clients before prosecutors, the Justice Department can get around that if it can convince a judge that a lawyer’s services were used in furtherance of a crime — a principle known in the law as the “crime-fraud"" exception.Howell ruled in the Justice Department's favor shortly before stepping aside as chief judge Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to discuss a sealed proceeding and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. That ruling was subsequently appealed, and the court records show the dispute before the federal appeals panel concerned an order that was issued last Friday by Howell.The three-judge panel that issued the decision include Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and J. Michelle Childs and Florence Pan, both appointees of President Joe Biden. The order came just hours after the court imposed tight deadlines on both sides to file written briefs making their case.A lawyer for Corcoran did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Wednesday, and a lawyer for Trump declined to comment on the sealed order.___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843880,"Browns get speed, land WR Moore from Jets, swap draft picks","CLEVELAND (AP) — Elijah Moore wanted out of New York. The Browns wanted speed.Both got their wish.Cleveland added another offensive playmaker and target for quarterback Deshaun Watson on Wednesday, acquiring Moore in a trade with the Jets, who have overhauled their receiving group this offseason — perhaps in advance of quarterback Aaron Rodgers' arrival.The Browns have agreed to send the No. 42 pick in this year's draft to the Jets for Moore and the No. 74 selection. The deal's completion is pending a physical.The Jets are parting ways with Moore, a second-round pick in 2021, shortly after agreeing to terms with former Kansas City wide receiver Mecole Hardman on a one-year deal, according to a person with knowledge of the contract.New York will have picks No. 42 and 43 — as well as No. 13 overall. Earlier in free agency, the Jets signed former Packers wide receiver Allen Lazard and have been working toward a possible deal for Rodgers.Cleveland made its major quarterback move last year, sending three first-round picks to Houston for Watson in a controversial trade. Now they're adding a downfield threat for Watson in Moore, who can play in the slot, backfield or line up outside. He'll complement receivers Amari Cooper and Donovan Peoples-Jones.The Browns lacked a player capable of stretching defenses after Anthony Schwartz, a third-round pick in 2021, struggled with drops and his confidence.Cleveland explored the free agent market and other trades, including one for Denver wide receiver Jerry Jeudy before striking the deal with the Jets.While Moore, who will turn 23 next week, hasn't put up big numbers, he's quick and versatile and gives Cleveland's offense another wrinkle to support Watson and its strong running game.The 5-foot-10, 180-pound Moore had 37 catches for 446 yards and one touchdown last season, but was unhappy with his role and asked for a trade. He became disgruntled due to a lack of pass-catching opportunities and asked to be dealt in October.After the Jets’ 27-10 victory at Green Bay in Week 6, Moore quote-tweeted a reporter’s Twitter post that pointed out he had no official receiving targets. In a series of since-deleted tweets, Moore posted if he said what he really wanted to, he’d be viewed as selfish, but added: “Just know I don’t understand either.”Things took a turn when he reportedly had a disagreement with then-offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur the following week and was held out from practice for two days to clear his head — but then requested to be dealt by the Jets.Moore didn’t travel with the team to Denver for its victory in Week 7. He returned to practice the following week, but had no catches the next two games and was targeted just once.Coach Robert Saleh insisted Moore wouldn’t be traded and was a big part of what the Jets wanted to do on offense last season and in the future. But Moore’s production the rest of the season was minimal, catching more than two passes just twice in the next eight games.Five months after asking to be dealt, Moore gets a fresh start in Cleveland.Moore played college ball at Mississippi. He had 43 catches for 538 yards and five TDs as a rookie, but his production dipped in 2022 in part because the Jets didn't have good quarterback play along with the arrival of wide receiver Garrett Wilson, the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.___AP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843881,North Carolina lawmakers nearing final Medicaid expansion OK,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — An agreement to expand Medicaid in North Carolina neared final legislative approval Wednesday as the House agreed to a bipartisan plan to ease or eliminate regulations that block the opening of new hospital beds or operating expensive equipment.Republican lawmakers had been skeptical for nearly a decade about accepting expansion, which originated from the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act.But the House voted 95-21 for legislation stemming from a deal between House and Senate GOP leaders, announced three weeks ago, that would direct state health officials to accept Medicaid coverage for potentially 600,000 low-income adults.Legislators also were convinced by an estimated extra $1.75 billion in cash over two years that Congress approved in a COVID-19 recovery law if North Carolina joined now.One more affirmative House vote is needed Thursday before it goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a longtime expansion advocate, for his likely signature. The Senate passed the final legislation by overwhelming margins last week.North Carolina, one of 11 states that haven’t yet adopted expansion, currently has 2.9 million enrollees in traditional Medicaid coverage.“Today marks an important day for so many North Carolina citizens,” said Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican, during Wednesday's floor debate. “This has been a long, bumpy journey. But we’re here to make history and move North Carolina forward.”Cooper doesn't care for the North Carolina expansion bill language that says expansion can’t be enacted until a separate state budget law is approved in the months ahead. Republicans argue that it makes sense for the state to accept expansion at the same time they adjust the state’s conventional Medicaid program. But it also gives GOP leaders leverage to fill the budget with other unrelated items the governor may strongly oppose.Democratic legislators like Rep. Carla Cunningham of Mecklenburg County had sought expansion for years. Cunningham, a registered nurse, said during the brief debate that she has been ""waiting a good long time to get to the bittersweet end of this journey.""“We're almost there and can celebrate,” she said.The state’s 10% share of expenses for Medicaid expansion recipients would be paid through hospital assessments. Hospitals also are expected to receive larger reimbursements for treating Medicaid patients through a federal program the state is requested to enter in the legislation.The legislation also would scale back “certificate of need” rules that have required state health officials, for example, to sign off before hospital beds for mental health patients are opened or MRI machines are purchased. Senate Republicans insisted on such changes as part of any expansion deal — a requirement that meant talks idled in 2022. Negotiations resumed earlier this year.Cooper and many lawmakers want to spend much of the additional $1.75 billion on mental health services.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843882,New bill aims to outlaw caste discrimination in California,"California may become the first state in the nation to outlaw caste-based bias, a safeguard people of South Asian descent say is necessary to protect them from discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where they hold key roles.State Sen. Aisha Wahab, the first Muslim and Afghan American elected to the state legislature, introduced the bill Wednesday. It adds caste — a division of people related to birth or descent — as a protected category in the state’s anti-discrimination laws.Those at the lowest strata of the caste system known as Dalits, have been increasingly calling for such legislation saying they have faced this kind of discrimination in the United States. But such policies remain divisive.Wahab said caste discrimination is “a social justice and civil rights issue.”“People came to this country so they can be free and can pursue their American dream without any disruption to their lives,"" Wahab said, adding that she heard about this form of discrimination growing up in Fremont, California, and living in the San Francisco Bay Area.But some groups such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America oppose such policies. They argue these measures will hurt a community that already faces hate and discrimination, and will specifically target Hindus and Indian Americans who are commonly associated with the caste system. The legislation is being backed by other groups such as Hindus for Human Rights and Hindus for Caste Equity.A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs.Wahab said she is “deeply sensitive to how minority religions and groups are depicted.”“Caste goes beyond religion and nationality,” she said. “This legislation primarily protects millions who live in silence and have never had such protection because there is little understanding of this issue. This bill is about protecting people who are vulnerable.”In February, Seattle became the first U.S. city and the first jurisdiction outside South Asia to add caste to its anti-discrimination laws. Several colleges and universities have also enacted similar policies barring caste discrimination on campuses, including University of California, Davis.A 2020 survey of Indian Americans by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found caste discrimination was reported by 5% of survey respondents. While 53% of foreign-born Hindu Indian Americans said they affiliate with a caste group, only 34% of U.S. born Hindu Indian Americans said they do the same.However, a 2016 Equality Labs survey of 1,500 South Asians in the U.S. showed 67% of Dalits who responded reported being treated unfairly because of their caste.California ""has been ground zero for the caste equity movement,” said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder and executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, a Dalit advocacy group.“This legislation is about clarifying existing protections and making them explicit,” she said.The Hindu American Foundation disagrees. Samir Kalra, the group's managing director, said it is “a dangerous and misguided bill that targets, racially profiles, and institutionalizes bias against all residents of Indian and South Asian origin, as well as a few other vulnerable communities of color.""Kalra said California legislators should be protecting everyone's civil rights, but “they are instead trampling the fundamental constitutional rights of specific minority communities.”According to a 2021 report by the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies, Asians, including South Asians, hold 37.8% of technical roles and 25.3% of leadership roles at Silicon Valley's largest tech companies.In 2020, California regulators sued Cisco Systems saying a Dalit Indian engineer faced caste discrimination at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters. In another case, Tanuja Gupta, quit her senior manager job at Google News last year after blowback over inviting Soundararajan to speak to employees during April, which is Dalit History Month. The talk was canceled and Gupta accused her former employer of retaliation, which Google has denied.Gupta said she is backing the bill because those facing caste discrimination have no protection or legal recourse right now.“This is the form of accountability we need,” she said. “People are afraid to speak up when they are discriminated against because they are afraid to rock the boat and they fear they may lose their job or employment visa. It's a hard cycle to break and you can only do it when someone is willing to risk everything.”Caste is “not a religious issue, but a civil rights issue,” said Gupta.Shakeel Syed, executive director of South Asian Network in Artesia, California, said he sees caste discrimination among workers and he has helped in cases where caste played a role in wage theft and housing discrimination.“When hardworking people are not respected or valued simply because of their caste, that is just blatantly wrong,” he said.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843883,Americans' faith in banks low after failures: AP-NORC poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Only 10% of U.S. adults say they have high confidence in the nation’s banks and other financial institutions, a new poll finds. That's down from the 22% who said they had high confidence in 2020.Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month, the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also finds that a majority say the government is not doing enough to regulate the industry.The underwhelming assessment of America’s banks and bank regulation comes after a series of shocks brought back disturbing memories of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.Silicon Valley Bank, the nation’s 16th-biggest, failed March 10 after making risky bets in the bond market. Two days later, regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank, which had gotten involved in cryptocurrencies. Across the Atlantic Ocean, long-troubled Credit Suisse was acquired by rival UBS on Sunday in a shotgun marriage designed to restore confidence in global financial institutions.In the United States, the tumult has raised questions among policymakers about 2018 legislation that rolled back strict regulations put in place after the financial crisis.The poll suggests the U.S. public shares that concern: 56% say the government isn’t doing enough to regulate banks and other financial institutions, while 27% say it’s doing the right amount and 15% say it’s regulating too much. The worry about under-regulation is bipartisan: 63% of Democrats say current bank regulation is insufficient, as do 51% of Republicans.U.S. Marine Corps veteran Philip Metscher, 53, a stay-at-home father of seven in Sacramento, California, said he has little faith in bankers or the government agencies that are supposed to regulate them.“It’s like they have free rein to do whatever they want with money,’’ said Metscher, a Republican.The poll finds that in addition to the 10% of Americans saying that they have high confidence in the nation’s banking institutions, 57% do have some confidence; 31% have hardly any.Though confidence in banks and financial institutions has decreased even since the last time that question was asked on an AP-NORC poll in 2020, low confidence among Americans in their public institutions is nothing new — the General Social Survey, which has tracked trends in public opinion for decades, shows that confidence in institutions ranging from the financial industry to organized religion and from the news media to Congress has declined substantially since the 1970s. The new poll shows few Americans have high confidence in any branch of the U.S. government.There's been little change in the already glum assessment of the U.S. economy since a month ago, before the recent banking system turmoil, the poll shows. Only a quarter say national economic conditions are good; three quarters call them poor.But 43% of Democrats call the economy good, versus just 7% of Republicans.About half of U.S. adults describe their personal financial situations as good, a drop from last year when about 6 in 10 said that. About 6 in 10 Democrats and about half of Republicans give positive assessments of their current finances.With a Democrat in the White House, Republicans are more likely than Democrats (36% versus 15%) to say their finances will get worse over the next year; 38% of Democrats say they expect their finances to improve, versus 22% of Republicans.Overall, about half of U.S. adults expect U.S. economic conditions to deteriorate over the next year. Again, there’s a political divide: About three-quarters of Republicans but only a third of Democrats expect the national economy to worsen.American households have been hit hard by inflation, which began to pick up in the spring of 2021. Adjusted for inflation, U.S. hourly wages have fallen for 23 straight months compared to a year earlier.“You never know what’s going on. It’s paycheck to paycheck,’’ said Metscher in Sacramento. “I’m looking at food prices, gas prices. It reminds me of being a kid growing up’’ during the high-inflation 1970s.Tyronda Springer, 28, a mother of two in Banks, Alabama, who works in a warehouse loading trucks, is struggling with the cost of living.“I get paid every two weeks,’’ she said. “One of my checks goes straight to daycare. The rest is what I have to use to pay the bills. It’s just ridiculous.’’ But Springer, a Democrat, blames businesses, not President Joe Biden or the government, for ratcheting prices higher. “The government can only do so much,’’ she said.In response to surging consumer prices, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate nine times over the past year, including by a quarter-point on Wednesday. But the rate hikes are putting a strain on banks. In fact, Silicon Valley Bank ran into trouble as higher rates pushed down the value of its investments in bonds.“It’s a financial house of cards,’’ said Bryan Martin, 49, of Westfield, New York, who works at a sewage treatment plant.“The Fed is stuck,’’ said Martin, who does not identify with either political party but leans Republican. The central bank has to raise interest rates to fight inflation, but higher rates are hurting the financial system. “These banks,’’ he said, “are starting to fail.’’Darlene Brady, 72, a retired nurse’s aide in Butler, Pennsylvania, has limited confidence in banks. Still, Brady, a Democrat, is not worried about her own bank savings, thanks to federal deposit insurance that covers up to $250,000.“I’m way below that,’’ she said. ___The poll of 1,081 adults was conducted Mar. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843884,Doctors may miss how addiction patients cheat drug tests,"Doctors often use urine tests to make sure patients taking medication for opioid addiction are sticking with treatment. A new study suggests they may be missing some cheaters.Nearly 8% of these patients sometimes spike their urine by adding their treatment medicine, buprenorphine, to the samples. Such spiking may go unnoticed by doctors who use rapid tests instead of more sophisticated lab tests that can reveal who's cheating.“These patients are at particularly high risk for opioid overdose, as they are not receiving the protective effects of buprenorphine,” said Dr. Jarratt Pytell of University of Colorado School of Medicine, who led the study published Wednesday by JAMA Psychiatry.About 2.4 million U.S. adults are prescribed this gold standard medication for opioid addiction. It works by preventing craving and is often paired with counseling and other support. With overdose deaths climbing, Congress recently made it easier for more doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, which is sold under the brand name Suboxone.In the study, researchers looked at more than 500,000 urine test results from Millennium Health, a large laboratory. The tests had been ordered by doctors from 2017 through April 2022.Less than 2% of samples — from 7.6% of patients — had evidence that patients directly added buprenorphine to the urine specimen. Spiking was indicated by a low amount of a substance produced as buprenorphine breaks down in the liver.Suspicious specimens were more likely to be collected in primary care doctor's offices than in specialty treatment clinics. And patients with evidence of spiked samples were more likely to test positive for heroin or fentanyl use.Doctors shouldn't cut off patients who cheat, Pytell said. That could lead to overdose. Instead, a suspicious result should prompt a frank discussion and possibly a higher level of care. Doctors should discuss whether patients are struggling with inadequate housing, mental health issues or financial strain.“When patients tamper with their urine specimen it often indicates that they are unstable in their recovery and they could use more help,” said study co-author Brendan Saloner of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Unfortunately, many patients are punished either by their program or by some legal authority, and they therefore have reasons why they may want to mask that they are not taking their buprenorphine as prescribed.”Dr. Kim Dougan, a primary care doctor in the Seattle area, has treated hundreds of patients with buprenorphine.“People not only get their life back, they get their jobs back, they get their families back,” Dougan said. Her new patients take a weekly urine test that is sent to a lab. Long-term, stable patients do an annual test.If lab results look suspicious, she brings it up with the patient, but doesn’t punish or judge.“My job is to say, ‘What’s going on here?’” Dougan said. “Being open and nonjudgmental is important.""___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843885,Portland Thorns open new NWSL season looking to defend title,"PORTLAND THORNS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-3-9, won the NWSL title over the Kansas City Current.COACH: Mike Norris.KEY PLAYERS: Sophia Smith, Christine Sinclair, Crystal Dunn.OUTLOOK: The Thorns defeated the Kansas City Current 2-0 to win last season's NWSL title, the team's third. They also won it in 2013, the league's first season, and again in 2017. Forward Sophia Smith was named the NWSL MVP last season as well as the championship game MVP. The team parted ways with coach Rhian Wilkinson after she self-reported inappropriate communication with a player. Portland promoted assistant Mike Norris to head coach for the 2023 season. The Thorns have a loaded roster, which this season could prove problematic with many players headed to the World Cup.___OL REIGN2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-4-7, lost to the Kansas City Current in the semifinals.COACH: Laura Harvey.KEY PLAYERS: Megan Rapinoe, Rose Lavelle, Alana CookOUTLOOK: The Reign won the Supporters Shield for the third time last season. But the Reign fell to the Kansas City Current in the playoffs. The Reign have three players who have been with the team since the start of the league in 2013: Megan Rapinoe, Jess Fishlock and Lauren Barnes. Laura Harvey is the winningest coach in NWSL history. Still, the Reign have never won a title. The team made Lumen Field, home of the MLS Sounders and the NFL's Seahawks, their permanent home field last season. The Reign will play a doubleheader with the Sounders on June 3.___RACING LOUISVILLE2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 5-9-8, ninth in the standings.COACH: Kim BjorkegrenKEY PLAYERS: Abby Erceg, Carson Pickett, Jess McDonald.OUTLOOK: Racing made a pair of notable moves in the offseason: They signed Nigerian forward Uchenna Kanu from Tigres in Liga MX and acquired defenders Carson Pickett and Abby Erceg in a trade with North Carolina for Emily Fox. Kanu, 25, should give Louisville an offensive boost after scoring 23 goals in 38 appearances with Tigres. Pickett and Erceg shore up a defense that gave up 35 goals last season. Wang Shuang, who joined Louisville in August, has her footing in the league now and should provide additional firepower.___ANGEL CITY2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 8-9-5, eighth in the standings.COACH: Freya Coombe.KEY PLAYERS: Christen Press, Sydney Leroux, Sarah Gorden.OUTLOOK: Press was Angel City's big signing for the team's debut last year but she was sidelined for much of the season after tearing the ACL in her right knee. She said on social media that she needed three surgeries over eight months. But it appears she'll be back at some point this season after U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said she was in “return-to-play protocol.” Defender Sarah Gorden also tore the ACL in her right knee last year but appeared in a preseason match against Club America, playing for 65 minutes. Angel City has a player to watch this season in No. 1 draft pick Alyssa Thompson, the first high schooler drafted in the league.___SAN DIEGO WAVE2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-6-6, lost to the Portland Thorns 2-1 in the semifinals.COACH: Casey Stoney.KEY PLAYERS: Alex Morgan, Naomi Girma, Kailen Sheridan.OUTLOOK: The Wave were the surprise of last season but expectations were high from the start for the Casey Stoney-led club. Alex Morgan scored 16 goals and the Wave became the first true NWSL expansion team to make the playoffs. They advanced to the semifinals but lost to eventual champion Portland. The team also set the NWSL attendance record in September when 32,000 fans were on hand for a rivalry game against Angel City at Snapdragon Stadium. Expect more of the same this season from the Wave, who have a loaded lineup including Naomi Girma, Taylor Kornieck and goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.___CHICAGO RED STARS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 9-7-6, lost to the San Diego Wave in the opening round of the playoffs.COACH: Chris Petrucelli.KEY PLAYERS: Mallory Swanson, Alyssa Naeher, Tierna Davidson.OUTLOOK: Chicago has made the postseason for seven straight seasons but the team has never won a title. Mallory Swanson had 11 goals for the Red Stars last season before going on a tear for the U.S. national team to start 2023. While she provides the offense, national team goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher holds down the defense. Defender Tierna Davidson missed last season with an ACL injury but coach Chris Petrucelli said she's ready for the start of this season. Swanson's husband, shortstop Dansby Swanson, will be nearby after signing a seven-year deal with the Chicago Cubs in the offseason.__KANSAS CITY CURRENT2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-6-6, lost to the Portland Thorns in the title game.COACH: Matt Potter.KEY PLAYERS: Debinha, Desiree Scott, AD Franch.OUTLOOK: The Current opened last season hoping new acquisitions Sam Mewis and Lynn Williams would take the team to the next level but both sustained season-ending injuries. Williams has since moved on to Racing Louisville and Mewis' injury has proven more serious. She's already been ruled out for the season. Even without those two, the Current finished fifth in the league and went on to play in the championship game, where they lost to the Thorns. The Current made a big move in the offseason, signing Brazilian midfielder Debinha.___ORLANDO PRIDE2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 5-7-10, 10th in the standings.COACH: Seb Hines.KEY PLAYERS: Marta, Adriana, Ally Watt.OUTLOOK: The Pride are in the midst of a rebuild. Seb Hines was interim coach last season before getting the job outright in November. Legendary forward Marta missed most of last season after tearing her ACL but she's back. Marta is a six-time FIFA Best Player of the Year and is the top career scorer for the Brazilian national team, among both men and women. The Pride signed fellow Brazilian Adriana to complement Marta. Longtime defender Toni Pressley has retired, while goalkeeper Erin McLeod and midfielder Gunny Jonsdottir stepped away from the NWSL to play in Iceland.___NY/NJ GOTHAM2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 4-17-1, last place in the standings.COACH: Juan Carlos Amoros.KEY PLAYERS: Kristie Mewis, Margaret Purce, Kelley O'HaraOUTLOOK: After a disappointing last-place showing in 2022, Gotham added a few key pieces in the offseason — including Lynn Williams, who spent last season with Kansas City recovering from a serious hamstring injury. Williams, Margaret “Midge” Purce and Ifeoma Onumonu will form a formidable front line. The team also added U.S. national team vet Kelley O'Hara and traded with Portland for Yazmeen Ryan. There's really nowhere to go but up: Gotham allowed a league-high 46 goals last season while scoring a league-low 16 goals.___WASHINGTON SPIRIT2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 3-9-10, 11th in the standings.COACH: Mark Parsons.KEY PLAYERS: Trinity Rodman, Ashley Hatch, Andi Sullivan.OUTLOOK: The Spirit, like the league as a whole, is coming off a turbulent couple of seasons. But the team has hired Mark Parsons, who also coached the club from 2013-15 before stints with the Thorns and the Dutch national team. Michelle Kang is investing in the club after a contentious ownership battle, and the Spirit are still looking to rebrand. But there's some serious talent on the roster, led by 20-year-old Trinity Rodman, the highest-paid player in the league, who had eight goals last season. The Spirit also brought in Chloe Ricketts, who at 15 is one of the youngest players in the league.___NORTH CAROLINA COURAGE2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 9-8-5, seventh in the standings.COACH: Sean Nahas.KEY PLAYERS: Emily Fox, Casey Murphy, Brianna Pinto.OUTLOOK: The Courage lost many notable players. Debinha went to Kansas City, defenders Carson Pickett and Abby Erceg were traded to Racing Louisville for Emily Fox. Diana Ordonez was sent to the Houston Dash. The team brought in Tyler Lussi to shore up the defense. The turnover could mean that goalkeeper Casey Murphy will be tested early. North Carolina narrowly missed the playoffs last season, marking the first missed postseason since the team moved from New York in 2017.___HOUSTON DASH2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-6-6, lost to the Kansas City Current in the opening round.COACH: Dan Laity.KEY PLAYERS: Diana Ordonez, Ebony Salmon, Sophie Schmidt.OUTLOOK: Diana Ordonez scored 11 goals for the North Carolina Courage last season, breaking the league record for goals scored by a rookie. She was traded to the Dash during the offseason and signed a three-year deal with the club. The Dash overall will have a new look under coach Dan Laity, who was a former assistant on Laura Harvey's staff with the Reign. The Dash qualified for the playoffs for the first time last season after joining the league in 2014 and hope to continue the upward trend this season.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843886,"After player input, MLB allows some pitch clock delays","NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball has clarified its new rules to allow umpires to delay the start of the pitch clock after big swings in which a hitter loses footing or when a pitcher covers first base, third or home, in addition to other clarifications announced Wednesday.The commissioner’s office said in its memo that if a catcher ends an inning on base, at bat or on deck, an umpire may determine the catcher needs additional time and allow the pitcher another warmup throw and the catcher to throw to second base.The MLB also said whether a defensive team violated the new shift restrictions will be subject to a video review only involving the first player to touch a ball after a pitch.The league also said that after a batter uses his one allowed timeout during a plate appearance, the clock shall start when the hitter indicates he is ready in addition to the previous specification when he returned to the batter’s box.The clarifications ahead of March 30 openers were contained in a four-page memo sent by MLB senior vice president Michael Hill to managers, general managers and assistant general managers, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.“They’re important in my mind because they’re responsive to things players said to us,” Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday night before Japan beat the United States 3-2 in the World Baseball Classic championship game.Baseball’s 11-man competition committee, established in the labor agreement last March, adopted the pitch clock and shift limits last September over the opposition of the four players on the panel. MLB set the pitch clock at 15 seconds with no runners and 20 seconds with runners.The average time of spring training games through Monday was down 25 minutes to 2 hours, 36 minutes. Violations per game were 1.03 during the past week, down from 2.03 during spring training's first week, according to the memo.Teams were told bat boys and girls in the visiting dugout will meet with the visiting club before each series to discuss the player preferences. MLB said it will monitor the bat boys and girls to determine whether they contribute to non-compliance with the pace of game procedures.MLB said it will issue guidance to teams Friday on use of PitchCom by pitchers. Catchers were allowed to use the device to call pitches last season, and pitchers were allowed to experiment with it during spring training.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

(AP) — Six people were killed when a passenger vehicle pulled into a work zone along the Baltimore beltway and struck construction workers there, Maryland State Police said Wednesday.Troopers responded to the work zone on northbound Interstate 695 at Security Boulevard in the Woodlawn area around 12:40 p.m. for a report of a pedestrian crash, police said in a news release. Emergency medical service personnel pronounced six people, all of them workers, dead on the scene, and the driver of the car was taken to the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Shock Trauma Center, police said.The preliminary investigation found that the vehicle pulled between the jersey walls of the work zone for unknown reasons and hit multiple workers before overturning, police said. The driver’s identity is unknown, police said. Late Wednesday, police said investigators believe a second vehicle that stayed on the scene may have been involved in the crash.The crash closed the beltway in both directions for hours, snarling traffic along the west side of the highway that encircles the city. Baltimore County Fire Department officials called the crash “extremely serious” and asked drivers to avoid the area.Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski called the incident horrific.“We offer our sincere condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who have lost their lives in today’s tragic crash,” he wrote in a tweet.The cause of the crash remains under investigation.Police didn’t release the names of those who were killed pending the notification of next of kin.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843888,Michigan GOP slammed for comparing gun reform to Holocaust,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The Michigan Republican Party has received backlash from political leaders on both sides of the aisle for posts on social media Wednesday that compared the Holocaust to gun safety measures being considered in the state.The posts, shared on the state party’s official Facebook and Twitter accounts, inaccurately claim that Democrats leading the Legislature are trying to disarm Michigan gun owners. A photo accompanying the message appears to match an image stored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, showing rings confiscated from Jewish prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp.“Comparing gun safety measures to the mass extermination of 6 million people is hateful and ignorant, and it comes from party leaders who are out of ideas and catering to the fringe of the fringe,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter in response.The gun safety package was introduced by Democrats in response to two school mass shootings in a 15-month span, including last month’s Michigan State University shooting that took place less than 4 miles (6 kilometers) from the state Capitol. It would add universal background checks, requirements for safe storage and extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws.Red flag laws are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior through a judge's order and at the request of law enforcement or family members in hopes of preventing them from hurting themselves or others.The 11-bill package was passed by the state Senate last week and still needs to be approved by the Democratic-led House before heading to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk — who has said she will sign the legislation.Democrats and Republicans swiftly condemned the posts and called for them to be taken down. Matt Brooks, chief executive of the Republican Jewish Coalition, responded to the Twitter post, saying it “is absolutely inappropriate and offensive and should be taken down immediately.”The Anti-Defamation League separately tweeted that “using the Holocaust as a way to score cheap political points in the debate over gun control is unacceptable and trivializes the memory of millions murdered by the Nazis.""Recently-elected Michigan GOP chairwoman Kristina Karamo wrote on Twitter that the state party “stands by our statement"" and added that the Democratic party “currently fights to murder unborn children” and is attempting to “disarm us.”A former community college professor, Karamo lost her secretary of state race in the 2022 midterms by 14 percentage points after mounting a campaign filled with election conspiracies. After winning the GOP chairwoman seat, she inherited a state party torn by infighting and millions in debt.The social media posts follow a recent wave of comparisons to the Holocaust and Nazis that scholars and organizations have said are concerning.Pope Francis compared Nicaragua’s repression of Catholics to Adolf Hitler’s rule in Germany earlier this month, while in Britain, a BBC sportscaster likened the nation’s asylum policy to 1930s Germany, resulting in his brief suspension and a national uproar.Earlier this month, a man was charged with threatening the lives of Jewish Michigan public officials, after tweeting that he would ""carry out the punishment of death to anyone” who is Jewish in the state's government.Michigan had the fourth most reported white supremacist propaganda of any state in 2022, according to the Anti-Defamation League.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843893,What to know about new research on coffee and heart risks,"Coffee lovers — and their doctors — have long wondered whether a jolt of java can affect the heart. New research published Wednesday finds that drinking caffeinated coffee did not significantly affect one kind of heart hiccup that can feel like a skipped beat.But it did signal a slight increase in another type of irregular heartbeat in people who drank more than one cup per day. And it found that people tend to walk more and sleep less on the days they drank coffee.Coffee is one of the most common beverages in the world. In the U.S., two-thirds of Americans drink coffee every day, more than bottled water, tea or tap water, according to the National Coffee Association, a trade group. Coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant, which is widely regarded as safe for healthy adults at about 400 milligrams per day, or roughly the equivalent of four or five cups brewed at home.Coffee has been associated with multiple health benefits and even a lower risk of dying, based on large studies that observed participants’ behavior. Despite research that has shown moderate coffee consumption doesn’t raise the risk of heart rhythm problems, some professional medical societies still caution against consuming caffeine.The latest research:THE EXPERIMENTResearchers outfitted 100 healthy volunteers with gadgets that continuously monitored their heart function, daily steps, sleep patterns and blood sugar. The volunteers, who were mostly younger than 40, were sent daily text messages over two weeks instructing them to drink or avoid caffeinated coffee on certain days. The results were reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.This type of study, which directly measures the biological effects of drinking or not drinking caffeinated coffee in the same people, is rare and provides a dense array of data points, said study co-author Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who specializes in treating heart arrhythmias.THE FINDINGSResearchers found that drinking caffeinated coffee did not result in more daily episodes of extra heartbeats, known as premature atrial contractions. These extra beats that begin in the heart's upper chambers are common and typically don't cause problems. But they have been shown to predict a potentially dangerous heart condition called atrial fibrillation.They also found slight evidence of another kind of irregular heartbeat that comes from the lower heart chambers, called premature ventricular contractions. Such beats are also common and not usually serious, but they have been associated with a higher risk of heart failure. The researchers found more of these early beats in people on the days they drank coffee, but only in those who drank two or more cups per day.The volunteers logged about 1,000 more steps per day on the days they drank coffee — and they slept about 36 minutes less, the study found. There was almost no difference in blood sugar levels.One interesting result: People with genetic variants that make them break down caffeine faster experienced less of a sleep deficit, while folks with variants that lead them to metabolize caffeine more slowly lost more sleep.WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUBecause the study was performed in a small number of people over a short period of time, the results don’t necessarily apply to the general population, said Dr. Dave Kao, a cardiologist and health data expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. However, the study is consistent with others that have found coffee is safe and it offers a rare controlled evaluation of caffeine’s effect, Kao added.Co-author Marcus cautions that the effects of drinking coffee can vary from person to person. He said he advises his patients with heart arrhythmias to experiment on their own to see how caffeine affects them.“They’re often delighted to get the good news that it’s OK to try coffee and drink coffee,” he said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843894,"NYC guards lead Michigan State, K-State to Sweet 16 at MSG","NEW YORK (AP) — Stories of New York City point guards have an almost mythical quality.There are Hall of Famers and trailblazers such as Bob Cousy and Nate “Tiny” Archibald. In the 1980s, Kenny Smith and Kenny Anderson followed a similar path — from the same Catholic high school in Queens to the Atlantic Coast Conference to the NBA.From Pearl Washington to Mark Jackson, Stephon Marbury to Sue Bird, tenacious players forged by rugged games played at the famous courts at Rucker Park and West Fourth Street are a part of basketball lore.And while New York City high schools haven't been pumping out stars in recent years the way they used to, three of the four teams that have reached the NCAA Tournament's East Regional at Madison Square Garden have point guards with Big Apple backgrounds.Michigan State's Tyson Walker and Kansas State's Markquis Nowell will renew their acquaintance in the Sweet 16 when the seventh-seeded Spartans (21-12) face the third-seeded Wildcats (25-9) on Thursday night.“I grew up playing in parks with him,” Nowell said. “I just want to give a big shoutout to New York City for breeding tough and gritty guards and just give him a shoutout.”The other point guard who's making a homecoming this week will only be able to watch his team at The Garden. No. 4 seed Tennessee managed to reach the second weekend of the tournament without the injured Zakai Zeigler, who blew out his left knee on Feb. 28.“I had no doubt in my mind that we were going to be here in this situation,” said Zeigler, who grew up on Long Island and finished his high school career in the Bronx. “So now that I'm back here and I can have some pizza, I feel great.”The Volunteers (25-10) face ninth-seeded FAU (33-3) in the late game of the doubleheader.The 5-foot-8 Nowell became one of the breakout stars of this NCAA Tournament when he went off for 27 points in a second-round victory against Kentucky.Nowell, whose Twitter handle is @MrNewYorkCityy and is @mr.newyorkcity on Instagram, grew up in Harlem, attended high school in the Bronx and went to college at Arkansas Little-Rock before transferring to Manhattan — Kansas, that is.“I made a promise to myself back when I was in high school that I was going to do anything and everything in my power to be the best player that came out of New York,” Nowell said. “So I kind of keep that edge and that kind of just reminds me every day that I wake up that I still have more work to do. Guys like Carmelo (Anthony), Bernard King and all the greats came out of New York, so that just keeps me grounded and keeps me working hard.”Ask Nowell about the New York City point guards he idolized in high school and he brings up the Mavericks' Kemba Walker, who led UConn to a national championship and was a first-round pick in the NBA draft in 2011, and the Pelicans' Jose Alvarado, who played at Georgia Tech.Alvarado went to Christ the King High School in Queens, a power in both boys and girls basketball that also produced Bird and the Spartans' Walker.Like Nowell, Walker started his college career at a mid-major (Northeastern) and transferred after two seasons to Michigan State in 2021.According to 247 Sports rankings, the last top-30 national recruit to come from a New York City high school was Moses Brown, a 7-footer who went to UCLA from Archbishop Molloy, where Smith and Anderson starred in the ’80s.“Are we as good as we once was? Well, if you take away all the kids that grew up in New York that go to prep school outside of New York ... and consider them New York, yes, we are,” said Cardozo High School coach Ron Neclario, the winningest NYC public school coach ever. “Do we have as many high, high, high majors? Maybe not, but we have plenty of low-majors. We have plenty of mid-majors.”Where Nowell leans into his New York roots, Walker takes a low-key approach.“Just got to be tough. Got a different type of finesse with you,” he said.Walker was also a difference-maker in the second round of the tournament, scoring 23 points to lead Michigan State past second-seeded Marquette.“I think sometimes the New York swagger is a very cocky swagger, and sometimes that’s good,” Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. “He’s kind of had the happy medium. He’s got enough cockiness to be confident, and yet he’s an unbelievable kid.”Izzo joked after beating Marquette about how Walker owed him cab ride and a slice of pizza for helping him earn a trip home.“Got me my pizza last night,"" Izzo said. ""I’m looking for the cab ride today.”Nowell is one of four Kansas State players from the New York area, along with Tykei Greene, Nae'Qwan Tomlin and Ismael Massoud. None has ever played at The Garden, only dreamed about it.“I had my big brother, my father, my uncles working me out every day for a moment like this,” Nowell said. “Standing here, being here at Madison Square Garden.”___March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843895,Report: Killer of Jesuits in Mexico found shot to death,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The sister of a drug gang leader accused of murdering two Jesuit priests last year has identified a body found shot to death in northern Mexico as her brother, prosecutors said Wednesday.The murder of the two beloved Jesuit priests in June 2022 had shocked Mexico, and Jesuits said the suspect's death, if confirmed, would only prove that the Mexican government can’t catch criminals and has lost control of parts of the country.The body is believed to be that of accused killer José Noriel Portillo Gil, alias “El Chueco,” or “The Crooked One.” Despite nine months of supposed searches for Portillo Gil, the circumstances of his death suggest he was executed by his own or a rival drug gang. Portillo Gil's gang was also implicated in the 2018 killing of an American travelling in the area.César Jáuregui, the chief prosecutor of the northern state of Sinaloa, said police received a report about a dead body Tuesday in the town of Choix, an area dominated by the Sinaloa drug cartel.Jáuregui said Diana Carolina Portillo, the suspect's sister, identified the body of the man, who was believed to have been shot to death some time Monday.Jáuregui said “we cannot conclusively determine this case is closed until we have scientific proof,” he told a news conference.But the corpse was relatively fresh, found in a field only a day after the man was killed, and the face was intact, making the sister's identification very plausible.The Society of Jesus, as the Jesuits are known, said Wednesday that the mere fact that Portillo Gil had been shot to death didn’t mean justice had been done.“If it is confirmed that this is the person implicated in the murder of the two Jesuit priests, his turning up dead can in no way be considered a triumph for justice, or a solution to the structural problem of violence” in the mountainous Sierra Tarahumara region, the Jesuits said in a statement.“On the contrary, the lack of an adequate legal process in the murder case would only imply the Mexican government has failed in its basic duties and confirm that the authorities do not have control of the territory,” according to the Society of Jesus.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and the Defense Department had vowed to find Portillo Gil and bring him to justice.It is not uncommon in Mexico for cartels to kill one of their own members, if their misdeeds have resulted in increased police or military pressure that affects the gang's business.López Obrador stressed earlier Wednesday that the body's identity had not yet been proven by tests.On June 20, Portillo Gil allegedly killed the two Jesuit priests and a tour guide, after the guide ran into a church in the neighboring state of Chihuahua to seek refuge, and the priests tried to protect the guide.The Jesuits have vowed to remain in the Tarahumara mountains, where the order has ministered to the Rarámuri Indigenous community for centuries.The murdered priests, the Rev. Javier Campos, 79, and the Rev. Joaquín Mora, 80, had spent much of their lives serving the Rarámuri community in the Chihuahua town of Cerocahui, despite fierce violence by drug gangs and illegal loggers in the area.Portillo Gil was also accused in the 2018 killing of Patrick Braxton-Andrew, a 34-year-old Spanish teacher from North Carolina who was traveling in the Tarahumara mountains.Portillo Gil’s gang apparently suspected Braxton-Andrew of being a U.S. drug agent and killed him.Despite the criminality, the area’s natural beauty continues to draw tourists. The Tarahumara mountains are known for their dramatic scenery, and the long endurance runs that the Rarámuri people have long practiced.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843896,"FAU doesn't want the slipper, it wants March Madness crown","NEW YORK (AP) — Florida Atlantic isn't looking for a slipper to wear at the Sweet 16 dance in the East Region.Coach Dusty May and his ninth-seeded Owls don't consider themselves a Cinderella team. FAU is 33-3 — a win total matched only by No. 1 seed Houston among the 16 teams still fighting for the national title.Forget that this Conference USA member is located among the trendy, white-sanded beaches of Boca Raton, Florida, and that the team plays what opponents consider a high school gym (it seats roughly 2,900). This is a good basketball team that will be taking on fourth-seeded Tennessee of the Southeastern Conference on Thursday evening at Madison Square Garden.May said people can say anything they want about Florida Atlantic.“We’re very, very confident in our abilities and those guys in the locker room,” he said Wednesday. ""We’ve never thought of ourselves in that regard (Cinderella) just because of the success of our league and our guys being able to do what they did over a 20-game schedule. But we’ll take it.""Whatever gets the people cheering for us, we’re open.""The Owls are talented, very focused and basketball junkies. More often than not, May has to kick his players out of the gym at night.After knocking off Western Kentucky in the opening-round game of the Conference USA Tournament, the team was supposed to return to their hotel and eat dinner. They started watching film of their next opponent, Middle Tennessee, instead. Then they beat Middle Tennessee, followed by Alabama-Birmingham for the the league title and the automatic NCAA bid, their second overall.It was no fluke. The Owls hold a school-record 20-game winning streak and were ranked this season for the first time in school history. Their wins over Memphis and Fairleigh Dickinson in the first two rounds of the tournament were their first in any postseason tournament — ever.Now comes Tennessee (25-10), an SEC powerhouse playing in its fourth straight NCAA Tournament under coach Rick Barnes.“We feel like it’s the year of the underdog,” FAU guard Alijah Martin said. “You know, we’re the underdogs, being a mid-major kind playing a lot of high majors and stuff like that. We’re just trying to stay levelheaded and stay locked in and try to get the job done.”Florida Atlantic has come a long way under May, a former University of Florida assistant. He took over a program that had seven straight losing seasons and he has posted five straight winning ones, highlighted by this season.After losing a lot of close games last season, guard Brandon Weatherspoon said the Owls attacked this season frame by frame and tightened ranks.“We've kind of seen this coming,” he said. “I don't want to say Cinderella because we went on a 20-game streak. We didn't have the media attention, which we don’t care about. We just like to play basketball.”If anything has gone wrong, it was the end of Sunday's second-round game against FDU. With the final seconds winding down and the Knights basically conceding, Martin showboated on a dunk.“It wasn’t necessary, we had won the game, no point rubbing it their face. I take full responsibility that,” Martin said. “They have a nice team over there and they worked hard to get here as well.”Guard Nick Boyd hopes that doesn't present the Owls in the wrong light moving forward.“We are all good guys. We’re not villains,” Boyd said. ""What happened, that was totally out of emotion. It was not meant to be personal or disrespectful to anybody. We want to be good guys out here. We’re not villains. We’re just having fun.""Barnes said he expects FAU to be a tough out. The Owls beat Florida. Tennessee didn't.“You look at their team, they’re smart,"" Barnes said, “they know each other well, great concepts on the offensive end, very sound defensively, and they should be a very highly confident team, because you win 33 games, it speaks volumes.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843897,2 employees of town near planned Ford truck plant indicted,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Two employees of a rural Tennessee town that resisted a takeover attempt by the state after Ford Motor Co. announced plans to build an electric truck plant nearby have been charged with the theft of town funds and official misconduct, officials said Wednesday.Reva Marshall, the former finance officer for the town of Mason, and Michele Scott, Mason's human resources manager, have been indicted by grand juries in two counties, the Tennessee Comptroller's Office said in a news release and an investigative report.Both Marshall and Scott were charged with receiving tens of thousands of dollars in improper wages, benefits and reimbursements from Mason by submitting timesheets for many more hours than they actually worked, officials said. They also worked full-time for the Memphis-Shelby County Schools system while also employed by Mason, receiving compensation from both entities for the same hours of work, officials said.In a report released Wednesday, investigators also questioned tens of thousands of dollars in credit card transactions and reimbursements by town employees.Marshall and Scott were indicted in west Tennessee's Tipton County, where Mason is located, and in Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Online court records did not show if they had lawyers to speak on their behalf about the charges.Mason's mayor did not immediately respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.The allegations are the latest in a string of financial problems that have beset Mason, located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northeast of Memphis. The state comptroller’s office said the town has experienced 20 years of financial mismanagement.The 2020 Census shows Mason’s population at about 1,330. But that fell to less than 800 after a private prison closed.The town’s current leadership is mostly Black, but white leaders were in charge for many of the years that the state said Mason’s affairs were mismanaged. The town has seen investigations into misconduct and accounting irregularities, including one by the comptroller’s office cited in a report in 2016, when its leaders were mostly white. Several officials resigned.Last year, Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower asked Mason’s town leaders to surrender their charter, pointing to the financial mismanagement. After Mason voters refused to do so, Mumpower later said the state would take over its financial supervision.The news of the takeover attempt sparked national attention as many questioned its timing because Mason is near the site of a future $5.6 billion Ford electric pickup truck factory. The plant is expected to employ about 5,600 workers at the plant, and construction will create thousands more jobs.Town leaders filed a lawsuit — with the help of the NAACP — hoping to stop a full takeover of its finances. Mason and the state later struck a deal for a scaled-back supervision of the town's finances.“The Comptroller’s Office continues to have enhanced supervision over the Town of Mason’s fiscal condition,” the news release said. “This includes ensuring the town maintains a balanced budget; requiring the town to provide monthly financial records and reports to the Comptroller’s Office; and requiring implementation of policies to address audit findings.”Construction has begun for the planned Ford factory in neighboring Haywood County. Officials say the plant, called BlueOval City, will boost west Tennessee’s economy. The factory is expected to bring both small and large businesses to the area, including hotels, restaurants, health care facilities and suppliers for the plant, among others. Real estate values also could increase.Ford has said it has not been directly involved with Mason's financial situation, but it has reached out to state and local community leaders about it.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843898,Oil exec held for 5 years in Venezuela sues Citgo for $100M,"HOUSTON (AP) — One of the Citgo oil executives who was held for nearly five years in Venezuela has sued his company for $100 million, alleging it conspired in his detention and then abandoned him and his family as he wasted away in horrific prison conditions for a crime he didn’t commit.Tomeu Vadell was one of six executives who worked for Houston-based Citgo when they were lured to Venezuela right before Thanksgiving in 2017 to attend a meeting at the headquarters of the company’s parent, the Venezuelan-run-oil giant known as PDVSA. Once there, they were hauled from a Caracas conference room by masked security agents.A Venezuelan judge later convicted the six executives of embezzlement and sentenced them to between eight years and 13 years in prison in a trial marred by delays and irregularities.In his lawsuit, Vadell’s lawyers allege Citgo lured him and the other executives, who became known as the Citgo 6, as part of a scheme to be used as “political pawns.”The lawsuit alleges that while Citgo is based in the U.S., it remains a fully controlled subsidiary of Venezuelan-owned PDVSA. It says this relationship spurred Citgo to work with the state-run oil giant to wrongfully arrest and imprison him in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and also so that the company could “curry favor"" with the administration of Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s president.“We suffered a lot and continue to suffer,” Vadell said in a statement about himself and his family. Vadell retired from Citgo in December.U.S. officials have accused Maduro of using the men as political bargaining chips to extract concessions from the United States.One of the men was released in March 2022. The remaining five, including Vadell, were freed in October as part of a prisoner exchange with Venezuela.“All while Citgo sat on the sidelines, merely observing the terrible consequences of its decision to sacrifice and abandon its loyal employee,” according to the lawsuit, which was filed in state district court in Houston.In a statement, Citgo denied Vadell’s allegations and pushed back on his claims that the company is inextricably tied to Venezuelan-owned PDVSA, saying the lawsuit ""irresponsibly equates Citgo, an American company based in Houston, with an authoritarian regime in Venezuela.”“The Citgo 6 were our senior-most executives, and neither they nor Citgo, the company they led, are responsible for the arbitrary acts of Maduro’s repressive regime. Citgo’s leadership has supported Mr. Vadell and his family in significant financial and other ways,” the company said.Five of the men, including Vadell, are dual Venezuelan-American nationals who had lived in the U.S. for many years, while one, former Citgo president Jose Pereira, is a permanent U.S. resident.Vadell’s lawsuit alleges at one point he was held in an “overcrowded, windowless, basement dungeon cell with eight other men,” wasn’t allowed outside for months at a time and “wasted away, losing more than seventy pounds.”Vadell accuses Citgo of refusing to pay his legal fees while he was tried and convicted in Venezuela and of not paying his salary while he was arrested and imprisoned, leaving his family in financial difficulty.“We are grateful that the American government got Mr. Vadell out of this hell. It is time for Citgo to be held responsible for conspiring to wrongfully imprison this American citizen,” said Megan Moore, one of his attorneys. ___ Follow Juan A.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843899,Ex-women's prison warden gets 6 years for inmate sex abuse,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The former warden of an abuse-plagued federal women’s prison in the San Francisco Bay Area was sentenced Wednesday to nearly six years in prison for sexually abusing incarcerated women.A judge sentenced Ray J. Garcia to 70 months in prison for sexually abusing three female inmates and forcing them to pose naked for photos in their cells at the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) east of Oakland. His term will be followed by 15 years of supervised release, and he must also register as a sex offender with the state of California.A jury in December found Garcia guilty of eight counts of sexual abuse and one count of lying to the FBI. He was among five workers charged with abusing inmates at the federal correctional institution and the first to go to trial.Garcia, 55, retired from his post in 2021 after the FBI found nude photos of inmates on his government-issued phone. Garcia was charged with abusing three inmates between December 2019 and July 2021.Two of the three women Garcia was convicted of abusing spoke about what they endured before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sentenced him, the East Bay Times reported.One of them described her post-traumatic stress disorder from the abuse, the newspaper reported.“I was not seen as a name or number by the federal government, but seen as a sexual play toy,” the woman said. “Gonzalez Rogers chastised Garcia for his role in tormenting women at the federal facility.“I sentence hundreds of people; I expect and they should be able to expect that when they go into federal custody, they won’t be abused,” Gonzalez Rogers said. “And you abused them. And there was no one watching you — you were the warden, and you were the associate warden.“You were supposed to be the check. You were supposed to be the person making sure no one else did that.”An Associated Press investigation last year revealed a culture of abuse and cover-ups that had persisted for years at the prison, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) east of Oakland. That reporting led to increased scrutiny from Congress and pledges from the federal Bureau of Prisons that it would fix problems and change the culture at the prison.The trial has called into question the Bureau of Prisons’ handling of sexual abuse complaints from inmates against staff and the vetting process for the people it chooses to run its prisons.The four other charged Dublin employees are at various stages of their cases.James Theodore Highhouse, the former prison chaplain who pleaded guilty to abusing an inmate in his chapel office and lying to authorities, was sentenced in August to seven years in prison. He is appealing the punishment, arguing it exceeded federal guidelines.Enrique Chavez, a food service foreman, pleaded guilty and was sentenced last month to 20 months in prison. Ross Klinger, a recycling technician, has pleaded guilty but has not been sentenced. John Russell Bellhouse, a prison safety administrator, is scheduled to stand trial May 30.Garcia was in charge of staff and inmate training on reporting abuse and complying with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act at the same time he was committing abuse, prosecutors say, and some inmates say they were sent to solitary confinement or other prisons for accusing employees of abuse.“You entered a cesspool and then did nothing about it. You just went along with the ride and enjoyed the cesspool yourself,” Gonzalez Rogers said, the East Bay Times reported. “You should have done something about it.”Before the judge issued her ruling, Garcia admitted fault for abusing women at the prison and expressed contrition and remorse. In the process, he also waived his right to appeal the verdict and sentence.“Your honor, I stand before you today as a broken man,” Garcia said. “I could not be more ashamed. I can’t be more sorry.”“I cannot imagine the pain, fear and shame they’ve gone through as a result of my actions,” he said of his victims.The judge ordered Garcia to turn himself in and begin serving the sentence on May 19. The prison where he will serve his sentence has not been determined.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843900,Bipartisan support emerges for Senate railroad safety bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan consensus that Congress should act to toughen regulations on railroads emerged Wednesday as senators heard fresh testimony on the fiery hazardous train derailment last month on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.Both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee peppered Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw with questions about what enhanced safety measures he would support. At times they aggressively questioned the CEO of one of the nation's largest railroads on what could be done to prevent future derailments like the one that has upended life in the Ohio village of East Palestine.Shaw offered support for some safety enhancements, including training for emergency response crews and phasing out older tank car models. But he declined to endorse several key parts of the bipartisan Railway Safety Act of 2023, which is being championed by Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and JD Vance, a Republican.The bill includes requirements that trains have crews of at least two people, expands the classification for highly hazardous flammable trains and increases fines for safety violations.Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawmakers have an opportunity to “use the horrible accident to really improve rail safety.” She predicted a bill would advance to the Senate floor by April.Cantwell added the bipartisan nature of the bill, as well as the committee's recent history of considering railway safety legislation, would make it possible for lawmakers to act quickly.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is also behind the Railway Safety Act. And in the House, a bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers has also introduced a similar proposal, though top Republicans have also urged caution on enacting fresh regulations.“It is an opportunity for real and meaningful bipartisan cooperation,” said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the committee's top Republican.The East Palestine derailment has given rise to rare bipartisan cooperation in the closely-divided Senate. Democrats say they want to ensure profitable corporations like Norfolk Southern invest in safety standards and workforce before reaping profits. Republicans, at times urged by Vance to shift attention from the concerns of big business towards white, working-class communities like East Palestine, are looking to show they can deliver for an area they accuse the Biden administration of overlooking.When Shaw testified before a separate Senate committee earlier this month, he emphasized the voluntary steps Norfolk Southern are taking after the derailment and stopped short of endorsing any action by Congress. But he appeared to concede Wednesday that legislation was likely, saying there are many provisions of the Railway Safety Act that now have Norfolk Southern's “full-throated endorsement.”He also reiterated apologies for the derailment and committed to aiding East Palestine's recovery.“We won’t be finished until we make this right,” Shaw told the committee.Misti Allison, an East Palestine resident, testified at the hearing that the company has lost the trust of a deeply traumatized community. State and local officials decided to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars after the Fed. 3 derailment, prompting the evacuation of half of the roughly 5,000 residents.“They feel like Norfolk Southern is offering breadcrumbs,” she said, describing how the derailment had haunted the town with fears of the long-term effects of the release of hazardous materials.“My seven-year-old has asked me if he is going to die from living in our own home,"" Allison said. ""What do I tell him?”Senators repeatedly noted that railway safety is an issue in every state, due to the national network of tracks.“The bottom line is that what happened in East Palestine could have just as easily happened in Illinois,"" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said of her home state.The Association of American Railroads trade group, whose CEO Ian Jefferies testified Wednesday, says that railroads are still the safest way to transport hazardous material over land. Train derailments have also been getting less common, but there were still more than 1,000 last year, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. And as East Palestine shows, even a single train derailment involving hazardous materials can be disastrous.Jefferies emphasized the industry's commitment to voluntary safety measures, but also clarified that it has not officially taken a position on the Railway Safety Act.The bill takes sides in a long-running disagreement between railroad worker unions and operators by requiring train crews to continue to have two people, although the train that derailed in East Palestine had a three-person crew. Unions argue that railroads are riskier because of job cuts in the industry over the past six years. Nearly one-third of all rail jobs were eliminated and train crews, they say, are fatigued and under pressure to perform safety inspections in a matter of seconds.Shaw was pressed to support a two-person requirement for crews, but declined. Instead, he said, “We are a data-driven organization and I’m not aware of any data that links crew size with safety.”Senators pushing the new safety requirements, like Ohio's Brown, argued Shaw's stance is emblematic of an industry that is putting efficiency and profits over safety.""Railroads want only one person working on a train that is two or three miles long,"" Brown said. “That's frankly crazy.”Some Republicans on the committee cautioned against legislation that would burden the industry. But the scenes of billowing smoke above East Palestine were still on the minds of lawmakers.The committee is also looking at possible changes to regulations that don't classify trains as high hazardous flammable, so long as they fall under certain thresholds for the number of railcars carrying combustible liquids. Lawmakers are examining how local authorities are informed by railroad operators about what trains are carrying as well.“It wasn’t a high-hazard train,” Republican Sen. Shelley Capito, R--West Virginia said of the train that derailed in East Palestine, “but it had hazard material that was very flammable. It just lit up the sky.”",2023/03/23,,World

The man possibly suffered some burns, but his injuries did not appear to be life threatening, Gonzalez said.Local news broadcasts showed a large ball of fire at the plant followed by large plumes of black smoke.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843902,Tunsil looks to lead Texans after signing 3-year extension,"HOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Texans don’t yet know who their quarterback will be next season and beyond.But whoever it is will be well protected with left tackle Laremy Tunsil signing a three-year $75 million extension that makes him the highest-paid left tackle in the NFL and will keep him in Houston through the 2026 season.Tunsil was entering the final year of a three-year $66 million contract extension he signed in 2020.“I’m glad to be here with H-Town for another four years,” he said Wednesday. “It was very important to stay here. I consider this home.”It is the second time Tunsil has negotiated a deal himself. He has a business team, but does not work with an agent.“I wanted to do something that has never happened before,” he said. “Making history for the second time in a row. Nobody has ever done that besides me. I always wanted to be the leader to start something new, and that’s what I did.”The Texans acquired Tunsil and receiver Kenny Stills in a trade with Miami in August 2019, shipping their 2020 first-round pick and their picks in the first and second rounds in 2021 to the Dolphins.Tunsil started 14 games in each of his first two seasons in Houston and was selected to the Pro Bowl in those years. He played just five games in 2021 because of a thumb injury, but bounced back last season, starting each game and earning his third Pro Bowl nod.His strong play did not lead to many wins as the team limped to a 3-13-1 record behind inept quarterback play from Davis Mills.Mills is under contract for two more years, but will almost certainly be replaced for the upcoming season.The Texans have the No. 2 pick in the draft and will likely draft Alabama’s Bryce Young or Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud to try and find a franchise quarterback after dealing Deshaun Watson to Cleveland last season following his trade request and legal problems.Regardless of whose blindside Tunsil is protecting next season, his goal is to help guide the young players and help the Texans rebound after three terrible seasons.“I view myself as the X-factor for this entire team and a mentor,” he said. “For the young guys ... I want to help those guys in any way that I can. Whenever they need me, they can hit me up. If they’ve got any questions, they can hit me up. I’m here for those guys. I’m here for this team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843903,$300M NJ statehouse renovation wraps up as governor moves in,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's statehouse building, part of which dates to the 1700s and was called a fire trap, is once again open after a renovation spanning almost six years and nearly $300 million in taxpayer money.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and his administration began moving back into the building last week, and work remains to be done on the building's façade. It's unclear when exactly the public will once again have access to the executive wing of the building, where the renovations took place.That work revealed giant skylights that were entombed under years’ worth of added plaster ceilings, with huge nets to catch falling pieces of debris and garbage bins to capture leaks from rainwater.The skylights have been restored to functional use, and the building made to adhere to how it looked in the early 1900s, when the last major addition was made.Other changes include the addition of modern sprinkler and fire alarm systems, new heating and air conditioning, a hand-dug foundation that the building previously lacked, internal fire escape stairwells to replace exterior versions that were falling down, new windows and numerous cosmetic changes.The building previously had cracked paint and exposed wires, window units for air conditioning and steam heat for the winter that frequently malfunctioned.Around the building on Tuesday, state workers settled into their new workspaces.State Treasurer Elizabeth Muoio was among them, still sorting through boxes and unhung picture frames.She discovered, she said, that a photo someone had given her of former President John F. Kennedy speaking from the statehouse reflects the current view from her new office window.Former Gov. Chris Christie announced the project in late 2016, saying the project was needed because the building was unsafe — he called it a “fire trap” at the time.Funding was secured in May 2017. Soon after that, three years of work began to prepare the building for the renovation — including removing asbestos, layers of paint and numerous drop-ceilings, walls and other fixtures.The renovation stage took another three years and meant Murphy was displaced to a nondescript office building down the street, and school tours couldn’t wind their usual routes through the ancient building.Murphy was eager to get back into the building, mentioning that renovation was nearly complete in his budget address earlier this year.“It took hard work to build this capitol. It took more hard work to rebuild it,” he said. “And that is a most New Jersey story.”There's still more work to be done, including the shoring up of a portico in the front of the building, which remains obscured by beams and wood planks. An external security structure, to screen visitors, is also still being worked on.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843915,"Lindsay Lohan, other celebs settle with SEC over crypto case","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actress Lindsay Lohan, rapper Akon and several other celebrities have agreed to pay tens of thousands of dollars to settle claims they promoted crypto investments to their millions of social media followers without disclosing they were being paid to do so.Lohan, Akon, recording artists Ne-Yo, and Lil Yachty, boxer and internet personality Jake Paul, and adult film performer Michele Mason all agreed to pay more than $400,000 combined in disgorgement, interest and penalties to settle the claims, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday.None admitted or denied the SEC’s findings as part of the settlement. Two other celebrities named in the SEC's complaint, rapper Soulja Boy and pop singer Austin Mahone, did not reach a settlement with the SEC, the agency said.In response to a request for comment, Lohan's publicist Leslie Sloane said the actress was contacted in March 2022, was unaware of the disclosure requirement, and agreed to pay a fine to resolve the matter. Lohan, who last week announced she is pregnant, was called to give up the $10,000 she was paid, plus interest, and pay a $30,000 fine, according an SEC complaint.A spokeswoman for Paul declined to comment. Emails left with representatives for the other celebrities named in the SEC complaint weren’t immediately returned Wednesday.In the complaint filed by the SEC in federal court in New York, the agency claims the celebrities were paid to promote Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT), both crypto asset securities that were offered for sale by three companies owned by Justin Sun, a Chinese national. Sun is the permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization and may be living in Singapore or Hong Kong, according to the complaint.Starting at around August 2017, Sun allegedly offered to sell billions in the unregistered securities and engaged in manipulative trading, while also creating secondary markets on which Tronix and BitTorrent could be traded, according to the complaint.“Although the celebrities were paid to promote TRX and BTT, their touts on social media did not disclose that they had been paid or the amounts of their payments,” according to the complaint. “Thus, the public was misled into believing that these celebrities had unbiased interest in TRX and BTT, and were not merely paid spokespersons.”Many celebrities and athletes have used their influence and massive social media followings to promote cryptocurrencies in recent years, including Matt Damon, Tom Brady and Reese Witherspoon. But doing so without disclosing when they're being paid to do so is illegal, and has landed some big names in hot water with securities regulators. Last fall, Kim Kardashian agreed to pay a $1 million fine to settle federal charges that she recommended Ethereum Max tokens, a crypto security, to her millions Instagram followers without making clear that she was paid to do so.In 2020, actor Steven Seagal agreed to pay more than $300,000 as part of a similar settlement with the SEC, which also banned him from promoting investments for three years.___Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843916,Texas university students protest drag show's cancellation,"CANYON, Texas (AP) — Protests continued Wednesday at a university in the Texas Panhandle after the school's president said a planned campus drag show wouldn't be allowed and expressed the view that such events “discriminate against womanhood.”Dozens of students gathered for the protests for a second day at West Texas A&M University, located in Canyon, just south of Amarillo. The students have been waving gay pride flags and holding signs that included the sayings “Women for Drag,” ""Drag is Rad"" and “Everybody Say Love.""In a Tuesday opinion column laden with religious references, the university's president, Walter Wendler, wrote that “drag shows are derisive, divisive and demoralizing misogyny, no matter the stated intent.” He also wrote that “drag shows stereotype women in cartoonlike extremes for the amusement of others.”In recent months, drag shows across the country have been targeted by right-wing activists and politicians, with Republican lawmakers in several states, including Texas, proposing restrictions on the shows. And events like drag story hours, where drag queens read books to children, have drawn protesters.WT Spectrum, a student organization for LGBTQIA students and allies, was recruiting participants for the March 31 drag show as a way to raise money for the Trevor Project, a group that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ young people.In an Instagram post, WT Spectrum wrote that drag isn't designed to be offensive, adding that it's a celebration of many things, including “queerness, gender, acceptance, love and especially femininity.” The group asked that Wendler reinstate the show, apologize and step down from his post.The group said in an Instagram post Wednesday that it still hoped to hold the show on March 31, but it wasn't yet sure where it would be held. The group said that it was talking with supporters and venues in the area.Students supporting the show included Signe Elder, who called drag “an expression of self and of joy.” She told KFDA television station: “I think if you don't like drag, you don't have to come to the show.""Other students said they agreed with Wendler's stance. Alejandro Rivera told KAMR television station that as a Christian, he doesn't hate anyone but thinks that if the show had been allowed “we would see our society kind of become like degenerates almost.”Rachel Hill, government affairs director of Equality Texas, said ""drag has always been a way for people who don’t easily fit into the gender binary to embrace different facets of themselves. Womanhood comes in all shapes and sizes and is what we make of it. That’s what makes drag so powerful.”The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, a national civil liberties group, wrote in a letter to Wendler that “drag shows, like other forms of theatrical performance, are expressive conduct shielded from government censorship.”In his column, Wendler also compared drag shows to someone performing in blackface, saying he would also not support performances of people in blackface. Blackface dates back to the 1800s when white men would darken their faces to create caricatures of Black people.“I will not appear to condone the diminishment of any group at the expense of impertinent gestures toward another group for any reason, even when the law of the land appears to require it,” wrote Wendler, who noted that he does recommend supporting the Trevor Project.University spokeswoman Kelly Carper Polden said Wednesday that they could not comment “due to pending litigation.” She did not respond immediately to a question on who might be filing a lawsuit.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843917,North Carolina House passes bill limiting racial teachings,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina’s Republican-controlled House passed a previously vetoed proposal Wednesday to restrict how teachers can discuss certain racial topics that some lawmakers have equated to “ critical race theory.”The House voted 68-49 along party lines for legislation banning public school teachers from compelling students to believe they should feel guilty or responsible for past actions committed by people of the same race or sex.United in their opposition, House Democrats challenged Republican claims that the bill would reduce discrimination and argued that a comprehensive history education should make students uncomfortable.Republican seat gains in the midterm elections give them greater leverage this year to override any veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who successfully blocked a similar proposal in 2021 and urged legislators this month in his State of the State address, ""Don't make teachers re-write history.” But Republicans, who are one seat short in the House of a veto-proof supermajority, will likely need some Democratic support for the measure to become law.North Carolina is among 10 states currently considering such proposals, according to an Education Week analysis. Eighteen others have already limited how teachers can discuss racism and sexism in the classroom.Gaston County Republican Rep. John Torbett said the proposal, which now heads to the Senate, will prohibit schools from endorsing controversial concepts, including that one race or sex is inherently superior.""This great education state must have an educational system that unites and teaches our children, not divides and indoctrinates them,"" said Torbett, the bill's sponsor.Several Democrats, including Reps. Rosa Gill of Wake County and Laura Budd of Mecklenburg County, raised concerns that the language is vague and does not outline clear boundaries for teachers. Budd said this “massive failure” places unnecessary pressure on teachers who may feel like they need to stifle productive classroom discussions to keep their jobs.“The bill, on its face, is the obvious attempt to micromanage from the General Assembly into the classrooms,"" she said during floor debate. ""It's overreach and will have a chilling effect on teachers and educators in curtailing what they think they're allowed to teach.”Republican lawmakers in committee had applauded the measure for “banning"" critical race theory, a complex academic and legal framework that centers on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation's systems and institutions that perpetuate inequality.The bill does not explicitly mention the framework, but it prohibits teaching that the government is “inherently racist” or was created to oppress people of another race or sex. Its language mirrors a model proposal from Citizens for Renewing America, a conservative social welfare group founded by a former Trump administration official to rid the nation's schools of critical race theory.Republicans nationwide have spun the phrase into a catchall for racial topics related to systemic inequality, inherent bias and white privilege. While many K-12 public schools teach about slavery and its aftermath, education officials have found little to no evidence that critical race theory, by definition, is being taught.North Carolina schools would also be required under the bill to notify the state's Department of Public Instruction and publish information online at least a month before they plan to host a diversity trainer or a guest speaker who has previously advocated for the beliefs restricted by the legislation.Cary mother and activist Michelle O’Keefe was among several parents who testified against the bill in a Tuesday committee meeting. O’Keefe said she doesn’t want her young child sheltered from learning about racism and other atrocities in history, as long as those lessons are age-appropriate.“The best way to keep history from repeating itself,” she said, “is to know the history.”Another mother worried she could be banned from speaking at her child’s school career day because she has a documented history of speaking out against social injustices. Democratic Rep. Julie von Haefen of Wake County expressed a similar concern that she might no longer be able to substitute teach because of her record on racial justice issues and gender equality.___Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843918,IOC's Bach defends Russia stance amid pro-Ukraine protest,"ESSEN, Germany (AP) — International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach defended his organization's efforts to create a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to competition in a speech in his home country of Germany which took place amid a pro-Ukraine protest Wednesday.Bach reiterated the IOC's position that it would be discriminatory to exclude Russians and Belarusians based on citizenship alone and argued the Olympics can help promote dialogue at a tense time. Public broadcaster WDR reported nearly 200 pro-Ukraine protesters gathered outside the venue calling for Russia to be excluded entirely from the Olympics.The IOC recommended excluding Russia and Belarus on safety grounds soon after the invasion last year but now argues for letting the two countries' athletes compete as neutrals without national symbols ahead of a packed calendar of qualification events for the 2024 Paris Olympics.Bach said he opposed political influence on sports and any suggestion that Russians should be treated as if they have “collective guilt.” The Olympics, he added, need to remain neutral to be a unifying force.The IOC previously said it wants to keep out athletes deemed to be “actively supporting the war,” with a final decision lying with the international federations running individual sports, but it has given few details of how that would work.Bach refined that approach Wednesday, indicating the IOC could recommend barring athletes who pose with a “Z” symbol, a marking used on Russian military vehicles which has become a symbol of support for the war.“Our principles say clearly and distinctly that any active support for the war, and that includes wearing this ‘Z’, that includes posts and much else besides (is prohibited). Anyone who supports the war in this way cannot, or in relation to the international federations, since we are issuing this only as a recommendation, should not take part in these competitions,"" Bach said.Asked about what to do with the many Russian athletes who are part of the military or have ties to military organizations, Bach indicated the IOC could decide on its approach at a board meeting next week.“Wait until the middle of next week. I am confident that we will come up with appropriate guidelines then,” he said.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843921,Uniquely New Orleans mayoral recall effort fails,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Because it happened in New Orleans, an effort to oust the mayor over typical big city complaints — high crime rates, slacking services, alleged misuse of taxpayer property — was anything but typical.Recall petition signatures were gathered during Mardi Gras parades. A brass band played and people danced on the sidewalk as organizers lugged boxes of signatures into City Hall. Disgruntled residents complained that dead people were still populating the voter rolls. It was political tumult, Louisiana style.In the end, the effort failed. The petition to force Mayor LaToya Cantrell into a recall election resulted in only 27,243 valid signatures, state officials announced Tuesday — about 18,000 short of what organizers needed.“Clearly, a weight lifted,” Cantrell, the city's first woman mayor, said at a Wednesday news conference. She also made it clear she doesn't think her political battles are over.“There's been intentional orchestration to discredit me, and my role as mayor of the City of New Orleans, and I do not expect that to stop,” she said.From the petition drive's beginning in August, Cantrell supporters have portrayed it as a Republican-led effort to drive a successful Black Democratic woman from office.“That's a fair characterization, but that's not the only characterization,” said Robert Collins, a local political analyst who is a professor of urban studies and public policy at Dillard University.One prominent Republican businessman put up more than $1 million of the nearly $1.2 million raised for the campaign, according to state records. And an analysis of signatures by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate showed support for the recall was much higher in predominantly white areas.But the initiators of the recall were Black Democrats Eileen Carter and Belden Batiste. And there is dissatisfaction with Cantrell among some Black voters, said Collins. “If it was just white folks and a rich guy, you wouldn't even have come close to the number of signatures that they had,” he said.University of New Orleans political scientist Ed Chervenak also indicated that the issue is not that clear-cut.“It's kind of difficult to paint it one way or the other,” he said.Cantrell took office in 2018 and had a first-year approval rating of 57%, according to a periodic survey of voter attitudes by the University or New Orleans Survey Research Center. That plummeted to 31% in a poll the university released in October.She had first gained notice in New Orleans after levee failures during Hurricane Katrina inundated most of the city in 2005. She became an activist for the devastated Broadmoor neighborhood, helping scuttle early plans to raze what was left there and turn the area into a park and floodway. She was elected twice to the City Council and that led to her winning the race to succeed former Mayor Mitch Landrieu early in 2018.Her first-term successes included pushing the state Legislature to collect more hotel taxes for the tourism-dependent city. Her handling of the COVID-19 crisis was generally well received. She drew no strong opposition in her 2021 election for a second term, not long after Hurricane Ida caused heavy damage in the city.But trash collection problems that grew in the aftermath of Ida lingered into her second term. So did crime — the greatest concern of voters who responded to the poll — and frequent complaints about the slow pace of street improvement projects that left many streets a mess.Meanwhile, Cantrell drew criticism for taking first-class trips abroad at city expense, violating a policy that requires city employees to use cheaper fares. She eventually agreed to repay the difference.There was also WVUE television's investigation showing she was using a city-owned apartment as a part-time residence. Former mayors said it was not to be a mayoral residence but a place for visiting dignitaries to say.It also led to questions about her relationship with a member of her security team, frequently seen at the apartment. “Strictly professional,” was the way Cantrell described it Wednesday.Chervenak said Cantrell appeared to develop a “sense of entitlement” in her second term.“I guess she started feeling she was bulletproof,” Collins said.Throughout the recall campaign and the mounting criticism, Cantrell has denied that she has been anything but laser-focused on all of the city's problems. She read statistics at Wednesday's news conference indicating downward trends in most violent crimes.“Throughout it all, it’s been focusing on doing the work,” Cantrell said.The battles aren't over. The mayor said her legal team won't stop challenging a court agreement that lowered the number of valid signatures needed for a recall petition by about 5,000 votes. Recall organizers had pushed for the lower threshold through a lawsuit. They said requiring the signatures of 20% of the city's qualified voters didn't work because the current voter rolls were inflated. According to them, the rolls still contained the names of hundreds of dead people and thousands who had moved out of the city.Cantrell supporters said Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin had no authority to enter into the settlement. They also noted the revelation by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate that the judge who approved the settlement had signed the petition.Recall organizers, meanwhile, could challenge any of the various reasons the New Orleans registrar had for invalidating thousands of signatures on the petition.Cantrell, now term-limited, faces a second term as a lame duck with a City Council that has been showing it's desire for more authority — including with its passage of a measure giving the council confirmation authority over her appointments. Among the battles that portends is one over the selection of a new police chief, which previously had been solely within the mayor's purview.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843925,Otieno family attorneys push back against officers' defense,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — As a video was released publicly this week showing sheriff’s deputies and employees of a Virginia mental hospital pinning Irvo Otieno to the floor, attorneys for several of the defendants charged with second-degree murder in his death began to weigh in to defend their clients.During bond hearings and through statements, lawyers sought to distinguish their clients from the mass of bodies involved in holding Otieno to the floor for over 10 minutes.One said in court that his client only worked to secure leg irons on Otieno, while another said his client put his body weight on the man for just a short period of time and then tried to position Otieno on his side so he would not have trouble breathing.Some defense attorneys also said their clients were only trying to restrain Otieno and there was no evidence of an intent to kill the 28-year-old Black man as deputies sought to have him admitted to Central State Hospital on March 6.“At no time did he realize that Mr. Otieno ... was in any danger whatsoever,” said attorney Caleb Kershner, who represents one of the seven Henrico County deputies who have been charged, along with three hospital employees.But Otieno’s family and their lawyers, including prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump, pushed back against any attempt to minimize the role they say individuals in the crowded room played in Otieno’s death.During a press conference Tuesday evening, family attorney Mark Krudys quoted some of the language used by defense counsel during bond hearings earlier that day, including a description of Otieno as being in obvious need of medical attention.“Despite that they piled on him,” Krudys said. “Ten individuals.”Krudys and Crump said the defense attorneys were offering “excuses” for what the video showed while trying to cast Otieno, who was shackled and handcuffed, as combative.“They are trying to say ... ‘Well, he was struggling. Well, he was still resisting.' No he wasn’t. He was trying to breathe,” Crump said at the news conference, which was punctuated by sobs from Otieno’s mother.Otieno's family has said he was brutally mistreated not only at the hospital where he died but also while in law enforcement custody beforehand.Otieno, whose family said he had long-running mental health struggles, was initially taken to a Richmond-area hospital by police for psychiatric care March 3. But after authorities said he became combative, he was criminally charged and transferred to the jail. His family says he was denied access to needed medication during his time there.News outlets obtained video this week of the events that preceded Otieno's death at the state mental hospital in Dinwiddie County. The prosecutor had previously shown the footage, for which there is no audio, to Otieno's relatives and attorneys.According to timestamps, an SUV carrying Otieno arrived at the hospital just before 4 p.m. March 6.In court, defense attorneys said that before he arrived there he was resistant. One said it took approximately 12 officers to get Otieno out of his cell at the jail.Video from the hospital shows that nearly 20 minutes after the SUV's arrival, officers remove Otieno from the vehicle and escort him inside. He appears to be upright but hunched over.By 4:19., a different camera shows him being forcibly led into a room with tables and chairs. He is hauled toward a seat and eventually slumps to the floor, first seated and then lying flat.An increasing number of people become involved in holding Otieno down. At times his shirtless body is obscured by the sheer number of bodies or by someone standing front of the camera.Steve Benjamin, a Richmond criminal defense attorney who serves as special counsel to the Virginia Senate Judiciary Committee and is not involved with the case, said the video by itself is not enough to determine the criminal culpability of the deputies or hospital workers.“We don't know if those who were observing were saying to the deputies, ‘Get off him, he can’t breathe.' We don't know if he was saying he couldn't breathe or if he was threatening violence to those who were trying to restrain him. We simply have no idea,"" Benjamin said.“Our reaction to that video is human and natural,” he said, “but it doesn't go very far in answering the question of, was there a criminal offense committed here?”In Virginia case law, second-degree murder is generally defined as the malicious killing of another, meaning the conduct must be so likely to cause death or serious injury that it demonstrates utter and callous disregard for life.The first charges in the case were announced last week against the deputies, followed by the hospital workers two days later. Dinwiddie Commonwealth's Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill said in an email Wednesday that while she doesn't have additional charges “in the pipeline,” the state police investigation remains ongoing.A separate investigation into the events preceding Otieno’s death — at both the hospital and the jail — is also ongoing, according to Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor.All 10 defendants have been granted bond and have pre-trial hearings set for late April or May.Final autopsy findings have not been released. Baskervill has said in court that Otieno died of asphyxiation, though some defense attorneys have raised the possibility that injections administered at the hospital may have played a role.The Rev. Al Sharpton has been asked to deliver the eulogy at Otieno's funeral, his National Action Network said Wednesday. Details have not been announced.___Associated Press writer Aaron Morrison contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843926,NTSB: Pilot error in crash killing diet guru Gwen Shamblin,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A small plane crash in Tennessee that killed weight-loss guru Gwen Shamblin Lara and six others likely happened when her husband piloting the plane — actor Joe Lara — became disoriented in heavy clouds, a final report by the National Transportation Safety Board says.Joe Lara, who played Tarzan in the 1990s TV series “Tarzan: The Epic Adventures,"" was flying a Cessna C501 on March 29, 2021, when the aircraft plunged into Percy Priest Lake, minutes after takeoff from an airport just outside Nashville.Flight track data found that the plane “made a series of heading changes, along with several climbs and descents, before it entered a steep, descending left turn,” according to the crash report released Wednesday.The maneuvering is consistent with a type of spatial disorientation called somatogravic illusion, and it likely caused the pilot to perceive that the airplane was pitching up even though it was actually in a continuous descent, according to an NTSB performance study.Lara was rated to fly with instruments only, but William Lardent, a local flight instructor who had flown with Lara several times in the Cessna that crashed, told investigators Lara struggled when forced to rely on instruments in low visibility and while using the plane’s autopilot.Lardent said Lara was a safe pilot but had trouble with multitasking and with situational awareness.“Mr. Lara could not visualize in his mind where the airplane was in time/space unless he saw it on his iPad,” according to an NTSB account of the interview.“Mr. Lara wanted to fly to bigger cities like New York and Las Vegas, but Mr. Lardent told him he was not ready because those areas were congested and you ‘had to be on your game’ to operate in those fast-moving environments,"" according to the document.Witnesses to the crash included a fisherman who “heard what he thought was a low flying military jet before he saw the airplane impact the lake in a ‘straight down’ attitude with the nose of the airplane impacting the water first,” according to the report.Post-accident examination of the wreckage revealed no obvious mechanical malfunctions with the aircraft, and investigators believe it is unlikely that any medical condition of the pilot or co-pilot were a factor in the crash.Rutherford County officials previously identified the other victims as Brandon Hannah, David L. Martin, Jennifer J. Martin, Jessica Walters and Jonathan Walters. They, along with the Laras, were all from nearby Brentwood. They had planned to travel to Palm Beach.Gwen Shamblin Lara founded the Remnant Fellowship Church in Brentwood in 1999 and wrote a faith-based weight loss book.",2023/03/23,,World

Even if we don’t do so well, it’s part of our life,” Ronaldo said Wednesday. ""When we are at the top of the mountain, it’s hard to see what’s down here and many times I couldn’t. I feel like I’m better prepared now because I can see some things. I’m a better man now.”The 38-year-old Ronaldo joined Saudi club Al Nassr after his contract was terminated by United following a TV interview in which he criticized manager Erik ten Hag and the club’s owners after being benched and even temporarily suspended by the club.“I think that everything in life happens for a reason,” he said. “I'm often grateful to go through some difficult things so I can see who is really on my side. At the tough times, you see who is on your side. It wasn't a very good phase in my life, in my career, first on a personal level and then professionally.”Ronaldo said he is motivated and enjoying his time back with Portugal's national team after a disappointing World Cup in which he was benched in the knockout rounds and left the field in tears after a loss to Morocco in the quarterfinals. He came off the bench in that match to tie Bader Al-Mutawa’s mark of 196 outings for Kuwait.He is expected to break the record on Thursday as new Portugal coach Roberto Martínez said he still counts on the star forward.“This record is special. I’ll be really proud if it happens,” Ronaldo said. ""But I want to keep playing even more games, I don’t want to stop here.”Ronaldo admitted there were doubts about his future with the national team, but that's all in the past now.“It was all in the balance after the World Cup,” he said. “I reflected with my family and then we came to the conclusion that it was not time to throw in the towel. I learned a lot from it and I’m very happy to be back.""___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

The countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina., Gambia, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Lichtenstein, Mauritania, Mozambique, and Tanzania were extended invitations to this year’s summit after being left out of the invite list to the 2021 gathering.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is slated to take part in a pre-summit event on Tuesday focused on Ukraine with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.This year's summit takes place next Wednesday and Thursday. It will be co-hosted by the governments of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia. The first day of the summit will be a virtual format and will be followed by hybrid gatherings in each of the host countries with representatives from government, civil society and the private sector participating.The world has seen big change since the December 2021 summit with countries emerging from the global pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the largest-scale war in Europe since World War II that has devastated the eastern European country and rattled the global economy.The president will look to make the case that the events of the last year have put into stark relief that democratic government grounded in the rule of law and the will of the governed remains — despite its frequent messiness — the best system to promote prosperity and peace, according to White House officials.Biden initially proposed the idea of a democracy summit during his 2020 campaign and has repeatedly made the case that the U.S. and like-minded allies need to show the world that democracies are a better vehicle for societies than autocracies.",2023/03/23,120,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843929,Coaches' sons Hurley and Musselman to meet in Sweet 16,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Every day he wasn't out recruiting or away at a game, Bill Musselman wrote a message on his son's school lunch bag.Effort, energy, enthusiasm.The message and the relentless pursuit of perfection it implored served as the substratum of Eric Musselman's life.“Everything that happened with my dad and I, whenever I was around him, being a competitor was kind of beyond belief,” the Arkansas coach said Wednesday.UConn coach Dan Hurley knows the feeling.Like Musselman, he spent his childhood being told just good enough might as well be failure.The two coaches' sons have come together in the desert, preparing for a Sweet 16 game Thursday night that will push one a step closer to college basketball's ultimate goal.“I think being coaches' kids just gives you such a unique perspective and it makes basketball such a huge part of your life,” Hurley said. “I think that’s why we both coach with so much passion and we live and die with every possession.”Hurley's father, Bob, is one of the few high school coaches to be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, a hoops firebrand who led St. Anthony High School to 26 New Jersey state titles.Dan and his brother Bobby played for their father and watched as he demanded excellence from his players on and off the court.Bobby won two national championships as a player at Duke and is currently Arizona State's head coach.Dan played at Seton Hall and, after stints at Wagner and Rhode Island, was tasked with rebuilding UConn back into national prominence when he was hired five years ago. The Huskies have gone to the NCAA Tournament in each of the past three seasons and are one win from the program's first Elite Eight since winning the 2014 national title.“I want to be the college version of my dad,” Hurley said. “I want to coach with integrity, be a man of my word and have the holistic type of approach that my dad had, be a coach’s coach like my dad, not a phony or a fraud or a liar or a cheater.”How important has his dad been? Hurley had to compose himself for several seconds after being asked about him Wednesday in Las Vegas.“That was a brutal last question, buddy,” he said before pausing. “I'm just glad my dad's at the games.”Musselman's dad, who died at 59 in 2000 after suffering a stroke, zigzagged his way across the country coaching in the NBA, American Basketball Association, Western Basketball Association and college over four decades.His father's travels gave the younger Musselman a unique view into the world of basketball and beyond.Musselman went on road trips with his father, served as a ball boy for opposing teams and got to know people most kids at the time only dreamed of meeting. He absorbed his father's intensity and attention to detail, and served as an assistant under him with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves.“To be able to work with him with the Timberwolves and watch his preparation, watch how he conducted practice, his attention to detail,” Musselman said. “And I was lucky to watch him meet with so many other coaches in different sports. I was just exposed to a whole different lifestyle than everybody else that I grew up with.”Musselman followed his father's coaching footsteps after playing at the University of San Diego. He became head coach of the Continental Basketball Association's Rapid City Thrillers at age 24 and later coached the NBA's Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors.Intrigued by the prospect of coaching in college, Musselman wanted to learn from the ground level, so he took jobs as an assistant at Arizona State and LSU. He was clearly ready once he become a head coach, leading Nevada to three straight NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the 2018 Sweet 16.Musselman has had even sweeter success in Fayetteville. He led the Razorbacks to the Elite Eight in his second season and returned there last year. He is seeking a third straight appearance in a regional final.That run seemed to be headed toward an end this season when Trevon Brazile tore his ACL and five-star freshman Nick Smith Jr. was limited by knee injuries. The Razorbacks rallied like their tenacious coach, pulling off a win over No. 1 seed Kansas that Musselman celebrating with his shirt off.“We just kept kind of grinding and looking at the next game on our schedule and trying to have belief,” Musselman said. “And here we are again. It’s a resilient team that’s overcome a lot for sure.”Just like its coach — and UConn's.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843930,Brian Dutcher's Aztecs meeting March Madness expectations,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Brian Dutcher will always be known as the guy who spent all those years at Steve Fisher's side, winning the NCAA title at Michigan in 1989 and recruiting the Fab Five before helping to build San Diego State into a West Coast power.It's a pretty full resume, for sure. Dutcher has added to it with his first two March Madness wins in his six seasons as head coach and hopes there's more to come for SDSU.Awaiting the Aztecs is a Sweet 16 matchup with overall No. 1 seed Alabama in Louisville in the South Region on Friday, with the No. 5 seed Aztecs looking for their first-ever trip to the Elite Eight.The Aztecs are 7 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook, and up for the challenge.“We just say that if we’re the best version of us, we’ll have a chance to win,” Dutcher said. ""So I always say our No. 1 opponent is ourselves. Play up to our standard. If we do that, then we should have a chance to win the game.”The Aztecs (29-6) are in the Sweet 16 for just the third time in school history and the first time since 2014. They won the Mountain West regular-season and conference tournament titles and then beat Charleston and Furman to advance to the second weekend of March Madness.Fisher and Dutcher built the Aztecs into a program that always has high expectations. To Dutcher, who was promoted after Fisher retired in October 2017, this is exactly what the Aztecs are supposed to be doing.It's just taken a bit longer than many expected. The Aztecs lost their first three NCAA Tournament games under Dutcher. Additionally, the Aztecs will always wonder what would have happened in 2020, when they were 30-2 behind Malachi Flynn and poised for a No. 1 or 2 seed before the NCAA Tournament was canceled due to COVID.Dutcher makes it clear that this run is about the team, not him.“That’s what they pay us to do is coach the team, get the best out of the team, and we’re supposed to win, and we’re supposed to win in March,"" said Dutcher, 63, who spent nine seasons as an assistant under Fisher at Michigan and 18 more at SDSU, including six years with the “head coach in waiting” designation. ""We can’t tell everybody we recruit that we want to win a Final Four or win a national championship and then act like we’re super overly excited when we do win.“So it’s just how I’m wired. I’m more happy for the kids,"" Dutcher added. “You know, I’ve been to a number of them, and I don’t take anything for granted. But I like the guys that go for the first time, that came here to win games, and then now they’re winning games.”The Aztecs are deep, big and tough, with Dutcher constantly preaching a defense-first mentality. Four of the top five scorers are transfers. Leading scorer Matt Bradley (13 points) is in his second season after transferring from California. Darrion Trammell (9.5), Micah Parrish (7.9) and Jaedon LeDee, a force inside at 6-foot-9, 240 pounds, are new this season. LeDee averages 7.8 points and 5.2 rebounds.Dutcher's nine-man rotation also includes holdovers Adam Seiko, Nathan Mensah, Lamont Butler, Keshad Johnson and Aguek Arop.Johnson, Seiko, Arop and Mensah were on the 2019-20 team that was just three days away from receiving its best seed ever when the pandemic shut down the sports world.“I’m for sure using that as motivation,” Seiko said. “For that to go down how it did was very disappointing. Three years later we’re making a run in the tournament, the Sweet 16. We’re not complacent. We want to keep making a run and reach the Final Four.”SDSU was routed by Syracuse in the 2021 NCAA Tournament in the Indianapolis bubble and then lost a heartbreaker in overtime to Creighton last year.“It’s really a blessing,” Seiko said about having more chances in the NCAA Tournament. “It’s testimony to the winning culture here at San Diego State that we were able to make the tournament in the past few seasons after that. We lost in the first round but this year we figured out ways to get better, especially down the stretch. We’re all happy to be here to make the run.”Fisher, who watches home games with his wife, Angie, from the second row above the SDSU bench, is pleased for his protégé.“I'm very proud of what Dutch has done. When we came here in 1999 we talked about a program and not being a one-hit wonder,” Fisher said. “We wanted to have a great foundation and build a program, and that's what's happened and that's what's continuing to happen as he grows.""___Follow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843931,Mississippi sets tighter restrictions on absentee ballots,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi will set tighter restrictions on who can gather other people's absentee ballots, under a bill that Gov. Tate Reeves signed Wednesday.The Republican governor said the law, which takes effect July 1, will ban political operatives from collecting and handling large numbers of absentee ballots. Reeves described the practice as “ballot harvesting,” a pejorative term for dropping off completed ballots for other people.“This process is an open invitation for fraud and abuse, and can occur without the voter ever even knowing,” Reeves said in a video statement.Opponents said the new restrictions could hurt candidates, campaign workers, nursing home employees or others who make good-faith efforts to help people obtain and mail absentee ballots.“This bill will make all of you criminals if you go and assist anybody with getting an absentee ballot. And that's wrong,"" Democratic Rep. Willie Bailey of Greenville told fellow House members during a March 7 debate. “It is no good. It is a part of a system going around the country, suppressing people's right to vote in a democratic society.”Republican-led states have tightened rules on voting by mail since the 2020 presidential election, in part because of the false narrative of widespread fraud in that race.Unlike some states that allow widespread use of voting by mail, Mississippi already restricts the reasons people may vote by absentee ballot. The absentee ballots are available — by mail or for early, in-person voting — to Mississippi voters who are 65 or older; any voter who has a temporary or permanent physical disability, or any voter who is that person's caretaker; or any voter who will be away from their home county on election day, including college students.Mississippi's new law takes effect a few weeks before the state's Aug. 8 party primaries for statewide, regional, legislative and county elections.The law sets a short list of people who can “collect and transmit” a ballot that was mailed to another person. That list includes employees of the U.S. Postal Service or other mail carriers, plus any “family member, household member or caregiver of the person to whom the ballot was mailed.”Any violation of the law will be punishable by up to a year in a county jail, a $3,000 fine or both.The House passed the bill 73-44 on March 7, with most of the support coming from Republicans and most of the opposition from Democrats. The Senate passed the final version 33-13 on March 14, with a similar partisan divide.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843932,March Madness: Tennessee-FAU pits White brothers in Sweet 16,"The White family text chain is relatively quiet right now.No talking trash. No picking sides. Just a handful of “good luck” sentiments before arguably the biggest basketball game involving a handful of households with the same surname.Nothing else needs to be said. Everyone knows the stakes because they’ve experienced this level of competition their entire lives. It comes with being part of “the First Family of college sports.”But it doesn’t make the Sweet 16 matchup between fourth-seeded Tennessee (25-10) and ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic (33-3) on Thursday night any less awkward for brothers and fellow athletic directors Danny (UT) and Brian White (FAU).“It’s not ideal,” Brian White said. “But it’s a reality at times.”Added Danny White: “We always get kind of silent about competition amongst each other. We talk trash about a lot of things but not about our teams competing against each other.”As two of five children of longtime college administrator Kevin White, whose stops as AD include Tulane (1991-96), Arizona State (1996-2000), Notre Dame (2000-08) and Duke (2008-21), they know the cost of winning and losing. And they realize one of them will be on the wrong end of the scoreboard at Madison Square Garden.“It’s not fun for us ‘cause these games matter a whole lot,” Danny White said. “Getting into the Sweet 16 and advancing to the Elite Eight, which is going to happen to either us or FAU, that’s a life moment that you’ll always carry with you. So it’s just too heavy to be flippant about.”Three of the five White children followed in their father’s footsteps and became college athletic administrators: Brian landed at FAU in 2018 after several years at Missouri; Danny took the Tennessee job after a decade at Buffalo and Central Florida; and Mariah Chappell is an assistant AD at Southern Methodist University.Eldest daughter Maureen Treadway is a high school English teacher in Arizona, and eldest son Mike just finished his first season as Georgia’s basketball coach after seven years at Florida.The White family is beyond tight. Not only do the five siblings exchange messages daily, Mike and Danny bought beachside condos a floor above and below their parents’ vacation home. And when Danny was hiring his first head coach, he used Dad’s connections at Duke (Coach Mike Krzyzewski) to land Bobby Hurley at Buffalo. And when Brian needed a basketball coach at Florida Atlantic, he turned to Mike’s staff at Florida and lured away Dusty May.“Why would you not bounce ideas off the people you know, ones who have your best interests at heart?” Brian White said. “You know they’re giving you real advice even if it’s advice you might not agree with.”The Whites try to gather at least twice a year, usually around Christmas and the Fourth of July. The five siblings have a combined 16 kids of their own, and there’s a good chance one of them will end up working in athletics.Kevin and Jane began their careers as high school teachers and track coaches in New Port Richey, Florida. They moved often from there, working their way around the country and up the collegiate ladder. Kevin served as track and field coach at Southeast Missouri State and assistant cross country and track and field coach at Central Michigan. His first AD job was at Division III Loras College in Iowa.He built a legacy — and a lineage — from there. He also built three houses with nearly identical floor plans to provide the kids with some level or normalcy as they bounced from city to city.As the story goes, Kevin and Jane drew a rough sketch of what they wanted at a restaurant one night, took it to an architect and had it built in Kenner, Louisiana. They had it replicated in South Bend, Indiana, and again in Durham, North Carolina — where they still live today.“Pictures are in the same places. It’s creepy,” Mike White said.Admittedly neat, too.“I never lived in the Durham house, but when I’m there, it feels like I’m in my childhood home,” Brian White said. “It’s very cool. We’ll be sitting around at the holidays and someone tells a story and says, ‘I was sitting right there.’ Except it was in the South Bend house. A lot of memories in that house, but not that actual house.”Two of the homes even had identical basketball hoops in the driveways, where “trash talk, bloody noses and skinned knees were nonstop,” Danny White said.Danny and Brian expect to get together briefly before the Sweet 16 matchup and surely will exchange condolences/congratulatory texts following the game. In the meantime, this is the closest they would come to stoking each other:“I know deep down (our parents) are rooting for the Owls,” Brian quipped. “Tennessee beat Duke; they never should have done that.”Responded Danny: “I’m sensing more orange out of the rest of the family.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843936,North Dakota House passes school gender pronoun prohibition,"Public schools and state agencies in North Dakota would be prohibited from referring to students and employees by any pronouns that don't reflect the sex assigned to them at birth, under a bill approved by the legislature.The House approved the bill 60-32 on Wednesday. It passed the Senate last month and now awaits the signature of Republican Gov. Doug Burgum.In 2021, Burgum vetoed a bill that would have restricted transgender students from participating in public elementary and secondary school sports. But Burgum has not said publicly if he supports this latest measure.The bill is among hundreds nationwide that are taking aim at nearly every facet of transgender existence, from pronouns to bathroom use to health care to athletics. In North Dakota, similar bills to restrict transgender athletes have passed the House this session with veto-proof majorities. The Senate has not yet voted on them. Last week, Wyoming became the 19th state to ban transgender athletes from playing on girls or women’s sports teams.“It’s another week of a legislative session, and we have another bill that’s telling certain people that they have value or don’t have value in our state,” Democratic Rep. Josh Boschee of Fargo said as he urged lawmakers to vote against the pronoun bill.Right before the vote, Republican Rep. SuAnn Olson of Baldwin countered: “Five years ago, this whole pronoun thing wasn’t a thing. It puts teachers in the very difficult position” of keeping up with students who switch their pronoun, she said. “It’s just a common-sense bill that deserves a green vote.""The bill would not criminalize teachers or state employees. And if a teacher received approval from a student’s parent or guardian — and from the school administrator — the teacher would be allowed to use the pronouns a student prefers.Although the measure also affects state employees outside the schools, Wednesday's debate focused mostly on educational staff who would be affected. Supporters said the bill would ease burdens on teachers and create better learning environments for studentsThe bill would allow teachers to “rest with relief that they only need to remember one name and (one) set of historically recognized biological pronouns,” Republican Rep. Lori VanWinkle, of Minot, said in support. She added that the bill would instill confidence in parents that their kids are safe at school and create learning environments without “social distractions.”Opponents including Democratic Rep. Mary Schneider of Fargo cited the testimony of countless people who argued the bill would harm LGBTQ youth: mental health therapists, school counselors, social workers, suicide prevention advocates, church leaders and more.Schneider noted that these experts said the bill would not protect kids or promote learning, because “the real threats to children are poverty, hunger, lack of health care, gun violence, bigotry, social pressures, mental health and bills like these.""Democrats and Republicans voted against the bill.A survey by The Trevor Project in 2022 found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous year, but that those who were supported socially or at school reported lower rates.___Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843937,Farmers struggle in Argentina as drought withers their crops,"URQUIZA, Argentina (AP) — The ground crackles as Guillermo Cuitino walks across dry farmland that should be green and lush this time of year. He grabs a soy plant and easily disintegrates its leaves with his hands.“This year’s drought was extreme,” the agricultural engineer said this week at the farm where he works in Urquiza, a town about 230 kilometers (143 miles) from Argentina’s capital.Cuitino normally has a policy of not walking on cultivated land, but everything is so dry now that there is absolutely nothing to damage — even weeds aren't growing.That scene is repeated in farms across Argentina, where harvesting should be in full swing but months of dry weather has ruined. Farmers are scrambleing to make ends meet, and a sharp drop in expected revenue from exported farm products will deal a severe blow to Argentina’s shaky economy.“This drought is unprecedented,” farmer Martín Sturla said, standing in the middle of his dustry fields in nearby San Antonio de Areco. “It’s Dantesque. No one has seen anything like it.”The situation is particularly dire because Argentina had already been suffering two years of unusually dry weather.“The last two years were bad, but we always had some rain events that allowed us to get by,” Cuitino said.Even experts are having trouble coming to terms with the crisis.“There are no words to describe the impact of a campaign marked by all-time historical records: a deficit of rainfall for the third consecutive year in the summer, persistent heat waves until well into March, and agricultural frosts as late as October 2022 and as early as February 2023,” said a recent report by the Rosario Board of Trade that has sharply cut estimates for this year’s harvest.“Crops, animals and natural resources have seen their conditions deteriorate week by week, leaving us on the eve of winter with a storm of losses,” it said.In its latest weekly report, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said this year’s soybean production would be around 25 million tons, down 44% from the average for the last five cycles. Total wheat production, meanwhile, is forecast at 36 million tons, a 31% drop from the previous year.Osvaldo Bo has seen this first hand at his farm in Urquiza.“We lost 90%,” Bo said while showing off a field of dry corn. “I’ve never seen a drought like this, because there have been droughts where there was no soybean, grain, but there was wheat and corn. But now, all harvests were lost.”Taking into account the soybean, wheat and corn harvest, which make up 87% of Argentina’s grain production, losses will reach an estimated $14.14 billion, according to the Rosario Board of Trade. The Regional Consortium of Agricultural Experimentation said in a recent report that the current condition will lead to almost $20.5 billion in export losses.Although many have been quick to attribute the drought to global warming, experts said it was not so simple.“We have no evidence that it’s climate change for now,” said Anna Sörensson, a climate change researcher at the publicly funded CONICET research institute. “On the contrary, we see that precipitation has increased due to climate change.”He added that there is “great certainty” the current drought was generated by the climate condition known as La Nina, which involves a cooling of the central Pacific that leads to changes in weather around the world. The phenomenon lasted much longer than normal this time.Even if it isn’t directly responsible for the drought, climate change still plays a role, though, he said.“What does happen due to climate change is that the heat waves become more frequent and more severe,” Sorensson said. That means “the soil dries more quickly,” he said.Argentina has suffered the hottest summer since 1961, according to the country's National Weather Service. In the capital, Buenos Aires, residents endured the hottest summer since records began in 1906.Farmers are trying to figure out how to keep going.“I’ve already done a couple of projections and I don’t have enough money to pay the bills of the year to plant again,"" said Jorge Bianciotto, who manages the farm where Cuitino works.""We’ve lost a lot of working capital and so what I’m doing know is trying to look for financing to cover the financial hole I have by asking for credit with the hope that next year will be better,” Bianciotto said. “One always believes that what’s coming is better than what happened.”___Associated Press writer Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843938,Israeli leader halts bill against Christian proselytizing,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said he would prevent the passage of a proposal by a powerful ally in his governing coalition to punish Christian proselytizing with jail time.The proposal had raised an uproar with evangelical Christians — one of Israel’s strongest and most influential supporters in the United States.The bill was introduced in January by a pair of ultra-Orthodox Jewish lawmakers, including Moshe Gafni, who heads the parliament’s Finance Committee. It says soliciting someone to convert their faith should be punishable by one year in prison and solicitation to convert a minor would be punishable with a two-year sentence.“Recently, the attempts of missionary groups, mainly Christians, to solicit conversion of religion have increased,” it said.The bill was never advanced, but it drew widespread attention in the American evangelical world this week after All Israel News, an evangelical news site, reported on it.On Wednesday, Netanyahu announced on Twitter: “We will not advance any law against the Christian community.”Gafni said he had introduced the bill as a procedural matter, as he has done in the past, and there were no plans to advance it.Evangelical Christians, particularly in the United States, are among the strongest backers of Israel, viewing it as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, with some seeing it as the harbinger of a second coming of Jesus Christ and the end of days.Israel has long welcomed evangelicals’ political and financial support, and it has largely shrugged off concerns about any hidden religious agenda. But most Jews view any effort to convert them to Christianity as deeply offensive, a legacy of centuries of persecution and forced conversion at the hands of Christian rulers. In part, because of those sensitivities, evangelical Christians rarely target Jews.Joel Rosenberg, editor in chief of All Israel News, welcomed Netanyahu’s announcement, which comes at a time of domestic turmoil in Israel over his plan to overhaul the country's legal system and rising tensions with the Biden administration over West Bank settlement activities.“Netanyahu is a longtime and proven friend to the global Christian community and his action today — amidst all the other issues on his plate — is further proof,” Rosenberg said.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843939,Manchester United sale: Deadline extended for 2nd bids,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Bidders trying to buy Manchester United have been given more time to submit second offers for the iconic soccer team.The deadline for the latest round of bids had been set for 9 p.m. Wednesday, but American merchant bank Raine has agreed to an unspecified extension to allow interested parties to fine-tune their proposals.A person with knowledge of the process confirmed the extension. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani has outlined his intention to make a second offer for United and British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe is also expected to bid, although neither met Wednesday's deadline. Both submitted indicative offers last month.Sheikh Jassim, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank, has said he wants to return the club to the summit of the sport if he is successful in buying out current owners, the Glazer family.His latest bid is ready and will be made to Raine, another person with knowledge of the process said. The person also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.United is expected to become the most expensive sports team in history, with the price estimated to reach up to $6 billion.Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe are the only contenders to have publicly declared their intention to buy the 20-time English league champions.Sheikh Jassim, the son of a former Qatari prime minister, sent a delegation to Manchester last week to meet with United executives.Ratcliffe, owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS, also held meetings with United last week.Sheikh Jassim is said to be confident in his bid to buy 100% of the club and plans to invest in the stadium, training ground and playing squads.Ratcliffe has spoken of his intention to take a “fan centered” approach to ownership, adding that he is focused on United winning the Champions League for the first time since 2008.He is bidding for a majority ownership.Last year, Raine handled the sale of Chelsea to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital for about $3 billion. The Denver Broncos were also sold last year to Walmart heir Rob Walton and his daughter and son-in-law for a record $4.65 billion.The Glazers announced in November that they were exploring “strategic alternatives.” It is not certain they will cede total control of the club they have owned since 2005, with minority investment also a possibility.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843940,'Rick and Morty' creator has domestic abuse charges dropped,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California prosecutors on Wednesday dropped domestic violence charges against Justin Roiland, who created the Cartoon Network animated series “Rick and Morty” and provided the voices of the show’s two title characters.Orange County district attorney’s spokeswoman Kimberly Edds said the two felony counts involving a former girlfriend were dropped “due to a lack of sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.”Roiland responded to the dismissal on Twitter.“I have always known that these claims were false — and I never had any doubt that this day would come,” he said. “I'm thankful that this case has been dismissed but, at the same time, I'm still deeply shaken by the horrible lies that were reported about me during this process.”He added that he is “disappointed that so many people were so quick to judge without knowing the facts, based solely on the word of a bitter ex trying to bypass due process and have me ‘canceled.’”Roiland, 43, had been awaiting trial on charges of corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, fraud, violence or deceit against the woman, who he was living with at the time. She was not identified in court documents.The charges dated to May of 2020, but they apparently went unnoticed by media outlets until NBC News reported on them in January of this year.Roiland and Dan Harmon created the animated sci-fi sitcom about a mad scientist and his grandson, both voiced by Roiland. It has aired for six seasons on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim nighttime programming block, and it has been renewed for a seventh.Adult Swim and Cartoon Network cut ties with him when the charges were reported and said his roles would be recast. 20th TV Animation and Hulu Originals, which produce two other animated series Roiland worked on, did the same.The companies declined comment on Wednesday.In his tweet, Roiland said he is “determined to move forward and focus both on my creative projects and restoring my good name.”___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843941,Prosecutors reveal planned Proud Boys witness was informant,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors disclosed Wednesday that a witness expected to testify for the defense at the seditious conspiracy trial of former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and four associates was secretly acting as a government informant for nearly two years after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, a defense lawyer said in a court filing.Carmen Hernandez, a lawyer for former Proud Boys chapter leader Zachary Rehl, asked a judge to schedule an immediate emergency hearing and suspend the trial “until these issues have been considered and resolved.” Lawyers for the other four defendants joined in Hernandez’s request.Hernandez said in court papers that the defense team was told by prosecutors on Wednesday afternoon that the witness they were planning to call to the stand on Thursday had been a government informant.The judge ordered prosecutors to file a response to the defense filing by Thursday afternoon and scheduled a hearing for the same day, putting testimony in the case on hold until Friday. The U.S. attorney's office did not immediately comment on the filing.In her court filing, Hernandez said the unnamed informant participated in “prayer meetings” with relatives of at least one of the Proud Boys on trial and had discussions with family members about replacing one of the defense lawyers on the case. The informant also has been in contact with at least one of the defense lawyers and at least one of the five defendants, Hernandez wrote.It's the latest twist in a trial that has been bogged down by bickering between lawyers and the judge and already lasted much longer than expected. Defense lawyers have repeatedly asked the judge in vain to declare a mistrial over a variety of issues they say have been unfair to their clients.The trial in Washington's federal court is one of the most serious cases to emerge from the Jan. 6 attack. Tarrio, Rehl and three other Proud Boys — Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean and Dominic Pezzola — are charged with conspiring to block the transfer of presidential power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 election.Tarrio, a Miami resident, served as national chairman for the far-right extremist group, whose members describe it as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” He and the other Proud Boys could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of seditious conspiracy.Defense attorneys have argued there is no evidence the Proud Boys plotted to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying Biden’s electoral victory.Hernandez didn't name the informant in her court filing, but she said it is somebody who has serving as a “confidential human source” for the federal government since April 2021 through at least January 2023. Prosecutors knew in December that the person was a potential trial witness but didn't inform defense lawyers until Wednesday that the witness has been a federal informant, she said.It's not the first time the government's use of informants has become an issue in the case. Defense attorneys have repeatedly pushed to get more information about informants in the far-right extremist group as they try to undermine the notion that the group had a plan to attack the Capital on Jan. 6.FBI Agent Nicole Miller testified last week that she was aware of two informants in the Proud Boys, including one who marched on the Capital on Jan. 6.Hernandez said there are “reasons to doubt the veracity of the government’s explanation and justification for withholding information about the (confidential human sources) who have been involved in the case.” She could not immediately be reached for additional comment.Law enforcement routinely uses informants in criminal investigations, but their methods and identities can be closely guarded secrets. Federal authorities haven't publicly released much information about their use of informants in investigating the Proud Boys' role in a mob's attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter leader. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Rehl was president of the Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia. Pezzola was a Proud Boys member from Rochester, New York.___Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World

Towns was averaging 20.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 21 games before the injury.“Expectations are that he just kind of settles into the flow of the game, not try to do too much at this point in time,"" Minnesota coach Chris Finch said before the Timberwolves hosted the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. “Most importantly, knock the rust off.

Then he felt it again in the first half Wednesday in Chicago.Philadelphia (49-23) visits Golden State on Friday night for its next game. Embiid said he likely will be able to play against the Warriors, but isn't exactly sure how the injury would react.“If it feels good, of course I will want to play,” he said. “But if it's not right, then we're going to figure it out.”Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers called Embiid's injury “very mild.”“We just felt like (keeping him out) was the right thing to do,"" Rivers said.Star guard James Harden and forward Jalen McDaniels missed Wednesday night's win with injuries. Harden was sidelined by left Achilles soreness, and McDaniels was ruled out because of right hip soreness.Harden played almost 47 minutes during Monday night's loss to the Bulls, finishing with five points on 2-for-14 shooting and 12 assists. He is averaging 21.4 points and an NBA-high 10.8 assists in 53 games this season.Rivers said he thinks Harden will be able to play against Golden State.“We've gone into the playoffs two years in a row with injuries,” Rivers said. “We all know you don't win in the playoffs if your key guys aren't healthy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843944,Escape-artist Missouri bear heads to Texas zoo with moat,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — An escape-artist bear from Missouri is headed to a Texas zoo with a moat in hopes that it will put an end to his wandering.The St. Louis Zoo cited the “specific and unique personality” of the Andean bear named Ben in announcing the move Tuesday. His soon-to-be home at the Gladys Porter Zoo near South Padre Island in Brownsville, Texas, has a long history of working with Andean bears. But it's still adding some extra security measures.“We’re confident it’s going to be good for Ben,"" said Walter Dupree, the Texas zoo’s curator of mammals.Ben gained notoriety in February by busting out of his habitat twice.The first time, the 4-year-old, 280-pound (127-kilogram) bear tore apart clips that attached stainless steel mesh to the frame of a door. But he was recaptured before the zoo opened for the day.Zoo workers then added zip tie-like attachments made of stainless steel that had 450 pounds (204 kilograms) of tensile strength. But Ben managed to escape through those about two weeks later. The zoo was open this time, but he was captured less than an hour later on a public path.Ben now lives in a nonpublic area of the St. Louis Zoo, where he can move indoors and out — and even splash in a pool — while he awaits his move.“He’s so fun, he’s so playful — we would love to be able to keep him here,” said Regina Mossotti, the St. Louis Zoo’s vice president of animal care.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843946,Arrest made in fire at planned Wyoming abortion clinic,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A woman was arrested on charges of setting fire to a building in Wyoming that was being renovated to house the state’s only full-service abortion clinic, authorities said Wednesday, hours after a judge temporarily blocked a ban on abortion that went into effect a few days ago.Lorna Roxanne Green, 22, of Casper, was arrested on Tuesday by Casper police and agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Wyoming U.S. Attorney Nicholas Vassallo said in a statement.Green faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, according to the statement. She is scheduled to appear in federal court in Cheyenne on Thursday morning.The fire was set on May 25, 2022, at a stucco house in Casper, the state’s second-largest city and the site of frequent anti-abortion protests.A witness told police they heard glass breaking and saw a person leaving the area carrying a gas can and a black bag. Security video released by police showed a woman in a hooded shirt and mask carrying what appeared to be a red fuel can through a room of the building just before the fire.No one was injured in the blaze, which left the planned Wellspring Health Access clinic with broken windows and smoke damage.“Now that a suspect has been arrested, we can continue our singular focus on providing quality reproductive health care to the Casper community in a safe, compassionate environment,” Wellspring President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.The clinic had been scheduled to open last summer as the only facility of its kind in the state, offering women’s health care, family planning and gender-affirming health care in addition to abortion services. But the fire delayed those plans.It was then slated to open next month but was thrown into doubt after Gov. Mark Gordon allowed a broad new abortion ban to take effect on Sunday without his signature. On Wednesday, Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens halted the ban after a hearing in which abortion-rights supporters said the law harms pregnant women and their doctors and violates the state constitution. Owens suspended the ban for at least two weeks.The ban prohibits abortion at all stages of pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest that’s reported to police, or to save a woman’s life. An amendment in the Wyoming Constitution says adults have a right to make their own health care decisions, so Republicans enacted a ban that states abortion is not health care.Owens had also blocked a previous ban since shortly after it took effect last summer.Prior to the latest ban, a clinic in the mountain town of Jackson provided medication abortions.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843964,"Gonzaga's Timme, UCLA's Jaquez to meet one more time","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Drew Timme and Jaime Jaquez Jr. grew up in different states, yet often came across each other at AAU tournaments, sometimes as roommates.The two fancy-footworking forwards with fantastic facial hair will be reunited Thursday night in the desert, when Gonzaga meets UCLA in the NCAA Tournament's West Region semifinals.“We’ve just kind of grown up at the end of our careers together and just to kind of see him from afar, it’s awesome to see,” Timme said Wednesday.Since those early high school days, Timme and Jaquez have become the focal points for the West's two powerhouse programs.The 6-foot-11 Timme has been one of the nation's best big men during his time in Spokane, Washington, leading the Zags to four of their eight straight Sweet 16 appearances, including the 2021 national title game.Timme's impeccable footwork, multitude of up-fakes, soft touch and basketball smarts have made him a near-impossible matchup for opposing defenses. He's Gonzaga's all-time leading scorer and was named to the Associated Press All-America second team for the third straight season after averaging 21.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game.Timme also has a knack for taking over in big games, like he did last week by scoring 28 points in Gonzaga's second-round win over TCU.“It’s great to see him and all the success he’s had there,” Jaquez said. “I credit that to all the hard work that he’s put in. And it was very cool to have full-circle moments like that in life.”Jaquez has had a similar impact — and game — at UCLA.The 6-7 swingman has balanced and nimble footwork similar to Timme's, loves to throw multiple up-fakes in the post and always seems to make the smart play. He's been a part of UCLA's three straight Sweet 16 trips, including the 2021 Final Four, and was a second-team AP All-American after averaging 17.5 points and 8.1 rebounds this season.“He’s super talented,” Timme said. “He can score at all three levels. He does everything for them, but he’s just a hard, smart guy. He’s always playing his tail off and working.”Timme and the Zags won the last two meetings, in Las Vegas in 2021 and on Jalen Suggs' buzzer-beating 3-pointer in the Final Four the year before.As for the facial hair, that seems to be a draw.Jaquez has stuck with the pirate-looking goatee throughout his career, while Timme has brought back the bristly mustache his mom once hated.REBOUNDING HUSKIESA key for Arkansas' bid to beat UConn in the Sweet 16 will be keeping the Huskies off the glass.UConn was one of the nation's best rebounding teams during the regular season, averaging eight more per game than its opponents. The Huskies have been just as dominant so far in the NCAA Tournament, grabbing 16 more rebounds than Iona and nine more than Saint Mary's.“A lot of teams will send three to the glass and two back, but they, almost every possession they’re sending four to the glass,” Arkansas coach Eric Musselman said. “So we’ve got to do a good job defensive rebounding, and then we’ll see how that affects our transition offense as well.”GOING SHIRTLESSMusselman attracted national attention by taking off his shirt when the Razorbacks eliminated defending national champion Kansas on Saturday.It's not new — he was doing that after big victories in his previous stop at Nevada.“I guess my emotions got the best of me,” Musselman said. “My wife’s not always happy about that. But it’s not something that we plan on doing all the time. It's just kind of, emotions run through you.”Razorbacks forward Kamani Johnson said seeing his coach with his shirt off is a good thing.“I always say a happy Muss is a happy us,” he said.Johnson said the Musselman on the TV screen is the same one in person no matter the time of day.“If you haven’t met him, you probably would be scared because you don’t know how he’s going to come at you,” Arkansas guard Davonte Davis said. “You never know. But it’s fun and it’s exciting. This journey has been really exciting with him.”BACK AT HOMEFor Gonzaga junior guard Julian Strawther, the trip to Las Vegas is a homecoming. He played at Liberty High School in the suburb of Henderson and became a top-100 prospect.“It’s kind of like a full-circle moment,” said Strawther, who averages 15.3 points and 6.1 rebounds. “It’s always a dream playing in March Madness, and not too many people get the luxury of playing in their hometown, especially in a regional final. It's huge for me, it's huge for my family and it's huge for everybody that I know.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843965,Starbucks workers protest before annual shareholder meeting,"SEATTLE (AP) — Starbucks workers and labor activists rallied outside the company’s Seattle headquarters Wednesday to protest what they describe as union-busting efforts by executives.Organizers said employees also walked off the job at more than 100 stores in 40 U.S. cities, though the company disputed the breadth of the protests and said nearly every store remained open. It did not immediately indicate how many locations closed. Some stores remained open because workers remained on the job, while others were staffed by employees from nearby stores who took additional shifts to cover for strikers, Starbucks said.The demonstrations came on the eve of the company's annual shareholders meeting and were designed to urge new Chief Executive Officer Laxman Narasimhan to take a more welcoming approach to unionization efforts, said organizers with Starbucks Workers United, which has asked shareholders to vote for a third party to assess the company’s commitment to labor rights.“Starbucks baristas like me are the ones who keep our stores running. We remember our customers’ regular orders, make the lattes, clean up spills, and are often the bright spot of our customers’ days,"" Sarah Pappin, a Seattle Starbucks worker, said in a prepared statement. “Starbucks should respect our right to organize and meet us at the bargaining table.""At least 280 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Workers are asking for better pay, more consistent schedules and safer stores, among other things. Starbucks and the union have not yet reached a contract agreement at any of those stores.The company opposes unionization, saying it already provides industry-leading benefits and that its stores function better when the company works directly with employees. The labor activists say workers have trouble obtaining enough hours to qualify for Starbucks benefits.Each side has repeatedly complained of the other's tactics to the National Labor Relations Board. Last week, a federal labor judge found the company violated U.S. labor laws “hundreds of times” during a unionization campaign in Buffalo, New York. The judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven fired workers and required former CEO Howard Schultz to read or be present at a reading of employee rights and distribute a recording of the reading to all of Starbucks’ U.S. employees.Faced with a possible vote to subpoena him, Schultz has agreed to testify next week before a U.S. Senate committee headed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The panel is examining Starbucks’ actions amid the unionization campaign.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843966,Brazil watchdog tells Bolsonaro to cede jewels from Saudis,"SAO PAULO (AP) — A Brazilian government watchdog voted Wednesday to give former President Jair Bolsonaro five working days to return to authorities a set of jewels he received from Saudi Arabia in 2021.All nine members of the government watchdog voted in favor of requiring Bolsonaro to turn the jewels over to the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal bank in the capital city of Brasilia.The five days start counting as soon as Bolsonaro's lawyers are officially notified, which had not happened, according to the government watchdog.Another set of jewels from Saudi Arabia estimated to be worth several million dollars and also sent to Bolsonaro, according to one of his former ministers, was seized by customs at Sao Paulo's international airport.Bolsonaro, who has been in the United States since he left office in January, is under preliminary police investigations at home since Brazilian media started reporting on the jewels earlier this month.The Federal Court of Accounts, a legislative branch watchdog that oversees actions of Brazil's executive, also ruled that Bolsonaro must give some weapons he received from the United Arab Emirates to the presidential collection.Bolsonaro did not declare either set of jewels to tax authorities. Legal experts say he could face prosecution in the case.It is unclear whether the diamonds were a gift from Saudi authorities or not.Bolsonaro's lawyer, Frederick Wassef, said in a statement on March 7 that the former president received the goods in a “very personal” manner and denied there was any wrongdoing.The government watchdog rejected that argument in its decision Wednesday. It said the jewels had to be returned due to the “high value of the goods, which should not be incorporated to a private collection.”The watchdog decided earlier this month that it will look into every gift received by former Brazilian presidents at the end of their terms. It will also audit the collection received by Bolsonaro since he took office in 2019.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843967,"After tears, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr. hopes for joy Vegas","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Arkansas had just returned to its locker room after knocking out defending national champion and West Region No. 1 seed Kansas 72-71 on Saturday when Nick Smith Jr. could no longer control his emotions.He sat at his locker as the tears flowed and teammates consoled him, the video taking off on social media.Smith said he was overjoyed by the victory and the chance to play in the Sweet 16, but losing so much time this season to knee injuries and what he missed out on with his teammates hit him hard.“Once I got (the crying) out of the way, I celebrated with my guys at the crib,” Smith said Wednesday, a day ahead of No. 8 seed Arkansas' game against fourth-seeded UConn in the NCAA Tournament's West Region semifinals. “I moved on to the next. At the end of the day, people in my circle know who I am. People that I talk to every day know who I am.”Smith, a potential NBA lottery pick, has faced high expectations since signing with the Razorbacks. The 6-foot-5 freshman guard was the USA Today Boys Basketball Player of the Year and 247Sports’ top prospect.But he missed the first six games this season to injury, averaged 12.8 points in five games and then sat out from mid-December until nearly mid-February.Smith returned to score more than 20 points three times over a four-game span and entered the NCAA Tournament averaging 14 points.Then came March Madness, and Arkansas' most notable recruit in 30 years didn't meet the moment.Smith made just 2 of 10 shots and scored six points in the first round against Illinois, and then against Kansas, he took four shots and did not score. Coach Eric Musselman, understanding the urgency and decreased margin for error in the single-elimination tournament, reduced Smith’s playing time from 28 minutes in the opener to 17 in the second round.“Nick’s one of the most talented players in the country, and he’s had some big games for us,” Musselman said. “He’s been in a tough situation, in and out of the lineup with injuries. It’s not easy for any player to do, let alone when a team’s on a tournament run.”Musselman said he was hopeful Smith would turn it around, but it’s clear any playing time will be earned.“We know how he feels to be in a position he’s in and have all the pressure that everybody’s putting on him,” said Arkansas guard Davonte Davis, a childhood friend of Smith's. “For him to come back, that’s amazing. He’s a young man that a lot of people can’t faze, and it’s tough to be in his world today to be able to take on the things he’s taking on.”Smith downplayed the notion that he got emotional after the win over Kansas because he wasn't as big a part of that victory as he'd hoped.As the video showed, Smith didn't lose the locker room. His teammates were there quickly to make sure he knew he wasn't alone.“We know who he is as a player,” forward Kamani Johnson said. “He knows who he is as a player. We don’t have to give him too much encouragement. He’s a dog, we know he’s a dog, and we know what he can do.”Smith said he hasn't spoken with his coach about possibly getting more minutes against UConn and, should the Razorbacks advance, against UCLA or Gonzaga on Saturday for the right to go to the Final Four.“My story's not over,” Smith said. “I've got to keep going and keep pushing through, hoping we can get a win.”Winning in an Arkansas uniform is especially meaningful for Smith, who is from the Little Rock area. He is considered the program's best recruit since Corliss Williamson, another Arkansas native who led the Razorbacks to the 1994 national championship before going on to a 12-year NBA career.“This experience of the Sweet 16 — and I haven't played the game yet — has been amazing,” Smith said. “When we landed in Vegas, it really doesn't get much better than this. We've got another opportunity to play, and that's why I came here to play basketball.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843968,U.S. Fed delivers small rate hike amid global banking turmoil,"March 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases in borrowing costs after the recent collapse of two U.S. banks.Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to reassure investors about the soundness of the banking system, saying that the management of Silicon Valley Bank ""failed badly,"" but that the bank's collapse did not indicate wider weaknesses in the banking system.""These are not weaknesses that are running broadly through the banking system,"" he said, adding that the takeover of Credit Suisse seemed to have been a positive outcome.The Federal Open Market Committee policy statement also said the U.S. banking system is ""sound and resilient.""Even so, Wall Street ended sharply lower after Powell told a news conference that officials were still intent on fighting inflation while also eying the extent to which recent bank failures had cooled demand and slowed lending.The much-anticipated rate hike by the Fed, which had delivered eight previous rate hikes in the past year, sought to balance the risk of rampant inflation with the threat of instability in the banking system.But in a key shift driven by the sudden failures this month of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, the Fed's latest policy statement no longer says that ""ongoing increases"" in rates will likely be appropriate.The banking sector has been in turmoil after California regulators on March 10 closed Silicon Valley Bank in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.The collapse of the Santa Clara, California-based bank and Signature Bank SBNY.O, another U.S. midsized lender, prompted a rout in banking stocks as investors worried about other ticking bombs in the banking system and led to UBS Group AG's UBSG.S takeover of 167-year-old Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S to avert a wider crisis.The Fed's relentless rate hikes to rein in inflation are among factors blamed for the biggest banking sector meltdown since the 2008 financial crisis.""The Fed is now living on a hope and a prayer that they haven’t done irreparable harm to the banking system,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. ""The Fed is probably thinking financial stresses are substituting for future rate increases.""Meanwhile, as beleaguered First Republic Bank FRC.N considers its options, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday there is no discussion on insurance for all deposits.She told a congressional hearing that the government ""is not considering insuring all uninsured bank deposits."" She also said the Treasury Department has not considered anything to do with guarantees for assets. First Republic shares closed down more than 15%.As officials grapple with restoring confidence in the banking system, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to meet with Lael Brainard, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, during the executive's planned trip to Washington, according to a person familiar with the situation.BANK SUPERVISIONThe latest move to restore calm to restive regional bank stocks came as Pacific Western Bank PACW.O, one of the regional lenders caught up in the market volatility, said it had raised $1.4 billion from investment firm Atlas SP Partners.Shares of the bank closed down 17% even as it tried to assuage investor worries by saying it had more than $11.4 billion in cash as of March 20.But less than two weeks after Silicon Valley Bank sank under the weight of bond-related losses due to surging interest rates, the CEO of hedge fund Man Group EMG.L, Luke Ellis, said the turmoil was not over and predicted further bank failures.Policymakers from Washington to Tokyo have stressed the turmoil is different from the crisis 15 years ago, saying banks are better capitalised and funds more easily available.SVB's collapse kicked off a tumultuous 10 days for banks which led to the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) weekend takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS UBSG.S.In further fallout, a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat in the U.S. Senate are introducing legislation to replace the Fed's internal watchdog with one appointed by the president, aiming to tighten bank supervision following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank.Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Elizabeth Warren blamed the collapse of the two banks on regulatory failures at the U.S. central bank, which has operated up to now with an internal inspector general who reports to the Fed board.The Fed was not immediately available for comment.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has moved the bid deadline for Silicon Valley Private Bank to Friday from Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Earlier this week, the FDIC decided to break up Silicon Valley Bank and hold two separate auctions for its traditional deposits unit and its private bank after failing to find a buyer for the failed lender last week.",2023/03/23,149,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843969,"NHL team won't wear Pride jerseys, citing new Russian law","A National Hockey League team with a Russian player has decided against wearing special warmup jerseys to commemorate Pride night, citing an anti-gay Kremlin law that could imperil Russian athletes when they return home.The Chicago Blackhawks, who have at least two more players with connections to Russia, will not wear Pride-themed warmup jerseys before Sunday's game against Vancouver, a person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press, because of security concerns involving the law, which expands restrictions on supporting LGBTQ rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed it in December.The decision was made by the Blackhawks following discussions with security officials within and outside the franchise, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke Wednesday to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the move.Chicago coach Luke Richardson said Thursday that he and his players were disappointed and called it “an unfortunate situation.”“I don’t think we can control the world issues, so that takes it out of our hands,” Richardson said. ""We’re just making decisions as best we can as an organization and for everybody.”The league declined to comment through a spokesperson.The decision comes amid increasing threats to freedom of expression in the U.S. and abroad. Conservative political forces have sought to ban LGBTQ-themed books from American school libraries and to forbid classroom lessons that mention sexuality and some aspects of race relations.Similar pressures have forced Russian players to walk a careful line since the invasion of Ukraine, with some cautiously speaking out against the war even with family members still living in Russia. Last year, Minnesota Wild star Kirill Kaprizov ran into several roadblocks as he traveled back to the U.S., raising concerns about his safety.“There’s such a sensitivity to the topic, and you have concerns for the Russians, especially,” Buffalo Sabres captain Kyle Okposo said, emphasizing that he does not “understand what it’s like to be in Russia and to grow up there. And I don’t think we’re able to speak about the psychology of those players because we don’t understand.""Chicago defenseman Nikita Zaitsev is a Moscow native, and there are other players with family in Russia or other connections to the country.The Florida Panthers — whose star goaltender, Sergei Bobrovsky, is Russian — went forward with plans to wear Pride-themed jerseys Thursday night before their home game against Toronto. Bobrovsky took part, while brothers Eric and Marc Staal did not, and cited religion as the reason.“We carry no judgement on how people choose to live their lives, and believe that all people should be welcome in all aspects of the game of hockey,” the Staal brothers said in a statement. “Having said that, we feel that by us wearing a Pride jersey it goes against our Christian beliefs.”The jerseys are just one part of many initiatives the Panthers built into the annual event, including auctioning off the jerseys, matching the money raised and donating it to nonprofits that work with the LGBTQ community.Speaking after Florida's 6-2 loss, Panthers coach Paul Maurice described the Staal brothers as men of faith, and then noted how the rest of the team wore the warmup jerseys.“I love both of those men and they have the right to their opinion. I stand by that right,” he said. “But everyone else in the room has the right to put that sweater on proudly and wear it and be welcoming to all people in our community.”The Sabres and Vancouver Canucks have Pride nights upcoming. The Canucks have not announced specific plans for the event. Sabres management was scheduled to hold discussions Thursday with its player leadership group on the matter, amid concern over whether defenseman Ilya Lyubushkin will participate because he is from Moscow, where he still has family and returns in the offseason to visit.Lyubushkin and his family members could face a backlash in Russia, according to a Sabres employee with knowledge of the issue. The person spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.In other sports, members of Major League Baseball’s Tampa Bay Rays decided last season not to wear rainbow-colored logos on their uniforms as part of their Pride night. Women's basketball star Brittney Griner, an American citizen who is gay, was arrested at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport last year after Russian authorities said she was carrying vape canisters with cannabis oil. She was imprisoned for eight months until a high-profile prisoner swap with the U.S.Kurt Weaver, chief operating officer of the You Can Play Project, which advocates for LGBTQ participation in sports, said he was upset when he learned of the Blackhawks’ decision, but he called the conversation an indicator of progress.“We are certainly disappointed that the jerseys aren’t worn, because that’s the No. 1 visual representation from the athletes themselves, and I know a lot of the athletes do support this effort and support their community that comes to watch them,” Weaver said, adding praise for the Blackhawks’ commitment to Pride causes dating back more than a decade.Ivan Provorov of the Philadelphia Flyers declined to take part in pregame warmups during the team’s Pride night in January, citing his Russian Orthodox religion. Russians Nikolai Knyzhov and Alexander Barabanov wore the Pride-themed jerseys for the San Jose Sharks Sharks on Saturday, when Canadian goaltender James Reimer refused to take part because, like the Staals, he said it conflicted with his religious beliefs.The New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild opted not to wear Pride jerseys or use Pride stick tape as part of their events despite previously advertising they would.The Blackhawks planned a variety of LGBT-related activities in conjunction with Sunday's game. DJs from the LGBTQ community will play before the game and during an intermission, and the Chicago Gay Men’s Chorus is slated to perform. There also are plans to highlight a couple of area businesses with ties to the gay community.“We don’t want the jerseys to represent the entirety of the night,"" Blackhawks defenseman Seth Jones said. “We’re still doing a lot for the LGBTQ community, and us as players respect that. We just thought that this was best for our team.""___AP Sports Writers John Wawrow, Josh Dubow and Tim Reynolds, and AP freelance reporter George Richards contributed to this report.___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843970,Big jump in migrants crossing Panama's dangerous Darien Gap,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama’s government said Wednesday that 50,000 migrants crossed the treacherous Darien Gap linking Colombia and Panama in the first two months of 2023, five times more than in the same period last year.For 2022 as a whole, a total of 250,000 migrants made the crossing, with big spikes in September and October, a trend that suggests the number that is likely to increase even more later this year.The increase was particularly noticeable among children and underage migrants. The People’s Defense Office said 9,683 migrants younger than 18 crossed the jungle-clad Darien route in January and February. That was seven times as many minors as crossed in the same period last year. The office said 1,119 of the latest young migrants were not accompanied by adults.The office and U.N. rights organizations said the Darien Gap crossing has now become an established route for migrants heading from South America to the U.S. border.“Year by year the number of migrants crossing through Panama grows, and the trend in the first months of 2023 suggest an unprecedented growth,” said Alberto Brunori, the Central America regional representative of the U.N. human rights office.The 250,000 migrants who crossed in 2022 was nearly double the 133,000 who crossed in 2021, according to the International Organization for Migration.The trip through the inhospitable jungle is fraught with dangers, including thieves, human traffickers and the possibility of sexual assault. Armed groups operate in the region.The unprecedented numbers come as the United States government tries to make the journey less appealing.The administration said Jan. 5 that it would admit up to 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela on a process called humanitarian parole if they applied online, entered at an airport and found a financial sponsor.At the same time, Mexico agreed to take back the same amount from those countries who enter the U.S. illegally and are expelled under Title 42, which denies them rights to seek asylum, with the stated goal of preventing the spread of COVID-19.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843971,Palestinians and Israelis clash at UN over Netanyahu actions,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Palestinians and Israel clashed over the future intentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far right-wing government at a U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday, with the Palestinian U.N. ambassador pointing to an Israeli minister’s statement “denying our existence to justify what is to come.”Israel’s U.N. ambassador countered that the minister had apologized, and accused the Palestinian leadership of regularly inciting terrorism and erasing Jewish history.The council’s always contentious monthly meeting on the Mideast was even more acrimonious in the face of comments and actions by Israel’s new coalition government, which has faced relentless protests over its plan to overhaul the judiciary and strong criticism of Tuesday's repeal by lawmakers of a 2005 act that saw four Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank dismantled at the same time that Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip.Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour told the Security Council the statement by firebrand Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claiming there’s “no such thing” as a Palestinian people wasn’t part of “a theoretical exercise” but was made as Israel’s unlawful annexation of territory the Palestinians insist must be part of their independent state “is more than underway.”While not all Israeli officials go as far as denying the existence of Palestinians, some deny Palestinian rights, humanity and connection to the land, Mansour said.Last year was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank, with the past three months “even worse,” he said. So far this year, 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, and Palestinian attackers have killed 15 Israelis, according to a tally by The Associated Press.Nonetheless, with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the approach of the Jewish holiday Passover and Christianity’s Easter observance, Mansour said the Palestinians decided to be “unreasonably reasonable” and leave no stone unturned to prevent bloodshed.The Palestinian envoy urged the Security Council and the international community to mobilize every effort “to stop annexation, violence against our people, and provocations.” Everyone has a duty to act now “with every means at our disposal, to prevent a fire that will devour everything it encounters,” he said.Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called his country “unquestionably the most vibrant liberal democracy in the Middle East” and accused the Palestinians of repeating lies, glorifying terrorists who spilled innocent Israeli blood and “regurgitating fabrications” that are not going to solve the decades-old conflict.“To the Palestinian representative, I say: 'Shame on you. Shame on you.’ It is so audacious that you dare condemn the words of Israeli minister who apologized and clarified what he meant, while your president and the rest of (the) Palestinian leadership regularly, regularly incite terrorism, never condemn the murders of Israeli civilians, praise Palestinian terrorists, and actively attempt to rewrite facts and the truth by erasing Jewish history,” he said.Erdan accused the Palestinians of being “dead set on encouraging more violence” while Israel has taken significant steps to de-escalate the current tensions by sitting down with Palestinian officials in Jordan in February and on Sunday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.In a joint communique afterward, the two sides had pledged to take steps to lower tensions ahead of the sensitive holiday season — including a partial freeze on Israeli settlement activity and an agreement to work together to “curb and counter violence.”The Palestinians seek the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Mideast war. Since then, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into dozens of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem — which most of the world considers illegal and an obstacle to peace.But Netanyahu’s government has put settlement expansion at the top of its agenda and has already advanced thousands of new settlement housing units and retroactively authorized nine wildcat outposts in the West Bank.The repeal of the 2005 act on the four West Bank settlements came after Sunday’s agreement, and a Palestinian shooting attack that wounded two Israelis in the West Bank underscored the difficulties in implementing the joint communique. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, criticized the repeal, summoning Israel’s U.S. ambassador, and other countries were also critical.Netanyahu appeared to back down Wednesday, saying his government has no intention of returning to the four abandoned settlements.Ambassador Erdan echoed him, saying “the state of Israel has no intention of building any new communities there,” but he said the new law “rights a historic wrong” and will allow Israelis to enter areas that are “the birthplace of our heritage.”",2023/03/23,,World

(AP) — Two-time All-Star guard Ja Morant was welcomed back Wednesday night with a standing ovation and cheers throughout the arena in his first action after missing nine games — eight because of an NBA suspension.Morant, who was not in the starting lineup against the Houston Rockets, entered the game after a timeout with 3:05 left in the first quarter, replacing starter Tyus Jones. The cheers began to build as Morant rose from the bench and made his way to the scorer's table, adjusting the specially fit mask from a previous nasal fracture.The standing ovation and the cheers reached their peak even before Morant was announced as entering the game.Morant ended up playing 24 minutes and finished with 17 points on 6-for-13 shooting overall and 5 for 6 from the line as the Grizzlies beat the Rockets 130-125. Morant added five assists and four rebounds.The first cheers came when Morant emerged from the locker room for pregame warmups.Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the decision for Morant to come off the bench was a collaborative one after discussions with Morant and the team's medical personnel. The Grizzlies are making sure Morant is building up to game shape. Memphis also went 6-3 during Morant's absence contributing to the decision.“This was something he brought to the table as well as it's been on my mind,” Jenkins said before the game. “So, we collectively thought this was the best strategy at least for the first one or two games. Then we will kind of reevaluate after that.”This is Morant's first action since the Grizzlies lost March 3 at Denver. Hours after the game, Morant live-streamed himself at a Denver-area strip club showing himself briefly brandishing a gun.That earned Morant a sit-down with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and $669,000 in pay for the suspension in which the league ruled his conduct was ""detrimental to the league.”Morant's suspension ended with Saturday's game against Golden State. He did not play in Monday's game against Dallas, as the team allowed him to work on conditioning before returning to action.That came Wednesday night. Jenkins said the star guard probably would play between 20 and 25 minutes.“We want to be really smart, not just over the first couple of game, but the first week to two.” Jenkins said. “We want to be smart with that layoff that we're not doing anything to jeopardize his health as well.”In his first comments since his suspension, Morant said Tuesday that he went to counseling at a Florida facility during his suspension to deal with the stress of becoming one of the NBA's most popular players.His enthusiastic play, with high-scoring and jaw-dropping dunks, have led to endorsements and rising uniform sales. Asked about whether the short period in counseling was enough to resolve his issues, Morant said it's an ongoing process.Jenkins emphasized that Morant being used in a reserve role is simply a focus on transition.“Eventually, Ja will be our starter,” Jenkins said, drawing a laugh from reporters.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843974,Keegan Bradley's latest tie in Match Play feels like a win,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Keegan Bradley extended his dubious streak to 16 matches over 11 years without winning in the Dell Technologies Match Play. He sure felt like a winner Wednesday.Bradley was 4 down with five holes to play when he rallied to scratch out a halve against Denny McCarthy in the opening round at Austin Country Club.“Gosh, that felt good,” Bradley said. “That was a grind. That has the possibility of going a long way, so I'm excited about it.”Defending champion and top seed Scottie Scheffler missed two putts inside 5 feet over the last five holes before making a 12-footer for birdie on the 18th to beat Davis Riley in a rematch of their U.S. Junior Amateur title match 10 years ago that Scheffler won.Jon Rahm, the No. 2 seed, was the only player from the top four seeds to lose. Rickie Fowler took him down on the 17th hole, the first time Rahm has lost in the opening round.Matt Kuchar, at 44 the oldest player in the field, outlasted Viktor Hovland and won his 35th match, one short of the career tournament record held by Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy had a shorter shaft in his driver and a new putter, and both worked just fine in his 3-and-1 victory over Scott Stallings.Nothing was decided Wednesday in the first of three rounds of group play. One player from each of the 16 groups will move on for the knockout stage on the weekend. But every point helps, and even a half-point felt big for Bradley.He made his Match Play debut in 2012 by beating Geoff Ogilvy, who has the highest winning percentage (80%) in tournament history. That was Bradley's last win. He has lost nine and halved seven matches since then, and it wasn't without a fight. This was his 11th consecutive match dating to 2015 that it was decided on the 18th hole, lose or draw.“Man, it was looking pretty bleak there for a while, but I just put my head down,” said Bradley, who drove into the water on the reachable par-4 13th to make bogey, going 4 down and running out of holes.“I finally started hitting some good shots coming in, and it definitely paid off,” he said.He won the 14th when McCarthy missed a 4-foot par putt. Bradley won the 15th with a birdie putt from 6 feet, the par-5 16th with a 6-foot eagle. After they halved the par-3 17th, Bradley hit wedge to 6 feet to win the last hole for a halve.Adam Scott felt even better. He never led the entire match against Seamus Power until he made a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole.“Just to win something feels good. I haven't won anything in a long time,” said Scott, whose last PGA Tour victory was three years ago at Riviera.Scheffler, who has won and lost in the championship match in his two appearances in the Match Play, never trailed against Riley. It was never easy, particularly the pillow fight that ensued at the end.Scheffler drove to the edge of the green on the 13th and made a 25-foot eagle putt for a 2-up lead that seemingly put him in control. But then he hooked his next tee shot into the Colorado River and still had a chance to halve the hole until missing a 5-foot putt.The Masters champion missed a 10-footer on the 15th. Riley had a chance to square the match on the 16th until he missed a 3-foot putt. Scheffler returned the favor when he missed a 3-footer on the 17th that would have closed out the match.With Riley just 8 feet away for a birdie attempt on the 18th, Scheffler made his 12-footer and gave a light fist pump and a big sigh of relief.“I'm going to remember the putt on the last hole and take that energy into tomorrow,” Scheffler said.A long day offered plenty of great shots, from J.J. Spaun holing out from the 13th fairway during his win over U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick to Jordan Spieth ending his match by chipping in for birdie from a squirrelly lie to beat Mackenzie Hughes, 4 and 3.Kuchar would not even be eligible for the 64-man field if not for nine LIV Golf players being ineligible. Now he is taking aim at Woods, who was 36-12 with three titles. Kuchar won the opening three holes and then had to hang on against Hovland, the No. 8 seed who made too many mistakes to catch up.“I've been out here a while,” said Kuchar, whose Match Play record improved to 35-11-4. ""Any time you're in a conversation with Tiger Woods, this is a very cool thing.”McIlroy has struggled with the driver this year, so he went to a 44-inch shaft that was slightly softer (he was at 44 1/2 inches) to get more spin. He also had a replica putter similar to the one he used to win his first two majors a decade ago.“I needed to go to a slightly softer shaft and I can hit more shots with it and feel a bit more comfortable,” he said. ""So it was good to see. It was good to put it in play today and have to perform pretty well. Drove it well, especially on the back nine.“Obviously this part of the season you’ve got one eye on what you’re doing now and one eye on Augusta.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

(AP) — Some evacuation orders were lifted while others remained Wednesday as heavy rains began to dissipate in northern Arizona, but flooding threats lingered.Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office officials said residents in Sedona could go home after determining that Oak Creek waters had gone down enough but said they should still be prepared to evacuate if needed.Nearby in Cornville, people at lower ground along Oak Creek were also told to consider evacuating or be ready to.Meanwhile, residents in one area of Camp Verde were told to evacuate because of flooding in low-lying areas along the Verde River. A shelter has been set up.For the past two days, authorities have said rising floodwaters have made some neighborhoods in the Sedona and Cottonwood areas unsafe.Evacuations also were ordered for portions of Black Canyon City, including an RV park, along the Agua Fria River in Yavapai County.The National Weather Service in Flagstaff said Wednesday afternoon that even though the stormy weather has appeared to wind down, there will be excessive runoff. Area creeks, streams and rivers will see higher flows. People are urged to keep away from fast-moving rivers and streams and to not try to cross any flooded roadways.Also in Yavapai County, the city of Prescott is warning residents to stay out of certain streams and creeks because of possible contamination. The storms have increased flows in the sewer system, which transports household and commercial sewage to two wastewater facilities.The sewer system, however, has been “stretched to its maximum capacity” because of all the storm water and snowmelt, city officials said in a news release. Crews have been trying to keep any flow in, but manholes near Granite Creek have exceeded capacity.Officials say crews will begin disinfecting all impacted areas after the flows recede.Weather conditions have already forced the closures of some streets and low-water crossings.Salt River Project officials said storms have compelled the utility to increase the number of water releases from its two reservoirs on the Verde River.The reservoirs were already more than 80% full.Recent surveys found that snowpack on the 13,000-square-mile (34,000-square-kilometer) watershed that feeds into those Verde reservoirs is the deepest it’s been in 30 years.The Salt River Project, which serves mainly central Arizona, operates by strategically releasing water from dams on the Salt and Verde rivers into a network of canals.",2023/03/23,,World

Japan does not claim Paramushir, one of the northern Kuril islands.The issue has prevented Moscow and Tokyo ever signing a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.MODERNISATIONRussian armed forces in the east of the country have received around 400 items of modern military equipment over the past year, including SU-57 jets and anti-aircraft missile systems, Shoigu said.""The military capabilities of the eastern military district have significantly increased,"" he said.Shoigu also said the modernisation of Moscow's air defence system would be completed this year.Russian officials have blamed Kyiv for a string of drone attacks deep inside Russian territory since the beginning of the military campaign in Ukraine.On the Ukraine conflict, Shoigu said Russian aerospace forces had so far destroyed more than 20,000 Ukrainian military facilities since the start of what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"".",2023/03/23,782,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843991,'The Young and the Restless' celebrates 50 years of drama,"NEW YORK (AP) — It all started on a late morning on a highway. A camera panned to the cab of a large semi-trailer truck. The driver wore a plaid shirt and a day's growth of beard. Next to him was a mysterious hitchhiker in expensive clothes that were ripped and a fresh head wound.He got out at Genoa City. And he stayed.That’s how “The Young and the Restless ” began on March 26, 1973, and a lot of people also stuck around Genoa City. The soap opera celebrates its 50th anniversary this month as the No. 1 daytime drama for 35 consecutive years, with fans growing up alongside the actors.“I think a huge reason why the audience has stuck with us for so long is because we are the same people. We are family members. We show up every day — sometimes more than a regular family member,” says Lauralee Bell, a star and daughter of the show's founders.Created by the late William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell, “The Young and the Restless” concerns the goings-on of several Midwestern families, some of whom have a lot and some who don't. William Bell was head writer for decades, giving the show a singular vision, unusual for soaps.Lauralee Bell, an Emmy-winner who plays good-girl Christine Blair Williams and first joined the show in 1983, says her dad would likely not be surprised by the show’s new milestone. “He said if you have two families that come from different backgrounds and good, solid characters, it’s endless material.”One of the ways the show will celebrate its milestone is with a masquerade ball storyline starting Thursday and continuing through the following week. Creators promise “surprise visits from fan favorites and secrets are revealed, forever changing the lives for the residents of Genoa City.” ""Entertainment Tonight"" also plans a March 27 special.The CBS soap has helped launch the careers of such primetime and film actors as Vivica A. Fox, David Hasselhoff, Adam Brody, Tom Selleck, Penn Badgley, Shemar Moore, Eva Longoria, Justin Hartley and the late Paul Walker. Eric Braeden plays the male lead Victor Newman, a villain of the highest quality who once kept his wife’s lover locked in his basement.Professor Elana Levine, who teaches media studies at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee and wrote “Her Stories: Daytime Soap Opera and US Television History,” says the staying power of soaps is that they get passed down from one generation to the next.“What streaming TV has shown us is that serialized narratives and stories that continue from episode to episode are really appealing and engaging,"" she says. ""Soaps did that before anybody and are the maximum version of that because the story is going for decades.”Among the cake-flinging food fights and evil twins on “The Young and the Restless,” there have also been important firsts — it aired the first live facelift on TV, back in 1984, and when veteran actor Kristoff St. John died in 2019, the cast and crew held a funeral for his character, bringing tears to a returning Moore.It became the first daytime drama with a character who had a mastectomy, it was the first soap opera to broadcast in HD and, perhaps most importantly, it welcomed leading Black actors in the 1980s before many other soaps.“'The Young and the Restless' attracted a big African American audience starting at that time because they were putting Black characters, front center, more so than some of the other soaps were,” says Levine.That's a legacy Bell is proud of and she puts it squarely as a result of her parents, whom she calls hard-working creators who demanded a lot from their writers and actors, even their kids.“My dad was not afraid of of being first. All the social issues he dealt with — date rape, AIDS, alcoholism, all of that. He really felt that if our audience bonded with these characters that they would learn,” says Bell. “If we could even help one person, it was worth it.”Show veteran Melody Thomas Scott recalls a story that featured infant CPR, which is nothing like the adult version. “I think Bill and Lee wanted the world to know the difference,” she says. On the soap, a baby swallows a coin and Victor Newman — of course — becomes the hero by showing viewers the correct CPR technique.“We got so many calls in our ‘Y&R’ office the day after that episode aired, some mothers in tears, so grateful,” she says. “That is the ultimate goal of sneaking in some social issues because it can save lives. It can change people’s lives.”One of Bill Bell’s hallmarks was telling stories in real time, for instance waiting for a couple’s first hand holding, then waiting a while before their first kiss. “If the audience doesn’t believe it and grow with them. It’s hard to buy sometimes,” his daughter says. The soap always stayed in the realm of reality: No getting possessed by the devil in Genoa City.Scott is celebrating her 44th year on the show as Nikki Newman, a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Her character has gone from a tempestuous, alcoholic stripper to the serial’s luminous and resourceful leading lady.She says the show has stayed true to Bill Bell's vision of a show with compelling characters played by beautiful people. Visually, the soap has stayed lush and elegant, with plenty of fresh flowers or candles onset. “We look different from any other show,” she says.Bell not only had a knack for storylines — he also knew his actors. Scott recalls being surprised when Bell paired her bratty character with tycoon Victor Newman, two people she thought had nothing in common.“We discovered that we had this chemistry that we certainly didn’t expect. But I think Bill, in all of his wisdom, somehow saw it in us,” she says. “You can’t force yourself to have chemistry with another actor. It just either is or isn’t. So we are eternally grateful that Bill was so psychic in knowing that we would click.”The Bell family has continued to be part of the DNA of modern soaps, with Lauralee acting, her brother Brad serving as executive producer and head writer for sister soap “The Bold and the Beautiful” and brother Bill Jr. as president of the family production companies who made a deal for “The Young and the Restless” to be seen overseas, with versions in Israel, Canada, Turkey and France, among others.“It was one of the first daytime soaps that got sold internationally,” says Levine. “I think that has been a key to its continued success and profitability. The money that any daytime soap brings in domestically has lessened over time and the audience has gotten smaller.”If any viewers need convincing the “The Young and the Restless” has penetrated popular culture, look for further than Mary J. Blige, who sampled the show’s theme song in her 2001 hit “No More Drama.”That mysterious man in the very first scene was Brad Elliot and ahead of him was plenty of drama — a love triangle with a pair of sisters, a marriage, the heartache of a miscarriage, a diagnosis of blindness and a divorce petition. Surgery restored his sight but his marriage never recovered. He left Genoa City after five years. The show continued.When Lauralee Bell looks at the TV landscape today, she sees variations on what her parents created in primetime shows like “The Crown” and “Succession.”“Every show is a soap, every nighttime show is a soap, all of these streaming shows are versions of soap operas,” she says. “So we’re all sort of a little tired of the soaps-are-on-their-way-out — well, every show is a soap, really.”___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843995,House GOP demands info from former prosecutors in Trump case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Wednesday demanded testimony and documents from two former Manhattan prosecutors who had been leading a criminal investigation into Donald Trump before quitting last year in a clash over the direction of the probe.Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sent letters to Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne as the party rallies around the former president. They request transcribed interviews and a series of communications by March 27. A grand jury in New York is weighing whether or not to bring an indictment against Trump.The letters, obtained by The Associated Press, are part of a larger GOP-led congressional investigation into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as he is wrapping up a probe into whether Trump engaged in an illegal hush money scheme involving a porn actor. Jordan and other senior Republicans have called the Bragg's investigation a “political persecution,” and one that is without merit.“Last year, you resigned from the office over Bragg’s initial reluctance to move forward with charges, shaming Bragg in your resignation letter — which was subsequently leaked — into bringing charges,” Jordan, an Ohio Republican, wrote in the letter to Pomerantz late Wednesday. “It now appears that your efforts to shame Bragg have worked as he is reportedly resurrecting a so-called ‘zombie’ case against President Trump using a tenuous and untested legal theory.”Requests for comment from Pomerantz and Dunne were not immediately returned Wednesday night.The outreach to Pomerantz and Dunne comes days after Jordan and two other Republican chairmen sent a letter to Bragg, a Democrat, seeking information about his actions in the Trump case, which they characterized as an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.” They requested testimony as well as documents and copies of any communications with the Justice Department.""No authorities wanted to take the case but then what changed? President Trump announces he’s running for president and shazam,” Jordan told reporters Monday.By effectively demanding transparency in the middle of a criminal investigation, House Republicans are using the power of their new majority to defend Trump — who is still seen as the leader of the party — as he mounts a second run for president.The Manhattan grand jury appears close to finishing its work, after hearing last week from Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, but the timing of a possible decision on whether to charge the ex-president remains uncertain. Prosecutors canceled a scheduled grand jury session Wednesday and it wasn’t clear if the panel would meet Thursday.Pomerantz and Dunne were top deputies tasked with running the investigation on a day-to-day basis. Both started on the probe under former District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., and Bragg asked them to stay when he took office in January. Both Vance and Bragg are Democrats.Pomerantz released a book last month titled “People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account."" In the book, he detailed how Vance authorized him in December 2021 to seek Trump’s indictment. He has portrayed the hush-money payments — made or arranged by Cohen — as perhaps the most challenging, legally fraught of the potential cases against the former president.Vance abandoned the hush-money angle in 2019, pivoting the investigation’s focus to other matters, but Pomerantz said he revisited it when he joined the office in January 2021, looking for a way to make more serious felony charges stick.He considered whether Trump could be charged with money laundering and explored if porn actor Stormy Daniels had demanded payment to remain quiet, thereby extorting him. Pomerantz said the hush-money matter became known around the office as the “zombie” case.Still, Pomerantz wrote, “Over the months that I and others worked on the case, we developed evidence convincing us that Donald Trump had committed serious crimes.”Even if a conviction wasn’t a certainty, Pomerantz said he thought they owed it the public to bring the case to trial. “Losing it would be better than not even trying,” he wrote.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843996,GOP operative who advised Youngkin moves to pro-DeSantis PAC,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A top Republican operative who worked as an adviser on Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's winning campaign has signed on to work for a super PAC urging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to run for president.Jeff Roe will serve as an adviser to Never Back Down, according to a person familiar with the arrangement but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Roe ran Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign and has advised numerous other GOP politicians, including Eric Greitens, who resigned as Missouri governor in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign violations.Roe didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment late Wednesday.The move comes as DeSantis readies for an expected 2024 Republican presidential campaign and works on building up a campaign infrastructure to support a potential bid.It wasn't clear what the departure of a top strategist would mean for Youngkin, who sparked speculation about a possible presidential bid after he captured national attention by defeating Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021. Politico first reported on Roe's new job.Youngkin political aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night on Roe’s move and whether it has any implications for the governor.Youngkin has not publicly ruled out a bid, and some of his steps have added to the chatter, including his travel around the country to boost GOP candidates in last year's midterms. He appeared earlier this month in a prime-time town hall on CNN and recently met with donors in New York.The pro-DeSantis super PAC is headed up by Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general who served in the Department of Homeland Security under former President Donald Trump. Cuccinelli been traveling to early voting states this month, making key connections that ideally would help set up a framework for DeSantis, if he enters the 2024 race.As recently as last week, Roe had been insisting that there was room for Youngkin in a Republican primary that already includes Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. In an interview, Roe called Youngkin “a unicorn in American politics,"" as the first GOP governor elected in Virginia in more than a decade.Those comments, however, came a day after Roe on Fox News had outlined a campaign that was a “two-person race between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis,"" adding, ""There’s simply no room for a third or fourth, or even fifth person in this race.”Roe has previously worked on behalf of a campaign against someone with whom he was previously aligned. In 2022, he advised the Senate effort of then-Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt in a primary victory over 20 Republicans — including Greitens.___Associated Press writers Michelle L.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844001,Sennheiser Group Introduces New Executive Management Board,"The family-owned company starts 2023 with a new management team
 WEDEMARK, GERMANY -  Media OutReach - 23 March 2023 -  Following the realignment of the company with a focus on the professional audio business, the Sennheiser Group is entering 2023 with a newly formed management team. The audio specialist's new Executive Management Board includes representatives from the three business units Pro Audio, Business Communication and Neumann, as well as Supply Chain, Corporate Functions and Development. Together with Co-CEOs Daniel and Andreas Sennheiser, the Board members will implement the strategic goals of the Sennheiser Group.        The new management team of the Sennheiser Group, consisting of Co-CEOs, EMB and extended EMB (from left to right): Steffen Heise, Markus Redelstab, Dr. Andreas Sennheiser, Yasmine Riechers, Dr. Andreas Fischer, Ralf Oehl, Greg Beebe, Ron Holtdijk, Mareike Oer, Daniel Sennheiser      As of January 1, 2023, the operational business of the Sennheiser Group will be managed by a team of six: The new Executive Management Board (EMB) includes Greg Beebe (Executive Vice President Professional Audio), Ron Holtdijk (Executive Vice President Business Communication), Ralf Oehl (CEO Georg Neumann GmbH), Steffen Heise (CFO), Dr. Andreas Fischer (COO) and Markus Redelstab (CTO). Peter Claussen and Thomas Weinzierl, who were previously COOs responsible for Professional Business and Supply Chain, will also remain on the EMB before their respective retirements in the course of the years 2023 and 2024. In the intervening period, they will gradually hand over their operational tasks and extensive knowledge to the new EMB. In the future, Co-CEOs Dr. Andreas and Daniel Sennheiser will primarily focus on corporate management and strategy development and devote more time to customers, while the other EMB members will manage the operational business. Yasmine Riechers and Mareike Oer complete the leadership of the Sennheiser Group as an extended management team, representing the Corporate Development Office and Brand & Corporate Communication.   ""With the integration of the business units into the EMB, our customers are moving even more into focus,"" explains Co-CEO Andreas Sennheiser. ""In the future, their very different needs will be represented at the highest management level and included in all decisions, enabling us to act even closer to the market."" The inclusion of product development into the direct scope of the EMB also reflects the great importance of this area and the associated efforts to align innovations and new technologies even more closely with customer needs. And by dovetailing all central functions with the business units, the different perspectives will be brought together in a new, strong management team.   Team spirit and collaborative leadership   ""With this step, we are adapting our management structure to our new corporate positioning with a focus on the Professional Business,"" explains Co-CEO Daniel Sennheiser. ""At the same time, we are further developing our leadership culture – in line with our corporate culture."" The Co-CEOs have already been leading the family-owned company in a dual leadership as part of a management team since 2013. The new set-up, whose introduction was accompanied by Peter Claussen, is also shaped by this management philosophy: ""We are firmly convinced that rigid hierarchies in corporate management are outdated. Just as we as Co-CEOs share overall responsibility for our family-owned company, we will also shape the path for Sennheiser in the expanded management team,"" said Andreas Sennheiser. ""After all, the most important guarantor of our future success is the people who work together worldwide under the umbrella of the Sennheiser Group. Our shared culture and our passion for what we do unite us. With the new EMB setup, we are also reflecting this ethos in our corporate management.""   A successful business year and further investments   As part of its focus on professional audio business, Sennheiser had announced investments in this area in line with its new corporate strategy, which are now being implemented on a step by step basis. For example, a new PCB assembly line went into operation at the main site in Wedemark near Hanover at the end of 2022. Further investments in development and in the production site in Romania are planned.   Even though the final results will not be available until later in the year, an initial very positive assessment can already be made for 2022: Sennheiser was again able to record significant growth last year. This was even higher than the previous year's growth - despite the difficult global economic climate with inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, rising costs and geopolitical events affecting markets around the world. Co-CEO Daniel Sennheiser sums up: ""We are on the right track with our strategy – these results show that very clearly. And we have clear goals for the future of the Sennheiser Group. We know our strengths and we are consistently expanding them. The newly formed EMB will pursue these goals together. We therefore look to 2023 with a great deal of confidence, and we enter this year with a strong, motivated management team of which we are very proud.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844030,"Jimmy Butler scores 35, Heat hold off Knicks 127-120","MIAMI (AP) — Jimmy Butler stepped back onto the court in his usual time slot, midway through the fourth quarter, with the Miami Heat clinging to a one-point lead.Not even three minutes later, the lead was 12 — and the Heat were on their way to a needed win.Butler finished with 35 points and nine assists, Tyler Herro scored 14 of his 22 in the pivotal final quarter and the Heat moved closer to escaping play-in tournament range by beating the New York Knicks 127-120 on Wednesday night.“Fourth quarter is winning time,” Herro said. “That’s when my scoring is needed most.”Herro made four 3-pointers in the fourth for the Heat, who led by 11 in the third, lost the lead briefly, then took the lead back for good with a 16-2 run midway through the final quarter.Herro and Max Strus each had a pair of 3's during the clinching run for Miami (40-34), which is now just percentage points behind Brooklyn (39-33) in the race for the sixth and final guaranteed playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Nets visit the Heat on Saturday.“Must-win,” Herro said.Gabe Vincent scored 19, Bam Adebayo scored 15, Kyle Lowry had 14 and Strus finished with 11 for Miami — in what became the 700th career win for coach Erik Spoelstra.New York's Julius Randle, coming off a 57-point effort Monday against Minnesota, was held to 15. RJ Barrett scored 26 for the Knicks, who got 25 from Jalen Brunson and 22 from Quentin Grimes.The Knicks cut what was a 12-point deficit with 3:54 left down to five on a 3-pointer by Barrett with 42.2 seconds remaining.Butler made a pair of free throws to push the lead back to seven, Brunson missed two free throws with 22.3 seconds left and that essentially sealed matters for Miami.New York shot 71% in the fourth — but allowed Miami to shoot 67% in that period, and the Heat were 6 for 7 on 3's in the final quarter.“They played really well,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought it was a hard-fought game, but our defense obviously wasn’t good enough.""TIP-INSKnicks: New York played the front end of its 12th and final back-to-back of the season. ... The Knicks have trailed by double digits in four consecutive games, tying their second-longest such streak of the season. New York faced deficits of at least 10 points in five straight games from Oct. 28 through Nov. 5.Heat: Cody Zeller (broken nose) missed his fifth consecutive game. ... Butler played in his 59th game of the season. That’s the most he has logged in any of his four Heat seasons; he played in 58 of a possible 73 in the pandemic-altered 2019-20 season.REMEMBERING WILLISThe Heat had a pregame tribute and moment of silence dedicated to the life of Knicks legend Willis Reed, who died Tuesday.“Obviously, we all know what he meant and continues to mean and will always mean to our organization, the city and the NBA,” said Thibodeau, adding “he embodied everything you want a Knick to be.”Thibodeau devoted the entirety of his pregame availability to telling stories about Reed and detailing his interactions with him.During the Knicks broadcast on MSG Networks, analyst and fellow Knicks legend Walt “Clyde” Frazier also raved about Reed — his friend and former teammate. “He made me the player who I am and the man that I am off the court as well,” Frazier said.SPO WATCHSpoelstra is the fourth coach in NBA history to win at least 700 games with one team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844031,Arizona court declines most of Lake's appeal over gov's race,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Supreme Court has declined to hear most of Republican Kari Lake’s appeal in a challenge of her defeat in the governor’s race but revived a claim that was dismissed by a trial court.In an order Wednesday, the state’s highest court said a lower court erroneously dismissed Lake’s claim challenging the application of signature verification procedures on early ballots in Maricopa County. The court sent the claim back to a trial court to consider.Lake said late Wednesday that she's thrilled with the ruling.“The signature verification process in Maricopa County is a house of cards,” Lake said in a statement. “Thanks to this ruling my team will get the chance to topple it.” The state Supreme court declined to review six of the seven legal issues presented by the former TV news anchor’s lawyers, including a claim that centered on Lake’s allegation that over 35,000 unaccounted-for ballots were added at a processing facility run by a company. The lower court will now examine whether Lake's signature verification claim was properly dismissed or whether she can prove her claim and show that enough votes were affected that it altered the outcome of the election.Barrett Marson, a Republican political consultant in Phoenix aligned with the party’s establishment wing, said some human-caused errors might be uncovered in the signature verification process, but he doubted that would be enough to undo the outcome of the race. “Systematic? No,"" Marson said. “Widespread? No. Election overturning? No.” Nicole DeMont, who served as Hobbs' campaign manager, declined to comment on the decision.Lake, who lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes, was among the most vocal 2022 Republican candidates promoting former President Donald Trump’s election lies, which she made the centerpiece of her campaign. While most other election deniers around the country conceded after losing their races in November, Lake did not.In her challenge, the former TV anchor focused on problems with ballot printers at some polling places in Maricopa County, home to more than 60% of the state’s voters.The defective printers produced ballots that were too light to be read by the on-site tabulators at polling places. Lines backed up in some areas amid the confusion. Lake alleged the ballot printer problems were the result of intentional misconduct.County officials say everyone had a chance to vote, and all ballots were counted because those affected by the printers were taken to more sophisticated counters at election headquarters.In mid-February, the Arizona Court of Appeals rejected Lake’s assertions, concluding she presented no evidence that voters whose ballots were unreadable by tabulators at polling places were not able to vote.The appeals court noted that even a witness called to testify on Lake’s behalf confirmed ballots that couldn’t initially be read at polling places may ultimately have been counted. While a pollster testified that the polling place problems disenfranchised enough voters to change the election’s outcome, the appeals court said his conclusion was baseless.Lake’s attorneys also said the chain of custody for ballots was broken at an off-site facility where a contractor scans mail-in ballots to prepare them for processing. The lawyers asserted that workers put their own mail-in ballots into the pile rather than returning them through normal channels, and that paperwork documenting ballot transfers was missing. The county disputes the claims.Hobbs’ attorneys have said Lake was trying to sow distrust in Arizona’s election results and offered no proof to back up her allegations.Lake faced extremely long odds in her challenge, which required proving misconduct specifically intended to deny her victory and that it resulted in the wrong woman being declared the winner.Hobbs took office as governor on Jan. 2.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844032,Antetokounmpo's big night helps Bucks trounce Spurs 130-94,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 14 rebounds in just 24 minutes as the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks rolled to a 130-94 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night.The Bucks extended their Eastern Conference advantage to 2½ games over the Boston Celtics as they prepare for a four-game road swing that includes a matchup Saturday with the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets.“I've never in my career believed in seeding, but we're No. 1 right now, we should just take it,” Antetokounmpo said. “We should just keep on building good habits, take it and maybe it helps us in a playoff run.”Antetokounmpo rested the entire fourth quarter and watched the Bucks put the finishing touches on their most lopsided win of the season.“They've got their culture down,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “They're confident. They know they can do it if they play the right way, which they do most of the time. Tonight was a good example. I'd love to be able to play them every night. It would be great for our young kids to see how it gets done and how mistakes are made and what's important.”Bobby Portis and Khris Middleton added 19 points each for the Bucks, who never trailed. Middleton also had 10 assists, while Portis had 10 rebounds.Devin Vassell scored 16 points to lead the Spurs.San Antonio was playing for a second straight night and was missing leading scorer Keldon Johnson for a second consecutive game due to a neck strain. The Spurs also didn’t have usual starter Tre Jones, who was out with a sore left foot after playing Tuesday in a 119-84 loss at New Orleans.After trailing by 13 in the first quarter, San Antonio got within two points a couple of times in the second period. But after Keita Bates-Diop’s three-point play cut Milwaukee’s lead to 51-49 with 2:41 left in the second, the Bucks outscored the Spurs 15-2 to close the first half.That spurt included consecutive dunks by Antetokounmpo, the first coming on a putback and the second on an alley-oop from Middleton. Milwaukee capped the run with 3-pointers from Pat Connaughton and Joe Ingles, who beat the buzzer with his shot from the corner in front of the Bucks’ bench.The Bucks then poured it on in the second half.“They’ve got young guys who play hard, so we knew obviously coming into it they were going to do that — play hard, play the right way,” said Ingles, who scored 14 points and shot 4 of 6 from 3-point range. “We had some turnovers early. I think in the third and fourth, we started to get some more stops, made some more shots and obviously were able to push that lead out a little bit.”TIP-INSSpurs: Sandro Mamukelashvili got a warm reception from the Fiserv Forum crowd as he faced Milwaukee for the first time since the Bucks waived him March 1. Mamukelashvili had 12 points and seven rebounds. “He's European, which makes me love him right off the bat because I think those guys are unbelievably well-coached and overall understand the game better than most of us here,” Popovich said before the game. “He moves without the ball. He shoots it pretty well. He can pass. He's got good speed. I like everything about him.” ... The Spurs shot just 9 of 39 from 3-point range.Bucks: Jae Crowder missed a third straight game with a sore left calf. “He's making good progress,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game. “Hopefully he continues in a positive direction. When he's ready, they'll let us know, but I think it's relatively short and in the near future.” ...

It was the first time since the NBA began tracking starters in 1970-71 that three Canadians started for the same team.“For it to happen in Toronto, it’s pretty cool,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “All three of those guys played well. Nembhard had a great game. Mathurin was terrific. I thought Brissett did what he does. He gave us energy, rebounded, he scored the first five points of the game. That was great.”Pascal Siakam scored 18 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter but the Raptors lost their second straight. Siakam also had 10 rebounds and seven assists.Fred VanVleet had 28 points and 11 assists for Toronto, and Jakob Poeltl scored 23.Poeltl missed two free throws with 1:24 left when Toronto could have cut the deficit to two.

Toronto was also without forward Precious Achiuwa (right hamstring) and guard Gary Trent Jr. (right elbow).Toronto lost at home for the first time since Feb. 10 against Utah, when the Jazz overcame a 12-point deficit in the final five minutes to beat the Raptors 122-116.“Didn’t feel super organized at either end at the start or for a while,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “I thought that we let a lot of chances go.”The Raptors shot 7 for 34 from 3-point range. Chris Boucher’s buzzer-beating shot helped Toronto avoid matching a season low for makes and setting a new low for shooting percentage from beyond the arc.Nembhard scored 14 points in the first, the most he's ever had in a single quarter, as the Pacers led 36-26 after one.“Nembhard obviously at the start was big,” Nurse said.Indiana led 58-52 at halftime and took an 83-78 lead into the fourth.TIP-INSPacers: T.J.

(AP) — Former U.S. Open champions Emma Raducanu and Sloane Stephens were knocked out of the Miami Open on Wednesday, hours after No. 1-ranked and defending champion Iga Swiatek pulled out of the tournament because of a rib injury.Bianca Andreescu — the 2019 U.S. Open champ — defeated Raducanu 6-3, 3-6, 6-2. Andreescu improved to 2-0 lifetime against Raducanu, the 2021 winner at Flushing Meadows.“Miami has a special place in my heart,” Andreescu said. “I’ve been coming here since I was I think 12 years old, whether it’s for vacation or training or, yeah, Orange Bowl. I love that tournament very much. Yeah, coming back here, I think it’s just good vibes overall.”Andreescu moves on to face 10th-ranked Maria Sakkari, who had a first-round bye.Shelby Rogers beat Stephens 6-4, 3-6, 6-2. Stephens has six hard-court titles, including the U.S. Open in 2017 and Miami in 2018.Rogers will face Australian Open champion and world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Rogers in the second round at Melbourne Park.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844035,"Curry, Warriors get crucial 127-125 win over Doncic, Mavs","DALLAS (AP) — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors have consecutive road wins for the first time since the NBA Finals, and a big advantage in the playoff race over the team they beat to get there last June.Curry scored 20 points and assisted on Draymond Green's tiebreaking three-point play late, and the Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks 127-125 on Wednesday night.Luka Doncic had 30 points after missing five games with a left thigh strain, but the Mavericks dropped below .500 as they try to stay out of the Western Conference play-in tournament a year after losing to the Warriors in the West finals.The Mavericks were without All-Star guard Kyrie Irving because of right foot soreness and fell 1 1/2 games behind the Warriors, who clinched the tiebreaker by winning the season series 2-1.Dallas owner Mark Cuban said after the game he intended to protest over an uncontested dunk for Golden State's Kevon Looney when there was confusion over which team had possession of the ball coming out of a timeout late in the third quarter.Jonathan Kuminga scored 22 points on 9-of-11 shooting off the bench for Golden State, including a soaring, one-handed dunk during a fourth quarter with an intensity that matched the stakes.Two nights after ending an 11-game road losing streak with a victory in Houston, the Warriors made it two in a row to finish a five-game trip as they battle Dallas and a host of other teams in the bottom half of the West playoff race.Golden State (38-36) holds the final guaranteed playoff spot at sixth in the West. Dallas (36-37) dropped to ninth — the third of four play-in spots.“Oh, we’re hot now,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, smiling to signal his sarcasm. “We’re road warriors.”“We knew we had to win these last two games,” he added. “That’s how we felt, given that everybody is just jockeying for position and we’ve got some tough games coming up.”Irving’s absence meant he and Doncic have played together in just half of the 18 games since Irving’s debut after the blockbuster trade that brought him from Brooklyn.Now the Mavericks are at risk of missing the playoffs altogether if they can't stay in the top 10 in the West.“The mood is not good, obviously,” said Doncic, who had 17 assists. “Every time you lose, it’s bad. We’ve got to focus what’s next. We’ve got to be focused on winning.”Golden State went in front for good when Curry had one of his 13 assists on a layup and foul for Green, who made the free throw for a 123-120 lead with 1:32 remaining.Doncic had to attempt a desperation 3-pointer with the shot clock winding down at the other end.Curry then dribbled out most of the clock before hitting a layup for a three-point lead with 8.5 seconds left, and Doncic missed a layup at the other end after a timeout.The Mavericks were also without guard Tim Hardaway Jr., who has sometimes started in Irving's absence, because of a non-COVID-19 illness. Rookie guard Jaden Hardy scored 27 points for Dallas.Jordan Poole scored 16 points, Donte DiVincenzo and Green had 14 apiece and Looney added 12 points and 12 rebounds.Christian Wood scored 19 points for Dallas.INBOUND CONFUSIONLooney got the uncontested dunk coming out of a timeout when the Mavericks thought they had possession and were lined up on their offensive end.Before the timeout, an official signaled the ball belonged to Golden State before pointing to the Dallas bench to indicate a timeout. The Mavs thought they had been awarded possession.Dallas coach Jason Kidd's contention was that official Michael Smith must have thought Dallas had possession because he was on the same end of the floor as the Mavs.“There was quite a few people out of position,” Kidd said. “It's correctable, but you first have to admit there was a mistake.”TIP-INSWarriors: Klay Thompson showed up at the arena with the No. 89 Dallas Cowboys jersey of the late Gavin Escobar, a tight end who died in a rock climbing accident in California last year. Both were from Rancho Santa Margarita, California. Escobar was a second-round pick by the Cowboys in 2013 and spent his first four seasons with them. ...

Embiid had 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists before sitting out for the second half.Asked how concerned he was about Embiid's calf injury, coach Doc Rivers responded: “Not much, not at all really.”“I think he'll be ready for the next game,” he continued. “It's just precaution.”The 29-year-old Embiid said he first felt the calf tightness during Monday night’s double-overtime loss to the Bulls. Then he felt it again in the first half Wednesday in Chicago.The 7-foot center, one of the front-runners for league MVP, didn't sound too concerned.“Like I always say, it’s all about the playoffs, trying to make sure we get there healthy,” he said. “We’re just going to see how it goes the next few days.”The Sixers (49-23) pulled within a half-game of idle Boston for second in the Eastern Conference behind Milwaukee (52-20).Philadelphia had won eight in a row before Monday night's loss to Chicago. But the 76ers jumped all over the Bulls in the rematch, opening a four-game road trip with an efficient offensive performance.Playing without Harden because of left Achilles tendon soreness, the Sixers started the game with a 23-1 run. They shot 48% from the field on the night and had five players score in double figures.“We just made simple plays,” Rivers said. “We passed to the open guy.”Bulls star DeMar DeRozan departed in the third quarter with a right quad strain. DeRozan, who scored 25 points in the prior game, had a season-low four points on 0-for-7 shooting.“I think he's feeling OK. It's just something that kind of comes and goes,” Bulls center Nikola Vucevic said. “He didn't want to force it too much.”Coby White scored 19 points for Chicago, and Zach LaVine had 16.The Bulls (34-38) had won five of six in one of their best stretches in a largely disappointing season. They remain in 10th in the East, holding onto the last spot for the conference's play-in tournament.“We didn’t make shots early on, and before you know it, it’s 23-1,” LaVine said. “Against a team like that, against that deficit, it’s going to be tough to crawl back out.”After the shaky start, Chicago closed within 36-26 on White's 3-pointer early in the second quarter. But Philadelphia pulled away again before halftime.Maxey, Harris and Melton each hit a 3 to help the Sixers to a 76-48 lead at the break. Philadelphia shot 62% (26 for 42) from the field in the first half, including 12 for 22 from 3-point range.“I thought we made the right plays,” Embiid said. “Guys made shots, and it's fun playing that way, when the ball moves and finds the right guys, and guys step up and then make shots.”TIP-INSSixers: F Jalen McDaniels was ruled out because of right hip soreness. ... F P.J. Tucker got the start after he was listed as questionable with left ankle soreness. He finished with five points and three rebounds.Bulls: G Alex Caruso (left mid-foot soreness) was expected to play, but he rested after he experienced some discomfort in warmups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844037,Court: Arizona governor not required to carry out execution,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that state law doesn’t require Gov. Katie Hobbs to carry out the April 6 execution of a prisoner who was convicted of murder.The decision issued Wednesday marks a legal victory for the newly elected Democratic governor whose office said the state isn’t currently prepared to carry out the death penalty. The high court had set the April execution date for Aaron Gunches, who fatally shot Ted Price near Mesa, Arizona, in 2002.The order came after Hobbs said executions will not be carried out until Arizonans can be confident that the state isn’t violating constitutional rights when it enforces the death penalty.The governor vowed two weeks ago that she wouldn’t carry out the court’s order while the state reviews death penalty protocols that she ordered because of Arizona's history of mismanaging executions.Gunches took part in a brief hearing Thursday before Arizona's clemency board, which can recommend to the governor that prisoners’ sentences be lessened and that they be given reprieves of execution. He voluntarily gave up his right to ask for clemency.The five-minute meeting was held to double-check that Gunches had waived his chance at relief. “Yes, ma’am,” Gunches said through a video conferencing link, confirming his decision to Mina Mendez, who chairs the board.Lawyers for Hobbs said the corrections department lacks staff with proper expertise and does not have a current contract for a pharmacist to compound the pentobarbital needed for an execution. They also said corrections officials are unable to find out the identity of the state’s prior compounding pharmacist, who primarily had contact with an official no longer with the department.A top corrections leadership position critical to planning executions remains unfilled.Corrections Director Ryan Thornell has said he was unable to find enough documentation to understand key elements of the execution process and instead has had to piece it together through conversations with employees on what might have occurred in past executions.Hobbs maintained that while the court authorized Gunches’ execution, its order doesn’t require the state to carry it out.In a statement Thursday, Hobbs said the ruling will allow corrections officials ""to ensure any execution conducted under this administration will be done lawfully and humanely.”Karen Price, whose brother was the victim in Gunches’ case, had asked the court to order Hobbs to carry out the execution. Colleen Clase, an attorney for Karen Price, declined to comment on the decision.Gunches pleaded guilty to murdering Ted Price, who was his girlfriend's ex-husband.Arizona, which currently has 110 prisoners on death row, carried out three executions last year after a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining execution drugs.Since then, the state has been criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner’s body and for denying the Arizona Republic permission to witness the three executions.Gunches, who is not a lawyer, represented himself in November when he asked the Supreme Court to issue his execution warrant so that, he said, justice could be served and the victim's families could get closure. In Republican Mark Brnovich’s last month as state attorney general, his office asked the court for a warrant to execute Gunches.But Gunches then withdrew his request in early January, and newly elected Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes later asked for the warrant to be withdrawn.The state Supreme Court rejected Mayes’ request, saying that it must grant an execution warrant if certain appellate proceedings have concluded and that those requirements were met in Gunches’ case.In another reversal, Gunches said in a filing that he still wants to be executed and asked to be transferred to Texas, where, he wrote, “the law is still followed and inmates can still get their sentences carried out.” Arizona’s high court denied the transfer.",2023/03/24,,World

He's simply locked in on helping the Pittsburgh Penguins make a 17th straight postseason appearance.Jeff Carter had a pair of goals, Crosby scored on a nifty backhand shot in the second period to reach the 30-goal mark for an 11th season and the Penguins beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-2 on Wednesday night.Crosby moved into a tie with Hall-of-Fame center Mario Lemieux for the most 30-goal seasons in Penguins history. Another milestone reached — it came as news to him.“I think the most important thing for me is just try to be consistent and if that reflects that great,” said Crosby, who turns 36 in August.Even more, Crosby’s the first player in league history to post a 30-goal campaign at 18 years old and again when he was 35-plus, according to NHL Stats.“It means I’ve been in the league for a while,” Crosby cracked. “That’s been the thing that’s driven me since since I got into the league — in your first year, you want to prove that you belong. Even at 35, I still think you want to prove you belong, because it is a younger league.”Jake Guentzel also scored and Bryan Rust added an empty-net goal for the Penguins, who snapped a four-game slide and moved back into a wild-card spot in the East.“It’s definitely a big one for us, for sure,” Guentzel said. “Defending champs, coming to their building, you know how good they are. Top to bottom, we defended hard and that’s what we have to do at this time of the year.”Pittsburgh goaltender Tristan Jarry stopped 28 shots in improving to 11-4 this season against teams from the Western Conference.J.T. Compher and Devon Toews had goals for the Avalanche, whose six-game winning streak was halted. Nathan MacKinnon had an assist to extend his home points streak to 18 games.It was a missed opportunity for Colorado, which could've pulled into a three-way tie with Dallas and Minnesota in the Central Division with a victory.“We knew they were going to play with urgency,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “But I didn’t feel like there was any reason why we couldn’t, either. ... We didn’t get it done. Hopefully we get another one.""Alexandar Georgiev made 40 saves, including several critical ones in a second period controlled by the Penguins, who outshot the Avalanche by a 21-9 margin. It could've been more than a 3-1 deficit heading into the third period.Toews' power-play goal made it 3-2 with 9:32 remaining. But Carter wrapped up the win with his first multigoal game in the regular season since Jan. 11, 2022.“I’m thrilled for him. We’re all thrilled,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said of Carter. “He cares about the Penguins. He wants to win, and he wants to contribute in helping us win so we couldn’t be happier for him.”BEDNAR’S DEALBednar was appreciative of the three-year extension he signed Tuesday that goes through the 2026-27 season. In his seventh season, he’s the third-longest tenured coach in the NHL behind Tampa Bay’s Jon Cooper (March 2013) and Sullivan (December 2015).“It’s not a forgiving league or sport, for the most part, but obviously that’s part of the reason why I’m so grateful and thankful,” Bednar said. “Because there were times over my tenure that got a little hairy and management could have made another decision. But obviously they didn’t.”AROUND THE RINKAvalanche D Cale Makar missed a second straight game with a lower body injury. “I still have him as day-to-day,"" Bednar said. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844040,Thai police bust call scammers who preyed on older Americans,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police said Wednesday they busted an international gang that operated call centers to deceive older Americans into wiring them money, netting more than 3 billion baht ($87 million).Police said they arrested 21 suspects Tuesday after raiding nine locations in four Thai provinces, seizing 162 bank accounts, 61 mobile phones, two cars, one gun, and multiple real estate properties. Another Thai suspect was arrested Wednesday. U.S. agents took part in the raids.The suspects, including five Indian nationals and 15 Thais, have been charged with involvement in transnational crime, fraud by impersonating others, fraud of the people, inputting false information into computer systems that causes damage to others, money laundering and conspiring to launder money.The scammers claimed to be law enforcement agents investigating money laundering and told victims their funds were suspicious so needed to be transferred to them to be verified, police said. In addition to that fairly common ruse, the suspects also hacked some victims’ computers, they said.The mostly elderly victims included doctors, professors, dentists, army personnel, and businesspeople, police said.Investigators went undercover to track the gang’s money and found it had been laundered through gold shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues in Chonburi province, 125 kilometers (78 miles) southeast of Bangkok. The area has long had a reputation for harboring members of foreign criminal gangs.Police said the syndicate was led by Indians with assets hidden in Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Peru and Poland.FBI and U.S. Secret Service agents alerted Thai police to the gang's activities after similar crimes were found to have caused over $3 billion in losses in some 72,000 cases in 2020-2021, police said.",2023/03/23,,World

At 9:10 a.m. on Tuesday (March 23), Taiwan High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court upheld the sentence, but the ruling can still be appealed.The court said Liang denied he intentionally murdered the victim and did not show any signs of remorse. After conducting two appraisals, it was determined the defendant was at ""high risk"" of recidivism, presented a defensive attitude, did not acknowledge his mistakes, and showed no empathy for the victim.The court added it is ""difficult to have a reasonable expectation of rectification and education, reducing the likelihood of social reintegration.""The court deemed Liang's actions to be the ""most serious crime."" After considering the circumstances of Article 57 of the Criminal Law and the sentencing appraisal reports, the defendant was sentenced to death in accordance with the law to match the crime and level of responsibility and the deprivation of civic rights.At 8 p.m. on Oct. 28, 2019, a 24-year-old Malaysian surnamed Chung (鍾) was walking to her dormitory from Chang Jung Christian University (CJCU) campus near Changda Road close to the viaduct of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Shalun Line. She disappeared after walking north along the underpass beneath the viaduct.Liang later confessed to using a rope to strangle Chung and drag her to his car. After murdering the student, Liang abandoned her body in a mountainous area of Kaohsiung City's Alian District.Chung's parents enlisted Taiwan Bar Association President Lin Jui-cheng (林瑞成) to take legal action against CJCU, the Taiwanese government, and the Tainan City Council for failing to take action that could have prevented the death of their daughter. On Dec. 25, 2020, the Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office in Kaohsiung announced that Liang had been indicted for murder.",2023/03/23,3705,Society

One batch was found to contain inorganic arsenic doubling the allowed levels and the other five times above the safety standards, the FDA said in notices on Tuesday (March 21).They were either returned or destroyed, said the FDA. The amount of the carcinogen permitted in foods is 0.5 mg/kg, pursuant to the Sanitation Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food (食品中污染物質及毒素衛生標準).This is the first time the metalloid was detected in Vietnamese oyster imports in two years. Previously, the seafood from the Southeast Asian country had been found to be laced with high levels of cadmium and norovirus, Agriharvest quoted Chen Ching-yu (陳慶裕), an FDA official, as saying.Chiang Chih-kang (姜至剛), a professor and toxicology expert at the National Taiwan University College of Medicine, said the toxins are likely the result of poor farming environments for oysters. Accumulated arsenic can harm blood cell production and the immune system, he cautioned.According to the World Health Organization, long-term exposure to arsenic from food or drinking water can cause skin lesions, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Arsenic is present at high levels in the groundwater of countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan, the U.S., Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.",2023/03/23,1396,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844056,Healthy Seas joins hands with Ghost Diving Hong Kong to remove gill nets in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 23 March 2023 - In conjunction with World Water Day, Healthy Seas is proud to announce it has expanded its geographic focus and launches activities to Hong Kong.   Healthy Seas is an environmental nonprofit organization founded in 2013 that began its marine conservation work in the Netherlands. Today, the organisation operates in 20 countries throughout the world, including many countries in Europe, the United States, New Zealand and through its recent collaboration with Ghost Diving Korea and now  Ghost Diving Hong Kong, has expanded to Asia, with regular activities in the Sai Kung Area - Port Shelter, Nine Pins Island Group, East Dam with regular ghost net cleanup projects.   Ghost net removal    On March 18th, the  Ghost Diving Hong Kong volunteer team kicked off its collaboration with Healthy Seas and with support from  DWS Group, successfully recovered about 120kgs of gill nets in the area of Sharp Island, Hap Mun Bay, Sai Kung. Although gill nets are typically very light, they are also the deadliest type of marine litter to marine animals.   Recently, the volunteers had recovered another 150 meters of net from the same location, while a third dive will be necessary and planned in the upcoming period to remove the nets that are still left underwater and continuing to threaten marine life.   ""We are extremely proud to be working with Healthy Seas and the Ghost Diving Foundation in order to remove these nets and through our work we hope to spread the message and educate the Hong Kong community to the important role we all share to remove marine pollution, not just ghost gear but debris of all forms,"" says Andrew Couch, Coordinator of Ghost Diving Hong Kong    The ghost fishing problem    It is estimated that 640,000 tons of fishing gear are lost or abandoned in the seas and oceans each year. It is plastic waste that does not biodegrade, remaining hundreds of years in the environment, all the while losing tiny particles called microplastics that end up in the food chain. The phenomenon takes the name ""ghost fishing"" because the nets that are made to appear invisible underwater are trapping and killing all manner of marine animals including turtles, fish, mammals and birds that get entangled, suffer and eventually die.   Fishing practices & trawling ban in Hong Kong   Capture fishing and aquaculture have a long history in Hong Kong, with the conservation of the environment and the well being of the fishing industry being at the forefront of the Hong Kong government's agenda. Over the past few years, there has been a proactive approach to promote the conservation and preservation of Hong Kong's marine habitat.   Since December 2012, there has been a ban on trawling within Hong Kong coastal waters to try to restore the damaged seabed. Combined with the Fisheries Protection Ordinance which is designed to regulate the size of local fishing vessels, these efforts aim at controlling fishing practices that resulted in the depletion and destruction of Hong Kong's marine biodiversity.   Despite the efforts that have been made to conserve Hong Kong's marine environment, there still remain challenges for the protection of the sea and coastline surrounding Hong Kong. For example, the numerous small speed boats that operate daily and deploy fine gill nets often for hundreds of meters along the sea floor. These are often lost or discarded becoming a major hazard to all marine life as well as the divers who enjoy Hong Kong's waters. Volunteer divers also encounter the remains of nets from the trawlers that were lost or abandoned long ago and caught on submerged rocks and reefs (both natural and artificial) and aim to remove them from the ocean floor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844097,Klinsmann getting to know South Korea's squad and its fans,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — More than six years after leaving his job as head coach of the United States, Jurgen Klinsmann returns to international soccer when South Korea takes on Colombia in a friendly on Friday.The Korea Football Association last month hired Klinsmann on a contract that runs until the end of the 2026 World Cup, to be held in North America. The 58 year-old German coach, who won the World Cup as a player in 1990, has already targeted success at next January’s Asian Cup.The sold-out game with Colombia is South Korea’s first since losing to Brazil in the Round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup last December. The South Koreans will host Uruguay in Seoul four days later — the teams drew 0-0 at the World Cup in Qatar.“These two matches against Colombia and Uruguay are very obviously exciting for us new coaches to get to know the team, to get to know the players, and to understand more and more about football in Korea ... about the fans, media and everyone,” Klinsmann said at a training camp north of Seoul.His main priority, though, is getting to know the players.“So I will hopefully get a lot of time, a lot of time talking to the players,"" he said. ""It’s a big learning curve for me too, but hopefully I’m a great learner.”Klinsmann succeeds Portuguese coach Paulo Bento and has only made one enforced change to the squad that went to the World Cup. He also confirmed that Son Heung-min will continue as captain.Son plays for Tottenham Hotspur, the English Premier League club where Klinsmann had two spells as a striker between 1994 and 1999.“At Tottenham, we still have people who spent time with coach Klinsmann back in his playing days, and he has such a sterling reputation,” Son said. “I have only had brief conversations with him, but I could already tell he was a great man who cares so much about players. Tottenham officials told me we have an exceptional coach for South Korea.”Overall, five of Asia’s six World Cup teams are in action with a run of international friendlies.Japan retained Hajime Moriyasu and he will take the team into a reversal of South Korea’s South American opposition, hosting Uruguay on Friday in Tokyo and then Colombia in Osaka on Tuesday.Australia pushed eventual champion Argentina all the way in their second-round match in Qatar. Coach Graham Arnold has named four uncapped players as the Socceroos start preparations for the Asian Cup with games against Ecuador in Sydney and Melbourne.Of the three Asian teams which failed to progress past the group stage at the World Cup, Saudi Arabia, which still has coach Herve Renard in charge, takes on Venezuela and Bolivia.Iran has replaced Carlos Queiroz with home-grown manager Amir Ghalenoei and hosts Russia in Tehran.Queiroz has gone to Qatar to succeed Felix Sanchez, who lost all three World Cup games on home soil in November. The former Real Madrid coach will, however, have to wait to make his Qatar debut.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844098,Australia sets wording of Indigenous Voice referendum,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The Australian government on Thursday released the wording of a referendum question that promises the nation’s Indigenous population a greater say on policies that affect their lives.Australians are expected to vote sometime between October and December on a constitutional amendment that would enshrine a new body called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. The Voice would be an elected group charged with advocating Indigenous interests, but would not have a vote on laws.An emotional Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the body was needed to overcome Indigenous disadvantage.“We urgently need better outcomes because it’s not good enough where we’re at in 2023,” Albanese told reporters.The Voice was originally proposed by a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advocates in 2017.Megan Davies, an Indigenous lawyer who consulted with grassroots communities over years to develop the Voice proposal, described the decision on the referendum question as a historic day.“When we ran the dialogues all over Australia, our people spoke about not being listened to and not being heard. They spoke about powerlessness and voicelessness,” Davies said.“This prime minister, this government, has listened respectfully, genuinely, authentically,” she added.Indigenous Australians from the Torres Strait archipelago, off the northeast coast, are culturally distinct from the mainland Aboriginal population. The two peoples account for 3.2% of the Australian population, and are the nation’s most disadvantaged ethnic group.“On every measure, there is a gap between the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the national average,” Albanese said.“A 10-year gap in life expectancy, a suicide rate twice as high, tragic levels of child mortality and disease, a massive overrepresentation in the prison population and deaths in custody, in children sent to out-of-home care,” he said.“And this is not because of a shortage of goodwill or good intentions on any side of politics and it’s not because of a lack of funds. It’s because governments have spent decades trying to impose solutions from Canberra rather than consulting with communities,” he added.The wording of the referendum question that the Cabinet signed off on Thursday is similar to words proposed by Albanese last year.The question will be: “A proposed law: To alter the constitution to recognize the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?”If the referendum succeeds, the constitution would state that the “Voice may make representations” to the Parliament and government “on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.”Most details of the Voice's makeup and function would be left to Parliament.Opinion polls suggest most Australians support the Voice concept, which Albanese announced was a major priority of his center-left Labor Party government during his election night victory speech in May last year. But deep divisions remain across Australian society.Opposition leader Peter Dutton said his conservative Liberal Party has yet to decide whether they would support the Voice and required more detail including the government’s own legal advice.Dutton questioned whether the Voice would help Indigenous women and children who suffer far higher rates of domestic violence than the wider community. He suggested the Voice might even drown out the victims’ voices.“Is it going to make it more difficult because there is another layer of bureaucracy and makes it harder for the Indigenous women in these communities to be heard?” Dutton asked.The Nationals party, the junior coalition partner in the former government, announced in November they had decided to oppose the Voice, saying it would divide the nation along racial lines.The government has not said what form it proposes the Voice would take. But Cabinet on Thursday agreed on a set of principles.Its members would be chosen by Indigenous people, and would serve for fixed terms. Members would be chosen from every Australian state and territory as well as the Torres Strait islands and include specific representatives for remote areas.Genders would be equally represented and Indigenous youths would be included.Cabinet specifies that the Voice would not have a veto power, countering arguments that the constitutional change could lead to unpopular laws being challenged in the courts.Changing Australia’s constitution has never been easy. Of the 44 referendums held since 1901, only eight have been carried and none since 1977.Draft laws setting out the question and the proposed constitutional change will go to Parliament next week and are expected to be voted on in June.Even lawmakers who oppose the Voice are unlikely to anger constituents by standing in the way of the referendum going ahead.Australia is unusual among former British colonies in it has never signed a treaty with the nation’s Indigenous population. The constitution came into effect in 1901, and has never acknowledged the Indigenous population as the country’s original inhabitants.Many talk about a Great Australian Silence, a term coined late last century to describe an erasure of Indigenous perspectives and experiences from mainstream Australian history.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844099,"Lillard, Sharpe lead Blazers past Jazz to halt 6-game skid","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Damian Lillard scored 30 points, rookie Shaedon Sharpe had a career-high 24 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Utah Jazz 127-115 on Wednesday night to stop a six-game losing streak.Trendon Watford added a season-best 21 points for the Blazers. Portland used a 9-0 run, sparked by Kevin Knox III’s alley-oop layup midway through the fourth quarter, to pull away.Lillard capped the spurt with a layup to make it 113-100 with 5:51 to play, and the Jazz never got it back under single digits.“What stands out is Shaedon — his game was incredible — and Trendon continues to be consistent,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. “I liked everything from the team tonight.”Lauri Markkanen had 40 points and 12 rebounds while Kris Dunn scored 15 off the bench for Utah, which had won four of five.The Trail Blazers (32-40) won three of four against Utah (35-37) this season but are a long shot to make the play-in tournament as they are still three games behind the Jazz for the No. 10 spot in the Western Conference standings.“We have played well in parts of all these games (we lost), but in this league you can’t have lows like we’ve had,” Lillard said. “Tonight we played a complete game.”The only thing that could stop Markkanen was a sore left hand that got hit on a foul late in the third quarter. The 7-footer from Finland stayed down on the court and flexed and massaged his hand before going to the line to get his 37th point.“The X-ray was good, clean. I don’t know more about it, but we’ll see how it feels tomorrow and go from there,” Markkanen said. “Once you get going, you don’t really think about it. But then obviously at dead balls and stuff it just happens to (hurt) again.”Markkanen had missed a game with a tight back but returned to make 10 of his 11 shots inside the arc. He managed only three points in the final quarter, though, as Portland pulled away.“We really locked up and stopped fouling,” said Sharpe, who had four steals.Jusuf Nurkic scored 20 for the Trail Blazers to mark his first consecutive 20-point games in two months. But the game belonged to the youngsters, Watford and Sharpe, who were thrust into the spotlight with Portland missing starters Jerami Grant (thigh bruise) and Anfernee Simons (sore foot).“I did what the team needed me to do, which is to defend, lock up, score the ball and make plays for others,” said Sharpe, who felt like he could “just hoop” without thinking too much.In surprising wins against Sacramento and Boston, the Jazz employed a trapping 1-3-1 zone with great success. It wasn’t nearly as disruptive against Lillard and the Blazers.“We took advantage of it,” Lillard said. “I got to the pocket and guys made shots, guys cut and finished, got to the free-throw line and I thought that was how we won the game.”When forced to give up the ball, Lillard found easy shots for his teammates and matched a season high with 12 assists. So the Jazz played much more traditional man-to-man defense in the second half but with similar results against the ball-moving Blazers.""We looked a step slow kind of on everything defensively tonight,” Utah coach Will Hardy said.The Jazz have thrived recently by taking care of the ball, but the miscues reappeared against Portland with 17 turnovers.The last time these teams met, Lillard scored 60 points on 21-of-29 shooting with nine 3-pointers in a 134-124 win on Jan. 25. This time, he was happy to share the ball to get another victory.“I knew they wouldn’t be in a drop coverage again. You know, that’s an easy night for me anytime teams play that type of defense. So we just found another way to win,” Lillard said.HIGH FLYINGThe Blazers said the play that really fueled their confidence was a lob from Watford to Sharpe for a thunderous dunk.“He tells me to just put it up anywhere, so anytime I see him running on a break, it is pretty much going to be a matter of time for the oop,” Watford said.Sharpe said those kind of plays make the game fun and easy.“That one tonight might have been my favorite one of the year,” Watford said. ""He makes me look like a really good lob passer.”TIP-INSTrail Blazers: Lillard got a technical foul in the second quarter, his eighth of the season. … Portland had a 62-52 advantage in points in the paint. … Ryan Arcidiacono’s foul on an airborne Markkanen was upgraded to a Flagrant 1 in the fourth quarter.Jazz: Utah fell to 2-1 when Markkanen scores 40 or more points. … Rudy Gay left in the third quarter with lower back spasms. … Jordan Clarkson missed his seventh game with a thumb sprain and Collin Sexton has been out for more than a month with a hamstring injury.UP NEXTTrail Blazers: Start a five-game homestand against Chicago on Friday.Jazz: Host the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844100,All Blacks job puts Robertson's Crusaders role in spotlight,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The ACT Brumbies and Christchurch-based Crusaders will meet Friday in a fifth-round match in Super Rugby Pacific which might attract more attention on the coaches than the players.Crusaders head coach Scott Robertson was announced this week as the next All Blacks head coach, to take from Ian Foster after this year’s World Cup in France. Performances of the Crusaders inevitably will now viewed through that lens.New Zealand Rugby created a precedent — and uncomfortable situation — by appointing a new All Blacks coach while the current coach still has seven months on his contract, including a World Cup.In preparing the team for the world tournament in France, Foster will feel Robertson’s breath on the back of his neck.He faces an unpredictable future as he seeks to become the fourth All Blacks coach to win a World Cup. The other three, Brian Lochore, Graham Henry and Steve Hansen, all were knighted at least partly because of their World Cup success. Foster will receive the order of the boot.Robertson’s was a popular appointment but if the Crusaders have a less than stellar season — they already have lost two out of four and might lose to the Brumbies who are unbeaten — reservations may grow about his appointment.Robertson was chosen as All Blacks coach entirely on the basis of his body of work with the Crusaders: six titles in various Super Rugby competitions. His only other experience is an unsuccessful tenure as coach of the New Zealand Under-20 team.If the Crusaders have form issues, Robertson will have to devote more attention to his Super Rugby responsibilities than the All Blacks. He will soon have to make additions to his All Blacks coaching team and begin preparations to take over as soon as Foster finishes.Robertson says he doesn’t yet know how and when the process of appointing assistants will occur.“I’ve got a few questions myself to be honest,” he said. “We will do that, we will work behind the scenes. But my main focus here is with the Crusaders and this season.”Robertson said the Crusaders administration will support him in his All Black role.""They said ‘we’re right behind you and we’d love you to get the job’. So I just feel like I can be myself and get on with it,” he said. “Like I said I’m back here now, Crusaders coach.”Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham also has issues to face this weekend as his team takes on the defending champions. Larkham has to rotate some players in order to rest Wallabies members of his squad according to Rugby Australia’s policy in a World Cup year.Captain James Slipper, scrumhalf Nic White and backrowers Rob Valetini and Pete Samu all will miss the game while their Wallabies teammates Len Ikitau and Darcy Swain are out with injuries.“We’ve had to rotate in a few areas but we’ve backed our depth and our connection as a squad from the start and every player who gets on the plane knows the responsibility that comes with the jersey,” Larkham said.“We’ve laid a good foundation for the season in the first couple of weeks and we’re excited to get back to New Zealand as a group and take on this challenge against a side we have a lot of respect for.”The only other unbeaten team after four rounds, the Hamilton-based Chiefs, will take on the New South Wales Waratahs at Sydney, also on Friday.The Chiefs have several players returning after taking mandatory rest-breaks last weekend under New Zealand Rugby policy which limits the workload on All Blacks.All Blacks captain Sam Cane, lock Brodie Retallick, scrumhalf Brad Weber and flyhalf Damian McKenzie all will be back in action. McKenzie will play his 100th Super Rugby game.“Our performance last week had moments of brilliance mixed with a lot of poor decision-making and execution,” coach Clayton McMillan said. “We will need to be more clinical if we want to take the points against a dangerous and hurting Waratahs side.”In other fifth-round matches, the Highlanders host the Fijian Drua at Dunedin, New Zealand, Moana Pasifika and the Hurricanes meet at Auckland and the Melbourne Rebels host the Queensland Reds, all on Saturday. The Blues host the Western Force at Auckland to conclude the round on Sunday.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844101,Senate votes to keep 2001 authorization for war on terror,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to continue congressional authorization for the use of military force in the global fight against terror, turning back an effort by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to repeal the 2001 measure.Senators rejected the amendment 86-9 as they are debating a separate repeal of two authorizations of military force in Iraq. There is broad bipartisan support to withdraw that congressional approval granted in 1991 and 2002 for military strikes against Saddam Hussein’s regime.While those two authorizations are rarely used and focused on just one country, Iraq, the 2001 measure gave President George W. Bush broad authority for the invasion of Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism, approving force “against those nations, organizations, or persons” that planned or aided the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.Passed in September 2001, it is still used to this day to justify U.S. military action against terror groups — including al-Qaida and its affiliates, such as ISIS and al-Shabab — that are deemed to be a threat against America.The 2002 measure that launched the invasion of Iraq 20 years ago this week has been used much less frequently, and supporters of repealing it say it is vulnerable to abuse. President Joe Biden has said he supports that repeal.Senators in both parties said they might be open to eventually replacing the 2001 authorization for the war on terror and narrowing its authority, but they argued that it should not be fully repealed. “We have not yet had that substantive discussion,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., ahead of the amendment vote.Paul said that by repealing only the Iraq authorizations, Congress is “missing the point” since Hussein’s regime no longer exists. By leaving the 2001 measure in place, Congress is keeping the authorization that approves “war everywhere, all the time,” he said.The Senate is expected to vote next week to repeal the two Iraq measures. In a test vote this week, 19 Republicans voted with Democrats to move forward on the legislation.It’s unclear whether leaders in the Republican-controlled House will bring the bill up for a vote, even if it passes the Senate. Forty-nine House Republicans supported the legislation repealing the Iraq authorities when then-majority Democrats held a vote two years ago, but current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., opposed it then.McCarthy signaled this week that he is open to supporting the measure, but it’s unclear whether House Republicans will move the Senate bill without any changes. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said he is interested in replacing the two Iraq authorizations instead of just repealing them, a move that is unlikely to have support in the Senate.McCaul met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Wednesday on the authorizations of military force and other issues.“I’m going to be for replacement,” he said coming out of that meeting. “I’ll see what the leadership does.”Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the lead Democratic author of the Senate bill to repeal the Iraq authorizations, said he believes bipartisan support in the House could move votes. Noting McCarthy’s new openness, he said he views the House as “getting better and better every day” on the issue.Kaine and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, the Indiana Republican who is also leading the push, have argued that repeal will help the United States’ strategic partnership with Iraq.“That relationship I think is not lost on some of the members who were now willing to vote for repeal,” Kaine said.___Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita Baldor contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844102,"TikTok CEO grilled by skeptical lawmakers on safety, content","WASHINGTON (AP) — A nearly six-hour grilling of TikTok’s CEO by lawmakers brought the platform’s 150 million U.S. users no closer to an answer as to whether the app will be wiped from their devices.U.S. lawmakers on Thursday pressed Shou Zi Chew over data security and harmful content, responding skeptically during a tense committee hearing to his assurances that the hugely popular video-sharing app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections.In a bipartisan effort to rein in the power of a major social media platform, Republican and Democratic lawmakers hurled questions on a host of topics, including TikTok’s content moderation practices, how the company plans to secure American data from Beijing, and its spying on journalists.Chew spent most of the hearing attempting to push back assertions that TikTok, or its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, are tools of the Chinese government. But he failed to answer uncomfortable questions about human rights abuses committed by China against the Uyghurs, and seemed taken aback by a TikTok video displayed by one lawmaker that advocated for violence against the House committee holding the hearing.The rare public appearance by the 40-year-old Singapore native comes at a crucial time for the company. TikTok has ballooned its American user base to 150 million in a few short years, but its increasing dominance is being threated by a potential nationwide ban in the U.S. and growing fears among officials about protecting user data from China's communist government.There's also symbolism for lawmakers in taking on TikTok, which has been swept up in a wider geopolitical battle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology, as well as heighted tensions due to recent balloon politics and China’s relationship with Russia.“Mr. Chew, you are here because the American people need the truth about the threat TikTok poses to our national and personal security,” Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, said in her opening statement.Chew told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that TikTok prioritizes the safety of its young users and denied it's a national security risk. He reiterated the company’s plan to protect U.S. user data by storing it on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said.Nevertheless, the company has been dogged by claims that its Chinese ownership means user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government or that it could be used to promote narratives favorable to the country's communist leaders.In 2019, the Guardian reported that TikTok was instructing its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square and included images unfavorable to the Chinese government. The platform says it has since changed its moderation practices.Concerns about the platform increased when ByteDance admitted in December that it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists, and people connected to them, last summer while attempting to uncover the source of a leaked report about the company.Aware of its weakness, TikTok has been trying to distance itself from its Chinese origins, saying 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as Carlyle Group.""Ownership is not at the core of addressing these concerns,” Chew said.But for many others, it is. The Biden administration has reportedly demanded TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company to avoid a nationwide ban. China has said it would oppose those attempts. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at a separate committee hearing Thursday that he believes TikTok is a security threat, and “should be ended one way or another.”White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “everyone was watching” Thursday’s TikTok hearing at the White House. But she declined to comment on specific actions the administration could take to address its TikTok concerns.In one of the most dramatic moments of the hearing, Republican Rep. Kat Cammack played a TikTok video showing a shooting gun with a caption that included the House committee, with the exact date before it was formally announced.“You expect us to believe that you are capable of maintaining the data security, privacy and security of 150 million Americans where you can’t even protect the people in this room,” Cammack said.TikTok said the company on Thursday removed the video and banned the account that posted it.Concerns about what kind of content Americans encounter online, or how their data is collected by technology companies, isn't new. Congress has been wanting to curtail the amount of data tech companies collect on consumers through a national privacy law, but those efforts have failed.At a news conference on Wednesday, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat and one of the few allies TikTok seemingly has on the Hill, said lawmakers concerned about protecting users shouldn’t target TikTok, but must instead focus on a national law that would protect user data across all social media platforms. Chew also noted the failure of U.S. social media companies to address the very concerns for which TikTok was being criticized.“American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security,” he said. ""Look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, just one example.”Committee members also showed a host of TikTok videos that encouraged users to harm themselves and commit suicide. Many questioned why the platform’s Chinese counterpart, Douyin, does not carry the same potentially dangerous content as the American product.Chew responded that it depends on the laws of the country where the app is operating. He said the company has about 40,000 moderators that track harmful content and an algorithm that flags material.Wealth management firm Wedbush described the hearing as a “disaster” for TikTok that made a ban more likely if it doesn't separate from its Chinese parent. Emile El Nems, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said a ban would benefit TikTok rivals YouTube, Instagram and Snap, “likely resulting in higher revenue share of the total advertising wallet.”To avoid a ban, TikTok has been trying to sell officials on a $1.5 billion plan, Project Texas, which routes all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle.As of October, all new U.S. user data was being stored inside the country. The company started deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers this month, in a process expected to be completed this year, Chew said.Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw noted that regardless of what the company does to assure lawmakers it will protect U.S. user data, the Chinese government can still have significant influence over its parent company and ask it to turn over data through its national security laws.Congress, the White House, U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states have already banned the use of the app from official devices. Similar bans have been imposed in other countries including Denmark, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand, as well as the European Union.A complete TikTok ban in the U.S. would risk political and popular backlash from its young user base and civil liberties groups.David Kennedy, a former government intelligence officer who runs the cybersecurity company TrustedSec, said he agrees with restricting TikTok access on government-issued phones but that a nationwide ban might be too extreme.“We have Tesla in China, we have Microsoft in China, we have Apple in China. Are they going to start banning us now?"" Kennedy said. “It could escalate very quickly.”___Associated Press reporters Kelvin Chan in London and Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this story.___This story has been corrected to show Oracle is a software giant, not a server giant.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844103,Mavs owner Cuban plans protest over free bucket for Warriors,"DALLAS (AP) — Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he plans to protest a two-point loss to Golden State after a confusing sequence led to an uncontested basket for the Warriors on Wednesday night.Kevon Looney had an easy dunk on an inbounds play with the Mavericks lined up on their offensive end after a timeout late in the third quarter of Golden State's 127-125 victory.The Mavericks thought they had the ball after official Andy Nagy pointed in Golden State's direction for possession but then quickly pointed to the Dallas bench to indicate a timeout.Looney protested when Nagy pointed toward the Dallas bench, but Nagy appeared to explain that he was signaling the timeout. The public address announcer also indicated Dallas was awarded possession.After the break, the Mavericks lined up on their offensive end, giving Looney the easy dunk with no defenders around as the Warriors took a 90-87 lead with 1:56 left in the third.Cuban said he planned to protest after posting on Twitter that he thought the sequence was the “Worst officiating non call mistake possibly in the history of the NBA.”According to NBA rules, a written protest must be filed within 48 hours of the end of the game, and the Warriors would then have five days to respond and submit their own evidence. Commissioner Adam Silver then has another five days to issue a ruling.Protests are rarely upheld in the NBA — or most major professional sports.Dallas coach Jason Kidd’s contention was that official Michael Smith must have thought the Mavericks had possession because he was on the same end of the floor as the Mavs.“There was quite a few people out of position,” Kidd said. “It’s correctable, but you first have to admit there was a mistake.”Crew chief Sean Wright said officials never indicated Dallas had the ball, and Nagy can be seen telling the Mavericks the second signal was for the timeout.“Initially on the floor the original signal was in fact Golden State ball as this can be seen on video,” Wright told a pool reporter. “There is a second signal but that signal is for a mandatory timeout that was due to the Mavs.”Dallas star Luka Doncic subbed out of the game during that timeout, while Looney had come in for Stephen Curry about two minutes earlier. Jordan Poole threw the inbounds pass.“I didn’t know what was going on,” said Looney, who had 12 points and 12 rebounds. “I’m just glad JP passed to me because all of us were open and I needed that to get to my double-double.”Doncic said he thought officials should have huddled to straighten things out when they saw the teams on opposite ends of the court, including Smith among the Mavs.“I was surprised,” Doncic said about Looney's free dunk. “I was like, ‘What is that?’ I’ve never seen that happen in my life.”Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his first reaction was to question whether his team was shooting on the end where they lined up. But that reaction didn't last long.“When they were down at the other end, I had to stop and think, ‘Is this right?’” Kerr said. “I thought it was pretty clear that it was our ball, and that’s why I was drawing up a play out of bounds on the baseline.”___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

Of the eight People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, one Harbin Z-9 anti-submarine warfare helicopter entered the southeast corner of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. No PLA aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line during this time.
In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.
So far this month, Beijing has sent 309 military aircraft and 83 naval vessels around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.










Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844125,US Navy still has upperhand over Chinese fleet: US Chief of Naval Operations,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. Navy still has the advantage over China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) but issues need to be addressed to maintain the upper hand, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said in an interview with 60 Minutes.
The latest episode of 60 Minutes took a closer look at the current state of the U.S. Navy amid China’s military buildup, interviewing high-ranking navy officials and lawmakers.
“Our navy's still in a position to prevail. But that's not blind confidence. We are concerned with the trajectory that China's on, with China's behavior. But we are in a good position right now—if we did ever get into a fight against them,” Gilday said.
However, he acknowledged there are problems the navy must solve to ensure its strength, including the insufficient number of shipyards. “Over my career, we've gone from more than 30 shipyards, down to about seven that we rely upon on a day-to-day basis to build ships,” he said.










Gilday also said there is a huge backlog of ship repairs. The navy had cut down the number of “delay days,” the extra days a ship is not operational, from 7,700 to 3,000 over a period of three years, but “we are not satisfied,” he said.
The navy chief said he is most alarmed about the rapid growth of China’s conventional forces as well as its nuclear, cyber, and space capabilities and how they will be used to repel other navies out of the South China Sea. “They want to control where those goods flow and how,” he said.
Gilday pointed out that America’s presence in the region is meant to “reassure allies and partners around the world that those sea lanes do remain open.” “The global economy literally floats on seawater.”
He said the U.S. Navy's primary edge over China is its sailors, which he wants to have serving in conjunction with a modernized fleet consisting of hundreds of unmanned vessels by 2045.
Admiral Samuel Paparo, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, echoed Gilday’s concerns about China’s military buildup, particularly its rocket force. “I'd be a fool to not worry about it,” Paparo said.
China has developed long-range precision guided weapons, including the DF-21 and DF-26, which can strike ships. The rocket force tests their accuracy by targeting replicas of American navy ships in the desert.
Paparo mentioned that China's navy, which currently has 350 ships, is growing at a rapid rate. “We call it the ‘Decade of Concern.’ We've seen a tenfold increase in the size of the PRC Navy,” he said.
One thing to look out for is China’s aircraft carriers, Paparo said. The PLAN now has two operational carriers but it is working toward bigger and more advanced ones, he said.
In terms of preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan, Paparo said it is the Pacific Fleet’s duty to be ready for the possibility. A large number of the navy’s assets would be deployed to the region to help defend Taiwan if Washington decides to take action, he said.
In the case of a Taiwan Strait conflict, the U.S. will work with its allies and partners “to deliver intolerable costs to anybody that would upend the order in violation of the nation's security or in violation of the nation's interests,” he said.
Paparo said the U.S. had always been supportive of China’s rise, and now only wants Beijing to “play by the rules.” “In no way are we seeking to contain China,” he said.
Sixty Minutes also talked to congresspeople Mike Gallagher and Elaine Luria, who were on the House Armed Services Committee in the last Congress.
Gallagher, who heads the new House select committee on China, argued that the U.S. is not taking adequate action to enlarge its navy despite increasing Chinese threats in the Indo-Pacific region. The navy will be reduced to 280 ships by 2027, the same year China is expected to have the capability to seize Taiwan by force, per 60 Minutes.
Luria said she believes the navy “has not received the attention and resources that it needs over two decades.” In her 20-year career in the navy, Luria said each of the six ships she served on “was either built during or a product of the fleet that was built—in the Cold War.”
The navy has requested over a quarter of a trillion dollars, an US$11 billion (NT$333.82 billion) increase from last year, for its budget request for fiscal year 2024, 60 Minutes reported.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. Navy still has the advantage over China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) but issues need to be addressed to maintain the upper hand, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said in an interview with 60 Minutes.The latest episode of 60 Minutes took a closer look at the current state of the U.S. Navy amid China’s military buildup, interviewing high-ranking navy officials and lawmakers.“Our navy's still in a position to prevail.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844126,US State Department reverses restrictions for Asian American diplomats,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. State Department is reversing “assignment restrictions” which disadvantage U.S. diplomats of Asian descent, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday (March 22).In the past, the U.S. State Department prevented employees from working in countries where they have family or financial ties, due to concerns over loyalty or susceptibility to “foreign influence.” Blinken wrote to employees on Wednesday, “I’m pleased to share that after a rigorous review, I have decided that the Department will end its practice as a condition placed on a security clearance.”The long-standing policy, known as “assignment restrictions,” disproportionately impacted Asian Americans. The restrictions stunted the careers of many Asian American diplomats, according to Politico.Taipei-born U.S. Congressman Ted Lieu said the previous restrictions send “the false message that people who look like me are more disloyal.” Lieu said that U.S. diplomatic discrimination and the recent rise in anti-Asian violence convey the same issue: The inability of the U.S. government and some people to distinguish between a “foreign government” and “Americans of Asian descent.”In 2021, over 100 Asian Americans working in national security signed a statement calling out “discrimination, and blatant accusations of disloyalty.” U.S. leaders, wary of China, at times improperly conflate Chinese people with the Chinese government, but prejudice is not limited to Chinese Americans, Politico cited an official as saying.The signatories noted that Asian Americans working in national security were treated “with a broad stroke of suspicion,” “simply because of the way we look.”“This is not to dismiss credible counterintelligence concerns as evidenced through indictments of U.S. citizens — some of whom are White — spying for China,” the letter clarified. However, the signatories argued that Asian Americans are “intrinsic to the fabric of American society,” and Chinese Americans are the U.S.’ “greatest asset” in furthering nuanced understanding and uniquely countering Chinese economic, military, and political aggression.According to the Department of State, around 1,800 employees are currently subject to assignment restrictions. The top four countries to which the restrictions apply are China (196), Russia (184), Taiwan (84), and Israel (70).America is limiting its diplomatic capabilities, according to Lieu. The fundamental issue remains that Asian Americans continue to be seen as foreigners by some Americans, including at the State Department, several diplomats told Politico.Blinken, who has pledged to support diversity, said the recent policy change allows the U.S. to “unlock the full potential of our workforce while upholding the highest standards of security.”",2023/03/23,1114,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844128,China will be able to invade Taiwan by 2027: Blinken,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday (March 22) agreed with the assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will have the ability to invade Taiwan by 2027 and acknowledged there is ""a very significant backlog"" of weapons orders from Taiwan.Blinken testified on the State Department budget before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. Senator Bill Hagerty pointed out that in February, CIA Director William Joseph Burns said China seeks to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027 and asked whether Blinken agreed with the assessment.Blinken agreed with the CIA assessment. Hagerty then said that ""time is not on our side"" as the U.S. has a US$19 billion dollar arms backlog with Taiwan.Hagerty said that is why he voted for the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA) that was included in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act and provides Taiwan up to US$2 billion under the ""Foreign Military Finance"" (FMF) grant and loan assistance program designed to purchase U.S-made weapons and defense equipment between 2023 and 2027.However, Hagerty said that he was ""deeply disappointed"" to find that Biden's proposed budget for this year only includes US$113 million in FMF lines. He said the proposed budget ""assumes a mere US$16 million as a baseline for foreign military financing in the Indo-Pacific.""He then asked Blinken why the remaining funding was excluded from the budget. Blinken responded by saying the US$113 million request is part of the emerging priorities fund but in terms of Taiwan, and that FMF is ""one tool,"" as well as a drawdown authority, ""but we have looked at how we can be most effective in supporting Taiwan in its defense.""Blinken said the State Department has processed over the ""past decade or so"" nearly US$40 billion in military sales to Taiwan. Since 2019, Blinken said that there have been approximately US$21 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan.""I have signed out more cases than any secretary of state in history for Taiwan,"" Blinken said. He then highlighted the fact that Taiwan has boosted its defense budget by 11%.However, Hagerty said the State Department request period for Taiwan weapons acquisitions is far shorter than what has been allocated. He then asked whether the Chinese government had told Blinken or any other diplomats that there is ""some sort of red line"" when it comes to increased military financing for Taiwan.Blinken said this was not the case and if Beijing were to issue such statements, ""that's not something we would take into account."" He said that although he has signed off on more weapons deals than any predecessor, he acknowledged that there is a backlog of weapons orders, ""a very significant backlog.""Blinken said the backlog is the result of ""production challenges."" He said the Biden administration is working with U.S. manufacturers to bolster production capacity.""That is the long pole in the tent, and we need to address it,"" Blinken said.Hegarty closed by saying the U.S. missed an opportunity to use deterrence to prevent Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said that TERA has been put in place with the aim of creating deterrence to discourage China from invading Taiwan, and he said he looks forward to working with Blinken on implementing the legislation.",2023/03/23,2241,Politics

According to official statistics, 90% of Saudi citizens are Sunni Muslims, while the remaining 10% are Shia. With Shariah-compliant financial products becoming more widely available, more and more Muslims are choosing to shift away from conventional banking systems and opt for Shariah-compliant alternatives. The Islamic finance market in Saudi Arabia is expected to continue to grow as the demand for Shariah-compliant products and services continues to increase.Additionally, the Saudi Arabian government has been actively promoting the growth of Islamic finance in the country. One such initiative is the Sukuks debt issuance program, which has significantly contributed to the growth of the Saudi Arabia Islamic finance market. The program allows the government to issue bonds that conform to Shariah law, thereby providing investors with an ethical and religiously compliant investment option. This program has been very successful, and its popularity is expected to increase as more investors become aware of its benefits.In conclusion, the Saudi Arabia Islamic finance market is experiencing rapid growth due to the country’s dominant Muslim population’s preference for Shariah-compliant financial products and favorable government initiatives such as the Sukuks debt issuance program.

The report was prepared by subject matter experts, researchers, and market research professionals to ensure that the information is compiled from authentic sources and the forecast is highly accurate. The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth. The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the Absorbable Heart Stent industry.Global absorbable heart stent market is expected to reach $671.3 million by 2030, up from $285.58 million in 2021 at a CAGR of 2022?2030.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS337The demand for absorbable heart stents is growing rapidly as more and more patients are looking for a less invasive way to treat their heart conditions. Absorbable stents are made of a biodegradable material that dissolves over time, leaving behind healthy tissue. This type of stent is becoming increasingly popular because it eliminates the need for repeat procedures and reduces the risk of complications. There are a number of factors driving the growth of the absorbable stent market. Firstly, the aging population is increasingly at risk of developing heart disease, and they are also more likely to seek out less invasive treatment options. Secondly, advances in technology have made it possible to manufacture absorbable stents with greater precision, resulting in better clinical outcomes. Finally, an increasing number of insurance companies are covering the cost of absorbable stents, making them more accessible to patients.Market Dynamics Drivers? There are several key factors that are driving demand for absorbable heart stents. One of the most important is the fact that they are much less likely to cause a second procedure, which is often required with traditional stents. Additionally, patients who receive absorbable stents also experience reduced rates of re-stenosis (narrowing of the arteries). This is because the stent degrades over time, leaving behind healthy tissue.
? Another key factor driving demand for absorbable heart stents is the fact that they are associated with a lower risk of blood clots. This is because there is no metal exposed to blood flow once the stent has degraded. Additionally, patients who receive an absorbable stent typically have a shorter hospital stay and faster recovery time.
? There are many other factors that contribute to the growing demand for absorbable heart stents, including their potential to reduce atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and improve patient outcomes. As more research is conducted on these devices, it is likely that even more benefits will be discovered. For now, these key factors make absorbable heart stents an attractive option for many patients undergoing cardiac procedures.Restraints
High Cost and Lack of Long-Term DataThe main factor hampering demand for absorbable heart stents is their high cost. In addition, the lack of long-term data on their efficacy and safety is another key concern among physicians. While there are some ongoing clinical trials evaluating the long-term effects of these devices, the results are not yet available. Another issue is that some patients may not be suitable candidates for this technology due to their individual anatomy or other factors. Finally, there is some concern that absorbable stents may not provide as durable support as non-absorbable stents and may therefore be associated with an increased risk of re-stenosis or restenosis. This potential complication could further limit their utility in the eyes of many interventional cardiologists.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS337Regional AnalysisAsia Pacific is expected to be the largest market with market share of more than 35%. The region generated a revenue of $111.82 million in 2021 due to the availability of advanced technology and favorable reimbursement policies. Europe and North America is also expected to see strong growth as patient awareness about absorbable stents increases.As the Asia Pacific region continues to experience rapid economic growth, the demand for medical devices and treatments is also on the rise.

Recent advancements in the field of medical device engineering have led to the development of absorbable heart stents made from biodegradable polymers. These devices are designed to be permanently implanted in the body and slowly degrade over time, resulting in minimal long-term side effects. Polymers are the most preferred material for absorbable heart stents manufacturing due to their excellent biocompatibility, low thrombogenicity and good mechanical properties. Polymers can be easily processed into different shapes and sizes, which makes them ideal for manufacturing absorbable heart stents. In addition, polymers are also relatively inexpensive when compared to other materials such as metals.By ApplicationBy application, coronary artery disease segment is holding highest share of the absorbable heart stent market. It is expected to generate revenue of around $530 million by 2030.
The rising incidence of CAD is resulting in high demand for absorbable heart stents for both treatment and preventive purposes. In addition, the growing preference for minimally invasive procedures is fueling market growth. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately one in every four deaths in the US is caused by CAD. The prevalence of CAD is highest in adults aged 65 years and older, and the risk of developing CAD increases with age. CAD is also more common in men than in women.
Absorbable heart stents are devices that are implanted in the coronary arteries to open them up and improve blood flow to the heart. They are made from materials that slowly dissolve over time, so they do not need to be removed.By End UsersBy end users, hospitals and clinics segment is leading the global absorbable heart stent market and is also growing at a CAGR of 12.25%.
Hospitals and clinics around the world are starting to use absorbable heart stents in an effort to provide better care for patients with heart conditions. These stents are made of a material that slowly dissolves over time, which eliminates the need for surgery to remove the device. This is a significant advancement in the treatment of heart disease, and it is hoped that absorbable stents will improve the quality of life for many patients.
Absorbable heart stents are in high demand at hospitals and clinics due to their many benefits. These stents are made of a biodegradable material that dissolves over time, meaning that they do not need to be removed after implantation like traditional stents. This can save both the patient and hospital time and money. Additionally, absorbable stents are less likely to cause infection or other complications. They are also being studied for their potential to reduce restenosis (reclogging of arteries). As hospitals and clinics strive to provide the best possible care for their patients, absorbable heart stents will continue to play an important role.To Get More Business Strategies For Request Sample Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS337By Absorption RateBy absorption rate, fast absorption rate to continue holding over 70% share of the global absorbable heart stent market.

Treasurer                    Mr. Andrew Yeo                    Income Insurance Limited              Members              Member                    Ms. Ho Lee Yen                    HSBC Life (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.                      Member                    Ms. Pearlyn Phau                    Singapore Life Ltd.                      Member                    Mr. Khor Hock Seng                    The Great Eastern Life Assurance Company Limited                    Newly elected President for 2023 – 2024, Mr Dennis Tan (on the right) with Guest-of-Honour, Mr Marcus Lim, Assistant Managing Director of the Banking and Insurance Group, Monetary Authority of Singapore (on the left).      Mr Dennis Tan is the newly elected President for 2023 – 2024, taking over the presidency from Mr Khor Hock Seng who has served the previous four terms as President. Ms Wong Sze Keed has been re-elected as Deputy President alongside Mr Raymond Ong who begins his first term as Deputy President. D Khoo Kah Siang was re-elected Secretary and Mr Andrew Yeo as Treasurer.   ""Amidst the challenges brought about by the pandemic and the volatile macroeconomic environment, the life insurance sector has remained resilient. In 2023, we will focus our efforts on supporting consumers in their financial planning journey and identifying their protection gaps through our protection gap study. At the same time, we will continue our digitalisation efforts and play our part in supporting the government's sustainability agenda,"" said Mr Dennis Tan, President of LIA Singapore, in his opening address at the luncheon.   This was followed by a speech by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Marcus Lim, Assistant Managing Director of the Banking and Insurance Group, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), who highlighted the importance of the industry maintaining public trust through managing financial and non-financial risks well, and by treating customers right. He also urged the industry to continue to push ahead with its efforts to address environmental risk.   The Management Committee, comprising eight members, have identified the following top priorities for the term office, namely:        Identifying and developing key initiatives to bridge Singapore's protection needs and financial gaps, especially through the nationwide protection gap study           Continuing digitalisation efforts in the life insurance sector to enhance the digitalisation journey for all stakeholders including the wider public           Supporting the nation's sustainability agenda through sustainable investing and green solutions      Identifying and understanding various protection gaps and helping consumers with their financial planning goals   With 2023 being the first endemic year since Singapore reopened its borders and transitioned towards living with COVID-19, the pandemic has reminded consumers of the importance of ensuring that they are well protected. LIA Singapore will release findings of the nationwide protection gap study in the coming months. This is a study conducted once every five years to better understand and identify various protection gaps that will help in the development of key initiatives that meet individuals' mortality and critical illness protection needs.   Amidst the rising cost of living and inflation, the life insurance industry will also continue to roll out people-first products and services that support consumers in their financial planning journey.   Continuing digitalisation efforts in the life insurance sector    The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital tools across the life insurance sector and transformed the way insurers and consumers interact with one another. With increased demand for digital services, life insurers will continue to work with its partners and the MAS to ensure the seamless use of digital tools and solutions that enhance the digitalisation journey and experience for consumers.   Supporting Singapore's sustainability agenda   As a Strategic Partner of the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT), LIA Singapore will continue to work with key partners to support sustainable investments and develop more green financial solutions.   Industry continues to show resilience and stability    Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, the life insurance industry continues to recover from the pandemic and recorded a total of S$5.10 billion in weighted new business premiums[1], a dip of 5.2% as compared to a year ago, mainly due to a drop in single premium business. The results also reflected an increase in demand for protection-focused policies in 2022, as uptake in total weighted new business premiums for Annual Premium plans recorded a 16.0% increase in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021.   Total weighted new business premiums for Individual Health Insurance for YTD Q4 2022 was at $360.2 million – consistent with the previous year. Total new business premiums[2] for Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) and IP riders for YTD Q4 2022 amounted to S$306.2 million, a 2.5% increase compared to YTD Q4 2021, highlighting how IP remains a priority health insurance product for Singaporeans.       [1] Weighted new business premiums measures premiums collected on new policies by taking into account (1) 10 per cent of the value of single premium products, (2) all of a year's premiums for annual premium products, and (3) adjusted value for products with premium payment durations of less than 10 years. The figure is calculated as follows: 10% Single Premium Insurance + 100% Annual Premium Insurance + Adjusted premium for Insurance with premium payment durations of less than 10 years.      [2] With effect from 1 January 2016, MediShield Life premiums have been excluded from LIA statistics. New Business premiums refer to the premium due to the new business sold in the year, as well as incremental premiums from any repricing of plans, and change in age-band of the insureds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844176,A look at the uranium-based ammo the UK will send to Ukraine,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia threatened to escalate attacks in Ukraine after the British government announced it would provide to Ukraine a type of munition that Moscow falsely claims has nuclear components.The British defense ministry on Monday confirmed it would provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.Such rounds were developed by the U.S. during the Cold War to destroy Soviet tanks, including the same T-72 tanks that Ukraine now faces in its push to break through a stalemate in the east.Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process needed to create nuclear weapons. The rounds retain some radioactive properties, but they can’t generate a nuclear reaction like a nuclear weapon would, RAND nuclear expert and policy researcher Edward Geist said.That didn’t stop the Russians from offering a full-throated warning that the rounds were opening the door to further escalation. In the past, they have suggested the war could escalate to nuclear weapons use.Both the the British ministry and the White House dismissed the Russian accusations. But the ammunition does carry risks even if it's not a nuclear weapon.A look at depleted uranium ammunition:WHAT IS DEPLETED URANIUM?Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the process to create the rarer, enriched uranium used in nuclear fuel and weapons. Although far less powerful than enriched uranium and incapable of generating a nuclear reaction, depleted uranium is extremely dense — more dense than lead — a quality that makes it highly attractive as a projectile.“It’s so dense and it’s got so much momentum that it just keeps going through the armor — and it heats it up so much that it catches on fire,” Geist said.When fired, a depleted uranium munition becomes “essentially an exotic metal dart fired at an extraordinarily high speed,” RAND senior defense analyst Scott Boston said.In the 1970s, the U.S. Army began making armor-piercing rounds with depleted uranium and has since added it to composite tank armor to strengthen it. It also has added depleted uranium to the munitions fired by the Air Force’s A-10 close air support attack plane, known as the tank killer. The U.S. military is still developing depleted uranium munitions, notably the M829A4 armor-piercing round for the M1A2 Abrams main battle tank, Boston said.In response to a query by the Associated Press, Pentagon spokesman Marine Corps Lt. Col. Garron Garn said in a statement Thursday that “DOD has procured, stored, and used depleted uranium rounds for several decades, since these are a longstanding element of some conventional munitions.”The rounds have “saved the lives of many service members in combat,” Garn said, adding that “other countries have long possessed depleted uranium rounds as well, including Russia.”Garn would not discuss whether the M1A1 tanks being readied for Ukraine would contain depleted uranium armor modifications, citing operational security.WHAT HAS RUSSIA SAID?President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday warned that Moscow would “respond accordingly, given that the collective West is starting to use weapons with a ‘nuclear component.’""The British “have lost their bearings,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, warning that the munitions are “a step toward accelerating escalation.”Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the announcement was ""another step, and there aren’t so many of them left.”The White House denounced Russia's claims as disinformation.“Make no mistake, this is yet another straw man through which the Russians are driving a stake,” U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.Russia also has depleted uranium munitions and just doesn't want Ukraine to have them, too, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that to his knowledge, the U.S. was not sending depleted uranium munitions from its own arsenal to Ukraine.NOT A BOMB, BUT STILL A RISKWhile depleted uranium munitions are not considered nuclear weapons, their emission of low levels of radiation has led the U.N. nuclear watchdog to urge caution when handling and warn of the possible dangers of exposure.The handling of such ammunition “should be kept to a minimum and protective apparel (gloves) should be worn,” the International Atomic Energy Agency cautions, adding that “a public information campaign may, therefore, be required to ensure that people avoid handling the projectiles.""This should form part of any risk assessment and such precautions should depend on the scope and number of ammunitions used in an area.”The IAEA notes that depleted uranium is mainly a toxic chemical, as opposed to a radiation hazard. Particles in aerosols can be inhaled or ingested, and while most would be excreted again, some can enter the blood stream and cause kidney damage.“High concentrations in the kidney can cause damage and, in extreme cases, renal failure,” the IAEA says.The low-level radioactivity of a depleted uranium round “is a bug, not a feature” of the munition, Geist said, and if the U.S. military could find another material with the same density but without the radioactivity it would likely use that instead.Depleted uranium munitions were used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq’s T-72 tanks and again in the invasion of the country in 2003, as well as in Serbia and in Kosovo. U.S. military veterans of those conflicts have questioned whether their use led to ailments they now face.Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian parliament’s lower house, said supplies of rounds containing depleted uranium could lead to ""a tragedy on a global scale that will primarily affect European countries.”Volodin said the use of such U.S. ammunition in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq led to “radioactive contamination and a sharp rise in oncological diseases.”___Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington, Frank Jordans in Berlin and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed to this report.___Follow the AP's coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844177,Iraq WMD failures shadow US intelligence 20 years later,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In his U.S. Capitol office, Rep. Jason Crow keeps several war mementos. Sitting on a shelf are his military identification tags, the tailfins of a spent mortar and a piece of shrapnel stopped by his body armor.Two decades ago, Crow was a 24-year-old platoon leader in the American invasion of Iraq. Platoon members carried gas masks and gear to wear over their uniforms to protect them from the chemical weapons the U.S. believed — wrongly — that Iraqi forces might use against them.Today, Crow sits on committees that oversee the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. The mistakes of Iraq are still fresh in his mind.“It’s not hyperbole to say that it was a life-changing experience and a life frame through which I view a lot of my work,” the Colorado Democrat said.The failures of the Iraq War deeply shaped American spy agencies and a generation of intelligence officers and lawmakers. They helped drive a major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community, with the CIA losing its oversight role over other spy agencies, and reforms intended to allow analysts to better evaluate sources and challenge conclusions for possible bias.But the ultimately incorrect assertions about Iraq’s nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs, repeatedly cited to build support for the war in America and abroad, did lasting damage to the credibility of U.S. intelligence.As many as 300,000 civilians died in two decades of conflict in Iraq, according to Brown University estimates. The U.S. lost 4,500 troops and spent an estimated $2 trillion on the Iraq War and the ensuing campaign in both Iraq and Syria against the extremist Islamic State group, which took hold in both countries after the U.S. initially withdrew in 2011.Those assertions also made “weapons of mass destruction” a catchphrase that’s still used by rivals and allies alike, including before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which U.S. intelligence correctly forecast.Avril Haines, the current U.S. director of national intelligence, noted in a statement that the intelligence community had adopted new standards for analysis and oversight.“We learned critical lessons in the wake of our flawed assessment of an active WMD program in Iraq in 2002,"" Haines said. ""Since then, for example, we have expanded the use of structured analytic techniques, established community-wide analytic standards, and enhanced tradecraft oversight. As in every part of our work, we strive to learn the lessons that allow us to preserve and advance our thinking to greater effect in service of our national security.”Only 18% of U.S. adults say they have a great deal of confidence in the government’s intelligence agencies, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Forty-nine percent say they have “some” confidence and 31% have hardly any confidence.Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush ordered an invasion of Afghanistan, where the ruling Taliban sheltered al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and allowed the group to run training camps.Bush's administration soon began to warn about Iraq, which was long seen as threatening American interests in the Middle East.Iraq was known to have sought a nuclear weapon in the 1980s and had chemical and biological weapons programs by the end of the Gulf War in 1991. It had been accused of concealing details about those programs from international inspectors, before they were kicked out in 1998.The Bush administration argued Saddam Hussein's government was still hiding programs from inspectors after they reentered the country in 2002 and found no signs of resumed production.A U.S. intelligence estimate published in October 2002 alleges that Iraq had considered buying uranium from Niger and aluminum tubes for centrifuges, that it was building mobile weapons labs, that it was considering using drones to spread deadly toxins, and that it had chemical weapons stockpiles of up to 500 tons.Some U.S. officials also suggested Iraqi officials had ties to al-Qaida leaders despite evidence of deep antipathy between the two sides.Those claims would largely be debunked within months of the invasion. No stockpiles were found. Subsequent reviews have blamed those claims on outdated information, mistaken assumptions, and a mix of uninformed sources and outright fabricators.Bush repeated wrong U.S. intelligence findings before the war, as did Secretary of State Colin Powell in a landmark February 2002 speech before the United Nations.“He said he’d go to his grave with the manacles of Iraq,” said retired Col. Larry Wilkerson, who was then Powell's chief of staff and later became a high-profile critic of the Bush administration. Powell died in 2021.It's still sharply debated whether the Bush administration would have ordered the invasion without the WMD intelligence.A White House spokesperson told The Washington Post in 2006 — as Iraq had fallen into a violent insurgency — that Bush “made his decision to go to war in Iraq based on the intelligence given to him by the intelligence community.”Some former intelligence officials argue the Bush administration stretched available information to make the case for war, particularly on allegations of ties between Iraq and al-Qaida.Congress was already debating wholesale change to the U.S. intelligence community after the Sept. 11 attacks, an intelligence failure blamed in part on a lack of information sharing between the CIA and FBI.Lawmakers in 2004 created the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence to oversee the other agencies, taking that leadership function away from the CIA. ODNI took control of the daily intelligence briefing given to the president and of the National Intelligence Council, comprised of the spy community's top analysts.Supporters say ODNI can arbitrate among the other agencies, which often have sharply different skillsets and cultures. Others criticize ODNI as an unnecessary bureaucratic layer.The CIA revamped its training program for analysts to emphasize the study of alternatives and use of “red teams” that challenge conclusions. It also forced more information sharing so analysts could better evaluate the sources of specific reports.Michael Allen, who served in the Bush White House and wrote the book “Blinking Red” about the 2004 intelligence overhaul, said U.S. officials in the wake of Iraq are more likely to accept differences of opinion within intelligence.Allen noted as an example the Energy Department's recent assessment that the COVID-19 virus likely leaked from a Chinese lab. The FBI also supports the lab leak hypothesis, but other agencies say the virus likely was transmitted from animals to humans or have declined to take a position.The U.S. learned to ""not take intelligence at face value, but to really examine the basis upon which the conclusions were made and to listen to differing views among different agencies in the intelligence community,” said Allen, now managing director of Washington-based Beacon Global Strategies.Ukraine has been a bright spot for U.S. intelligence. The Biden administration has supplied information to Kyiv for Ukraine to bolster its defenses and declassified intelligence findings on Russian intentions to try to influence Moscow and build allied support.And while they correctly predicted Russia’s intention to invade, the spy agencies wrongly believed Ukraine’s forces would fall within weeks.While in Congress, Crow has pressed the agencies to review how they assess a foreign government’s ability to fight. U.S. intelligence two years ago wrongly projected the Washington-backed government in Kabul would survive months after the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.“We’ve lived with the ghosts of Iraq for two decades and it’s impacted our credibility,” Crow said. “Now we’re starting to find it again. It’s a great opportunity for us to learn lessons of the past and do it better going forward.”But those ghosts remain. Sitting in his office for a recent interview, Crow said he understands the limits of what a military can do and the importance of using armed forces properly. He said he thinks about his enrolling in the Wisconsin National Guard after high school as a private and moving to active duty after Sept. 11.He pointed to a photo on a wall opposite the shelf with his Iraq War mementos, a picture of his company at Fort Bragg, an Army base in North Carolina, before they went to the Middle East.“There's men in that picture who died, who aren't here anymore,” he said. “I think about those guys, too.”___AP Polling reporter Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844178,Biden approval dips near lowest point: AP-NORC poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of President Joe Biden has dipped slightly since a month ago, nearing the lowest point of his presidency as his administration tries to project a sense of stability while confronting a pair of bank failures and inflation that remains stubbornly high.That’s according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which shows there have been modest fluctuations in support for Biden over the past several months. The president notched an approval rating of 38% in the new poll, after 45% said they approved in February and 41% in January. His ratings hit their lowest point of his presidency last July, at 36%, as the full weight of rising gasoline, food and other costs began to hit U.S. households.In recent months, approval of Biden had been hovering above 40%.Interviews with poll respondents suggest the public has mixed feelings about Biden, who is expected to announce a reelection bid by this summer. When it comes to the president, people generally do not swing between the extremes of absolute loyalty and aggressive loathing that have been a feature of this era's divided politics.“Neutral towards approve,” Andrew Dwyer, 30, said of Biden. “I don’t think he’s the best at representing my position and issues. But I know being president involves compromises.”Dwyer, a data analyst in Milwaukee, said he voted for the president in 2020 and considers himself to be liberal. He acknowledged the recent failures of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but he said that the economy is adjusting to higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation.“We all got so used to cheap debt and the ability to throw money around,” Dwyer said. He said there were “pain points” caused by higher borrowing costs but that he thinks the process will “ultimately” lead to a healthier economy.The president has taken ambitious steps to boost the U.S. economy, with his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package from 2021, infrastructure investments, support for computer chip plants and taxes on corporations and the wealthy to help fund health care and a shift away from fossil fuels.But those efforts involve multiyear investments that have yet to provide much optimism to a public dealing with annual inflation at 6%. The president and other administration officials have toured the country to promote their achievements. But to many, the economy feels as though it could be on a knife's edge after the recent bank failures, as well as the debt limit showdown with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., that could put the U.S. government at risk of defaulting.Just 31% approve of Biden’s stewardship of the national economy, about where it’s been over the course of the last year. His handling of the nation’s economic fortunes has been a weak point at least since late 2021, when the inflation that the administration had suggested was transitory became a bigger pain point for businesses and families.Michael McComas, 51, voted Republican in 2020 and described Biden as “not great — average, I guess.” A resident of Westland, Michigan, he noted that it will take years to determine whether federal infrastructure spending fulfills the promises made by Biden.McComas said he believes inflation is the direct result of government spending to counter the pandemic, a claim that Biden has personally rejected when asked by reporters.“We poured so much money into the system — that’s a little frustrating that we were shocked that we got hit by inflation when a lot of our policies were inflationary,” McComas said.The difference between Biden’s approval overall and his approval on the economy is driven largely by Democrats, 76% of whom say they approve of how he’s handling his job as president while 63% approve of his handling of the economy. Few Republicans approve of Biden on either count.Democrats under the age of 45 feel less positive about Biden, causing a drag on his approval ratings. Just 54% approve of the president's economic leadership, compared to 72% of Democrats older than 45. Similarly, just 66% of Democrats under 45 approve of Biden overall, compared to 85% of older Democrats.Only about a quarter of Americans say the national economy is good or that the country is headed in the right direction, the poll shows. Those numbers have also fluctuated only slightly over the last few months.Ratings of Biden’s handling of foreign policy (39%) and climate change (41%) are about on par with his overall approval ratings. Seventy-four percent of Democrats and 9% of Republicans approve of Biden on foreign policy, while 67% of Democrats and 17% of Republicans approve of his handling of climate change.Theresa Ojuro, a 29-year-old doctoral student in Rochester, New York, said she “expected more” from Biden — “just a little bit more stability with the economy.” Ojuro, who voted for Biden in 2020, also noted that the bank failures are dragging down her sentiment, but she worries about how high taxes are in New York state relative to the benefits provided.“If Biden is doing his job, why in a state like this can you see people really suffering?” Ojuro said.___The poll of 1,081 adults was conducted Mar. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844225,Holocaust survivor shares on TikTok to educate young people,"MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) — Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman is a TikTok star at age 85, thanks to her 17-year-old grandson.In the family living room in Morristown, New Jersey, he records short videos of his grandmother reminiscing about life in 1944 and 1945 when she was a 6-year-old child at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. She also discusses her experiences before and after the camp.They say videos on her account have garnered 75 million views since the duo started posting in September 2021.“It really snowballed,” said Friedman. “And then we realized it was a fabulous medium for the Holocaust, for young people who don’t want to read the books, who don’t like the classes in school, who don’t like the way the teachers teach or whatever, who are bored with it, or some who never heard of it. Here they are, listening.”Her grandson, Aron Goodman, said their most-viewed videos are “ones that show her number” — the identification tattooed on prisoners' arms at Auschwitz.“People around the world can’t really get the chance to see a survivor, to see the history on their arm,” Goodman said. “So social media and TikTok is the way we kind of impart our message and show the evidence of the Holocaust that people unrightfully deny.”Commenters on the videos thank Friedman for posting her memories, with many remarking they had not learned much — or anything — about the Holocaust in school.Goodman said he makes the videos to counter antisemitic speech online and to educate the TikTok generation about the horrors of the Holocaust.“We need to focus on the history and warn people where hate can lead if it’s unchecked, if no one does anything about it,” the high schooler said.Another TikTok features black-and-white footage of Friedman with other Jewish children in early 1945, as she pushes up her sleeve to show the tattooed number on her arm. The film was shot by the Soviet military a week after they liberated the camp.When Friedman looks at the film, she remembers her mother, out of frame but nearby, who taught her how to survive in the camp by not making eye contact with the guards and hiding amid dead bodies. Her mother fell into despair after the war and died in her mid-40s.Friedman said people often ask how she could ever trust or love people after what she witnessed. Friedman said she saw many other Holocaust survivors who lost their families in the camps go on to remarry and have more children, which they called “replacement children” in those days.“Life is resilient, and you can live again,” said Friedman, who works as a therapist and social worker and wrote a book about her experiences called ""The Daughter of Auschwitz."" “This is what I’d like to let people know. It’s the hope that humanity can rebuild itself.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844226,African Union urges nearly $90 million for its Somali force,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The African Union appealed for nearly $90 million Wednesday for its peacekeeping force in Somalia, which is providing support to its military forces battling al-Shabab extremists.Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, the AU commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, told two reporters that the more than 19,600-strong AU force won’t be able to function properly and help the Somalis unless that funding gap is filled.A year ago, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a new African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, known as ATMIS, to support the Somalis until their forces take full responsibility for the country’s security at the end of 2024.If the AU force doesn’t have the funds to operate effectively in the coming 21 months before the handover, Adeoye said, “it may mean that al-Shabab will eventually take over the responsibilities of a state in Somalia.”“The implications are huge,” he said. “And we do not want the international community to lose focus or have diverted attention away from Somalia, because it’s been on for almost two decades.”Adeoye said the current Somali government is doing what many in the past never did — launch a full-scale offensive against al-Shabab instead of responding to al-Shabab attacks — and “there’s a need to encourage that offensive onslaught.”He said a key reason for the AU financial plight is the European Union’s $60 million cut in funding because of competing interests.Adeoye attended a high-level meeting with U.N. member nations on financing for ATMIS after speaking to the reporters. He expressed hope that all countries help fill the $89 million funding gap, especially Gulf nations, the global south and the EU.The government of Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud declared “total war” last year on the thousands of al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremists. For more than a decade they have controlled parts of the country and carried out devastating attacks while exploiting clan divisions and extorting millions of dollars a year in their quest to impose an Islamic state.The current offensive was sparked in part by local communities and militias driven to the brink by al-Shabab’s harsh taxation policies amid the country’s worst drought on record.The United States has increased its military assistance to Somalia as it has seen success in battling al-Shabab, with 61 tons of weapons and ammunition arriving in the capital Mogadishu on March 1.“The West is supporting Ukraine in the fight for the protection of their sovereignty, but Ukrainians are doing the fight,” Adeoye said. “So now the Somalis are doing the fighting, and we need to all encourage that fight by ensuring that the peace support operation of the African Union does not fail.""He said a lack of resources will affect the withdrawal date for the AU force, and he warned that an uncoordinated AU withdrawal would be worse than the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO forces from Afghanistan in August 2021. He added that ""it will affect the whole region.""Adeoye said everyone’s assessment is that the Somali forces have “improved tremendously militarily” and on the political side, where they worked with the AU in supporting elections last year.But Adeoye said al-Shabab has been in Somalia for almost 20 years and it is definitely trying to adapt to a more robust Somali security force.“They are resilient, so we have to be above game, and that’s why we are not just asking for resources to train, to pay troops,” he said. “We’re asking for resources for equipment as well — for the best state-of-the-art offensive weapons from the U.S., from those with the wherewithal to make an impact, and double-up what the Somali government is doing.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844227,New dawn for France as Mbappé leads team against Netherlands,"PARIS (AP) — New captain, new goalkeeper, new defense, new governance — and major players retired.It seems like a new dawn for World Cup runner-up France as it begins European Championship qualifying without Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema, and with Kylian Mbappé leading the team out at Stade de France against the Netherlands on Friday. Les Bleus then play Ireland in another Group B match at Dublin on Monday.“The end of several players’ international careers means that the squad is younger,” said coach Didier Deschamps, who picked brothers Khéphren and Marcus Thuram in his first squad since last year's World Cup. “Obviously we have less experience.”The Thuram brothers are the sons of famed France defender Lilian Thuram, who played with Deschamps when France won the 1998 World Cup and its second European title in 2000. Their selection gives insight into how Deschamps plans to rebuild.“We want to have answers for the future while remaining competitive,"" he said. ""Because our first two games are already difficult, so we have a degree of obligation.”Forward Marcus Thuram, who played for France at the World Cup, is the elder brother of 21-year-old Nice midfielder Khéphren Thuram, who wants to win his first cap alongside his sibling.""It's always been my dream to play alongside him, whether in the back garden or at the highest level,"" Khéphren said.Mbappé, meanwhile, succeeds veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris as captain. Lloris and central defender Raphaël Varane retired from international soccer following the World Cup final defeat to Argentina last December.Varane's departure leaves a healthy competition for his spot between Liverpool's Ibrahima Konaté and Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano. There are new faces, too, with goalkeeper Brice Samba of Lens and Chelsea center back Wesley Fofana called up for the first time.But the spotlight Friday will be on Mbappé.His hat trick in the World Cup final propelled him further into soccer stardom and made it a logical choice for Deschamps when it came to replacing Lloris, France's record holder with 145 caps.Varane played the last of his 93 games for Les Bleus against Argentina and, near the end of extra time, he lay down on the side of the field unable to stand.Varane's exhaustion summed up how much he gave for France, including winning the World Cup alongside Lloris and Mbappé in 2018. But perhaps Deschamps sensed it was time for an overhaul.Lloris and Varane took that decision away from him by retiring, and Deschamps has the luxury of being able to count on AC Milan standout Mike Maignan as his No. 1.The 27-year-old Maignan was outstanding when Milan won the Italian league in 2022.Benzema was outstanding, too, throughout all of 2022 but left the World Cup injured without kicking a ball.He has disputed a newspaper interview Deschamps gave explaining what happened when Benzema left Qatar. Deschamps has since refused to answer any further questions about Benzema, who was France's top scorer at the 2020 European Championship.Another exile from the national team — and this one is self-imposed - likely spells the end of the Real Madrid star's international career after 97 caps and 37 goals.Another prominent French soccer figure has also gone, but for very different reasons.Long-serving French soccer federation president Noël Le Graët, who had a close relationship with Deschamps and renewed his contract in January, resigned three weeks ago. A government audit found he no longer had the legitimacy to lead because of his behavior toward women and his management style.While France turned the page in different ways, the Dutch start another era under coach Ronald Koeman.The former Barcelona coach pledged to take the Netherlands back to playing flowing attacking soccer in his second stint in charge.Netherlands lost in the World Cup quarterfinals to Argentina.Sections of the Dutch media were critical of Koeman’s predecessor, Louis van Gaal, for what they perceived as an abrasive and defensive style of play.Forward Memphis Depay is No. 2 on the Oranje's all-time leading scorers with 43 goals as he closes in on Robin van Persie's record of 50.After facing France, Koeman's squad plays Gibraltar.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844228,Gwyneth Paltrow's lawyer asks about missing GoPro video,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Gwyneth Paltrow's attorneys asked the daughter of a man suing the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer over a 2016 ski collision about missing GoPro camera footage that they called “the most important piece of evidence"" at trial Thursday.Steve Owens, Paltrow's attorney, asked one of the man's daughters, Polly Grasham, about emails exchanged with her father about the mysterious footage and the possibility that the lawsuit was filed against Paltrow because she was famous.The GoPro footage has not been found or included as evidence for the trial.“I'm famous ... At what cost?” Terry Sanderson, the 76-year-old retired optometrist suing Paltrow, wrote in the subject line of an email to his family after the crash.Sanderson is suing Paltrow for more than $300,000 in damages, claiming that she skied recklessly into him on a beginner run at Deer Valley Resort seven years ago, breaking his ribs and leaving him with a concussion. Paltrow has claimed Sanderson caused the crash and countersued for $1 and attorney fees.The trial took on an increasingly personal note on the third day of proceedings when Sanderson's daughter and a neuropsychologist testified about his declining health.Sanderson's attorneys tried to persuade jurors that the collision had changed the course of their client's life, leaving him brain-impaired and damaging his relationships with loved ones.Paltrow's attorneys questioned whether Grasham and neuropsychologist Dr. Alina Fong could say with certainty that Sanderson's downturn wasn't a result of aging or documented, pre-crash conditions. They questioned Grasham about her father's anger problems, divorces and estranged relationship with another of his daughters, who is not testifying at trial.Paltrow has previously called the lawsuit an attempt to exploit her fame and celebrity. On Thursday, Owens, her lead counsel, asked Grasham why her father sent messages about his newfound fame.“It matches his personality a little bit, making light of a serious situation,” Grasham said of the email.Owens probed Sanderson's “obsession” with the case and whether he thought it was “cool” to collide with a celebrity like Paltrow, the Oscar-winning star of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and founder-CEO of the wellness company, Goop.Sanderson is expected to testify Friday about the lasting effects of the crash. He has not been present in the courtroom while his doctors and experts have detailed his health problems.Paltrow could be called to testify on Friday or early next week, when the eight-day trial continues.The proceedings thus far have touched on themes ranging from skier's etiquette to the power — and burden — of celebrity. The amount of money at stake for both sides pales in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit, private security detail and expert witness-heavy trial. Sanderson's attorney told the jury Thursday that this trial is about “value, not cost.""The first two days of trial featured attorneys arguing about whether Sanderson or Paltrow was further down the slope during the collision — a disagreement rooted in a ""Skiers Responsibility Code” that gives the skier who is downhill the right of way. Sanderson's attorneys and expert medical witnesses described how his injuries were likely caused by someone crashing into him from behind. They attributed noticeable changes in Sanderson's mental acuity to injuries from that day.Paltrow's attorneys have tried to represent Sanderson as a 76-year-old whose decline followed a normal course of aging rather than the results of a crash. They have not yet called witnesses of their own to testify, but in opening statements previewed for jurors that they plan to call Paltrow's husband Brad Falchuk and her two children, Moses and Apple, to the stand next week.__Associated Press writer Anna Furman contributed reporting from Los Angeles.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844229,Muddy clothes? 'Cop City' activists question police evidence,"ATLANTA (AP) — When police stormed an Atlanta-area music festival two days after a rainstorm, they were looking for suspects wearing muddy clothing.Authorities moved in on the South River Music Festival on the evening of March 5, over an hour after more than 150 masked activists attacked a construction site about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 kilometers) away, bashing equipment, torching a bulldozer and a police ATV, while throwing rocks and fireworks at retreating law enforcement officers, according to police surveillance footage.Officials say many of the rioters trekked back to the festival ground, crossing a creek before changing out of their all-black or camouflage attire in the woods in order to blend in with the hundreds of peaceful concertgoers gathered to show their solidarity with the “Stop Cop City” movement — a decentralized campaign to halt the planned razing of an urban forest for the construction of a huge police and firefighter training center.By the end of the night, 23 had been arrested, each facing between five and 35 years behind bars on domestic terrorism charges, even though none of the warrants accuses any of them of injuring anyone or vandalizing anything.Civil liberties groups and defense attorneys say officials levied the disproportionate charges to scare off others from joining a movement that has only grown since January, when a 26-year-old known as Tortuguita was killed by a state trooper as authorities cleared activists from the South River Forest. Authorities said they fired in self-defense after the protester shot a trooper, but activists have questioned that narrative and called for an independent investigation.Officials say the protesters have attacked officers, destroyed property and unleashed anarchy, causing terror in the community.“You can’t make a criminal organization out of a political movement,” said defense attorney Eli Bennett, representing three people who were arrested at the festival. “That’s just not what we do in this country, I hope.”Following the arrests, numerous activists told The Associated Press that they fear being detained on flimsy charges that could have huge ramifications. But they are committed to ensuring that what they refer to disparagingly as “Cop City” will never be built.“If I am arrested with domestic terrorism charges for camping in a forest, that’s something I’m willing to go to court for,"" said Sam Law, an anthropology doctoral student from Texas. ""If I have to spend a few weeks in jail, that sounds like a deeply unpleasant experience, but I don’t think it’s a reason not to stand with other people of conscience doing what I feel like the historical moment calls us to do.”Vanderbilt University law and political science research professor Samar Ali said domestic terrorism charges should be reserved for heinous crimes such as the 1996 Oklahoma City bombing, and that Georgia authorities' use of such harsh laws only fans the flames of distrust between activists and authorities.If the prosecutions succeed, Ali predicted, conservative states could replicate Georgia’s broad domestic terrorism statute and target left-wing movements, while liberal states could take a similar approach against white nationalists, further increasing division in the country.“This is going to be a test case in terms of an application against environmental activists,” Ali said. “If there is a harsh sentence against environmental activists, we are likely going to see replication of this across states.”In their arrest warrants, police allege 17 of the 23 suspects wore muddy clothing and carried shields — evidence that they were among the band of violent protesters and not mere festivalgoers. But the warrants for five of the other suspects do not list any specific details to explain why they were arrested.One of the defendants, a Southern Poverty Law Center legal observer accused because of their muddy clothing, was released on bond a few days later. Fourteen other defendants spent at least two weeks in jail before being granted bond, while eight were denied bond Thursday.Bennett said none of his clients had shields despite the warrants' claims. He said it's ridiculous to call muddy clothes evidence of wrongdoing, given that it had rained that week and there were many muddy patches around the festival site, including by the stage where festivalgoers had been moshing to punk music.“I understand law enforcement has a big problem on their hands in identifying the actual ‘vandals’ here,” Bennett said. “But that doesn’t justify arresting people who had no involvement and were just there for a music festival that was in support of an environmental cause and an anti-militarization of the police cause.”Atlanta police declined to comment on how many shields were recovered and where and when the arrests occurred, though jail records say all 23 were arrested at 7:45 p.m., more than two hours after Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said the violence took place.Ever since City Council approved the $90 million training center in 2021, the movement has brought together a whole host of leftists, including environmentalists and police abolitionists. They say officers at the 85-acre (34-hectare) center would be trained to become more militarized and quell dissent, all while hundreds of trees are cut down, damaging the climate and flood mitigation in a poor, majority-Black neighborhood.Officials counter that the state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale beset by hiring and retention struggles following violent protests against racial injustice after George Floyd's death in 2020.Georgia’s domestic terrorism law originally applied only to crimes that were “intended or reasonably likely to injure or kill not less than ten individuals.” But state lawmakers broadened the law in 2017, removing the 10-victim threshold and adding attempts to “disable or destroy critical infrastructure” with the intent to “alter, change, or coerce the policy of the government.”For more than five years, the statute was rarely employed. That changed in December, when six self-described “forest defenders” were removed from the training center site. Since then, 35 other alleged members of the movement have been jailed on the charge, including seven who were arrested during the clearing operation when authorities killed Tortuguita, whose given name was Manuel Paez Terán.Four days after the festival, dozens of activists remained in the nearby woods. Some were cleaning up trashed campsites, while others prepared lunch. The activists insisted they had the moral high ground and would not back down to “heavy-handed” police tactics.Some conceded that facing a domestic terrorism charge could have huge personal implications.Kira, an Atlanta-based technical writer who has served as a medic during “Stop Cop City” demonstrations, said she does not engage in violence, and that a domestic terrorism charge could ruin her career, even if it is later dropped. She left the festival after she heard that officers were on their way.“My instincts told me, ‘OK, it’s time to get out,'” Kira said. “I'm middle-aged. I have a good job. I would take an arrest if I feel that it’s justified but I'm not going to get arrested out of collateral damage.""Ashley Dixon, a local organizer with Showing Up for Racial Justice, said she and her friends didn't realize the vandalism was going on and that she was shocked to see an officer holding a weapon running toward her.“The officer tased someone right in front of me,"" Dixon said. ""I heard him yelling something, but I don’t know what he was yelling because I was in fight-or-flight mode. I was in fear for my life and I just kept running.”But fear of being charged won't stop her activism.“If anything, it makes me want to fight harder because it just seems that much more important,” Dixon said. ""If they’re already using this level of violence against protesters now, imagine what they will do if they have this militarized police training center.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844230,California may punish oil companies for high gas prices,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A first-in-the-nation bill to punish oil companies for profiting from price spikes at the pump breezed through the California Senate on Thursday at the urging of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, the first major vote in an effort to pass the law by month's end.The proposal is in response to sales last summer, when the average price of a gallon of gasoline in California soared to a record high $6.44. Drivers in some places paid as much as $8 per gallon, prompting widespread outrage in an election year.Newsom, a Democrat seen as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2024, reacted by attacking the oil industry, specifically the five companies that provide 97% of gasoline in the state. He asked the Democratic-controlled state Legislature to pass a new tax on oil company profits, arguing it would protect consumers by preventing price spikes.That idea went nowhere in the Legislature, as lawmakers feared it would create chaos in the petroleum market and cause companies to make less gasoline, thus increasing prices.Instead, lawmakers and Newsom settled on a bill that would let the California Energy Commission decide whether to impose civil penalties on oil companies for price gouging. The commission – a five-member panel appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate – would rely on information from a new state agency that would have the power to monitor the market, including forcing companies to disclose financial information and having the power to subpoena oil executives to testify.In 10 years, the bill requires the state auditor to investigate the program to find out if it is working to reduce gas prices. If it’s not, the auditor can order the program to shut down – but lawmakers will have six months to review that decision and reverse it if they choose.“It is our role to protect our residents from any practices of any business that may harm them,” said state Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat from Berkeley and the author of the bill.The bill highlights the challenges of balancing the competing pressures of protecting consumers at the pump while at the same time pushing policies to end the state’s reliance on fossil fuels. California’s climate strategy — which includes banning the sale of most new gas-powered cars by 2035 — would reduce demand for gasoline by 94% by 2045.“To sum it all up, it's our energy policy — our energy policy and our efforts to replace fossil fuel with all electric in a very, very short amount of time,” said state Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Republican from Murrieta who opposes the bill. “Why can't we just tell our constituents that? That's why your gas prices are so high.”California’s gasoline prices are already higher than most other states because of taxes, fees and environmental regulations. California’s gas tax is the second-highest in the country at 54 cents per gallon. And the state requires oil companies make a special blend of gasoline to sell in California that is better for the environment but is more expensive to produce.Republicans on Thursday tried to force a vote on a separate bill that would suspend the state's gas tax and some gas-related regulations for one year. But Democrats voted not to bring the bill up for debate.At one point last year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in California was more than $2.60 higher than the national average — a difference regulators say is too large to be explained by taxes, fees and regulations.Much of the oil industry’s complaints about the bill have focused on the new, independent state agency lawmakers would create create to investigate the market. Oil companies would be required to disclose massive amounts of data to this agency, giving regulators a better sense of what could be driving price spikes. And, crucially, the agency would have subpoena power to compel oil company executives to testify.Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, said oil companies would have to report data on 15,000 transactions per day, what he called “a ridiculous level of reporting” that would drive up costs. He said the real problem with California’s gas prices are state laws and regulations that hinder the supply of fuel. He criticized Newsom and lawmakers for rushing the bill through the Legislature with little input from the oil industry.“Why does the governor want to jam this through? Clearly it’s because the details of this are not good for California consumers,” Slagle said. “They don’t address the problem, but it provides him a political win.”Dana Williamson, Newsom’s chief of staff, said she has repeatedly had meetings with representatives from the oil industry to discuss the bill, including meetings with specific companies and two meetings with the Western States Petroleum Association.Newsom said the bill would end “the era of oil's outsized influence and holding them accountable.”___This story has been updated to correct the record-high average price for a gallon of gasoline in California. It is $6.44 per gallon, not $6.48 per gallon.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844231,"Lakers charge to skid-snapping win over Suns, 122-111","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Anthony Davis had 27 points and nine rebounds Wednesday night in the Lakers' 122-111 victory over the Phoenix Suns, who were furious with the game's large free-throw disparity favoring Los Angeles.Suns coach Monty Williams gave just one answer before leaving his postgame news conference, both ripping the game officials and describing what he sees as a pattern of unfair officiating against his team in recent games. The Lakers shot 46 free throws to the Suns' 20, outscoring Phoenix by 21 points at the line.“Where do you see a game with 46 free throws for one team?” Williams said. “That’s just not right. I don’t care how you slice it. It is happening to us too much. Other teams are reaching, other teams are hitting, and we’re not getting the same call, and I’m tired of it. It’s old. Forty-six to 20 free throws with Devin Booker on our team. He gets 12. I mean, our bench had no free throws. It’s just … I’m over it. Been talking about the same thing for a while. Doesn’t matter what team it is.”Booker scored 25 of his 33 points in the second half for the Suns, who have been called for 31 personal fouls in each of their last two games. Chris Paul said the box score was ""a little weird-looking.”“We've been seeing some crazy stuff in different situations,” Paul added. “I watch a lot of basketball, and ... we've got a guy (Booker) who goes (to the rim) night in and night out, and you don't necessarily see the same (calls). It's crazy. Crazy how some of (the officials), too, you can't even talk to them or approach them ... because that (communication) is horrible.”D’Angelo Russell scored 26 points for Los Angeles. Austin Reaves had 25 points and a career-high 11 assists after moving into the starting lineup for the Lakers, who improved to 7-5 in LeBron James' latest injury absence with an impressive second half.Reaves shot 13 free throws one game after shooting a career-high 18 against Orlando.“(Reaves) was huge for us, and he's been huge for us all year,"" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “He's in a great space right now, feeling his game and locked into what we're trying to accomplish.”Paul had 18 points for the Suns, who have lost five of six. Phoenix hadn't lost to the Lakers in six games since May 2021.The Lakers shot 27 free throws in the first half to the Suns' 10, but Phoenix rallied back to trail by just one point with 7:29 to play. Davis, Russell and Reaves then scored every point in a 16-6 Lakers run to put it away.“After the game is controlled in the first half and we're down 20 to 30 free throws, it's kind of easier for them to give us some after that,” Booker said. “Like Chris said, I watch these games every night, so I kind of understand what's going on. I understand the agendas that are being pushed, and trying to just get that out of my head and go out there and compete.”Booker added six rebounds and five assists, but was limited at key moments by Jarred Vanderbilt while the Lakers maintained a steady lead in the fourth quarter.Kevin Durant missed his seventh straight game for Phoenix with an ankle injury, and Deandre Ayton also didn’t make the trip to Los Angeles while sitting out his second game with a hip injury.James is still sidelined with a foot injury, allowing the Suns to miss him for the third time this season. The Lakers have kept James' recovery under wraps, but he is scheduled to be re-evaluated later this week.Los Angeles endangered its playoff hopes with losses to Houston and Dallas last week, but has surged back into a tie for ninth place in the Western Conference postseason picture with consecutive victories.TIP-INSSuns: Landry Shamet scored 15 points in his second game back from a 25-game absence with a left foot injury.Lakers: Reaves scored a career-high 35 points in Los Angeles’ last game, prompting Ham to promote him into Malik Beasley’s starting spot. Beasley hit two 3-pointers off the bench.UP NEXTSuns: At Sacramento on Friday.Lakers: Host Oklahoma City on Friday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844232,Taiwan Marines simulate enemy landing on beach,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Marine Corps sent amphibious vehicles to a beach in Taoyuan City Thursday (March 23) to simulate an attempt by the enemy to land its forces.The drills were the latest in a nationwide series designed to counter an invasion of Taiwan, as China continues to fly jets and sail ships close to the country. Military experts identified the lack of suitable landing sites as one of Taiwan’s major advantages if China decided to attack.While past exercises centered on the mouth of the Tamsui River, Taipei Port, and the beaches of Bali District in New Taipei City, on Thursday, the AAV7 amphibious vehicles rolled across a beach in Zhuwei, Taoyuan City.The military counts the area as a “red beach,” meaning it is convenient for the enemy to use for a large-scale landing effort, CNA reported. The beach is located a mere 5 kilometers from the country’s main gateway, Taoyuan International Airport.A Navy tank landing ship appeared off Zhuwei before dawn Thursday, with three AAV7 amphibious vehicles setting off at 8 a.m., representing the start of the invasion by the “red army.” However, as they reached the beach, they were met by soldiers from the “blue army” setting off smoke bombs to disrupt visibility.Some “red army” soldiers managed to break through the defenses and reach urban areas, where the exercises for the “blue army” included replacing tires on armored vehicles.",2023/03/23,1250,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844242,'Spider-Grandma' spotted gardening on Taipei ledge,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A photo posted over the weekend showing an elderly woman precariously perched on a fifth floor tin roof of a dilapidated apartment building while tending to her garden in Taipei has gone viral.On Sunday (March 19), a member of the Facebook group Streets Observation Academy posted the image and wrote, ""Grandma is so good at playing hide and seek. The sun has almost already set, and she still has not been found yet. All she can do now is plant flowers while she's at it.""What frightened many netizens was that ""Spider-Grandma,"" as some dubbed her, had somehow climbed over a concrete wall first before stepping onto the flimsy, downward-sloping roof while wearing pink plastic slippers. All with nothing to stop her from plummeting five stories below if she lost her footing.One Facebook user posted a video showing the Monkey King floating on a cloud and whisking her away.According to TVBS News, the apartment is located in the high-end Tianmu neighborhood of Taipei City's Shilin District. In response to the uproar over her exploits, the septuagenarian told the news site that after retiring, she started to grow vegetables on an awning outside her top floor balcony, which is part of an illegal addition.The woman was cited by FTV News as saying that some of the leaves had turned yellow, and she was simply removing them. She said the wall was ""not very high"" and so she did not think it was very dangerous.The news station interviewed a member of the community who pointed out that there are no safety measures in place on the awning and if she slipped she would fall approximately 15 to 20 meters.Netizens were not reassured by her explanation:""Don't do that, it's scary!""""This is very dangerous. I advise her not to play like this.""""Putting your life on the line to grow vegetables.""""Is it necessary to risk your life like this?'""Grandma in Spider-Man incarnate?""Woman tends to her garden while sitting on roof.

The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8%, reaching revenue of around USD 10.5 billion by the end of 2028. The significant growth of the Global Industrial Enzymes market can be attributed to the increasing shift towards renewable sources of energy and biofuel that are environment-friendly, expanding food and beverage industry, rapid technological innovation, and increasing usage of enzymes in industries to control process time, lower the activation energy of a reaction, increase shelf-life, enrich the flavor of food, increase the reaction rate, and reduce the use of food additives. These factors increase the demand for Industrial Enzymes worldwide, impacting the growth of the Global Industrial Enzymes Market during the forecast period.”Furthermore, Global Industrial Enzymes market is one of the most booming markets that grow continuously owing to the fast advantages and integration of new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and others. However, some factors like safety issues, handling factor associated with enzymes, and greater sensitivity to temperature and pH are the major restraining factors for the growth of the market. Enzymes can be contaminated by a small increase in temperature due to their highly-temperature sensitive nature which affects negatively the chemical reaction of enzymes in food and beverages. Moreover, industrial Enzymes are considered a sustainable alternative to harsh chemicals, resulting in driving the growth of the Global Industrial Enzymes Market during the forecast period. The demand for Industrial Enzymes in baking, brewing, fermented products, leather processing, and home cleaning products in general, is gaining huge popularity among consumers across the globe.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844296,Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market Dynamics and Emerging Trends for the Forecast Period 2023-2031,"Report Ocean, a leading market research firm, has recently released a comprehensive analysis of the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market. The report assesses various aspects of the market, including business solutions and studies, advancements, applications, advantages, benefits, breadth, and operations.According to the report, the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market was worth USD 940.6 million in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.8%, earning revenues of around USD 1689.3 million by the end of 2028. The market is flourishing due to the increasing chronic conditions in pets, rising pet ownership, and growing spending on pets to ensure a healthy and happy life.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR310The growing pet ownership in the Asia-Pacific region is a major driver of the market growth. The majority of pets are becoming family members for their owners, causing them to spend more money on yearly checkups due to the growing problems caused by cross-breed pets. Moreover, several pet insurance policies include an optional wellness package that includes savings for routine items such as an annual physical checkup, heartworm tests, fecal tests, annual parasite evaluation tests, blood work, and vaccines.The report also highlights the benefits of having pet insurance, including the peace of mind that comes with knowing that unexpected veterinary expenses will be covered. Moreover, the report discusses the various applications of pet insurance, including coverage for accidents, illnesses, wellness, and routine care.Overall, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market and its potential for growth. With the increasing pet ownership in the region and the growing importance of pets as family members, the market is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace in the coming years.Increasing Chronic Conditions in Pets are driving Pet Insurance MarketThe prevalence of chronic diseases in pets has increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the increase in the prevalence of various chronic conditions in pet animals is the primary factor driving growth in the chronic condition segment. Canine cancer cases more than doubled between 2006-07 and 2016-17, according to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI). Along with the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in pets, the growing number of pet owners seeking pet insurance is a major factor driving the Asia Pacific pet insurance market. For instance, it was discovered that whereas there were just 5,000 pet insurance clients in China between 2015 and 2018, there are today 1,60,000 pet insurance clients in the nation, according to a 2019 article headlined “China’s pet insurance business sees promising future.”Surging Demand for Financial Security as Uncertainty GrowsThe demand for quality veterinary accidents only is increasing as the number of pets increases, driving up the cost of veterinary accidents. As a result, the demand for pet insurance is increasing. Furthermore, the policy includes coverage for blood tests, urinalysis, x-rays, MRIs, labwork, CT scans, and ultrasounds, as well as outpatient, specialty, and emergency care procedures, as well as hospitalization and surgery. Furthermore, as medical costs rise, pet owners can obtain an extended accident and illness package that goes beyond the initial coverage of accidental road accidents and poisonings, as well as a variety of illnesses. In addition, in response to changing customer demand, pet insurance companies are offering customized policies such as multi-pet insurance and many others. They concentrate on packages based on pet lifetime and incident. Furthermore, as the number of pet owners grows, many insurers are introducing new pet insurance, which is driving the market growth.Get a Request Sample Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR310RestraintsAPAC has Lax Pet Safety RegulationsDuring the forecast period, the pet insurance market will face challenges due to low adoption in developing countries. APAC countries such as India, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines do not have such stringent pet safety regulations. These countries’ governments are primarily concerned with the safety of endangered species. This disregard for pet safety discourages pet owners from keeping pets or purchasing pet insurance. This results in restraining the growth of the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market.Segmental CoverageThe market for Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance by Policy CoverageThe Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market is divided into four categories based on policy coverage: accident only, accident and illness, chronic conditions only, and others. The Accident & Illness segment has the largest market share of these. The accident and illness policy, among other things, covers treatments for poisoning, allergies, urinary tract infections, surgeries, hospitalizations, and broken bones. As a result, the comprehensiveness of such policies is a critical growth factor that attracts a large number of pet owners. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer will drive segment growth. During the forecast period, all of these factors contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market (2022-2028).Segment-BY ANIMAL (DOG, CAT, AND OTHER),BY POLICY COVERAGE (ACCIDENT ONLY, ACCIDENT & ILLNESS, CHRONIC CONDITIONS ONLY, AND OTHER),BY PROVIDER (PUBLIC AND PRIVATE),BY COUNTRY (CHINA, INDIA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, REST OF ASIA PACIFIC)Impact of COVID-19 on Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance MarketThe pet insurance market has grown significantly over the last few years, but it is expected to suddenly fall in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bulk of diagnostic and veterinary facilities was shut down as a result of lockdown measures taken by various governments, which is to blame for this. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the economy, growth, and overall physical and mental health of all people. Several pet-related businesses provide exceptional care for animals during pandemics. With the occurrence of health issues, insurance firms are attempting to innovate and adjust policy coverage and policies. Businesses are concentrating on offering pet owners solutions and raising knowledge of the expense reimbursement programmers that exist in the market.Competitive LandscapeThe leading market players in the Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market Anicom Holdings, Agria, Pet Insurance Australia, Rakuten, Ipet Insurance, More Than, Trupanion, Petplan, ASPCA, and others. The Asia-Pacific Pet Insurance Market is highly fragmented with the presence of several manufacturing companies in the country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844302,Organic Personal Care Products Market Trends and Innovations for the Period 2023-2031″,"Report Ocean, a leading market research firm, has recently released a comprehensive analysis of the Organic Personal Care Products market. The report assesses various aspects of the market, including business solutions and studies, advancements, applications, advantages, benefits, breadth, and operations.According to the report, the Global Organic Personal Care Products market was worth USD 21.45 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.8%, crossing USD 41.03 billion by the end of 2028. The market is flourishing due to changing consumer behavior, rising purchasing power in developing nations, and increasing demand for sustainable and biobased skincare products globally.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR309The growing popularity of organic cosmetics is a major driver of the market growth. Compared to chemically produced skincare products, organic skincare products are less likely to cause allergic reactions, inflammation, and irritation on the skin. Moreover, the market for organic personal care products is predicted to grow as skincare product sales rise and the availability of natural ingredients improves.The report also highlights the benefits of using organic personal care products, including the use of natural and biobased ingredients that are better for both the skin and the environment. Moreover, the report discusses the various applications of organic personal care products, including anti-aging, anti-acne, and sun protection.Overall, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Global Organic Personal Care Products market and its potential for growth. With the increasing demand for sustainable and biobased skincare products, coupled with changing consumer preferences and rising purchasing power in developing nations, the market is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace in the coming years.Furthermore, the rising demand for fairness products among the younger population in countries such as India, South Africa, Nigeria, Cameroon, and China offers lucrative growth opportunities for the market. However, Organic skincare products are quite more expensive than non-organic skincare products. Also, there are some fake organic personal care products available at cheaper rates, which can cause skin infections. This, in turn, may act as a huge restraining factor for market growth.Changing Consumer Behaviour and Rising Purchasing Power in Developing NationsIncreasing urbanization, the number of working women, changing lifestyles, and rising hygiene and skin care awareness are some of the major factors driving the market for personal care ingredients. The need for personal care products has increased along with awareness of hygiene and personal health. The demand for ingredients for personal care products has increased as a result of the increased production of skin care and hair care products. Most developing nations, particularly China, Brazil, and India, have seen a significant change in consumer lifestyle. Rising income and purchasing power support the development. These elements have raised the need for components in personal care products in these nations. Health, hygiene, and beauty-related awareness has been growing over time. For instance, high-end skin and hair care products that were previously only utilized in cities are now quickly gaining traction in India and China’s rural areas. The cosmetics and personal care business is being driven by this change in consumption habits.Get a Request Sample Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR309Demand for Sustainable and Biobased Goods is Increasing GloballyPetrochemicals used to make personal care compounds cause carbon emissions and dangerous byproducts. As a result, many forms of environmentally friendly and non-hazardous ingredients are being produced. As a result, enzymes that can create bio-based solutions have been produced. Bio-based goods are capable of being developed to satisfy a variety of customer requests in addition to having fewer carbon footprints. Outstanding cleaning and wetting qualities, as well as multipurpose capabilities, are only a few of the improved properties. The creation of novel products as a result of rising consumer awareness of biodegradable goods is anticipated to lead to market expansion potential.Challenge: Slow Results of Organic Personal Care ProductsThe same as any other product, organic cosmetics have drawbacks. Its slowness to act is its first drawback. Organic cosmetics do indeed take longer to work than conventional ones. Additionally, allergic responses might be brought on by some natural items. The organic substance must next be tested on a tiny area of skin before being applied more broadly. Essential oils that trigger skin responses are typically to blame for this reaction. Organic cosmetics frequently have a “monotonic” scent because they don’t include chemicals.Segmental CoverageGlobal Organic Personal Care Products Market – By RegionGeographically, the Global Organic Personal Care Products Market is segmented into North America, Europe, The Asia Pacific, Latin America, The Middle East, and Africa. Among these, North America holds the largest market share for organic personal care and cosmetic goods worldwide. Due to the high level of health consciousness among consumers in the United States, organic personal care and cosmetics products have long been well-liked. Moreover, Asia-Pacific is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period (2022-2028). The personal care products market in Asia-Pacific has enormous potential. Due to consumers’ growing preference for goods that are scientifically confirmed to be organic and include natural ingredients, the market experienced significant demand. The demand for organic personal care products in the area is being driven by an aging population, rising disposable income, and an increase in the number of women in the workforce. The largest market for organic personal care goods is China. Over the past few years, it has been growing quickly. The Asia-Pacific market is being driven by rapidly shifting lifestyles and rising awareness of beauty and wellness.BY PRODUCT TYPE (HAIR CARE, SKIN CARE, LIP CARE, ORAL CARE, MENS GROOMING),BY CUSTOMER (MEN AND WOMEN),BY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL (HYPERMARKET, E-COMMERCE, RETAIL STORES, HEALTH AND BEAUTY STORE, DIRECT SELLING, CONVENIENCE STORE, DEPARTMENTAL STORE, AND OTHERS),BY REGION (NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, THE ASIA PACIFIC, LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA)Impact of COVID-19 on Global Organic Personal Care Products MarketThe coronavirus outbreak has had an impact on the personal care industry, particularly the market for personal care ingredients. The decline is primarily the result of countries imposing a lockdown to adhere to social distancing norms. Industry disruption is also being exacerbated by the global economic slowdown. Manufacturing facility closures have harmed the organic personal care products market. The pandemic has reduced consumer spending on necessities. It has also had an impact on consumer consumption patterns. As a result, there is a global demand-supply mismatch for personal care ingredients. COVID-19 has resulted in significant reductions in personal care market discretionary expenses such as fragrances, hair styling products, and make-up.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:-  https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR309Competitive LandscapeThe leading market players in the Global Organic Personal Care Products Market are The Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Weleda AG, Loreal SA, Burts Bees, Arbonne International, LLC, KORRES S.A, Avon Products, Inc, Bare Essentials Beauty, Coty Inc., AVEENO, and other prominent players.

The report was prepared by subject matter experts, researchers, and market research professionals to ensure that the information is compiled from authentic sources and the forecast is highly accurate. The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth.

There will be a Worldwide Market Shift, with North America in the Forefront










Geographically, the worldwide osteoporosis medications market is broken down into the following regions: North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. In 2018, the market for pharmaceuticals to treat osteoporosis was dominated by North America due to the region’s higher prevalence of the disease, the rapid approval of new therapies to treat the condition, and the high rate at which the disease is diagnosed. Osteoporosis and decreased bone mass, for example, are currently anticipated to represent a major public health issue for almost 44 million U.S. women and men aged 50 and older, according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation.
Spreading Osteoporosis to Accelerate Market Development
According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, osteoporosis of the hip affects over 10 million Americans aged 50 and up. Demand for osteoporosis treatment in the North American osteoporosis treatment market is predicted to rise due to the rising incidence of the condition, which causes bone deformation and fragility. The expansion of the North American osteoporosis treatment market is predicted to be aided by the increasing number of unique therapeutic solutions approved by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration for the treatment of osteoporosis. Increase in both the global geriatric population and the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles also contribute to the expansion of the osteoporosis medications market.
Drugs for Osteoporosis have Undesirable Side Effects, which can restrict the Market Growth
Significant advances in the treatment of the condition and the introduction of breakthrough medicines have been made, but their widespread implementation is hampered by a number of issues. The risks and adverse effects of osteoporosis treatment are one of them. Symptoms such as hot flashes, nausea, vomiting, and cramping in the legs slow the market. Further limiting the market’s expansion are the high prices of treatment and the restricted nature of reimbursement policies. In addition, the advent of new therapies for osteoporosis management by competing market players is expected to slow the market in the coming years.

The increasing use of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cloud computing is also contributing to market growth.

UAE’s Growing Construction Industry is Fueling Market Growth










Since 2013, the UAE Government has made large investments in the nation’s commercial infrastructure development to get the country ready for the eagerly anticipated Dubai Expo 2020. After the Expo, various commercial developments are being planned by both private and public investors in anticipation of significant foreign investments. Office space supply is accelerating in the commercial centers of the UAE to draw multinational corporations to establish offices there, creating opportunities for players in the commercial interior fit-out market to make the interiors employee- and employee-friendly. Additionally, a large ex-pat community and the UAE’s ambition to encourage travel and tourism in the nation have drawn many worldwide brands to establish retail stores there, which has increased the demand for commercial interior fit-out professionals in the nation.
Growing Preference for a Sustainable and Intelligent Built Environment
The younger generation in the UAE, which makes up a sizable portion of the population, is becoming more dependent on technology. Additionally, a healthier constructed environment has become crucial, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals spend more time indoors than outdoors. As a result, the idea of smart and sustainable buildings is spreading throughout the nation’s business sectors. In addition, the UAE government and the local governing bodies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have developed and are enforcing green building laws, supporting the UAE’s ambition to reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by 2030. As a result, a wealth of opportunities in green building design and appropriate installations are set to emerge for UAE Commercial Interior Fit Out Professionals.
Challenge: Shortages of Skilled Workers
Labor shortages in the design services sector were exacerbated by high rivalry among design services firms and a lack of adequately skilled staff. For example, as new technologies and standards entered the market, designers needed to upgrade their skill sets in terms of smartphones, tablets, and other IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Similarly, some interior designers and industrial design experts lacked the most up-to-date skill sets, resulting in fierce competition among interior design and industrial design firms for employees with the most up-to-date talents.

Website: https://www.reportocean.comThe UAE Commercial Interior Fit Out Market was worth USD 1.47 billion in 2021, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach around USD 2.51 billion by the end of 2028, according to a recent study by strategic consulting and market research firm Report Ocean. The market is growing due to the high growth of the commercial sector in the UAE, with the country being a popular tourist destination and investing heavily in infrastructure development, including luxurious hotels, restaurants, and workplaces. The increasing use of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cloud computing is also contributing to market growth. However, skilled labor shortages, counterfeit designs, and easy access to free internet tools and blogs may act as a restraining factor for the market’s growth.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR303UAE’s Growing Construction Industry is Fueling Market GrowthSince 2013, the UAE Government has made large investments in the nation’s commercial infrastructure development to get the country ready for the eagerly anticipated Dubai Expo 2020. After the Expo, various commercial developments are being planned by both private and public investors in anticipation of significant foreign investments. Office space supply is accelerating in the commercial centers of the UAE to draw multinational corporations to establish offices there, creating opportunities for players in the commercial interior fit-out market to make the interiors employee- and employee-friendly. Additionally, a large ex-pat community and the UAE’s ambition to encourage travel and tourism in the nation have drawn many worldwide brands to establish retail stores there, which has increased the demand for commercial interior fit-out professionals in the nation.Growing Preference for a Sustainable and Intelligent Built EnvironmentThe younger generation in the UAE, which makes up a sizable portion of the population, is becoming more dependent on technology. Additionally, a healthier constructed environment has become crucial, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals spend more time indoors than outdoors. As a result, the idea of smart and sustainable buildings is spreading throughout the nation’s business sectors. In addition, the UAE government and the local governing bodies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have developed and are enforcing green building laws, supporting the UAE’s ambition to reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by 2030. As a result, a wealth of opportunities in green building design and appropriate installations are set to emerge for UAE Commercial Interior Fit Out Professionals.Challenge: Shortages of Skilled WorkersLabor shortages in the design services sector were exacerbated by high rivalry among design services firms and a lack of adequately skilled staff. For example, as new technologies and standards entered the market, designers needed to upgrade their skill sets in terms of smartphones, tablets, and other IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Similarly, some interior designers and industrial design experts lacked the most up-to-date skill sets, resulting in fierce competition among interior design and industrial design firms for employees with the most up-to-date talents.Get a Request Sample Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR303Segmental CoverageUAE Commercial Interior Fit Out Market – By OwnershipBased on the ownership, the UAE Commercial Interior Fit Out Market is segmented into Self-Owned, Rented, Hospitality, Commercial, Retail, Education, Healthcare, and Others.

Owners of any residential, commercial, or industrial property desire to invest heavily in upgrading and remodeling the structure to keep it in good condition. Furthermore, by utilizing interior fit-out services, the interior of any living area becomes more visually appealing, making the selling or renting process easier for the owners of that space.Segment-BY OWNERSHIP (SELF-OWNED, RENTED, HOSPITALITY, COMMERCIAL, RETAIL, EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, OTHERS),BY APPLICATION (RESIDENTIAL, HOSPITALITY, COMMERCIAL, RETAIL, EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AND OTHERS)Impact of COVID-19 on UAE Commercial Interior Fit Out MarketThe COVID-19 breakout has changed the rules of the game for most firms, including the interior design industry.

The market is growing at a CAGR of 4.6%Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS362The UK medical compression garments market is experiencing unprecedented growth. This is being driven by a number of factors, including an aging population, the rise in obesity rates, and increasing awareness of the benefits of compression garments. British patients are increasingly turning to medical compression garments to help with a range of conditions, from swelling and bruising after surgery to chronic venous insufficiency.The aging population is the largest driver of demand for medical compression garments market. As people age, they are more likely to develop chronic conditions that can benefit from compression therapy. These include venous insufficiency, lymphedema, and arthritis. Additionally, older adults are more likely to be sedentary, which can also lead to increased swelling and discomfort.
Obesity is another major driver of demand for medical compression garments. Obesity rates have been rising steadily in the UK for decades, and now affect over 40% of the population. Obese individuals are at greater risk for developing chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, which can cause swelling and pain. Additionally, obese individuals often have difficulty finding clothing that fits properly, making compression garments an attractive option.Finally, awareness of the benefits of compression therapy has grown in recent years. More people are aware that compression garment can help improve circulation, reduce swelling, and relieve pain. As a result, more people are seeking out these products for both medical and non-medical purposes.
As the UK medical compression garments market grows, we expect to see more innovation in product design and development, as manufacturers try to meet the needs of consumers. We also expect to see a continued shift towards online retailing, as patients seek out greater convenience and choice when purchasing their products.Market Dynamics
Drivers
? Our analysis shows that the main drivers of this growth are an ageing population and an increase in obesity rates. As people age, they are more likely to experience conditions such as venous insufficiency, which can lead to swelling and pain in the legs. Meanwhile, obesity rates have been increasing steadily in recent years, and this is also driving demand for compression garments as obese individuals are more likely to suffer from lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling due to accumulation of lymph fluid.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS362? Increase in awareness of venous conditions and treatments has resulted in more patients seeking out information and solutions to their condition. This has led to an increase in procedures being carried out, which has subsequently driven up demand for compression garments both pre- and post-procedure.
Restraints
? The competitive landscape in the UK medical compression garments market is relatively fragmented, with a large number of small players accounting for a significant share of the market. This makes it difficult for any one player to gain a significant foothold and differentiate their products from the competition.
? Lack of awareness of the benefits of compression garments amongst both medical professionals and the general public. This is likely to be a significant barrier to uptake, as compression garments can only provide benefits if they are correctly prescribed and fitted.
? There is a lack of reliable data on the efficacy of compression garments in treating specific conditions. This makes it difficult for clinicians to justify prescribing them to patients, and means that insurance companies are unlikely to reimburse for their use.Segmental Analysis
By ProductBy product, the UK medical compression garments market is dominated by upper compression garments. The segment is projected to offer a growth opportunity of $35 million during the forecast period.
Our analysis show that upper compression garments are most commonly used for sports or medical purposes. Sports compression garments are typically worn during exercise to improve performance and reduce fatigue. Medical compression garments are often prescribed by doctors to treat conditions such as lymphedema or venous insufficiency. The price of upper compression garments can vary widely, depending on the brand, materials used, and features offered. In general, simpler designs tend to be less expensive than more complicated ones.
There are good growth prospects for both online and offline retailers of upper compression garments in the UK. Online sales are growing rapidly, although offline sales still dominate the market.

Generic compression garments are also widely available and these can be an effective alternative for some consumers.By ApplicationBy application, the varicose vein segment is expected to generate a revenue of over $70 million during forecast period. It is also expected to lead the UK medical compression garments market.

The garments are available in a variety of styles, including socks, stockings, and leggings. They can be worn during the day or night, and they can be removed when necessary.
People with varicose veins often experience symptoms such as pain, heaviness, fatigue, itching, and cramping.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844332,"India Mutual Fund Industry Market Analysis, Revenue, Price, Growth Rate, Forecast To 2031","It seems like the India Mutual Fund Industry Market is poised for significant growth, with a projected CAGR of 22.5% until 2028. This growth is attributed to several factors, including the rising investments in mutual funds, increasing digital penetration, smart cities, faster data speeds, and government support. The economic growth, an increase in the middle-income population, and financial savings are also driving the market. Moreover, the report suggests that regulatory and government activities aimed at increasing financial literacy among the general public would contribute to higher mutual fund penetration. Despite the positive outlook, high expenditure ratios and sales charges, as well as the volatile nature of the capital markets, may limit the market’s expansion.

Growing Investments in Mutual Funds










The growing focus on domestic savings, the rise in disposable income, and the mobilization and allocation of the income toward advantageous assets are some factors contributing to the expansion of investments in mutual funds. It also makes it possible for national small- and large-fund savers to participate in investment plans and gain from the expansion of the capital market. The massive expansion and standardization of the mutual fund industry’s products and services, the spread of a sizeable number of private sector funds, and regulatory frameworks all contributed to the market growth. As a result, the India Mutual Fund Industry Market is predicted to develop at a significant rate during the forecast period (2022-2028).
Growing Government Initiatives and Support for Mutual Fund Assets
It is anticipated that numerous governments, regulatory bodies, and other authorities would strengthen and develop their current mutual fund industries. Additionally, regulatory bodies keep looking for ways to work with e-wallets, e-commerce distribution, and other comparable platforms to increase market penetration and expansion. Moreover, governments in some regions actively encourage and engage with distributors of mutual funds. As a result, by enhancing the quality and depth of the relationship with channel partners, this component is spurring revenue development for mutual fund providers. Furthermore, it is anticipated that in the upcoming years, sophisticated mutual fund initiatives and increased government assistance would present appealing prospects to the industry.
Fluctuating Returns
Because mutual funds do not provide fixed guaranteed returns, people need to be prepared for any scenario, including a decline in the value of their mutual fund. To put it another way, mutual funds are subject to a wide range of price changes. Professional fund management by a team of specialists does not protect from poor fund performance. Moreover, fund managers oversee all forms of mutual funds. A team of analysts may assist the fund management in various circumstances. As a result, as an investor, there is no influence over investment. The fund manager makes all significant decisions regarding a consumers fund. However, the consumer can look at certain crucial factors including disclosure requirements, corpus, and an asset management company’s overall investing plan (AMC). All these factors hinder the growth of the India Mutual Fund Industry Market.

Microfinance Industry Adoption of Cutting-Edge Technology










Market expansion is supported by the rising use of digital technology in the microfinance industry to give people additional channels and boost their revenue potential. Additionally, improved connections in underdeveloped areas and technological advancements in some fields are projected to present the lucrative potential for market expansion. Additionally, the microfinance sector has a high penetration of modern technologies in emerging markets, including POS, ATMs, mobile banking, and others, which presents prospects for the business in the future. For example, the Indian government has developed several financial assistance programs for current and future MSMEs. These programs are designed to give aspirant MSMEs financial support so they can establish themselves and/or reach their full potential.
Change from Traditional Lending to Microfinance
Because of the surge in smartphone and internet user penetration across the country, online finance has witnessed significant growth in recent years. Microfinance is regarded as one of the practical and often used solutions for lenders because it provides quick affordability for applications. In recent years, many firms and individuals have begun to submit online loan applications rather than going through traditional lending procedures. According to a report by industry group MFIN and KPMG, the microfinance sector has been able to quickly convert to a more efficient digital model to cover a larger population at a lower cost. Additionally, the ease with which borrowers can apply for loans is driving market expansion, as are numerous advantages for lenders like automated loan administration and quick approval.
Challenge: Excessive Interest on Small Amounts
The high-interest rates that microfinance organizations and microlenders charge for a variety of different loan sizes are the key barrier preventing the market’s expansion. A short repayment time and high fees are also outcomes of microfinance’s primary focus on increasing revenue. Microfinance institutions are forced to charge high-interest rates and have brief repayment terms as a result of their significant borrowing from banks and other institutions, which limits the market’s growth. Additionally, many microfinance institutions across the country must use private equity to raise capital because traditional microfinance banks are allowed to collect deposits as a means of funding loans that harm market growth. Additionally, the expansion of the microfinance sector is being hampered by stricter government regulations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844338,"Viscosupplementation Market Size, Future Demands, Share, Key Players, Growth and Forecast 2031","It seems that Report Ocean has published a market research report on the Viscosupplementation industry, covering over 150 countries and analyzing more than 1,00000 published and forthcoming reports every year. The report was prepared by subject matter experts, researchers, and market research professionals to ensure that the information is compiled from authentic sources and the forecast is highly accurate. The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth. The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the Viscosupplementation industry.The global viscosupplementation market held a market value of USD 4,041 million in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 8,958.9 million by the year 2030. The market is projected to list a CAGR of 9.2% during the forecast period.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS349Some of the reasons anticipated to propel the market include the rising need for non-surgical treatments for osteoarthritis, the prevalence of illnesses brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, and improvements in the creation of hyaluronic acid-based therapies. The market-available viscosupplements have been clinically demonstrated to be the most efficient treatment for knee osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic cause of disability and is a painful degenerative joint condition. The condition typically begins after the age of 30, and after 10 years of diagnosis, it may grow to become a disability.Growth Influencers:Surging geriatric populations and prevalence of Osteoarthritis will drive the growth of the market
The rising geriatric population is driving the market growth. According to projections made by the WHO, the number of people 65 and older in the world is expected to climb from 7% in 2000 to 16% in 2050, which will subsequently cause an increase in the prevalence of obesity and osteoarthritis. Thus, it is anticipated that over the projection period, the demand for the product would develop significantly due to the global expansion in the target population and the growing preference for alternate treatment alternatives for corticosteroids for the management of joint pain. Combination Therapy of Gel Injection and Knee Bracing Benefit Moderate-grade Knee Arthritis Patients Hyaluronic acid is the active component in knee arthritis gel injections. Our bodies naturally manufacture hyaluronic acid. It is an essential part of the synovial fluid that lubricates many of our joints. Over time, the quality of hyaluronic acid in knees with osteoarthritis declines. Synovial fluid’s consistency is affected by low-quality hyaluronic acid, which lessens the fluid’s capacity for lubrication and shock absorption. Greater lubrication is the main advantage of hyaluronic acid injections into joints. There are, however, a number of additional ways in which it might enhance joint performance. An antioxidant, hyaluronic acid, has the ability to prevent the buildup of dangerous compounds in the knee joint. The capacity of the knee joint to repair cartilage may be enhanced by hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid may lessen joint inflammation, easing arthritis-related stiffness and pain.
Healthcare Infrastructure growth Installed base and rise in demand for the treatment procedures.
In the U.K. and France, osteoporosis affects more than 2.5 million women annually. Following a decision by the Haute Autorit? de Sant? (HAS), the Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie will pay 70% of the cost of the scan (CPAM). Additionally, the Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie has been advised to reimburse BONVIVA, a medication used to strengthen bones and given in the U.K., at a rate of 65%, according to Haute Autorit? de Sant? (HAS), the health authority (CPAM). The market is being driven by increasing consumer preference for quick turnaround times even if they are expensive and rising rates of target diseases like osteoarthritis.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS349Segments Overview:The global viscosupplementation market is segmented into product type, application, material type, packaging type, and end user.

Rising Customers’ Loyalty due to Digital Insurance Platforms










Digital insurance solutions provide deeper, more meaningful connections with customers across channels, provide personalized experiences, and, most crucially, accelerate online claim processing. Acquiring a new customer in the insurance market is frequently five times more expensive than converting an existing one. Furthermore, clients who are satisfied with the insurance options are 80% more likely to renew their coverage than those who are not. Applying for and renewing a policy online can be straightforward, quick, and available around the clock for insurance buyers. As a result, the ability of these platforms to develop customer loyalty is further supporting the growth of the digital insurance platform business.
Ongoing Digital Transformation
Due to expanding digitization, increased adoption of Internet of Things technology, and insurance companies shifting from product-based to customer-centric business models, the industry is predicted to experience significant growth. To provide a better customer experience while streamlining corporate operations, insurance companies that serve various industrial verticals are investing more and more in digital solutions. Digital insurance alternatives assist businesses in using business analytics to both boost consumer interaction and make informed judgments. The use of digital insurance platforms is predicted to increase as a result of the insurance industry’s ongoing digital transformation. Through a single centralized structure, these platforms assist insurance companies in communicating to address various difficulties. The platform enables the insurance industry to transition from analog to digital operations, making the insurance ecosystem more customer-focused. This results in offering lucrative opportunities for the China Online Insurance Market during the forecast period (2022-2028).
Challenge: Privacy and Security Concerns
Data and payment security are critical factors when digitizing insurance. As digital interventions become more ubiquitous, identity theft and hacking may become increasingly common. When an insurance company implements digital insurance platforms, it must ensure that background checks are complete, claims are genuine, and its online infrastructure is well-protected against uninvited attacks. While the digital insurance platform market offers benefits to consumers, it also raises potential risks. Consumers, for example, must have confidence that the information provided by digital platforms is beneficial to them. Search results, rankings, and other information generated by these systems may not necessarily reflect specific user preferences due to simplicity and biased information. Furthermore, concerns about privacy invasion, fairness, and prejudice are raised by the massive amounts of personal data those online platforms use. This is the main problem preventing market expansion as a result.

Website: https://www.reportocean.comReport Ocean has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the China Online Insurance Market, revealing that the market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 12.6% by the end of 2028. This growth is being fueled by changing customer demands and the need for appealing, uncomplicated products that offer an omnichannel experience. The digital insurance platform industry is rising as a result of insurers’ ability to provide personalized insurance products, precise underwriting, and customized experiences through various channels. The market is also being driven by the fast integration of new technologies such as IoT, AI, and cloud computing. However, digital transformation takes time, and issues with privacy and security may slow down the market’s growth. Overall, the China Online Insurance Market is an emerging market with immense growth potential.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR528Rising Customers’ Loyalty due to Digital Insurance PlatformsDigital insurance solutions provide deeper, more meaningful connections with customers across channels, provide personalized experiences, and, most crucially, accelerate online claim processing. Acquiring a new customer in the insurance market is frequently five times more expensive than converting an existing one. Furthermore, clients who are satisfied with the insurance options are 80% more likely to renew their coverage than those who are not. Applying for and renewing a policy online can be straightforward, quick, and available around the clock for insurance buyers. As a result, the ability of these platforms to develop customer loyalty is further supporting the growth of the digital insurance platform business.Ongoing Digital TransformationDue to expanding digitization, increased adoption of Internet of Things technology, and insurance companies shifting from product-based to customer-centric business models, the industry is predicted to experience significant growth. To provide a better customer experience while streamlining corporate operations, insurance companies that serve various industrial verticals are investing more and more in digital solutions. Digital insurance alternatives assist businesses in using business analytics to both boost consumer interaction and make informed judgments. The use of digital insurance platforms is predicted to increase as a result of the insurance industry’s ongoing digital transformation. Through a single centralized structure, these platforms assist insurance companies in communicating to address various difficulties. The platform enables the insurance industry to transition from analog to digital operations, making the insurance ecosystem more customer-focused. This results in offering lucrative opportunities for the China Online Insurance Market during the forecast period (2022-2028).Challenge: Privacy and Security ConcernsData and payment security are critical factors when digitizing insurance. As digital interventions become more ubiquitous, identity theft and hacking may become increasingly common. When an insurance company implements digital insurance platforms, it must ensure that background checks are complete, claims are genuine, and its online infrastructure is well-protected against uninvited attacks. While the digital insurance platform market offers benefits to consumers, it also raises potential risks. Consumers, for example, must have confidence that the information provided by digital platforms is beneficial to them. Search results, rankings, and other information generated by these systems may not necessarily reflect specific user preferences due to simplicity and biased information. Furthermore, concerns about privacy invasion, fairness, and prejudice are raised by the massive amounts of personal data those online platforms use. This is the main problem preventing market expansion as a result.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR528Segmental CoverageChina Online Insurance Market – By TypeThe China Online Insurance Market is divided into categories based on type, including Life Insurance, Non-Life Insurance, Health Insurance, Accident Insurance, Air Travel Insurance, Dental Insurance, and Others.

You are not going to get many better looks than that. It is not every day you get two breakaways back to back like that.“Getting 60, a lot of great players in the past have done it and it feels good to join that list.”Ryan Nugent-Hopkins also had a pair of goals, and Leon Draisaitl assisted on all four of the Oilers’ scores.“He obviously missed the first one and he was telling me he slammed his stick against the boards after,” Draisaitl said of McDavid’s overtime goal. “I just saw their guy bobble it, so I tried to strip him and I saw Connor again. It is crazy to try that same move again and score on it the second time. But that is just what he does, I guess.Stuart Skinner made 14 saves for Edmonton, which has won five straight games and nine of its last 11.Clayton Keller scored twice and J.J. Moser also scored for the Coyotes, who have lost two in a row following a four-game winning streak. Ingram stopped 27 shots.“I think we had some good urgency,” Keller said. “It was a tough back-to-back for us, but I think we did a good job. We were a little sloppy at the start and we didn’t want to put them on the power play and it was good for us to kind of just stick with it and play a mucky game and get a point out of it.”McDavid extended his points streak at home to 16 games with his first goal of the game on the power play 5:47 into the opening period. McDavid took it behind the goal line and banked it in off Ingram’s head.Moser tied it with a power-play goal with 4:13 left in the first.Keller gave the Coyotes the lead 3:37 into the second period after a giveaway behind the Oilers’ net allowed Nick Schmaltz to send it in front, and Keller extended his points streak to 10 games with his 33rd goal.With just 10 seconds to play in the second, Nugent-Hopkins tied it on the power play.Arizona regained the lead 8:54 into the third when Barrett Hayton made a nice pass through traffic to get Keller a wide-open net and his second of the game.Just over three minutes later, Draisaitl made a long stretch pass to send Nugent-Hopkins in on a breakaway and he beat Ingram stick-side for his second of the game.NOTES: Out with injuries for the Coyotes were Josh Brown (lower body) and Zack Kassian (upper body). ... Out for the Oilers were Ryan Murray (back), Ryan McLeod (upper body) and Devin Shore (undisclosed).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844369,"Japan, South Korea drop export claims against each other","TOKYO (AP) — Japan and South Korea almost simultaneously dropped their export claims against each other on Thursday in the latest sign of improving ties.Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that effective Thursday the country would lift export controls of three key semi-conductor-related materials imposed in 2019 against South Korea, while Seoul said it would drop its complaint with the World Trade Organization over the issue.The two sides agreed to the plan as part of their recent effort to improve ties and the announcement came a week after their leaders agreed to work past their troubled history and mend ties so they can better respond together to growing regional threats.The announcement came hours after South Korea's unification minister and senior Japanese government officials reaffirmed their close cooperation in response to North Korea's escalating missile threats at a rare meeting.Kwon Youngse is in Tokyo for talks with Japanese ministers and top governing party officials, becoming the first unification minister to do so in 18 years. His trip comes on the heels of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last week, when they agreed to resume regular visits and launch high-level talks on security, trade and other issues.Kwon and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi agreed that North Korea's repeated ballistic missile firings, which have occurred at an unprecedented pace, are a “serious and pressing threat to regional security and a clear and grave challenge to international society,” according to a Foreign Ministry statement.The two ministers confirmed their close cooperation in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, the ministry said.At the outset of the talks, Hayashi said last week's summit was “a great success” and praised Yoon's leadership toward improving bilateral relations. Hayashi also said he was “delighted to meet with Minister Kwon without delay.""Kwon, in response, said the process of improving ties has just begun and that he believes further efforts by the two governments can help bolster their healthy relations.He said North Korea's nuclear and human rights issues represent a problem not only for South Korea but also for the international community. He said it is also necessary for his country to strengthen ties with Japan to tackle those issues.South Korea and Japan have deep economic and cultural ties and are both key U.S. allies. But their relations have often faltered due to disputes stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.After long negotiations with Japan, the South Korean government earlier this month announced plans to use local funds to resolve a compensation dispute over wartime Korean forced labor, leading to the first full summit between the two countries’ leaders in 12 years.The latest row started in late 2018, spilling over to defense and trade ties between the two sides.In 2019, Japan's government tightened export controls on three materials to South Korea — fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride and resists — key materials used in the production of semiconductors. The two countries are also discussing restoring each other’s trade status.The South Korean trade ministry also said it plans to revise government export regulations to restore Japan’s status as a favored trade destination for the export of “strategic” materials that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.The South Korean ministry said it will continue to engage in broader talks with its Japanese counterparts to discuss both countries restoring their “white lists” of nations enjoying minimum trade restrictions, after Tokyo and Seoul downgraded each other’s trade status during the 2019 dispute.___Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844370,"Asian shares fall on banking turmoil, recession worries","BANGKOK (AP) — Shares fell Friday in Asia as worries over turmoil in the banking sector and recession risks overshadowed gains on Wall Street.Benchmarks declined in most major markets, while U.S. futures were higher. Oil prices fell.Investors are worried that more banks might suffer a debilitating exodus of customers following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. That turmoil is clouding the outlook for what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates after hiking them to market-rattling heights over the last year.The fear is that all the turmoil in the banking industry could cause a sharp pullback in lending to small and midsized businesses around the country. That could put more pressure on the economy, raising the risk for a recession that many economists already saw as likely.Regional banks shares in Asia were modestly lower Friday, with HSBC Holdings plc losing 3.4% in Hong Kong while mid-sized Japanese bank Resona Holdings declined 3%.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3% to 27,328.27 and the Kospi in Seoul gave up 0.7% to 2,406.92. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.2% to 20,007.19 and the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.5% to 3,268.89.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% lower to 6,952.80. Shares fell in Bangkok and Mumbai but rose in Taiwan.On Thursday, the S&P 500 added 0.3% for its third gain in four days, closing at 3,948.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2% to 32,105.25 after seeing an early gain of 481 points evaporate. The Nasdaq composite held up better thanks to strength in technology shares, gaining 1% to 11,787.40.Big technology and other high-growth stocks were among the strongest on Wall Street. Nvidia rose 2.7%, and Microsoft gained 2%.Stocks fell sharply the day before after the Federal Reserve indicated that while the end may be near for its hikes to interest rates, it still doesn’t expect to cut rates this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also insisted the Fed could keep raising rates if inflation stays high.Markets were also still mulling comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said the government is not considering blanket protections for all customers at all banks. She did say the government will make all depositors whole at banks, on a case-by-case basis, if failing to do so would pose a risk for the broader system.Implicit in that is perhaps the hint that any bank failure could be seen as such a systemic risk. Failures at both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank met that criteria. Depositors were promised all their money, even those with more than the $250,000 limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Stocks in the financial industry ended up being the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 despite rising in the morning. First Republic Bank fell 6% after giving up a gain of nearly 10%.The Fed’s Powell said such fears were part of the reason the central bank raised rates by only a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday instead of more. A pullback in lending could act almost like a rate hike on its own, he said.In markets abroad, stocks in London fell 0.9% after the Bank of England also raised its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Stocks were mixed elsewhere across Europe and Asia.On Wall Street, shares of Coinbase Global fell 14.1% after the cryptocurrency trading platform said it had been warned by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it could face charges of violating U.S. securities laws.In the U.S. bond market, which has been home to some of Wall Street’s wildest moves this month, yields fell.The yield on the two-year Treasury dropped to 3.81% from 3.97% late Wednesday. It was above 5% earlier this month.In other trading Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil slipped 15 cents to $69.81 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 94 cents to $69.96 per barrel.Brent crude, the pricing basis for international oil, lost 17 cents to $75.33 per barrel.The U.S. dollar fell to 130.25 yen from 130.83 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.0833.___AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844371,"Ramadan starts in Mideast amid high costs, hopes for peace","KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) — Hundreds of millions of Muslims began the first daily fast of Ramadan on Thursday, as parts of the Middle East approached crucial junctures in high-stakes peace negotiations during the holy month, traditionally a time of reconciliationIn Sudan, parties are wrangling over how the country will usher in a civilian government following 17 months of military rule. In Yemen, diplomats are pushing for a lasting truce, following the recent rapprochement between regional powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia which have been locked in a proxy war there for eight years.During Ramadan, observant Muslims abstain from food and water from dawn to dusk, before gathering with family and friends for indulgent nighttime meals. According to Islam, fasting draws the faithful closer to God and reminds them of the suffering of the poor.In Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, families prepare culinary delights weeks in advance to mark the break of the fast each evening, a meal known as iftar. For the feasts, Sudanese worshippers favor assida, a semolina-based flour dish, and a sugary fermented drink called, “sweet bitter” — both recipes that date back generations.“Those who can’t afford don’t have to pay,” said Fatima Mohammed Hamid, who sells food items from her small home on Tuti island on the Nile River, just north of Khartoum.In addition to fasting, charity giving is another of Islam’s five pillars. During Ramadan, mosques and charities regularly provide meals for the poor at long tables that sprawl out onto the street.Sudan has been steeped in political chaos since a coup ousted a Western-brokered power-sharing government in October 2021. There are hopes for a transitional government before the four weeks of Ramadan end, as promised by the country’s ruling military and other political forces earlier this week. However, many prominent Sudanese factions reject the move.Amid the uncertainty, most find common ground in complaining about the rising cost of living.“Everything costs double what it did last year,” said Hamid.At a meeting Egypt earlier this week, Israeli and Palestinian delegations pledged to lower tensions during the sensitive holiday season — Ramadan will coincide with the Jewish festival of Passover in April — but surging violence continues across the occupied West Bank. There are concerns about flare-ups with large numbers of Jewish and Muslim faithful expected to pour into Jerusalem’s Old City.From the Gaza Strip to Sudan and Tunisia to Yemen, soaring prices are proving a further concern for observant Muslims. Arab countries are continuing to suffer from the economic fallout of the war in Ukraine, with many reliant on grain imports from eastern Europe.At the once-bustling Bab al-Fellah market in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, rising costs have left shoppers unable to splurge on Ramadan delicacies as they might have in past years.“I have almost used up the 40 dinars (roughly $13) that my husband gave me and I bought only vegetables, a chicken and some spices,’’ said Fatima B., embarrassed to give her full name out of her financial desperation.In Pakistan, shoppers reported similar hardships, with inflation surging to nearly 40%. Many said they would consider breaking the daytime fast if free food were to be handed out.In war-torn Yemeni capital of Sanaa, prospects for Ramadan are bleaker still, with residents struggling to buy even basic supplies. The country’s ruinous civil war, now in its ninth year, has killed more than 150,000 people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.“I am not able to provide daily food for the children,” said Saleh al-Omrani, an unemployed resident from Sanaa. “We had Ramadan in the good old days, but today there is no longer Ramadan.”Diplomats and leaders had expressed new hope for peace efforts in the days leading up to Ramadan, amid signs of warming relations between two of the region’s rival superpowers, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The two are on opposing sides of the war in Yemen, and despite announcements of restoring ties, sporadic fighting continues across the country. Clashes in Yemen killed at least 16 people earlier this week.In Afghanistan, people are observing their second Ramadan under Taliban rule. Since the Taliban seized power in the country in August 2021, foreign aid stopped almost overnight and the economy collapsed, driving millions into poverty and hunger.In southern Turkey and northwestern Syria, the destruction caused by last month’s earthquake, which killed over 52,000 people, poses perhaps the steepest challenge of all.In the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras — near the quake's epicenter — worshipers held the first Ramadan prayers inside a 1,000-person tent on the grounds of the city’s famed Abdulhamid Han Mosque. Turkey’s fourth-largest mosque sustained slight damage in the temblor and has been closed to worshippers, Turkish media said.Some 1,400 mosques have been destroyed or damaged by the quake, Turkish authorities say, leaving tens of thousands to pray in makeshift tents. More than 100 sound systems have been installed to recite the call to prayer.In Syria's northwestern Idlib province — the last rebel enclave -- very few families still have the energy or resources to make the necessary preparations for Ramadan this year.Abdul Qahar Zakou, a cafe owner from, said he will put up Ramadan decorations despite the prevailing misery and do his best to create a festive atmosphere.“Despite all the odds, Ramadan will always have its own atmosphere, with a symbolism and spirituality that makes life easier,” said Zakou.Fasting is required of all healthy adult Muslims, with exemptions for those who are sick, pregnant women and those breastfeeding.Alongside eating and drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse are also prohibited during daylight hours in Ramadan.Islam follows a lunar calendar, so Ramadan starts about a week and a half earlier each year. At the end of holy month, Muslims celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday, when children often receive new clothes and gifts.___ Associated Press writers Ghaith Alsayed in Idlib, Syria; Bouazza ben Bouazza in Tunis, Tunisia; Andrew Wilks in Istanbul; Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Munir Ahmed and Rahim Faiez in Islamabad contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World

It has been observed eating fruits and vegetables, and has not harmed any humans.Taoyuan's Animal Protection Office said the plan was to dispatch staff and capture the primate with a cage trap first, and if that failed, veterinarians would use a tranquilizer dart.After conducting an investigation, the office did not find any registration documentation for baboons in Taoyuan. Officials believe the monkey may have been abandoned by someone in a bordering country or city.Huang Chih-chieh (黃志杰), borough chief of Pingzhen's Xingli neighborhood, was cited by CNA as saying that on March 10, the baboon was spotted in a factory. On March 18, Huang received notification of the incident, and he contacted Leofoo Village Theme Park, in neighboring Hsinchu County, to dispatch veterinarians to capture the monkey.The baboon is about 110 centimeters tall and weighs around 20 kilograms.An individual who assisted in the efforts to capture the animal said that it is not afraid of humans. However, when the Leofoo Village Theme Park veterinarians appeared in their uniforms, it ran away.Baboon spotted on Gaoyou Road in Taoyuan's Pingzhen District. (Facebook, Streets Observation Academy screenshot)According to the latest report, the baboon has fled to Xinwu Meigao Road, Section 3.Leofoo Village officials said that on March 18, it received a report that a baboon had escaped, and the park requested support in trapping the animal. As to whether the primate had escaped from Leofoo Village, the park claimed none of its baboons were missing.Leofoo Village added that because it has experience trapping animals, the park dispatched personnel to assist in capturing the creature.The Forestry Bureau said there are 10 olive baboons registered at Taipei Zoo, 150 yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), eight Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryads), and five olive baboons registered at Leofoo Village, and five Hamadryas baboons registered at the Kaohsiung City Shou Shan Zoo. None of these facilities have reported any of their baboons missing, per TVBS News.According to Article 37 of the Wildlife Conservation Act (野保法), endangered and rare wild animals should be properly managed during breeding and should not be allowed to escape. If so, the animal's owner should report the incident to local authorities and assist in capturing it. Those who break the law will face fines of between NT$10,000 (US$329) and NT$50,000.",2023/03/23,3534,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844378,Taipei 7th most expensive city in Asia for business travel,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei is ranked as the seventh most expensive city in Asia and Hsinchu made its first appearance in the top 10, in the annual report on expenses faced by business travelers released earlier this week by consulting firm Employment Conditions Abroad (ECA).The most expensive city in Asia in the 2023 rankings was Hong Kong, followed by Singapore and Tokyo, according to ECA.Despite recent political unrest and the impact of COVID, Hong Kong has retained its position as a crucial hub for business and the most expensive city for business travelers in Asia. ECA reported the average business trip to Hong Kong costs about US$520 (NT$15,800) each day, making it the 16th most expensive city on ECA’s global index.This year, Singapore edged out Tokyo for the No. 2 spot in the rankings. Daily costs for business travelers in Singapore are only slightly lower than Hong Kong’s at US$515 per day, over Tokyo’s US$424 dollars.As for Taiwan, its comparatively stable economy and successful COVID response put it in a healthy position for business activity. In comparison to other nations in the region suffering from heavy inflation and struggling to boost business post-pandemic, the demand for business travel to Taiwan has increased costs over many similarly sized cities in the region.Lee Quane, ECA’s regional director for Asia was quoted by the Hindustan Times, as saying, “The rise in our rankings of Taipei is largely due to the fact that locations such as Yokohama, Beijing and Macau, which were all more expensive before the COVID-19 pandemic, are now relatively cheaper than Taipei.""

The rise of Hsinchu into the top 10 reflects the global demand for semiconductors and related tech products and services. Quane said that Taiwan can likely expect to see an increase in business travelers over the next year, but many may find that costs are slightly higher than expected.(ECA International image)",2023/03/23,2213,Business

She was also charged a fine of $30,000.In recent years, many celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Matt Damon, Tom Brady and others have used their massive social media influence to promote cryptocurrencies.However, it is illegal to do so without the full disclosure of being paid to promote.Last year, reality TV star Kim Kardashian had to pay a fine of $1 million to settle federal charges after she recommended Ethereum Max tokens, a crypto security, to her millions of Instagram followers.She did not disclose that she had been paid to promote the currency.In 2020, actor Steven Seagal paid more than $300,000 as part of a settlement with the SEC. He was banned from promoting investments for three years.ns/ar (AFP,, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844395,Opinion: The Wall of China still stands behind Putin,"Vladimir Putin has his back to the wall in the war in Ukraine. His army is barely making any headway, the Russian economy is groaning under Western sanctions, and the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court has isolated Russia's president as never before. But as long as the wall Putin has his back to is Chinese, the Kremlin chief can still hope for victory, and a new world order. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow is likely to have given this hope a fresh boost.It couldn't have been more symbolic. Xi's visit began almost exactly nine years to the day since Russia's annexation of Crimea. Shortly beforehand, Putin flew for the first time to the occupied and utterly devastated city of Mariupol — where some of the worst war crimes have taken place.The Chinese head of state came to Russia for a three-day visit as if the brutal war in Ukraine was not taking place. The trip was flanked by newspaper articles in which Xi and Putin invoked their friendship and the close partnership of their countries, which stood ""shoulder to shoulder.""The visible outcome of the meeting is: even more trade. It will bind Russia, weakened by the Ukraine war, even more closely to China, while at the same time enabling Moscow to continue to wage this very war. China is buying more and more Russian raw materials, and selling it more and more goods. Chinese companies now serve the markets that were dominated by Western firms before the war.By contrast, results of the talks on China's latest diplomatic initiative for Ukraine are barely visible at all. This gives rise to the suspicion that Beijing's 12-point proposal, which Putin described as the ""basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict,"" was not entirely serious. Otherwise it would not have come only a year after the invasion, and would not have omitted the central issue — the complete withdrawal of Russian troops. To freeze the war at this point would be a victory for Putin. How serious Xi actually is about his offer to mediate is, therefore, unlikely to become clear until after he has held talks with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.This was one of those visits where you only understand in retrospect what else was discussed behind closed and soundproofed doors. It is to be feared that Putin's main concern was in fact to inform Xi about what he may do next in Ukraine — which is presumably what he did before launching the invasion in February 2022. Russia may step up its offensive in the coming weeks, with brutal consequences for the Ukrainian population. If it does, Moscow will clearly want to know that China is on its side, even if this is not outwardly apparent.With this alliance continuing to strengthen, the West is watching in surprise, unsure what to do. Economic interests and the hope of diplomatic mediation mean it is still refraining from harsh criticism, for now. Perhaps there is also an assumption that China will distance itself from Moscow as soon as a clear defeat for Putin in this war becomes foreseeable. Perhaps then the Wall of China at his back will crumble.However, another scenario seems to be more likely: China will certainly try to prevent a Russian defeat, whether through diplomacy or by openly supplying it with weapons. The West must prepare itself for this.Not that long ago, a frequent comment to be heard in Berlin and other Western capitals was: ""We shouldn't drive Russia into China's arms."" That was naïve: It had already happened. Their embrace is getting tighter and tighter, and the West would not have been able to prevent this  alliance. Xi's visit to Moscow has only made it more visible.This article has been translated from German.",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844396,'Pandora’s box': EU weighs changing relations with China,"If Xi Jinping chooses to ""befriend a war criminal, it is our duty to get very serious about China,"" Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told DW when asked what he thought about the Chinese president's three-day visit to Moscow and his meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin late last week, accusing him of war crimes.The only way forward for the European Union now, Landsbergis said, is to take ""first steps on de-risking and eventual decoupling from China. The sooner we start, the better for the union.""But not everyone in Brussels believes such strong action is necessary. In conversation with DW, EU officials pointed out that Xi Jinping and Putin have met more than 40 times in recent years. That made the two leaders' display of unity ""expectable,"" one official said on an anonymous basis.The general feeling seems to be that China is taking advantage of Russia's weakness.China is among the few countries that have avoided calling Russia's aggression in Ukraine an invasion. It has also abstained from all United Nations resolutions to condemn Russia. It continues to buy Russian oil and gas, and its officials and media have been criticized in many western countries for parroting the Kremlin's propaganda about the invasion.President Xi's pledge of a no-limits friendship with Russia has further hurt China's relations with the EU, which are already strained.Although some Western allies are worried China might be considering providing weapons to Russia, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this week in Brussels that he hadn't seen any evidence that China was prepared to deliver lethal aid to Russia.China has been supporting Russia's war efforts, however, in several indirect ways. This includes the ramping up of economic exchanges and exports of dual-use equipment, said Grzegorz Stec, an analyst at the Brussels office of the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German foundation.Among the equipment exports are ""tires, trucks, clothing and other goods that can be used by the Russian military, although those are not specifically weapons,"" he told DW.If the West were to find tangible proof of China providing large-scale military equipment to Russia, Stec pointed out, that would be ""a red line"" for the Europeans. But he recommended taking a cautious approach before accusing China of supplying weapons to Russia, given the magnitude of the potential geopolitical implications.Now that China has scrapped its zero-COVID policies and is reopening its economy, ""we may be in a period of diplomatic reopening and stabilization,"" he said, ""but the stabilization is really fragile, and tensions remain.""These tensions include the deteriorating relations between the US and China, particularly over the Taiwan question, China's repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the EU's WTO dispute with China over its trade restrictions against member state Lithuania, Stec said.""The EU doesn't want to face more economic destabilization. It is interested in keeping the relationship stable for now,"" he said.""Redefining [the relationship] is like opening a political Pandora's box.""This is one of the reasons why Brussels is reluctant to join US initiatives to contain China.The administration of US President Joe Biden has been trying to persuade the EU and its members to work together to confront China. Those efforts have only been partly successful. In March, the Netherlands moved to ban the sale of advanced microchip technology to China and Germany announced a security review into critical components of its mobile phone networks provided by Chinese manufacturers Huawei and ZTE.In general, however, many EU countries are hesitant to pull away from the profitable Chinese market — first and foremost Germany, whose biggest trading partner is China.The statement by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January that the EU wants to ""de-risk"" but not ""decouple"" from China highlights the EU's reluctance to turn its back on China.Regardless of this reluctance, Europe's attitude towards China is more skeptical than it has been in decades, said Reinhard Bütikofer, chair of the European Parliament's China delegation.""The Chinese haven't been very successful in dealing with the Europeans lately,"" he told DW. ""I would say they have squandered a lot of the political capital that they used to have.""Along with several other European lawmakers, Bütikofer was blacklisted by China in March 2021 after the EU imposed sanctions on Chinese officials who stood accused of being involved in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs.As consequence, the EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement was put on ice.Since then, however, Bütikofer has been approached by Chinese diplomats, as have many other EU politicians, he told DW.China analyst Stec believes that a new Chinese ""charm offensive"" led by the new Chinese ambassador to the EU, Fu Congin, is underway.He explained that Fu had been extremely active in testing two key ideas: First, the simultaneous lifting of sanctions imposed by the EU on China, and by China on the EU, something he said Fu was presenting as ""a supposed goodwill gesture from the side of Beijing, given that the EU imposed its sanctions first.""When this was completed, he continued, Fu was hoping for the unblocking of the ratification of the investment agreement between the EU and China.However, EU politician Bütikofer, who represents the German Greens in the European Parliament, thought the chances of getting the investment agreement back on the table were ""extremely slim.""There doesn't seem to be much appetite to start a new discussion on the EU's position on China, sources told DW, as long as member states hold different positions: Some of them are willing to focus on continuing trade relations, while others are ready to align more with US policy on China.That might be why China is not even on the agenda of the upcoming EU summit on 23-24 March, at least not officially.""The Chinese are trying to balance two incompatible goals. Being best buddies with Putin and being good friends of the Europeans at the same time,"" Bütikofer said.He made clear he doesn't think they can achieve both.""As Abraham Lincoln said, you can fool some of the people all of the time or all the people some of the time. But you cannot fool all the people all the time.""In concrete political terms, he explained, this meant that they would ""fail if they insist on their no-limits friendship with the Russians.""Edited by: Kate Hairsine",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844397,Ukraine updates: Zelenskyy visits troops near Bakhmut,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited military positions near the front line city of Bakhmut on Wednesday.""Donetsk region. The front line positions of the Ukrainian military in the Bakhmut area,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram, which included a video of him greeting soldiers.He said this part of eastern Ukraine has seen the longest and bloodiest battles since the start of Russia's invasion.The Ukrainian president used the visit to award medals to soldiers in a warehouse near the battlefield.""I am honored to be here today to award our heroes. To shake hands and thank them for protecting the sovereignty of our country,"" Zelenskyy said.Bakhmut is a small industrial city that had a pre-war population of around 80,000 people.Russian forces, spearheaded by Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner Group mercenaries, have been waging a monthslong assault on the city.Although Russian soldiers came close to encircling the Bakhmut, Ukraine's military has held ground to the east and launched several counteroffensives.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Wednesday, March 22:Prince William arrived in Poland on Wednesday to express his gratitude to Polish and British troops involved in efforts to help Ukraine.""I'm here because I want to thank the Polish and British troops working in close and crucial partnership,"" William told Polish news outlets. ""I also want to pay tribute to the inspiring humanity of the Polish people. You have opened your hearts as much as your homes.""William was in Rzeszow in southeastern Poland, where he met Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Balszczak.After meeting with troops, William was to tour office buildings in the capital Warsaw which are being used to accommodate about 300 Ukrainian women and children.On Thursday, William is expected to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and lay a wreath at Warsaw's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He is also set to meet with more Ukrainians who have settled in Poland.The trip was not publicized in advance, and is being conducted under tight security.A former Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, told DW that she is skeptical of China's mediation efforts regarding the war.""We've seen the plan that — or so-called plan — that China has put forward. We did not see the actual preconditions for actual peace being reached through that particular plan because it doesn't say anything about the withdrawal of Russian troops from the sovereign territory of the sovereign independent country with recognized borders under international law,"" she said.""So I'm a bit skeptical with regard to that suggestion, to put it very diplomatically and very mildly,"" she added.Klympush-Tsintsadze said peace cannot ultimately be achieved unless Russia withdraws from occupied territory in Ukraine.China's 12-point plan on the conflict does not explicitly urge Russia's withdrawal, but calls for ""respecting the sovereignty of all countries.""The Swedish Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted in favor of legislation to join NATO, amid regional security concerns due to Russia's assault on Ukraine.The NATO bill was passed in a 269-to-37 vote after hours of debate. The Left Party and Greens were the only parties to oppose the bill.Turkey has expressed opposition to Sweden's NATO bid, as Ankara has accused the Nordic country of harboring members of terrorist organizations. Sweden has denied the allegations.In addition to Sweden, Russia's neighbor Finland has also expressed interest in joining the alliance.Turkey's Parliament has begun the process of ratifying Finland's entry into NATO, but has not greenlit Sweden's bid. Hungary has also taken steps toward approving Finland's NATO accession, but is holding back its approval of Sweden's application.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide Ukraine with a $15.6 billion (€14.5 billion) loan for economic recovery, the organization announced late on Tuesday.The deal is the first time the IMF has agreed to loan money to a war-torn country in its 77-year history, Bloomberg reported. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva previously met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv last month.""In addition to the horrific humanitarian toll, Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to have a devastating impact on the economy,"" IMF Ukraine mission chief Gavin Gray said.He said Ukraine's economy had contracted by 30% in the past year and poverty has increased since Russia's invasion.The funds will be delivered over four years to support ""long-term growth in the context of post-war reconstruction"" as well as Ukraine's potential journey to joining the European Union.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal welcomed the agreement.""In conditions of a record budget deficit, this program will help us finance all critical expenditure and ensure macroeconomic stability and strengthen our interaction with other international partners,"" he said in a message on Telegram.The United States is the IMF's largest shareholder.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has previously urged the IMF to provide new financing for Ukraine. She also welcomed the announcement.""An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF program is critical to underpin Ukraine's reform efforts, including to strengthen good governance and address risks of corruption, and provide much needed financial support,"" Yellen said in a statement.Meanwhile, the World Bank estimated that Ukraine needs $411 billion for reconstruction and recovery from Russia's invasion. It's a jump from the $349 billion estimated for Ukrainian recovery last September.The World Bank's Vice President for Europe and Central Asia Anna Bjerde said she believes Ukraine's reconstruction will ""take several years."" She said both public and private investment is needed, but recovery costs will rise as the war drags on.British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said on Wednesday that there was no nuclear escalation in the war in Ukraine.His comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the United Kingdom for supplying Ukraine with tank ammunition that contains depleted uranium.""There is no nuclear escalation,"" Cleverly told reporters on Wednesday.""The only country in the world that is talking about nuclear issues is Russia. There is no threat to Russia, this is purely about helping Ukraine defend itself""The United Kingdom has used depleted uranium in its armor-piercing shells for decades because the material helps penetrate tank armor. It does not consider these rounds to be nuclear capable. Russia has also been known to use this same technology.""It's worth making sure everyone understands that just because the word uranium is in the title of depleted uranium munitions, they are not nuclear munitions, they are purely conventional munitions,"" Cleverly said.Japan's prime minister has pledged development support to help Poland assist Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia's invasion.After making a surprise visit to Kyiv and meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was hosted in Warsaw by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.""Bearing in mind the increasing burden on Poland due to the prolonged invasion of Ukraine,"" Kishida said Japan would offer Poland assistance to support its role and is looking to ""vigorously build up"" projects.Kishida noted that it was crucial for like-minded countries such as Japan and Poland, to remain united in their support for Ukraine and in furthering sanctions against Russia.In a joint conference with Kishida, Morawiecki said that at the time when a ""new geo-political order "" was becoming apparent, both countries understand the ""threat to world peace and international order coming from Russia's imperialism.""Warsaw has supplied military, humanitarian, and political support to Kyiv during the invasion which has lasted 13 months.The Kremlin has dismissed ""hostile"" reactions from the West to Putin's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.""As for the reaction of the collective West, the fact that on all issues this reaction took on an unfriendly and hostile nature is not news to anyone,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said after Xi departed on Wednesday.Xi's visit to Moscow this week was about more than drumming up support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a Green member of the European Parliament.""Xi Jinping and Putin are building a new hegemonic order wherein they intend to dominate globally,"" German Green MEP Reinhard Bütikofer told DW's Terry Martin.Bütikofer was also skeptical about Beijing’s 12-point position paper on the war in Ukraine, which Xi and Putin discussed.""In the first point of the paper, it says that national sovereignty and territorial integrity should be the principles on which policies are built. But then later in the paper, it clearly also stipulates that, of course, the so-called security interests of Russia also have to be taken account of,"" he said.""And basically what that tells us is the following: If you are a smaller country and you have a more powerful neighbor, then your sovereignty and territorial integrity has to come with a rebate to your more powerful authoritarian neighbor.""The British Ministry of Defense said Russia's assault on the front line city of Bakhmut could be slowing in the wake of a recent Ukrainian counterattack.Ukraine controls a patch of territory to the west of the city, while Russian forces have been attacking from most other directions.""Fighting continues around the town center and the Ukrainian defense remains at risk from envelopment from the north and south,"" the ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing.""However, there is a realistic possibility that the Russian assault on the town is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, partially because some Russian MoD (Ministry of Defense) units have been reallocated to other sectors.""Three people were reportedly killed and several more injured after a Russian drone hit a vocational high school near Kyiv overnight.""Three people died, two people were injured and one person was rescued. Four people are probably under the rubble,"" Ukraine's State Emergency Service said on Telegram on Wednesday.The school is located around 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Kyiv.Authorities said the drone attack ""partially destroyed"" two floors of student dormitories as well as a building that is used for studying.It also caused a fire that affected 300 square metres (3,200 square feet). It was extinguished on Wednesday morning.Ukraine's military blamed Iranian-manufactured drones for the attack.""Over 20 Iranian murderous drones, plus missiles, numerous shelling incidents, and that's just in one last night of Russian terror against Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy later said on Twitter.Chinese President Xi Jinping left Moscow on Wednesday morning after after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Xi was seen off at Vnukovo airport by a guard of honor playing the Chinese and Russian national anthems, local media reported. High-ranking Russian officials were also in attendance.During the visit, the two leaders hailed a ""new era"" of relations and discussed China's 12-point proposal for a cease-fire in Ukraine.However, Putin stopped short of endorsing the plan, saying it could only be the basis for peace once ""the West and Kyiv are ready for it.""Critics say the plan is thin on solutions and could allow Russia to keep the territory it has occupied in eastern Ukraine.Xi's visit gave a strong political boost to Putin, who is increasingly isolated on the world stage. However, there was no mention of potential Chinese weapons supplies to Russia or any other support for the invasion. Beijing has repeatedly denied Western accusations that it plans to arm Moscow, or is already secretly doing so.Russia repeatedly bombarded Ukraine's electricity and gas infrastructure in recent months, but the nation was able to make it through the winter. DW looks at how Ukraine has maintained its energy supply despite the war.Many countries issued sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844398,Spain's PM Sanchez survives no-confidence vote,"Spain's legislators on Wednesday rejected a move to oust Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, following 14 hours of debate in the 350-seat parliament.Sanchez, of the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), is currently leading a governing coalition with the left-wing alternative alliance United We Can (Unidas Podemos) and the support of smaller Catalan and Basque parties.The vote of no confidence comes just two months before local and regional elections are to take place in Spain.It was the second move to oust him in the current legislative period. Both attempts were brought on by the far-right populist party by Vox.Some 201 lawmakers voted against the no-confidence motion, while 53 voted in favor and 91 abstained. Of those who supported it, 52 were members of Vox and one was an independent member of parliament.The abstaining votes all came from the conservative Partido Popular (PP), the largest opposition party in the legislature.""It is remarkable and revealing to see the traditional right ... getting closer and closer to the far right,"" Sanchez said, accusing PP of having abstained in order to appease Vox.The parliamentary debate was marked by acrimony, with legislators attacking each other over personal and policy issues, involving anything from climate change, feminism, the economy and Spanish democracy.Sanchez blasted Vox for fomenting ""hate"" and putting forth a ""destructive"" no-confidence motion.In 2019, Vox entered parliament and became Spain's third-largest party. The movement has gained ground — last year it won its first share of power in one of Spain's regional governments alongside the PP.The far-right party has accused Sanchez's government of promoting illegal immigration and being too close to separatist parties in Catalonia and the Basque Country.Vox's no-confidence move on Wednesday was defended by an unlikely figure, an independent parliamentarian, Ramon Tamames. He does not belong to Vox and was once a communist who was instrumental in Spain's transition to democracy.Eighty-nine-year-old Tamames said he was seeking to protect the ""Spanish nation"" from a leftist government that was supported by Catalonian and Basque pro-independence parties.Vox leader Santiago Abascal said he was ""satisfied"" with the result, even though the motion did not go through. ""Once again, we have exposed one of the worst governments in our history,"" he told reporters.""We knew what the outcome (of the vote) would be but above all we were satisfied with the debate, we wanted this government to be exposed and it was,"" Abascal added.jcg/nm (dpa, Reuters, EFE)",2023/03/22,,

They know now that they only need look to the guy in their own dressing room to see the most complete player in all of baseball.Still, it may have taken a speech just before the World Baseball Classic final in Miami between Japan and the United States, tweeted by the Japanese team, to help tilt the balance.""Let's stop admiring them,"" Ohtani said referring to his teammate's reverence for the heroes of MLB. ""If you admire them, you can't surpass them.""In the nine innings of baseball that followed, Ohtani's teammates surpassed the Americans, winning 3-2 after Ohtani struck out perhaps the second best player, Los Angeles Angels teammate, Mike Trout, to end the game.The 28-year old does what modern players in Major League Baseball don't. He pitches the ball when his team is on the defensive side of an inning and he hits when his team is on the offensive side.In the top tier of baseball, pitching perhaps 100 times in a game if things go well, is left to specialists. They rest their precious arms when their teammates are up to bat. Ohtani isn't alone amongst pitchers that do take to bat, but few in the history of the sport have ever boasted the prowess of the Japanese marksman.Starting pitchers are usually limited to one appearance every five or so games in a 162-game regular season and take the time to rest their arms and bodies between appearances. There is no rest for Ohtani, who is a star pitcher and hitter for the Los Angeles AngelsOhtani worked his way to stardom in Japan's top baseball leagues until December of 2017 when he signed a contract with Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels at the age of 23.He batted successfully in his debut during the 2018 season and helped pitch his team to a win two days later. At season's end he was named the American League Rookie of the Year. Three years later, in 2021, he was named the American League's Most Valuable Player. He had become better than Americans — Latin Americans too — at what they consider their own game.Back home, Japanese media follow Ohtani every game in the US, and media consumers back home eat up all things ""Showtime.""""I suppose the idolization of Ohtani in Japan reflects its own inferiority complex vis a vis the fatherland of baseball that is the U.S.,"" said Koichi Nakano, who teaches politics and culture in Tokyo at Sophia University.""Baseball is so major here, but it has long been said that Japanese baseball, called yakyu, is different from 'real' baseball in America. Books have been written and published on the topic,"" Nakano said. ""So each time where there is a Japanese 'export' that was hugely successful in MLB, the Japanese are enthralled.""Seconds after he struck out his Angels' teammate, Mike Trout, in the game that put Japan back on top of the world of baseball, a shouting and smiling Ohtani threw his glove to the ground and tossed his hat to celebrate with his teammates.""This is the best moment in my life,"" he said through a translator. Ohtani had helped his Japanese teammates to win seven games and lose none in the tournament, widely considered the World Cup of baseball. His excellent hitting and pitching led him to be named the MVP.Ohtani's words to his teammates from before the game still echoed:  ""For one day, let's throw away our admiration for them and just think about winning.""In Japan, broadcaster WBC stuck to its live coverage from Miami for almost two hours.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844400,"In Northern Ireland, businesses want to move on from Brexit","In Northern Ireland, things are rarely black and white. Rather they're green, orange and any number of shades in between.The region has been the central issue in EU-UK negotiations since the 2016 Brexit vote. The main question: where should the border separating the EU single market from the UK market be?The EU and the UK have repeatedly agreed that border should not be on the island of Ireland, due to the toxic legacy of 'The Troubles' — the 1969-1998 conflict which claimed more than 3,500 lives. Most people in Northern Ireland agree, polls say.The compromise is the so-called 'Irish Sea border', where goods are checked before moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol includes this law but its implementation in 2021 infuriated members of Northern Ireland's pro-British unionist community, who saw it as diluting their link to the UK.They and others also bemoaned other aspects of its practical application, saying it imposed vast levels of needless bureaucracy on businesses and thwarted trade, introducing curbs on everything from sausages to pets.The row became very bitter. It threatened several times to spiral into a trade war when Boris Johnson was UK prime minister. But under Rishi Sunak, the EU and the UK have worked hard on finding a solution. Last month, Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a new plan in what was by far the warmest EU-UK summit since Brexit.The Windsor Framework removes the vast majority of checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, amid other changes. Sunak said it made Northern Ireland the ""world's most exciting economic zone"" because of its dual access to the EU and UK markets.Politicians from all sides across the UK and Ireland welcomed it as a major breakthrough. But many unionists still aren't happy. The DUP, the largest unionist party and second biggest party in Northern Ireland behind the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, says it is still not enough.On March 22, Sunak's government held a vote on an aspect of the framework, the 'Stormont Brake' mechanism in which the Northern Irish parliament and the UK government can prevent new EU laws from being introduced in Northern Ireland.The vote passed by a massive 515 votes to 29, with even the opposition supporting it. The DUP voted against it along with 22 rebels from the Eurosceptic wing of Sunak's Conservative Party. Former Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, both keen to undermine Sunak, were among them.However, Sunak does not need DUP support and it is expected that the Windsor Framework will proceed to implementation regardless. He says there will be no new negotiations. Businesses in the region are largely supportive and are keen to move on after almost a decade of uncertainty.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says the deal confirms a long-established reality — that the border on the island of Ireland cannot return because of Brexit.""The reality is that the tectonic plates aren't going to shift on the island of Ireland,"" he told DW. ""And it isn't going to be moved to the middle of the Caribbean. This is always going to be the place where the EU single market and the UK's internal market meet.""Kelly represents Northern Irish manufacturers. He says that their own surveys show that approximately one in five of their members have reported that since the Protocol came in, their British suppliers stopped sending goods to Northern Ireland due to customs burdens.He expects that the new deal will change this. ""Our view is that the framework gives a great basis to reopen those supply lines, make them more secure and to maintain Northern Ireland's position within the UK's market,"" he says. ""But also to maintain Northern Ireland's position in the EU's market for goods of which we've seen quite a significant benefit from.""On Sunak's assertion that Northern Ireland is now the 'world's most exciting economic zone,' Kelly laughs that it doesn't feel like that looking out of the window on a cold, grey day in Derry. But he says there is genuine ""validity"" to the claim, given that Northern Ireland has unique access to both markets.""Certainly when it comes to exports and sales of goods and as a location in terms of attracting inward investment, then if we get this protocol stuff and the politics around it sorted, then we know that we're capable of making the most of that,"" he says.""We're left with a unique opportunity and proposition that we're able to take to the world...we have something now that no one else has and we want to make the most of it.""The vast majority of business groups echo his sentiments. The general public too is supportive. A recent poll by the Irish News-Institute of Irish Studies-University of Liverpool found that 3 out of 4 people who expressed an opinion on the new deal supported it.None of that has influenced the DUP position, which focuses its opposition on constitutional matters — specifically the application of EU law in Northern Ireland.They say that the mechanism voted upon on Wednesday – the 'Stormont Brake' — will not stop new laws from being introduced.""It remains the case that the 'brake' is not designed for, and therefore cannot apply, to the EU law which is already in place and for which no consent has been given for its application,"" the party said in a statement.Even if their opposition does not stop the new legislation, it is likely to mean that they will not return to Northern Ireland's power-sharing deal with the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein any time soon. That has not functioned for four of the last six years amid deep divisions between the parties.At the last election in May 2022, Sinn Fein became the biggest party for the first time in Northern Ireland's history. That would give them the symbolically significant post of First Minister in any government.Some political commentators speculate that as this is something the DUP does not want to countenance, it is hoping it can force another election and come out on top again, rather than return to government as a perceived 'junior' party to Sinn Fein.That's the green and the orange again, complicating the black and white. In that sense, political change still seems a long way off in Northern Ireland. But those speaking for the business side increasingly just want to move on.Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844401,Boris Johnson defends conduct during 'partygate' testimony,"Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended himself before Parliament on Wednesday amid criticism of his handling of lockdown-defying parties during the COVID-19 pandemic.Johnson told lawmakers that he did not deliberately lie to the House of Commons about the parties, which took place at Downing Street in 2020 and 2021 while he was prime minister.During his testimony to the Parliament's Committee of Privileges, the former Conservative Party leader swore on the Bible to tell the ""whole truth and nothing but the truth.""""I'm here to say to you, hand on heart, that I did not lie to the House (of Commons),"" Johnson said. ""When those statements were made, they were made in good faith and on the basis of what I honestly knew and believed at the time.""Johnson apologized for ""inadvertently misleading"" the House of Commons. ""But to say that I did it recklessly or deliberately is completely untrue, as the evidence shows,"" he added.If found guilty of lying to Parliament, it could cost Johnson's parliamentary seat. It could also cost the 58-year-old his chance of a political comeback, after multiple controversies led to his resignation from the premiership in 2022.Opposition Labour Party MP Harriet Harman, who sits on the committee probing Johnson, said the panel wants to find out whether he ""told the truth to the best of his knowledge.""""Misleading the House might sound like a technical issue, but it is a matter of great importance,"" Harman said.Johnson has argued that parties at Downing Street during the height of the pandemic were ""lawful work gatherings.""""No cake was eaten, and no one even sang Happy Birthday,"" Johnson has said, referring to his surprise Downing Street birthday party on June 19, 2020. Up to 30 people are believed to have attended the party in breach of lockdown rules.Earlier on Wednesday, the Privileges Committee released written evidence sowing doubt on Johnson's claims.The evidence reveals that Martin Reynolds, who was principal private secretary to Johnson, said he had ""questioned whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times"" during the pandemic.Another Downing Street aide claimed that Johnson had the chance to ""shut down"" the lockdown-defying parties, but the former UK PM instead drank with staff and gave speeches.wd/nm (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844402,India: Will there be a roll back of Myanmar's refugees?,"As the violence in Myanmar shows no signs of abating, an influx of refugees is being witnessed in north-eastern India.The arrivals, mostly from Chin state, continue to take refuge in Mizoram following a military coup in the neighboring country in February 2021.Owing to shared ethnic ties, history, and kinship with the people of the Chin state of Myanmar, Mizoram has welcomed the refugees with open arms, allocating funds for their welfare in open defiance of the central government's ban.Meanwhile, Mizo voluntary associations, churches and local individuals have led a grassroots humanitarian response and mobilized local support.According to estimates by the state government and charities, over 31,500 refugees have taken shelter in camps spread across Aizawl, Lawngtlai and Siaha districts of the state, living with bare necessities. Many live in shacks with tinned roofs or plastic tarpaulins overhead.The home department says 30,385 Myanmar nationals, including 10,013 females and 11,650 children, have taken shelter across all 11 districts of Mizoram. Over 13,000 people have been lodged in 160 relief camps while the rest live outside.""Life is at a standstill here. Our children do not go to school and we depend on the largesse of our hosts,"" Man Chung, a refugee living in a camp, told DW.""Some of us take up odd jobs as daily laborers with local farmers but at times there is no work for weeks,"" Aye Laizo, another refugee, told DW.Given their meager infrastructure and resources, the state is stretched beyond capacity in the absence of government help. Though civil society organisations have been demanding stronger intervention from Prime Minister Narender Modi's government on the unfolding refugee situation, there is still little forthcoming.""The Indian government is failing to provide any assistance to Myanmar's refugees simply because Mizoram with one parliamentary seat does not matter in national politics while the ruling BJP with one legislator in the state assembly does not have a future in state politics,"" Suhas Chakma, Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group, a think-tank, told DW.""India's refugee policy is all about ethnic or religious preference, domestic politics and at times, regional geo-politics,"" added Chakma.According to UN figures, approximately 80,000 Myanmar refugees have fled to other countries in the region since the coup. Hundreds of thousands more have utilized regular and irregular pathways to leave the country.Since the coup, India has been cautious about its diplomatic relationship and has adopted a middle path, saying that restoration of democracy in Myanmar remains a priority.New Delhi has economic interests in maintaining cordial relations with Myanmar's military as the country has natural resources, including natural gas, petroleum, and rare earth metals useful for India's high-tech industry.A bridge between south Asia and southeast Asia, Myanmar has always loomed large on India's diplomatic horizon and its importance is all too obvious.Both countries share a long land border of over 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) and a maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar is also critical to India's national security. The two countries have sealed a pact to share real time intelligence to combat Indian insurgents operating from the border region.Four north-eastern states – Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram – share the international boundary with Myanmar.""India should do much more to help the refugees. The UN special rapporteur has recommended that the government give the UNHCR unfettered access to refugees and asylum seekers throughout the country including Mizoram,"" Babloo Loitongbam, director of Human Rights Alert, told DW.Loitongbam, who is currently in Geneva for the human rights council session, pointed out that UN special rapporteur Thomas Andrews emphasized that paltry refugee resettlement quotas and a weak international refugee system have left Myanmar's neighbors sheltering refugee populations indefinitely.""Member states have underfunded the humanitarian response to the crisis, increasing instability and contributing to displacement and international migration,"" said Loitongbam.With no support coming in from New Delhi, the onus has fallen on the state to provide land for the refugee camps, and drinking water, toilets, and electricity.""We still have people trickling in twos and threes from across the border. The state has provided them temporary identity cards while some carry the pink I-cards of their homeland. We hope the situation gets better in Myanmar,"" Professor Malsawmliana, assistant secretary of the Young Mizo Association (YMA), told DW.The YMA, the state's largest and most influential voluntary group, along with an alliance of local non-governmental organizations such as the Mizo Students Association and the Chin Health Organization (CHO) have been at the forefront of providing the refugees shelter and medical relief.""Some of the refugees are suffering from anxiety and mental stress given what they have faced and the dangerous trek they have undergone. They are uncertain about their future,"" Dr Numang of the CHO told DW.Later this year assembly elections are due in Mizoram and the refugee problem could be an electoral issue. New Delhi has instructed paramilitary forces to be alert at the border and prevent a further influx of refugees. Moreover, it has also been wary of taking a public stand on the events unfolding in Myanmar.However, state chief Minister Zoramthanga, a former insurgent leader turned democrat, has made his position clear maintaining that the Chins were the brethren of the residents of Mizoram and he would not turn them away.""I think the government in New Delhi needs to take a proper stand on this issue. Just like it wanted to give citizenship for Hindu refugees through the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2020, it should take a stand for refugees who are camping in Mizoram,"" a senior YMA leader told DW.Close observers say the situation in Mizoram requires a careful and nuanced approach that considers the concerns of both the refugees and the local population.""Dialogue, humanitarian aid, diplomatic efforts, security measures, resettlement, and long-term solutions are all needed to address this crisis,"" said Loitongbam.Edited by: John Silk",2023/03/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844404,Why is India's Khalistan separatist movement on the rise?,"The Amritsar district in India's northern Punjab state is on high alert as authorities try to track down Amritpal Singh, a self-styled preacher who heads a radical organization that demands a separate Sikh homeland known as ""Khalistan.""Several major roads are blocked, internet services have been cut in many regions, and authorities have blocked several Sikh twitter accounts. More than 100 people have been detained in connection with the investigation.Singh's popularity and calls for a separate Sikh nation have stirred fears of violence in Punjab state.In the 1980s, during the decade-long insurgency led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, thousands of people were killed in Punjab.Bhindranwale was a Sikh separatist leader who was killed in 1984 when then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to storm the Golden Temple in Amritsar.In 1984, after Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, anti-Sikh riots broke out and over 3,000 Sikhs were killed in New Delhi alone. Thousands were left displaced across the country.As Singh continues to evade the police, his rise in popularity and the ensuing crackdown haunt Punjab as a reminder of a bloody past.On Sunday, a group of people carrying banners that said ""Khalistan"" vandalized and removed the Indian flag from the balcony of the Indian High Commission in London. A day later, pro-Khalistan protesters damaged the Indian Consulate in San Francisco.Meanwhile, earlier this week, the Punjab and Haryana high court criticized police for having failed to apprehend Singh quickly.""You have 80,000 police. How has he not been arrested? If he escaped, this is an intelligence failure,"" the court said.Singh, 30, first gained popularity after moving to Dubai in 2012, where he joined his family's transport business and drove trucks.During his time in Dubai, Singh gained a following on social media, where his separatist views and ideas of Sikh unity amassed a lot of young followers.In August 2022, Singh traveled back to India and was appointed the head of  Waris Punjab De (WPD), which translates to ""Heirs of Punjab.""Until then the organization had been led by Deep Sidhu, an actor and activist who died in a car accident in 2022.Singh's LinkedIn profile shows a photo of him in a shirt, sporting a neatly trimmed beard and a short haircut.However, when Singh returned to India, he adorned a distinctly different look. He began wearing only traditional Sikh clothes and a turban. He grew his beard, wore a steel bangle on his wrist and the kirpan — a dagger that hangs at the hip.People began noticing Singh's resemblance to Bhindranwale. Singh has been vocal about drawing inspiration from the former leader. In a symbolic move, when Singh was appointed the head of the WPD, the ceremony was held in Bhindranwale's ancestral village.Amandeep Sandhu, a Punjabi writer and journalist, told DW that Singh has tapped into social problems in Punjab after returning to India, which has resonated with people there.One of the first things Singh did when he reached Punjab was to set up a drug rehab center. For decades, Punjab has suffered from a widespread drug abuse problem, which is combined with high unemployment.A study conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), revealed that in the state of 30 million people, 15% of the population are consuming drugs.Meanwhile, a 2021 economic survey reported that Punjab has an unemployment rate of 7.4%, one of the highest in India. Even though both drugs and unemployment have consistently ranked high as issues in political polls, politicians have yet to provide results.Singh, however, took on the drug issue head on. Simultaneously, he began leading processions and giving speeches promoting the idea of Khalistan and threatening officials from India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While Singh has managed to mobilize large groups during his speeches, his popularity and impact in Punjab remains contested.Sandeep Singh, a journalist based in Punjab, interviewed Singh while he was still in Dubai.""Most of his supporters are youngsters who realized that unlike politicians, Singh was addressing issues that plague Punjab,"" he told DW.The spokesperson for Punjab's chief minister, Bhagwant Mann, told DW that he believes Singh's popularity is a ""social media issue,"" and that police will soon arrest the Sikh separatist.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/03/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844407,France: Macron backs controversial pension reform in TV address,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday issued his first public remarks since his government forced the passage of a controversial pension reform bill through parliament.The reforms sparked violent protests accross the country.""This bill will continue its democratic pathway,"" Macron said. The Constitutional Council must now give its approval for the bill to come into law.Macron said the reforms were necessary for the nation's future.""That reform is not a luxury, it is not fun, it's a necessity for the country,"" Macron said said. ""I take no pleasure in it,"" he added.He criticized unions for not reaching a compromise over the bill, saying that labor organizations had just rejected the proposal outright.""Violence needs to be condemned,"" Macron said referring to violent protests and disruptions surrounding the opposition to the bill.Last week, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne invoked an article in the French constitution to enable the passage of Macron's pension reform without a parliamentary vote.The fight over the pension overhaul has proved to be the greatest domestic crisis of Macron's second presidential term. But despite the backlash to his government, he narrowly survived a no-confidence motion in parliament that took place on Monday.A recent survey has put Macron's personal approval rating at just 28%, his lowest level of approval since the height of the anti-government ""Yellow Vest"" protest movement in 2018-2019.Polls have also shown that a wide majority in France are opposed to the pension legislation.The controversial reform bill is the second time Macron has tried to make changes to France's pension system.France's retirement age structure is one of the most generous among EU member states, but Macron has argued that the system must be reformed in order for the country to stay solvent.To that end, his government is seeking to raise the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64.But French unions have argued that the move threatens worker rights. Instead, they propose a tax on the wealthy or higher payroll contributions from employers to the pension system, in order to keep government revenue steady.Critics have also pointed out that Macron's pension system changes are unfair to people who work from a young age in physically tough jobs and women who interrupt their careers to raise children. This is because it also increases the number of years one must work in order to claim full benefits.The fight over the future of the French pension system has led to weeks of disorder marked by nationwide protests and prolonged strikes.Last weekend, protests intensified after the forced adoption of the law without parliamentary approval.Clashes between authorities and protesters took place in Paris, where some protesters reportedly set trash on fire, broke glass on billboards and bus shelters and threw barriers, used to block streets, at police.Police reportedly fired tear gas at demonstrators in the French capital and detained over 200 people on Monday night alone.Sanitation workers in Paris have entered their 17th day of strikes, in response to the pension reform, leading to mountains of trash piling on the streets.Oil workers in several refineries in western and southern France have also stopped working, leading to gas shortages across the region.The popular backlash is set to continue, as France's main unions have announced a ninth nationwide day of strikes and protests on Thursday.Macron's opponents have demanded the government withdraw the bill and called for the dissolution of parliament and the firing of Prime Minister Borne. The government has rejected such calls""She has my confidence to lead this government,"" Macron said on Wednesday.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen warned Macron on Tuesday that he was pushing the country to the brink of a ""social explosion.""Both the government and opponents have appealed to the Constitutional Council for a speedy review of the bill to resolve the conflict.Legislators also submitted a request for a public referendum, known as the referendum d'initiative partagee (RIP), so that voters can have a say over the fate of the bill.jcg/es (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844408,Will Turkey ever become a Russian gas hub?,"Russia was the world's largest gas exporter until February 24, when Moscow invaded Ukraine, shaking global energy markets and forcing Europe to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.Europe imposed sanctions on Russia, which Turkey has refused to apply. Since the war began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to play a mediating role in the conflict, supplying weapons to Kyiv while maintaining close relations with President Vladimir Putin.In response, Putin proposed in October to make Turkey a hub for Russian gas deliveries as an alternative supply route to Europe — a plan backed by Erdogan. But what Putin has in mind is not clear, so far.Both presidents are going through difficult times. After 20 years in power, Erdogan faces the toughest challenge of his political life in the upcoming elections on May 14.Erdogan's re-election bid was already proving to be arduous amid record-high inflation and an economic slowdown. A devastating earthquake that hit Turkey in February, killing almost 50,000 people, has only made it harder for the Turkish leader. The quake caused damage worth more than $103 billion (€96.11 billion), or approximately 9% of the country's expected national income this year.Putin has his own set of challenges at hand, including the war in Ukraine and tough economic sanctions hitting the Russian economy.""Putin is dangling for Turkey the 'carrot' of becoming a gas hub to bring Turkey closer to Moscow's orbit — similarly to what Putin had tried to do with Germany and Nord Stream,"" said energy expert Agnia Grigas, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a US think tank.""Putin has traditionally used personal relationships, natural gas deals and arguably corruption to establish closer diplomatic relations with European and Eurasian countries, so Turkey is no exception,"" she told DW.Despite promising rhetoric by the leaders of both countries, there are technical concerns about the plan for Turkey to become a Russian gas hub.""The idea behind Putin's statements seems to send more Russian pipeline gas to Turkey, and that gas could then be re-exported to Europe,"" Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a global research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told DW.""The issue is that there is not enough pipeline capacity to do that,"" she added.Two active natural gas pipeline systems carry gas from Russia to Turkey. The biggest of these, TurkStream is designed to carry 31.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year and supplies gas to both Europe and Turkey via two pipelines.The second pipeline system, BlueStream, has an annual capacity of 16 bcm and covers Turkey's domestic gas demand.Both systems are currently heavily congested and adding one or more pipelines will take years, energy analysts say.In addition, there is a concern in Western capitals that any Turkish gas hub that includes Russian gas could allow Moscow to mask its supplies that the Europeans are ultimately trying to move away from.Considering Erdogan's well-known long-standing goal of making Turkey one of the world's leading energy trading centers, could Turkey and Russia pull this off?""Despite the TurkStream pipeline project, Turkey does not have the potential to become a gas hub for Europe as the EU countries and Russia's near abroad countries are seeking diversification away from Russian energy sources,"" said energy expert Grigas.""Likewise, most EU countries are prioritizing alternative supplies of gas such as from the Caspian, Norway, North Africa and further afield such as the United States and Qatar via LNG,"" she said, referring to liquefied natural gas.With oil and gas scarce, Turkey relies heavily on gas imports from Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as LNG imports from the United States, Egypt, Qatar, Nigeria and Algeria.LNG imports have reached 14.1 bcm, accounting for 24% of total imports, according to data from the Turkish Ministry of Energy. Turkey has doubled its LNG imports since 2013, data shows.In order for Turkey to become a gas hub and supply Europe ""the only possibility that I could see is that Turkey imports more Russian pipeline gas [once the pipeline capacity has been built]. Therefore it needs less LNG and this LNG is then free to supply other European markets,"" Corbeau said.""I don't think Europe wants to be more dependent on Russian gas coming through another place,"" she noted.Turkey's strategic position in the Black Sea, its control over the Bosphorus, and its status as a NATO member make it a valuable partner for Moscow in the current geopolitical situation. But Putin's idea of turning Turkey into a Russian gas hub could make Ankara more dependent on Moscow, analysts warn.""You have to remember that the relationship between Erdogan and Putin has not always been great if you recall what happened in 2015,"" said Corbeau, referring to the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkish forces in Syria.Even though the relationship was officially restored in 2016, the two countries have remained on opposite sides in recent conflicts such as Libya and Syria.Corbeau thinks Erdogan is playing an ""interesting game between Ukraine and Russia,"" wondering if anyone would ""bet that the relationship between Russia and Turkey — in particular their presidents — would be good for a long time.""""It's not really down to the relationship between two countries but the relationship between two presidents. At the end of the day it's all about Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan,"" she added.There is one more piece of the puzzle. Turkey will go to the ballot box on May 14, which could be a game changer, said Grigas and could spell the end to the ""cozy personal relationship between Putin and Erdogan,"" resulting in changes to Turkey's energy and foreign policy.Turkey had planned to hold a natural gas summit in Istanbul this year, bringing together gas suppliers and Europe's consumer countries. The event, which was initially planned for February and was postponed to March 22 due to the earthquake, has been pushed back indefinitely, according to local media reports.The Kremlin said on Monday that work to create a gas hub in Turkey was ""a complex project that would require time to come to fruition.""""It is clear that this is quite complicated work, it is a rather complex project which, unfortunately, cannot be implemented without time shifts, without technical or other problems,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.""Such situations are inevitable in relation to the Turkish hub. We will follow it, we will continue to work with our Turkish partners.""Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/22,,

The two leaders also signed two agreements to deepen the strategic partnership of coordination and economic cooperation.Analysts said one of the outcomes of the trip is the inevitable change in the power dynamic between Russia and China. Moscow is becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing economically and politically and China is not against lending support to its neighbor.""China wants to maintain its image as a peacemaker, but it's one that leans toward Russia,"" said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore (NUS). ""The optics suggests that Beijing is not ready to let Russia go and it's willing to support Russia up to a certain point.""Prior to the trip, China had been presenting itself as a peacemaker, but its position on the war, which was laid out by the 12-point document as well as public remarks by top Chinese officials, has been met with strong skepticism from the United States and other Western countries.On Tuesday, Putin said China's proposal could be used as ""the basis for a peaceful settlement in Ukraine."" Putin added that Russia is committed to ""restarting peace talks as soon as possible,"" which China approves.However, Havren pointed out that if China pushes for a cease-fire while Russian troops remain in the occupied areas, it will ""freeze the war"" and give Moscow more time to ""prepare for a new offensive.""She said that if Kyiv refused to accept a cease-fire because Russia hasn't withdrawn its troops from Ukrainian territory, Chinese and Russian propaganda machines would frame the US and its Western allies as ""warmongers that want to fuel the war"" while characterizing China as ""doing its utmost as a peace broker.""Other experts said China's efforts to present itself as a mediator reflect its urgent desire to ""reassert its international influence.""""It will be welcomed in some corners of the world, but definitely not in the US and some of its allies,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ""Major European countries will also be suspicious of China's efforts.""On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized Beijing for not holding Moscow accountable for ""the atrocities committed in Ukraine.""""Instead of condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those very crimes,"" Blinken said.As Xi to continues his diplomatic charm offensive, building on its successful mediation of the Iranian-Saudi deal to establish diplomatic relations and the further consolidation of bilateral ties with Russia, Chong from NUS told DW that Beijing is trying to create an image that it's a major player independent of the United States.""They are trying to reach out to other states, especially in the Global South, who have the tendency of viewing the US and its allies as potentially problematic,"" he said, adding that Beijing's goal is to consolidate the relationship with these states.Despite Xi's efforts to present China as a peacemaker in Russia's war in Ukraine, some observers said Beijing's priority is not for the war to come to an end. Instead, the main importance for China is to ensure the Russian regime remains in power.""The collapse of the Russian regime and the creation of a pro-Western government in Moscow would be a catastrophic scenario for China,"" said Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""At the same time, China also doesn't want the war to escalate into something much bigger than it's right now.""Umarov told DW that Beijing could accept a continuation of the war as it would leave Russia with no other option but to lean toward China.""Also, [an ongoing war] will have the US distracted from the confrontation with China. Beijing would be the biggest beneficiary of the current state of affairs,"" he concluded.Edited by: Sean Sinico",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844411,'Please Please Me': The Beatles' rushed first album turns 60,"When the album ""Please Please Me"" was released in the UK on March 22, 1963, it shot straight into the Top 10 of the British charts. Six weeks later it was number one, and stayed there for 30 weeks. It also spawned a number of hit singles including ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout.""But the record was a rush job. It was mostly recorded in one day by the Fab Four from Liverpool while Paul McCartney and John Lennon were suffering from a cold.At the time, the band played a grinding schedule of gigs in small clubs, or as an opening act for other artists. With a growing fan base, and as mainstays of the popular Liverpool Cavern Club, ""The North's No. 1 Rock Combo"" sometimes played two gigs a day. On New Year's Eve in 1962, The Beatles performed what proved to be their last gig at the Star Club in Hamburg, a venue where they had played residencies since 1960.In between gigs, producer George Martin of EMI Records — with which the band signed in 1962 — called the band into Abbey Road Studios in London. The single ""Love Me Do,"" released in October 1962, reached number 17 in the charts but still made the Beatles famous nationwide.A successor had to come quickly. Martin desperately wanted to record ""How Do You Do It,"" written by composer Mitch Murray, but the Beatles wanted to release their own composition.They looked to John Lennon's ""Please Please Me,"" which was recorded in September 1962 at the same sessions where ""Love Me Do"" was written. Peppered with sexual innuendo, the lyrics of ""Please"" seem almost raunchy by the standards of the time.Producer Martin didn't like the style of this version of the song — too monotonous, too slow. And so they were all back in the studio recording the single that was to catapult the Beatles to number one.When the recordings were finished, Martin was confident: ""You've just recorded your first number one."" On January 11, 1963, the single with the B-side ""Ask Me Why"" was released and Martin was proven right.Meanwhile, the hit single helped The Beatles promote their ongoing daily concert schedule, with manager Brian Epstein now firmly at the helm. It was not long before Martin called them back into the studio on February 11, 1963. The first long-playing record was to be made — and in one day!George Martin wanted to get the raw, original sound out of the Fab Four.The band was tight, having been playing so many shows, and they managed to record the remaining 10 songs live — in addition to the existing four titles.For the last number, ""Twist and Shout,"" John had to give his battered voice a rest, forcing Martin to go with a scratchy take that has endeared the song to millions of Beatles fans to this day.Martin only used a two-track tape recorder, and only a few instruments were mixed in. It took them between 15 and 90 minutes per song.After almost 13 hours, gallons of tea, milk, throat lozenges and cigarettes, the songs were recorded, with Martin later adding some piano tracks.Despite the rather simple recording technique, the production costs were relatively high: £400, which would correspond to about $9,200 (€8,500) today.It unusual for a band to put so many of their own songs on a debut album at the time: only six of the 14 tracks on ""Please Please Me"" were cover versions.The fact that the Beatles had convinced their producer to record their own material meant that the Lennon-McCartney pair were quickly recognized as songwriters. Paul and John agreed to always use both their names, even if a song was only written by one of them.The album ""Please Please Me"" still sounds fresh and testifies to the band's, and George Martin's, perfectionism and conviction to break new ground.The first of 12 studio albums, the debut long-play not only marked the start of a global Beatlemania but also the birth of a new way of making pop music that would inspire future generations of musicians.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844412,How Ukraine has maintained its energy supply despite the war,"This winter has put the Ukrainian energy system to the test. Since the start of the season, the Russian army has carried out 15 massive rocket attacks and 18 drone attacks on energy facilities in Ukraine. The attacks have aimed to destabilize the country's energy system and put the population at the mercy of the dark and cold.The Energy Ministry in Kyiv told DW that more than 50% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure was damaged, affecting both electricity generation and conveyance. It said the most significant damage was done to heating facilities, with every single cogeneration plant hit.""All the big heat and hydropower plants were damaged by Russian fire,"" Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the director of the state-run Ukrainian energy supplier Ukrenergo, said.Almost all major substations had been attacked at least three to four times, he said. ""We have objects that were hit six times, or some even 20 times,"" he added.But the electricity supply has been maintained, he said. According to Kudrytsky, there have been no more outages since mid-February and the system has been working without any restrictions.Several factors help explain the resilience of the Ukrainian grid.According to Ukrenergo, damaged power lines were quickly repaired, often at the risk of expert workers' lives.But it says the protection of Ukrainian airspace by air defense systems was also of great importance. In addition, the state energy supplier worked together with grid operators to develop new methods for reacting to attacks by Russian rockets and drones.""One method is to take the load off the energy system in the period before the attacks, thus maintaining its integrity,"" Volodymyr Omelchenko, the director for energy programs at the Rasumkov research center in Kyiv, told DW.This unloading — stopping the operation of individual block units at a power station ahead of possible rocket attacks — makes it possible to minimize the damage to the energy system if they are destroyed, thus allowing the faster restoration of lost energy.The Energy Ministry also mentioned the existence of several technical methods that facilitate the stabilization of the situation but declined to give details.""These methods are, let us say, not traditional technical solutions according to established standards, but they work, and thanks to them everything keeps going,"" Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Haluchenko told DW.In addition, repairs on a block at Ukraine's Rivne nuclear power plant have been finished. The second block of this plant, which operated at half-capacity in 2022, is also now at full power. This means that all nine available nuclear blocks are operating, which has compensated for shortfalls from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, currently occupied by Russian troops.There has also been assistance from ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity. Thanks to a continuous technical current flow, the Ukrainian energy system has remained in equilibrium, Ukrenergo's Volodymyr Kudrytsky explained. This synchronization allowed Ukrenergo to prevent frequent larger-scale blackouts during the attacks.Electricity imports from EU countries in January and early February of this year also guaranteed the supply to Ukrainian industry.The weather did its bit to help, too. ""Nature is on our side. This winter, we have unusually large amounts of meltwater in the Dnipro, Sozh, Dnesna and Pripyat rivers. Something like that happens only every 20 to 30 years. That helps us a lot, and the hydroelectricity plants are supplying a lot of power now,"" Ihor Syrota, CEO of the Ukrainian hydropower generating company Ukrhydroenergo, told DW.Ukrainian energy suppliers are meanwhile looking for more ways to secure those facilities and networks most at risk. For example, Ukrainian engineers are gathering information on how to move energy facilities as far as possible beneath the ground to protect them from Russian rockets.""I traveled to South Korea, because they also have such a 'nice' neighbor,"" CEO Syrota from Ukrhydroenergo said.""There, we saw how equipment and transformers are hidden under the ground or in rocks. We will also adopt solutions like these,"" he said.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/22,,

Around 150 people were injured.A 90-meter (295-foot) wall around a police station in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province collapsed without leaving casualties, a police district spokesman said.A spokesperson for Afghanistan's disaster mitigation ministry said two people, including a child, had been killed in the eastern Laghman province.Government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said health centers across Afghanistan had been put on high alert.Sharafat Zaman Amar, Taliban's appointed spokesman for the public health ministry said, ""Unfortunately, there could be more casualties as the quake was so powerful, in most parts of the country.""Authorities said strong shaking was felt in Badakhshan and other parts of the country's north.A spokesperson for the Red Cross said there were no immediate reports of damage in Badakhshan's capital.Some remote villages in the region can be difficult to reach and do not have phone or internet access.The United States Geological Survey (USGS) put the magnitude of the quake at 6.5 and said it struck at a depth of 187.6 kilometers (116 miles).The Hindu Kush mountain range was the epicenter of the quake. The range, which is at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian continental plates, is often hit by earthquakes.The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center said that shaking could be felt in an area of 1,000 kilometers by 285 million people across South and Central Asia.Afghanistan was hit by an earthquake in June of last year, which killed 1,000 people.sdi/nm (Reuters, AP, dpa)",2023/03/21,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844414,Italy investigates TikTok over 'dangerous content',"Italy's competition watchdog has launched a probe into Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok over what it says is ""dangerous content"" that the app is failing to remove.The Italian decision is the latest in a series of bans and restrictions targeting the app in Europe and the US.It also comes as the Dutch government advised officials not to install the app on their work phones, following in the footsteps of other countries including Britain, Belgium and the US.The Italian antitrust authority on Tuesday accused TikTok of breaching its own guidelines by failing to remove content related to suicide, self-harm and poor nutrition.A recent face-marking challenge, dubbed ""French scar,"" has taken the app by storm. The challenge involves pinching one's face until it bruises.The Italian authority's investigation involves TikTok's Irish unit, which handles its European customer relations. The authority added that police also visited the app's Italian headquarters on Tuesday.The social media giant has in tandem been struck with a series of bans recently.On Tuesday, the Netherlands ""immediately discouraged"" central government employees from installing on their business phones apps from countries ""with an offensive cyber program against the Netherlands and/or Dutch interests,"" citing cyber security fears.Though it did not name TikTok, the memo is widely believed to affect the app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance. The national intelligence agency AIVD had already added China, alongside Russia, North Korea and Iran, to a list of countries where apps ""carry a heightened risk of espionage.""The British and US governments also took similar measures, alongside the European Commission,the European Union's executive arm. And Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, recommended that its employees remove the app from their corporate phones.Also on Tuesday, Norway's youngest government member and Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl made the same recommendation. Mehl's own previous active TikTok use has previously gotten her in trouble with the public.The growing pressure comes as the app's CEO Shou Zi Chew prepares to appear before US congressional lawmakers on Thursday. Chew is expected to be grilled about TikTok's privacy and data-security practices, as well as its alleged relationship with the Chinese government.Addressing TikTok users, whom he estimated at around 150 million in the US alone, Chew said in a TikTok video that the hearing ""comes at a pivotal moment"" for the company.""I'll be testifying before Congress this week to share all that we're doing to protect Americans using the app,"" he said.Western governments fear the app threatens cybersecurity and data privacy, or could be used to promote pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation.No evidence has thus far emerged that the Chinese-owned app has turned over user data to the Chinese government.However, the app acknowledged last November that some of its China-based employees could access European user data. It admitted a month later that employees had used the data to spy on journalists, in an effort to identify employees who leaked confidential information to the media.rmt/nm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844424,Putin says China's Ukraine proposal could be basis for peace,"Russian President Vladimir Putin met again with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Tuesday during the latter's visit to Moscow.Xi was welcomed for talks with pomp and affair at the Grand Kremlin Palace as Russian soldiers dressed in 19th-century-style parade uniforms stood by.The importance of the Chinese premier's visit was highlighted by the pageantry and displays of excess from Russia's tsarist imperial past.Putin, who has until now been finding himself increasingly isolated on the world stage in light of the war in Ukraine, said that the two leaders had signed major agreements expanding their strategic cooperation as well as increasing Russian energy supplies to China.""The two statements we signed fully reflect the special nature of Russian-Chinese relations, which are a model of true partnership and strategic interaction,"" Putin said.Putin also said that China's proposals for peace in Ukraine could serve as a basis for a political settlement ""once the West and Kyiv are ready for it.""""We find that many of the positions in the peace plan put forward by China agree with Russian approaches,"" he added.Putin hailed the talks as ""successful and constructive"" after they concluded. Xi described the talks as ""open and friendly.""Earlier the two leaders had made remarks that were broadcast on Russian state TV.The Russian president touted his country's ability to feed China's energy demands. ""Russian business is able to meet China's growing demand for energy carriers,"" Putin said, adding that a new pipeline connecting the two was in the works that could in the future transport up to 50 billion cubic meters of gas per year.Trade with China is an important replacement for Russia after losing lucrative deals with EU countries. China will get a discount on its energy purchases.For his part, the Chinese leader talked about boosting working ties between the two neighbors. ""I propose strengthening our coordination and cooperation,"" Xi said. ""The early harvest of [our] cooperation can be seen, and further cooperation is being advanced,"" he added.Putin and Xi signed a joint declaration following talks on Tuesday in which they said that nuclear war can ""never"" be allowed to happen.""There can be no winners in a nuclear war, and it must never be unleashed,"" the statement said.Putin and Xi also pledged to bolster ""strategic cooperation"" in energy and high-tech industries.They said that Beijing and Moscow would use their currencies in mutual trade in order to reduce dependence on the West.The statement said that the two countries would conduct more joint sea and air patrols.""I am sure that Russian-Chinese cooperation has truly unlimited possibilities and prospects,"" Putin said following the talks.The Chinese president, who is one of only a few world leaders to visit Moscow since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, offered a reciprocated invitation to Putin to visit Beijing at a later point in the year.""I invite you to visit China as soon as possible,"" Xi said, while also extending the invite to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.The invite comes shortly after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin over the alleged deportation of children from Ukraine, but neither Russia nor China — nor even the US — recognizes the court's jurisdiction, meaning that a visit to Beijing would not put Putin in any danger.Western backers of Ukraine have expressed concern that the increasing relations between Moscow and Beijing may be a sign that China is planning on sending weapons to Russia which could drag out the war in Ukraine.China has not condemned the invasion, nor has it risked the ire of western states by helping Russia circumvent sanctions.ab,sdi/nm (dpa, AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844428,Flag football: The NFL's future from the USA to Vietnam,"With the NFL draft in April, the next generation of stars in the sport are on the verge of arriving on the big stage. But the future of American football lies beyond even the college game.In 2023, the NFL's Pro Bowl - an event with the league's star players - included a flag football game for the first time. Recognition of the inclusive, accessible version of American football that is played by people of all ages and genders thanks to its non-contact, low-cost, and easy to understand rules is also recognition of how flag football is reinvigorating the sport's participation numbers and development strategies.A new study led by the Boston University CTE Center has found that, for those playing traditional tackle football, ""repetitive blows to the head may also lead to less white matter in the brain, potentially causing impulsive behavior and other thinking-related problems, whether or not someone has CTE.""This is just the latest piece of evidence around the violent nature of American football and the concussions often associated with playing the game, both of which have led to a decline in those playing tackle football. As Forbes reported in 2020, in the 11 years between 2008 and 2019, ""the total number of youths aged 6 to 18 playing tackle football fell by more than 620,000.""The International Federation of American Football (IFAF) says there are an estimated 20 million flag football players across more than 100 countries.In Japan, half a million elementary school children per grade now have the chance to play flag football every year while in Mexico there were 100,000 new flag football players in 2021 alone.Most intriguingly, across IFAF's 72 national member federations, flag football will this year overtake tackle football in terms of organized participation opportunities.With Mexico's women beating the United States at the World Games in 2022, Papa New Guinea on the verge of entering its first IFAF tournament and US high school participation of women's flag football up 40% since 2018, it's clear the sport is booming across the world.Vietnam, also one of the 72 IFAF members, is also enjoying a boost in participation, albeit not at the same level.The sport has been around in the country for around a decade, but now it has approximately 400 registered players in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with the majority playing in the latter, where the creation of the Vietnam Flag Football League (VFFL) three years ago changed the game.""We started out struggling to get enough players each week. We used to play in random parks and the street on Saturday,"" Anetnga told DW. ""We have grown to now having real tournaments on real fields with sponsors.""Anetnga plays for The Swarm, one of six teams in a league now in its fourth season. By using Reclub, a digital platform that allows users to manage teams and competitions, review stats and be a part of the flag community, the VFFL's development has been steady.""This year is the first time the league has had more local Vietnamese players than foreigners, which speaks to the stability of the sport,"" Luis Aloma, co-founder of Reclub and fellow player, told DW.Duong Phan has been playing for nearly a year, and is President of the RMIT Wolves.""I think the spirit and energy of flag football connecting everyone is one of the factors that makes this sport is so special in Vietnam,"" he told DW.""A big part of why I like flag football is the people I've met,"" Anetnga said. ""I've made a lot of friends playing it, especially with the other Vietnamese women that play. It's quite fun and the lack of tackling/contact makes it even safer than soccer.""Some people underestimated me because I am a local girl, looking weak and they thought I would give up soon so I wanted to prove them wrong,"" Sue, who plays for the Saigon Southside Brotherhood, a team made up only of Vietnamese players, told DW.""Flag football has helped me learn how to play as a team and build trust in each other, regardless of age.""The next edition of the flag football world championship is in 2024 in Finland, where a record 24 men's and women's national teams are expected.Flag football is also among nine sports shortlisted for inclusion at the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, with a decision expected later this year. If the sport is included, IFAF believe that ""uniting football with the Games can deliver powerful growth benefits for all parties, unlocking new audiences and supercharging global participation.""Vietnam is certainly one of those countries. Flag football is on the verge of taking the next step in the country, and in doing so is a reminder of how popular and important this safer, more inclusive version of an already popular sport has become in recent years.""What I'd really like to see is Vietnamese kids playing it on their own the same way kids play soccer. Even just seeing kids throwing a football in the street would be cool,"" said Anetnga.Edited by Matt Ford",2023/03/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844432,Why oral storytelling will always need a human touch,"We all tell stories. From cave paintings depicting dramatic hunting scenes to hieroglyphics, poetry, song, films and computer-generated imagery, anthropologists have shown that storytelling is central to human existence. Stories allow people to connect, communicate and maintain their culture.This includes information about genealogy and social customs or cautionary tales that have been passed down through generations.""I think storytelling is pretty much everywhere and everything, right?"" Chitra Soundar, an Indian-British oral storyteller, tells DW.""Because advertising is storytelling. Us explaining anything in a classroom to children or 'Why I was late to school today' is all storytelling because the better the storyteller you are, the better you can get away with things. Our politicians are storytellers, otherwise they wouldn't be elected.""Oral storytelling is primarily done through voice and gestures and dates back millennia. Besides narration, oral storytelling encompasses poems, chants, songs and even dance.Chitra Soundar, who is a published children's author, began honing her oral storytelling skills early on in life.""I have been an oral storyteller from when I was probably four or five because our family is full of storytellers. My mum is an improv playwright. My grandmother used to tell us loads of stories,"" explains Soundar, who won her first storytelling prize at school, aged seven.Having once regaled her cousins with stories during sleepovers, today her primary audiences are mainly children at schools, libraries and literature events in the United Kingdom and abroad. She often retells stories that her Indian grandmother told her while growing up, ""what we call trickster tales, but they are all stories about right and wrong, about fairness and equality.""Besides that, Soundar has written and narrated stories for children that explain natural phenomena or climate change in different ways or that help them understand conflict resolution.""So, for me storytelling is pretty much the way I approach life. Because I'm a children's author, most of the stories I write and the stories I tell come from this hopeful world that we want to create for this generation and for the next,"" she explains.Chitra Soundar also says that storytelling as an art form will continue in the digital age; it is only the means through which stories are relayed have changed.""So, animation is storytelling. It just uses a different technology. So, whether it's TikTok or Facebook or whether we write a letter, we're still telling stories. We're just using a different technology for it. So, I don't think storytelling is going to change. It's going to change to suit the formats. It's going to change in length,"" explains Soundar.Yet, the uniqueness of oral storytelling is the human connection between the teller and listeners.Soundar agrees that from a spatial viewpoint, oral storytelling remains an intimate experience, whether it's in a large hall, in a small group or even at a sleepover, adding that even audiobooks for instance can't compete with this experience.She elaborates by describing how she regales her nephews with bedtime stories: ""We switch off the lights, we're ready for bed, and we make up a story in the darkness as they fall asleep. And that is, to me, oral storytelling that no digital tool can bring about because it's being made up on the spot and is knowing what the children like and using our family and our culture and making up stories.""Humans will never stop doing that, says Soundar, who previously worked in the tech industry before becoming a full-time author and storyteller.And finally given artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of producing text — even stories — the question arises if AI might give human storytellers a run for their money in due time.A common name that crops up is ChatGPT — a prototype artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the company OpenAI. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is an auto-generative chat that extracts data from textbooks, newspapers, websites and different articles.As ChatGPT's responses are not original creations of the human mind, they are not protected by copyright law, which means people are free to use its output without seeking permission or obtaining a license.Yet, this output may contain information that is protected by copyright law, such as text or images that are copied from other sources — making it a somewhat questionable source of creativity or originality.""I had a friend from Silicon Valley who emailed me and asked me, ‘Hey, what do you think about what's going on?' And I said, 'First of all, if I was a human being and I plagiarized all of this stuff and created a story, it's plagiarism',"" Chitra Soundar says, adding that stories by chatbots ""will be derivative, it won't be original, it won't have me in it.""Soundar is firm in her belief that bots won't be able to create stories as well as people can and believes that it is a ""craze that will come and go away."" Referring to a story she read recently, she explained that a short story magazine received around about 10,000 entries created by chat bots, all of which were rejected by the judges.""Because they're not going to make sense. They're not going to tug at your emotions. They're not going to make you laugh and cry and sing and interact with them.""",2023/03/20,,

But he was still dissatisfied,” said Mulaj, a high school teacher in the northeastern town of Bajram Curri, which is in one of the country's poorest regions.Five years later, her now 25-year-old son is working two jobs in Britain and hardly thinks of returning to his homeland. “Albania is in regress,” he complains to his mother.His path has been shared in recent years by thousands of young Albanians who have crossed the English Channel in small boats or inflatable dinghies to seek work in the U.K. Their odyssey reflects the country's anemic economy and a younger generation's longing for fresh opportunities.In 2018, only 300 people reached Britain by crossing the channel in small boats. The number rose to 45,000 in 2022, in part because of arrivals from Albania, a country in southern Europe that is negotiating for membership in the European Union.Other migrants were from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Unlike many countries that fuel migration, Albania is considered safe by U.K. officials.Britain is attractive to Albanians because it has a better economy and higher-paying jobs than neighboring countries such as Greece or Italy. Many Albanians also have family ties in the U.K. Birmingham, for instance, has a large immigrant population from the Albanian town of Kukes, on the border with Kosovo.The deputy mayor of Bajram Curri, Abedin Kernaja, said young people leave because of low wages and the difficulty of building ""a comfortable family life.” His two sons are in the U.K.Xhemile Tafaj, who owns a restaurant on a scenic plateau outside town, said “young people have no money to follow school, no job to work, no revenue at all.”In such an environment, “only old men have remained and soon there will be empty houses,” Tafaj said.Northeastern Albania is known for its natural Alpine beauty and green sloping landscape. The region is also famous for chestnuts, blueberries, blackberries and medicinal plants, as well as wool carpets and other handmade goods.But those products offer scant job opportunities. The only jobs are at town halls, schools and hospitals, plus a few more at cafes and restaurants.Petrit Lleshi, who owns a motel in Kukes, has struggled to find waiters for two years.“I would not blame a 25-year-old leaving because of the low salaries here,” Lleshi said. “What our country offers is not enough to build a proper life.”Few migrants seek a visa. They generally pay smugglers 5,000 to 20,000 euros ($5,300 to $21,200) for the dangerous, illegal crossing.Many migrants undertake the trip with the expectation of a secure job, only to find after arriving in the U.K. that they must work in cannabis-growing houses for up to two years to pay back the trafficking money, according to reports by Albanian news outlets.The steady stream of migrants has provoked clashes between British and Albanian leaders in recent months.U.K. interior minister Suella Braverman has described the arrivals as an “invasion on our southern coast” — words that Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama blasted as a “crazy narrative” and an attempt to cover up for the U.K.’s failed border policies.Albania also publicly protested what it called a “verbal lynching” by another U.K. official who made comments about Albanian immigrants. Rama accused the new U.K. Cabinet of scapegoating Albanians because it “has gone down a blind alley with its new policy resulting from Brexit.”Rama was is in London Thursday for talks on immigration with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and accused U.K. officials of “singling out” Albanians for political purposes. “It has been a very, very disgraceful moment for British politics,” he told the BBC.Sunak’s spokesman has said the U.K. welcomes and values Albanian migrants who come to the country legally, but that large numbers making illegal boat journeys to the U.K. are straining the asylum system.In a statement after the meeting, Sunak and Rama welcomed progress to date following a taskforce action on organized crime and new U.K. guidance designating Albania a safe country, with around 800 migrants returning to Albania since December.They also decided to create a joint team to assess Albania’s prison capacity until the end of April “with a view to returning all eligible Albanian nationals in the UK prison system.”Rama has argued that easing visa requirements would help reduce the number of people arriving illegally.In response to the spike in migration, some agencies are investing in programs that aim to offer opportunities to both countries — jobs for eager Albanians and a supply of remote workers for businesses in the U.K.Elias Mazloum of Albania's Social Development Investment group said that immigration is “a cancer.”“We are offering chemotherapy after a lot of morphine used so far only has delayed immigration,"" he said.Under his project, 10 companies in Ireland will employ 10 young Albanians to work remotely in an apprenticeship paying 500 euros ($530) per month in the first year. Participants get a certificate from Ireland’s Digital Marketing Institute and then are hired remotely for 1,000 euros ($1,060) per month.The vision is for the project to help establish a remote-work ecosystem in the region.“Albania, and in particular the northeast region, has the advantage of working from a blank canvas"" to attract digital nomads and encourage its young people to stay, said Declan Droney, a business trainer and consultant in Galway, in the west of Ireland.A British project in Kukes supports small and midsize businesses in tourism and agriculture and will open a school teaching different professions.The Albanian government has also offered incentives. Young couples who launch a small business will be exempt from taxes for up to three years, and couples who return from the U.K. will receive 5,000 euros ($5,300).Mazloum’s organization has negotiated with Vodafone Albania to offer free high-speed internet to remote workers.“The eyes cannot get enough from the beauty of this place — the food, the fresh air. This added to very hospitable people, ambitious youth who like to work hard,” Mazloum said. “Imagine if you give a little hope to the people here, what they could make this place.”___Sylvia Hui and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this story.___Follow Llazar Semini at https://twitter.com/lsemini",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844441,"Launch debut of 3D-printed rocket ends in failure, no orbit","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A rocket made almost entirely of 3D-printed parts made its launch debut Wednesday night, lifting off amid fanfare but failing three minutes into flight — far short of orbit.There was nothing aboard Relativity Space’s test flight except for the company’s first metal 3D print made six years ago.The startup wanted to put the souvenir into a 125-mile-high (200-kilometer-high) orbit for several days before having it plunge through the atmosphere and burn up along with the upper stage of the rocket.As it turned out, the first stage did its job following liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and separated as planned. But the upper stage appeared to ignite and then shut down, sending it crashing into the Atlantic.It was the third launch attempt from what once was a missile site. Relativity Space came within a half-second of blasting off earlier this month, with the rocket's engines igniting before abruptly shutting down.Although the upper stage malfunctioned and the mission did not reach orbit, “maiden launches are always exciting and today's flight was no exception,” Relativity Space launch commentator Arwa Tizani Kelly said after Wednesday's launch.Most of the 110-foot (33-meter) rocket, including its engines, came out of the company’s huge 3D printers in Long Beach, California.Relativity Space said 3D-printed metal parts made up 85% of the rocket, named Terran. Larger versions of the rocket will have even more and also be reusable for multiple flights.Other space companies also also rely on 3D-printing, but the pieces make up only a small part of their rockets.Founded in 2015 by a pair of young aerospace engineers, Relativity Space has attracted the attention of investors and venture capitalists.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844444,Violent French pension protests erupt as 1M demonstrate,"PARIS (AP) — More than 1 million people demonstrated across France on Thursday against unpopular pension reforms, and violence erupted in some places as unions called for new nationwide strikes and protests next week, coinciding with King Charles III's planned visit to France.The Interior Ministry said the march in Paris — marred by violence, as were numerous marches elsewhere — drew 119,000 people, which was a record for the capital during the pension protests. Polls say most French oppose President Emmanuel Macron's bill to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64, which he says is necessary to keep the system afloat.Building on the strong turnout, unions swiftly called for new protests and strikes on Tuesday when the British king is scheduled to visit Bordeaux on the second day of his trip to France. The heavy wooden door of the elegant Bordeaux City Hall was set afire and quickly destroyed Thursday evening by a members of an unauthorized demonstration, the Sud Ouest newspaper said.Nationwide, more than a million people joined protest marches held in cities and towns around the country Thursday, the ministry said.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, visiting police headquarters Thursday night as fires still burned in some Paris neighborhoods, gave assurance that security “poses no problem” and the British monarch will be “welcomed and welcomed well.”He said there was “enormous degrading” of public buildings and commerce Thursday, “far more important than in precedent demonstrations.”“There are troublemakers, often extreme left, who want to take down the state and kill police and ultimately take over the institutions,” the minister said.The demonstrations were held a day after Macron further angered his critics by standing strong on the retirement bill that his government forced through parliament without a vote.“While the (president) tries to turn the page, this social and union movement ... confirms the determination of the world of workers and youth to obtain the withdrawal of the reform,” the eight unions organizing protests said in a statement. It called for localized action this weekend and new nationwide strikes and protests Tuesday.Strikes upended travel as protesters blockaded train stations, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, refineries and ports.In Paris, street battles between police and black-clad, masked groups who attacked at least two fast food restaurants, a supermarket and a bank reflected intensifying violence and drew attention away from the tens of thousands of peaceful marchers.Police, pelted by Molotov cocktails, objects and fireworks, charged multiple times and used tear gas to disperse rioters. A haze of tear gas fumes covered part of the Place de l'Opera, where demonstrators converged at the march's end. Darmanin said radicals numbered some 1,500.Violence marred other marches, notably in the western cities of Nantes, Rennes and Lorient — where an administrative building was attacked and the courtyard of the police station was set afire and its windows broken — and in Lyon, in the southeast.Thursday's nationwide protests were the ninth union-organized demonstrations since January, when opponents still hoped that parliament would reject Macron's measure to raise the retirement age. But the government forced it through using a special constitutional measure.In an interview Wednesday, Macron refused to budge from his position that a new law is necessary to keep retirement coffers funded. Opponents proposed other solutions, including higher taxes on the wealthy or companies, which Macron says would hurt the economy. He insisted the government’s bill to raise the retirement age must be implemented by the end of the year.The Constitutional Council must now approve the measure.“We are trying to say before the law is enacted ... that we have to find a way out and we continue to say that the way out is the withdrawal of the law,"" the chief of the moderate CFDT trade union, Laurent Berger, told The Associated Press.High-speed and regional trains, the Paris metro and public transportation systems in other major cities were disrupted. About 30% of flights at Paris Orly Airport were canceled.The Eiffel Tower and the Versailles Palace, where the British monarch is to dine with Macron, were closed Thursday due to the strikes.Violence, a recurring issue at protests, has intensified in recent days. Darmanin said that 12,000 security forces were in the French streets Thursday, with 5,000 in Paris,The Education Ministry said in a statement that about 24% of teachers walked off the job in primary and middle schools on Thursday, and 15% in high schools.At Paris' Gare de Lyon train station, several hundred strikers walked on railway tracks to prevent trains from moving, brandishing flares and chanting “and we will go, and we will go until withdrawal"" and “Macron, go away.”""This year perhaps maybe our holidays won’t be so great,"" said Maxime Monin, 46, who stressed that employees like himself, who work in public transport, are not paid on strike days. ""But I think it’s worth the sacrifice.”In the northern suburbs of Paris, several dozen union members blocked a bus depot in Pantin, preventing about 200 vehicles from getting out during rush hour.Nadia Belhoum, a 48-year-old bus driver participating in the action, criticized Macron’s decision to force the higher retirement age through.“The president of the Republic ... is not a king, and he should listen to his people,"" she said.___Associated Press journalists Sylvie Corbet, Helena Alves, Masha Macpherson and Jeffrey Schaeffer in Paris contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844445,Chinese diplomats oppose US military presence in Philippines,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Chinese diplomats expressed their strong opposition to an expanded United States military presence in the Philippines in closed-door talks with their Filipino counterparts Thursday in Manila, a Filipino official said, underscoring the intense U.S.-China rivalry in the region.The Philippine official, who attended the meeting, told The Associated Press about China's intense objections on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to discuss what transpired at the start of the two-day talks. The Filipino diplomats responded by saying the decision to allow an expanded American military presence was in their national interest and would boost Philippine capability to respond to natural disasters, the official said, suggesting it was not aimed at China.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong and Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro led the talks aimed at assessing overall relations between the two sides amid thorny issues, including Beijing’s alarm over a Philippine decision to allow the U.S. military to expand its presence to a northern region facing the Taiwan Strait and escalating spats in the South China Sea.The discussions on Friday will focus on the long-seething territorial spats in the disputed waterway, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila.The back-to-back meetings are the first under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a state visit to Beijing in January, where both agreed to expand ties, pursue talks on potential joint oil and gas explorations and manage territorial disputes amicably.In early February, the Marcos administration announced it would allow rotating batches of American forces to indefinitely station in four more Philippine military camps. Those are in addition to five local bases earlier designated under a 2014 defense pact between the longtime treaty allies.Marcos said Wednesday the four new military sites would include areas in the northern Philippines. That location has infuriated Chinese officials because it would provide U.S. forces a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan.The Americans would also have access to military areas on the western Philippine island province of Palawan, Marcos said, adding that the U.S. military presence under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was aimed at boosting coastal defense.Palawan faces the South China Sea, a key passage for global trade that Beijing claims virtually in its entirety but a United Nations-backed arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that historical claim had no legal basis under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Seas.China had dismissed the ruling, which Washington and other Western governments recognize, and continues to defy it.When asked to react to the Philippine decision, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a news briefing Wednesday in Beijing that defense cooperation between countries “needs to be conducive to regional peace and stability and not targeted at or harmful to the interests of any third party.”Wang warned countries in the region “to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the U.S.” without naming the Philippines.A recent statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Manila was more blunt and warned that the Manila government's security cooperation with Washington “will drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife and damage its economic development at the end of the day.”The territorial conflicts have persisted as a major irritant in relations early in the six-year term of Marcos, whose administration has filed at least 77 of more than 200 diplomatic protests by the Philippines against China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters since last year alone.That included a Feb. 6 incident when a Chinese coast guard ship aimed a military-grade laser that briefly blinded some crew members of a Philippine patrol vessel off a disputed shoal. Marcos summoned the Chinese ambassador to Manila to express concern over the incident, but Beijing said the Philippine vessel intruded into Chinese territorial waters and its coast guard used a harmless laser gadget to monitor the vessel’s movement.The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. The U.S. moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid its disputes with China in the South China Sea.The U.S. denied Chinese claims Thursday that its military had driven away an American guided-missile destroyer from operating around disputed islands in the South China Sea, with the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet saying in a statement the USS Milius was conducting routine operations in the waterway and was not expelled.China’s Southern Theatre Command had earlier said it had forced the USS Milius away from waters around the Paracel Islands, which China calls Xisha, after it “illegally entered China’s Xisha territorial waters without approval from the Chinese government, undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea.”Two senior Filipino officials told the AP that the Philippine government would extend the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which allows the temporary presence of U.S. forces and their defense equipment in the country. The Philippine Constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreign troops in the country and their involvement in local combat.The agreement, signed in 2014, would initially be effective for 10 years and would remain in force automatically unless terminated by either side with a one-year advance written notice.The two officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they lack authority to discuss the issue publicly.___Associated Press journalist Joeal Calupitan contributed.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844446,EU leaders endorse joint ammo purchases for Ukraine,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders endorsed a plan Thursday for sending Ukraine 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition within the next 12 months to help the country counter Russia’s invasion forces.EU foreign and defense ministers approved the plan for a fast-track purchasing procedure earlier this week, and the leaders of the bloc’s 27 member nations gave it their political blessing at a summit in Brussels Thursday.“Taking into account the security and defense interests of all member states, the European Council welcomes the agreement ... to deliver ground-to-ground and artillery ammunition to Ukraine and, if requested, missiles,” the meeting’s conclusions on Ukraine read.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked leaders for the initiative earlier during a video call.Zelenskyy, who spoke from a moving train as he visited front-line areas, said: “Not only months and weeks, but also days are important. The faster we act together, the more lives we save.” according to video posted on the presidential website.“But, dear colleagues, don’t you feel that we have fewer new successes than new protractions in our joint efforts? Unfortunately, this is the case. And the Kremlin sees this. This moves us further away from achieving peace,” he said.Zelenskyy also asked leaders to deliver modern aircraft and long-range missiles to help Ukraine's resistance.With Ukraine facing ammunition shortages after more than a year of fighting, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas brought to the table last month the idea of the EU setting up a joint purchasing plan similar to the one devised during the coronavirus pandemic to buy vaccines.“What is critical is sending ammunition to Ukraine fast, because that might bring a change in this war,” Kallas said as she arrived at the summit.Under the plan, the European Defense Agency will — in parallel with deliveries — aggregate requests from member states to restock, and lead a fast-track procedure for direct negotiations with industrial providers of ammunition in Europe.According to various estimates, Ukraine is firing 6,000-7,000 artillery shells a day, around a third of Russia’s total.“The EU supports Ukraine in its relentless quest for freedom,” European Council President Charles Michel said. “We stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said this week that he secured approval for earmarking 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to encourage member nations to provide artillery shells from their existing stocks and any pending orders. Another 1 billion euros would go toward accelerating new orders and encouraging countries to work together on making purchases through the European Defense Agency or in groups of at least three nations.Hungary has said it will not take part in getting ammunition to Ukraine, citing its commitment to peace, but said it wouldn't prevent other members from doing so by blocking the deal.Last month, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said the EU was partly to blame for prolonging Russia’s war in Ukraine by sanctioning Russia and supplying Ukraine with money and weapons, rather than seeking to negotiate peace with Moscow.Bulgaria's president, Rumen Radev, also ruled out the delivery of shells as long as a caretaker government remains in charge in the country.“This is our sovereign decision,” he said. “Bulgaria will support European diplomatic efforts to restore peace.”Leaders also discussed the possibility of topping up with an extra 3.5 billion euros the European Peace Facility — a fund being used to reimburse member countries that provide weapons, ammunition and military support to Ukraine.U.N. Secretary General António Guterres joined the EU leaders for lunch on Thursday. Guterres described a grim global situation, with the world facing a “perfect storm” in many parts of the world.“More hunger, more poverty, less education, less health services,” he said. “And it is clear that our international financial system is not fit for purpose to deal with such a huge challenge.”The EU leaders also discussed the fight against climate change, the bloc's competitiveness and its response to the $369 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, as well as migration. Friday’s discussions will focus on economic and financial issues.___Veselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, contributed to this story.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844447,Netanyahu vows to unite Israel but opponents dismiss pledge,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to “mend the rift” in a nation deeply divided over his proposed overhaul of the country’s judiciary. But he offered no details on how he intends to do so and gave no indication that he would slow down the plan.Netanyahu delivered his appeal in a nationally televised address after another day of mass protests across the country against the plan, and hours after his parliamentary coalition passed the first in a series of laws that make up the overhaul. His vague pledges were quickly rejected by the protest movement, which said it would continue to oppose “Netanyahu’s attempt to become a dictator.”Protesters blocked traffic on main highways and scuffled with police in unrest that shows no sign of abating. Police used water cannons to disperse crowds, and dozens of people — including leaders of the protest movement — were arrested.The government’s plan has plunged the nearly 75-year-old nation into one of its worst domestic crises.Netanyahu and his allies want to weaken the powers of the judiciary, saying unelected Supreme Court justices and other judges wield too much power.Critics say the changes, which would give Netanyahu and his conservative allies the final say in choosing the country’s judges, will destroy a delicate system of checks and balances. They also say Netanyahu has a conflict of interest while he is on trial for multiple corruption charges.In his speech, Netanyahu said he understood the concerns of both sides. He accused the Supreme Court of intervening in political issues but also acknowledged concerns by his opponents that a narrow parliamentary majority could impose its will and harm the rights of LGBTQ people, Palestinian citizens and other minorities.“We will ensure the basic rights of all Israeli citizens — Jews and non-Jews, secular and religious, women, the LGBTQ community, everyone without exception,” he said. “I will do everything to calm the waters and mend the rift in the nation, because we are family.”As he spoke, thousands of people continued to march in cities across Israel, including a large crowd outside of his private residence in Jerusalem. Netanyahu pushed back his departure on an official trip to Britain until 4 a.m. on Friday to deal with the crisis.His opponents quickly rejected the speech.The grassroots protest movement said it would press ahead with the demonstrations, which have taken place weekly for the past three months.“Tonight we saw a dictator-in-the-making who instead of stopping the legal coup, decided to continue with the hostile political takeover of the Supreme Court,” it said.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu made clear he has “no intention of holding true dialogue.” He called on “responsible” members of Netanyahu’s Likud party to speak up against the plan.Among Lapid’s targets is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a top Likud official who met with Netanyahu shortly before the speech.According to Israeli media, Gallant voiced his concerns that objections by Israeli reservists and other security forces were hurting Israel’s international image and power of deterrence. However, Gallant abruptly canceled a planned statement in which he was expected to call on Netanyahu to freeze the plan.The opposition is rooted in broad swaths of society — including business leaders and top legal officials. Even the country’s military, seen as a beacon of stability by Israel’s Jewish majority, is enmeshed in the political conflict, as some reservists are refusing to show up for duty over the changes. Israel’s international allies have also expressed concern.In a first step of the overhaul, Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition approved legislation that would protect the Israeli leader from being deemed unfit to rule because of his trial and claims of a conflict of interest. Critics say the law is tailor-made for Netanyahu and encourages corruption.The law to protect Netanyahu passed in a 61-47 vote in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, after a debate that ran through the night. It stipulates that a prime minister can only be deemed unfit to rule for health or mental reasons and that only he or his government can make that decision.Civil society groups have called on the attorney general to declare him unfit to rule over his legal problems. The attorney general has already barred Netanyahu from direct involvement in the legal overhaul, saying he is at risk of a conflict of interest.The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good governance organization, said it would challenge the new law in court.On Thursday, protesters launched a fourth midweek day of demonstrations. They blocked major thoroughfares, set tires ablaze near an important seaport and draped a large Israeli flag and a banner with the country’s Declaration of Independence over the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City.The protests have intensified in recent weeks, with a number of senior Cabinet ministers accosted and heckled by vocal crowds while making public appearances. Netanyahu called on opposition leaders to “stop the anarchy immediately.”A protest took place Thursday night in Bnei Brak, a large ultra-Orthodox city near Tel Aviv. The overhaul crisis has magnified a longstanding rift between secular Jewish Israelis and religious ones over how much of a role religion should play in their day-to-day lives.Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers in government are central drivers of the overhaul because they believe the courts are a threat to their traditional way of life. In contrast, secular opponents to the changes fear they will open the door to religious coercion. They also object to exemptions granted to ultra-Orthodox men from military duty, which is mandatory for most Jews.Along with Thursday’s demonstrations, tens of thousands have been showing up for weekly protests each Saturday night.Netanyahu’s government rejected a compromise proposal earlier this month meant to ease the crisis. It said that it would slow the pace of the changes, pushing most of them to after a monthlong parliamentary recess in April.But the government is plowing forward on a key part of the overhaul, which would grant the government control over who becomes a judge. That measure is expected to pass next week.Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving wealthy associates and powerful media moguls. He denies wrongdoing and dismisses critics who say he could find an escape route from the charges through the legal overhaul his government is advancing.Israel’s Palestinian minority has largely avoided participating in the demonstrations. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel’s democratic ideals have long been tarnished by the country’s 55-year, open-ended occupation of lands the Palestinians seek for an independent state and the treatment of Palestinian Israeli citizens, who face discrimination in many spheres.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844473,'Kia ora whanau': Taiwan welcomes Maori athletes to Indigenous Games,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The 2023 Taiwan National Indigenous Games will open on Friday (March 24) with 17 Indigenous Taiwanese groups attending alongside a delegation of New Zealand Maori athletes, who will join the competition for the first time this year.Chairman of the Council for Indigenous Peoples (CIP), Icyang Parod (夷將·拔路兒), said this is the first time a team from New Zealand has sent a delegation to participate, and that a type of Maori music and dance performance called Kapa haka will be featured. The sporting event aims to deepen exchanges between Austronesian peoples of Taiwan and the wider Pacific region, the CIP said on Thursday (March 23).The Maori team has 37 members, and has been in Taiwan since March 12, participating in CIP funded training in the basics of Taiwanese Indigenous hunting, woodcutting, and other techniques so that they can participate in the games. Icyang said that despite the Maori team’s short training time, they would prove to be formidable competition.“They only trained for one day in the woodcutting event, and they completed it in just over 19 minutes,” which is about 30 minutes faster than previous years’ teams, he said. “This year’s field competition between the teams ought to be exciting.”Taiwan’s Austronesian links have been promoted by the central government in recent years, as the country seeks to deepen connections in the Pacific region under the New Southbound Policy. Taiwan’s Austronesian connection with Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian peoples was first popularized in the 1980s, when scholars presented a theory suggesting an initial wave of migration of people to Southeast Asia and the Pacific originated from Taiwan in around 1000 BCE.""Kia ora"" is a Maori greeting that has also become a common part of New Zealand English. ""Whanau"" is the Maori word for ""family.""",2023/03/23,1018,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844559,'On tour in hell': Wounded Ukrainian soldiers evacuated,"DONETSK REGION, Ukraine (AP) — Their hands are blackened and grimy from the fight. Some are still wearing their combat boots, small flecks of black soil from the battlefield clinging to their torsos, bare under the emergency blanket.With bandaged heads and splinted limbs, the wounded soldiers are stretchered into the waiting medical evacuation bus by members of the Hospitallers, a Ukrainian organization of volunteer paramedics who work on the front lines in the war in Ukraine.The soldiers were all wounded recently in fierce fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have been pressing advances. The battle in Bakhmut, a city now encircled on three sides by Russian troops, has been particularly bloody, with soldiers describing endless days of combat, often at close quarters.“We’ve been on tour in hell,” said Yura, who like all the soldiers would give only his first name for safety reasons. He lay on a bed in a specially equipped medical bus, with his arm and leg badly wounded.Blood stained the heavy bandages around his right forearm, which metal rods held together to stabilize the shattered bone. His bicep bore a deepening purple bruise left by the tourniquet applied to staunch the blood and save his life. The time it was put on was scrawled in pen across his right cheek: 19:45.“They tried to get me with grenades,” he said.Unlike most of the wounded, Yura is not Ukrainian. He is Russian, but fought on the side of Ukraine in Bakhmut since November. The Moscow native said he moved to Ukraine before the war, as did a friend of his who is also fighting for Ukraine and had spent 2 1/2 years in prison in Russia for reposting a social media post saying Crimea — annexed by Russia in 2014 — was Ukrainian.It was his own countrymen who wounded him.He was in Bakhmut for “eight days of almost uninterrupted combat.” But he and his unit managed to repel all the assaults on their position, he said.“On the fifth day without sleep, I had thoughts that I would go crazy,” he said. “In fact, it’s impossible to sleep there. They shell it in such a way that the earth trembles.”He showed a video on his mobile phone shot inside Bakhmut: the interior of a devastated building, holes punched through the walls by artillery, rubble strewn across the floor. Beyond the twisted metal remnants of a window, a glimpse of an urban hellscape of shattered buildings and splintered trees.Yaroslav, 37, was also wounded in Bakhmut. The battle was so close that Russian and Ukrainian forces fought room to room inside buildings, he said.Pale and with an almost imperceptible tremor, his lips nearly white, he propped himself up on an elbow as he waited to be carried on a stretcher from an ambulance onto the bus for the trip to a better equipped hospital in a city further west.An explosion had sent shrapnel through his leg, piercing it below the knee.“I came to my senses and saw that there is nobody around me, and then I understood that there is blood oozing into my shoe, blood squelching in my shoe,” he said, quietly drawing on a cigarette. “It was totally dark.”As his unit had attempted to move from its position, the Russian forces began shelling.“When I left, everything was on fire,” he recalled. There were dead Russians lying on the ground, and dead Ukrainians, too. “People were running in the road and falling down, because mines were exploding, drones were flying.”He finished his cigarette and lay back on the stretcher. His eyes fixed on some invisible point before him, and he slowly closed his eyelids. The Hospitallers lifted his stretcher and carried it to the waiting bus.The medically equipped bus — named “Austrian,” the nickname of a Hospitaller paramedic who was killed in a crash of another medical evacuation bus — can carry six severely wounded patients on stretchers, and several more walking wounded.“We’re doing evacuations as necessary. It could be twice or three times per day,” chief paramedic Kateryna Seliverstova said.Bought with money from donations, the bus is better equipped medically than even some state hospitals, Seliverstova said. It is stocked with monitors, electrocardiographs, ventilators and oxygen tanks and can care for severely ill patients while they are transported to a major hospital.“This project is really important, because it helps to economize resources,” Seliverstova said. “We can transport six injured people who are in serious or moderate condition,” whereas a normal ambulance can only transport one.All six places were taken on the trip evacuating Yura and Yaroslav. Across the aisle from Yura, another soldier slipped in and out of consciousness, a brown bandage wrapped around his head. A paramedic checked his vital signs on a monitor, and helped him sip water from a syringe.Behind him, a man coughed deeply. Only the blackened tip of his nose was visible from his heavily bandaged head. He had suffered extensive burns to his face.Yura spoke softly to one of the paramedics. Without his expression changing, tears began rolling down the side of his face. The paramedic leaned over and gently wiped them away.___Vasilisa Stepanenko and Evgeniy Maloletka contributed from Donetsk region, Ukraine.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844561,US denies Chinese claim it drove away American destroyer,"BANGKOK (AP) — The United States denied Chinese claims Thursday that its military had driven away an American guided-missile destroyer from operating around disputed islands in the South China Sea as tensions rise in the region between the two powers.The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said that a statement from China's Southern Theatre Command that it had forced the USS Milius away from waters around the Paracel Islands — called Xisha by China — was “false.”“USS Milius is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea and was not expelled,” said Lt. j.g. Luka Bakic in response to a query from The Associated Press.“The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” Bakic added.Bakic would not comment on whether the ship had been operating in immediate proximity of the Paracel Islands, which are in the South China Sea a few hundred kilometers (miles) off the coast of Vietnam and the Chinese province of Hainan, or whether there had been any sort of a confrontation.China occupies the Paracel Islands, but they are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.Col. Tian Junli, a spokesperson for China’s Southern Theatre Command, said earlier that the Chinese navy had followed and monitored the USS Milius after it “illegally entered China's Xisha territorial waters without approval from the Chinese government, undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea.”He said that the Chinese navy and air force then forced away ""the U.S. warship in accordance with the law.”""The theatre troops will maintain a state of high alert at all times and take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said.The incident comes amid growing tensions between China and the United States in the region, as Washington pushes back at Beijing's growingly assertive posture in the South China Sea and elsewhere.China claims ownership over virtually the entire strategic waterway, through which around $5 trillion in global trade transits each year and which holds highly valuable fish stocks and undersea mineral resources.The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan also have competing claims.The U.S. itself has no claims to the waters, but has deployed Navy and Air Force assets to patrol the waterway for decades and says freedom of navigation and overflight is in the American national interest.China has frequently responded angrily, accusing the U.S. of meddling in Asian affairs and demanding it leave the region where it has had a naval presence for more than a century.Following the incident with the USS Milius, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing that “the U.S. should immediately stop such violations and provocations.”“China will continue to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said.",2023/03/23,3324,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844562,UK central bank hikes rates like Fed amid financial turmoil,"LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England extended its battle against inflation Thursday, announcing an 11th consecutive interest rate increase despite concerns about the economic fallout from troubles in the global financial system.Britain’s central bank boosted its key rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25%, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved a similar move to tame price increases that are crimping household budgets and slowing economic growth.The decision followed unexpected news that U.K. inflation accelerated to 10.4% in February, driven by the cost of food, clothing and dining out. Before the figures were released Wednesday, many analysts had expected the Bank of England to keep rates on hold following the collapse of two U.S. banks and the hastily arranged takeover of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse.“A banking curve ball has been thrown into the Bank of England’s already tricky juggling act, but for now the eye of policymakers is still firmly trained on catching inflation and bringing it under control,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, which manages more than 120 billion pounds ($147 billion) for investors.Still, Thursday’s move was the smallest rate hike since May 2022, with the Bank of England forecasting a drop in inflation to 2.9% by the end of the year as energy costs fall and the big price increases recorded last year drop out of calculations.As it did last month, the central bank indicated that it no longer has a presumption for further rate increases, saying only that it would closely monitor price pressures in the economy.“If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required,” the bank said.Raising interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, which reduces spending and relieves upward pressure on prices. But it also tends to slow economic growth.Central bankers worldwide are struggling to balance competing economic demands as they try to rein in inflation, which erodes savings and increases costs for consumers and businesses, without unnecessarily damaging economies weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and the turbulence it unleashed on the global financial system, policymakers are concerned that banks around the world may curtail lending, further crimping economic growth.The Bank of England said Thursday that it had determined that British banks are “resilient.”“The U.K. banking system maintains robust capital and strong liquidity positions and is well placed to continue supporting the economy in a wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher interest rates,” the central bank said.That echoed the words of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who sought to reassure Americans that their bank deposits were safe as the Fed raised its key rate by a quarter-point Wednesday.The Swiss central bank also went higher, hiking by half a point Thursday and declaring that the government-orchestrated takeover of Credit Suisse by Swiss rival UBS “put a halt to the crisis.”A week ago, the European Central Bank increased rates by a half-point, brushing aside the financial market jitters and calling Europe’s banking sector resilient.The Bank of England was among the first to begin raising borrowing costs after a prolonged period of low interest rates following the 2008 global financial crisis. In 11 hikes since December 2021, the key rate went from just 0.1% to 4.25%.The rapid rise in interest rates worldwide squeezed the finances of some banks because it reduced the value of their bond holdings.As they assess the potential impact that higher rates are having on banks, policymakers also are weighing how long it will take recent increases to flow through to the broader economy.If they wait too long to stop raising rates, they risk slamming the breaks on already anemic growth. If they stop too soon, they risk inflation becoming embedded in the economy.Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at the U.K.-based fund manager abrdn, said he expects Thursday’s move to be the last rate increase of this cycle because the impact of past hikes and recent market volatility will begin to slow economic growth.“However, there is still a significant risk of one final rate increase if inflation proves to be a bit stickier in coming months,” he said.The Bank of England will have to make that decision in an even more complex environment than other central bankers.A high level of dependence on natural gas and limited storage capacity left British energy users particularly exposed to the surge in global gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Britain also is still adjusting to the impact of leaving the European Union, which reduced trade with its neighbors, curtailed the supply of cheap labor and slowed economic growth.U.K. inflation is stuck above 10%, while it dropped to 8.5% last month in the 20 countries sharing the euro and to 6% in the U.S.Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt applauded the central bank’s decision.“With rising prices strangling growth and eroding family budgets, the sooner we grip inflation the better for everyone,” he said.",2023/03/24,,World

This growth can be attributed to an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease, and technological advances within dialysis machines. This market expansion can be attributed to the rising number of patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). As more people are diagnosed with this condition, demand for hemodialysis services will continue to increase.However, there are some limitations which could hinder its progress. Hemodialysis is more expensive than other medical care treatments and patients who require it may not have the financial means to cover it, leading to a decrease in demand.Fresenius

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844592,The Impact of AI on Content Creation and Marketing Strategies,"Over the past few years, marketing has undergone a dramatic evolution, with AI emerging as one of the most significant technological breakthroughs. Businesses of all sizes have leveraged AI tools to streamline their campaigns and craft more personalized and captivating content for their target audiences. In this article, we’ll investigate how AI tools are revolutionizing content production and marketing strategies alike – and why this revolution is important for all marketers.Enhancing Content PersonalizationOne of the major advantages of AI tools in marketing is their capacity to create highly personalized content tailored to specific target audiences. By analyzing large amounts of data, businesses gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. With this understanding, businesses can craft targeted and tailored messages that resonate with their readers and encourage them to engage with their brand.Improved Efficiency and Productivity in Content CreationAI tools have the potential to drastically boost efficiency and productivity in content creation. For instance, AI-powered content creation tools can automate the writing process, enabling businesses to produce high-quality material in less time while cutting costs associated with hiring writers or editors.Enhance SEO and Content OptimizationAI tools can also be employed for SEO and content optimization. AI-powered SEO tools analyze search trends to identify the most pertinent keywords and phrases to include in content, increasing its visibility and driving more visitors to a business website.Optimizing Audience Targeting and EngagementAnother advantage of AI in marketing is that it helps businesses better target their audience and boost engagement. AI-powered tools can analyze customer data to detect key trends and insights, which then become the basis for creating targeted marketing campaigns. By reaching the right audience with the appropriate message, businesses can improve engagement levels and boost conversions.Increased Accuracy in Data Analysis and Predictive AnalyticsAI tools can also assist businesses in making more informed decisions based on accurate data analysis and predictive analytics. By analyzing customer information, these AI-powered tools are able to detect patterns and trends that human analysts may not be immediately aware of. This enables businesses to make data-driven decisions that are more likely to lead to success.Current AI Technology Has LimitationsAI tools have the potential to revolutionize marketing strategies, however, there are some limitations with current AI technology. For instance, these programs only work with data that is available to them, meaning inaccurate results may occur if that data is incomplete or outdated.Data Quality and Quantity MatterAI tools rely heavily on the quality and quantity of available data. If the information is inaccurate or incomplete, then the results generated by AI tools may not be reliable. Furthermore, businesses that lack access to large enough datasets may find that using AI tools fails to yield useful insights.Difficulty Replicating Human Creativity and Emotional IntelligenceDuplicating human creativity and emotional intelligence requires great skill, patience, and persistence.Another limitation of AI tools is their potential in replicating human creativity and emotional intelligence. While AI programs can automate certain parts of content production like grammar and syntax, they may not produce work as captivating or emotionally poignant as that created by human writers.Ethical Considerations and Potential Biases in AI-Generated ContentAI tools also raise ethical concerns regarding the potential bias in AI-generated content. If AI systems are trained on biased data, then they may produce biased outcomes. Furthermore, businesses that rely too heavily on AI content may lose touch with their audiences and brand voice.Chatbots and Virtual Assistants for Customer ServiceOne of the most popular applications of AI in marketing is customer service. Chatbots and virtual assistants can be employed to offer 24/7 assistance, answer frequently asked questions, and even provide personalized product recommendations. Businesses can benefit by increasing customer satisfaction levels while decreasing the workload on their customer service teams.Content Creation and CurationAI tools can also be utilized for content creation and curation automation. AI-powered content creation tools generate articles, blog posts, and social media posts based on predetermined guidelines or keywords – helping businesses produce high-quality material quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, these AI-powered content curation tools help companies identify pertinent and engaging material to share with their audience.Email MarketingAI tools can also be utilized to enhance email marketing campaigns. AI-powered tools analyze customer behavior and preferences to create tailored email messages that are more likely to lead to conversions. For instance, AI programs may use content a customer has engaged with previously and use that knowledge to suggest products or services they may be interested in.Social Media AdvertisingAI tools can be employed to optimize social media advertising campaigns. AI-powered tools analyze customer data to determine the most efficient times to post content and select effective messaging and imagery. Furthermore, these AI-enabled programs help businesses identify relevant audiences to target with their ads on social media.Search Engine Optimization and Content OptimizationAs previously noted, AI tools can also be utilized for SEO and content optimization. AI-powered SEO programs analyze search trends to identify the most pertinent keywords and phrases to include in the content. Furthermore, these AI-enabled solutions assist businesses with optimizing their material for readability and engagement.AI tools are revolutionizing marketing and content creation, offering businesses a range of advantages such as enhanced personalization, increased efficiency and productivity, improved SEO/content optimization, and better audience targeting and engagement. However, current AI technology also has limitations; businesses must consider ethical considerations and potential bias in AI-generated content. Nevertheless, the use of AI tools by marketers will likely continue to increase in importance over the coming years as businesses strive to stay ahead of competitors by providing personalized yet engaging content to their audiences.",2023/03/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844601,5 Emerging Trends in Affiliate Marketing You Need to Know,"Affiliate marketing has been around for a while, but it has become increasingly popular in recent years. This marketing strategy involves promoting products or services to your audience, and when they make a purchase, you earn a commission. It’s a win-win situation for both the marketer and the company, as the company gets more sales, and the marketer gets a cut of the profits. In this blog post, we will explore some of the trends in affiliate marketing that have emerged in the past few years.Micro-influencer marketing is the latest trend in affiliate marketing, and it’s gaining popularity fast. A micro-influencer is someone with a smaller following on social media, typically under 10,000 followers. Unlike macro-influencers with millions of followers, micro-influencers tend to have a more loyal and engaged audience. They also tend to have a specific niche they cater to, making it easier to target specific audiences.As a result, micro-influencers are becoming an essential part of affiliate marketing strategies. Brands now partner with micro-influencers to promote their products and services to a highly engaged audience, leading to higher conversion rates and sales.Video content is becoming increasingly popular, and it’s no surprise that affiliate marketers are incorporating video into their strategies. A video is a powerful tool for promoting products, as it allows viewers to see the product in action and get a better sense of its benefits.Affiliate marketers are now creating videos to showcase the products they are promoting, which can be shared on social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. This strategy has been proven to be effective, as video content tends to get higher engagement rates than other types of content.Influencer marketing networks have been around for a while, but they are becoming more prevalent in affiliate marketing. These networks are designed to connect influencers with brands, making it easier for both parties to work together.Influencer marketing networks are becoming popular because they offer a one-stop shop for brands looking to partner with influencers. Instead of reaching out to influencers individually, brands can use these networks to find influencers that match their brand and audience.Social commerce is the combination of social media and e-commerce, and it’s becoming a popular trend in affiliate marketing. Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest are now allowing businesses to set up shops, making it easier for users to make purchases directly from their social media feeds.As an affiliate marketer, you can take advantage of social commerce by promoting products on social media platforms that offer these features. This can lead to higher conversion rates, as users are more likely to make a purchase when they can do so directly from their social media feeds.Personalized marketing is becoming increasingly popular, and it’s no different in affiliate marketing. Personalized marketing involves tailoring your marketing efforts to specific individuals based on their interests, behavior, and demographics.Website builder software – Many people who want to start an online business don’t have the technical skills to create a website from scratch. Website builder software, such as Wix, Squarespace, or Builderall provides an easy solution for creating a professional-looking website. As an affiliate marketer, you could promote these products to your audience and earn a commission on any sales made through your unique affiliate link.Health and wellness products – The health and wellness industry is booming, and there is a wide range of products available, from supplements to fitness equipment. You could promote these products to your audience as an affiliate marketer, especially if you have a health and wellness-focused blog or social media account. Popular brands in this space include GNC, Bodybuilding.com, and Vitacost.Travel products – If you have an audience interested in travel, promoting travel-related products could be a good fit. This can include things like luggage, travel accessories, or even booking websites like Expedia or Booking.com. With more people traveling, there’s a growing market for these types of products, making it a good opportunity for affiliate marketers.In conclusion, these are just some of the trends in affiliate marketing that have emerged in recent years. As an affiliate marketer, it’s essential to stay up-to-date with these trends and incorporate them into your strategies. By doing so, you can increase your chances of success and generate more revenue.",2023/03/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844602,"Global Animal Genetics Market Products, Financial Information, and Top Developments 2023-2030","The global animal genetics market in terms of revenue is estimated to be worth USD 7.1 billion in 2023 and is poised to reach USD 11.78 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2023 to 2030.Animal genetics is a branch of genetics that studies the appearance, breeding, colour and health of animals. It employs standard genetic concepts as well as hybrid, population, ontogenetic and statistical approaches. A hybrid analysis can identify inheritance patterns, biochemical features and physiology due to each animal’s unique chromosome makeup; due to this diversity comes unique traits passed down through generations. This discipline focuses on investigating how genes influence productivity levels, fertility rates, viability rates and more by investigating these links between genes and traits.Market growth will be slowened due to an increasing focus on finding superior breeds resistant to disease. Animal geneticists have discovered genes that promote animal growth and health, increasing output while decreasing environmental impact. Nearly one billion people depend on livestock and other animals for their livelihoods and food security; 40% of global agricultural output comes from these creatures, so it is crucial to study animal genetics in order to produce resistant breeds.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-animal-genetics-market-qy/534665/#requestforsampleThe growing consumption of animal-derived proteins and dairy products is driving the animal genetics market. Livestock and fowl provide humans with essential calcium and proteins, while veal, eggs, milk products and beef remain popular foods that are expected to become even more sought-after in the coming years.The growing demand for companion animals will ultimately determine the growth of animal genetics. Major driving forces behind this market expansion include urbanization and an expanding global population. Furthermore, major market drivers for future expansion in this space include increasing investment in genetic services to prevent genetic diseases, as well as increased spending on healthcare infrastructure.The growth of animal genetics markets will be hindered by the increasing availability of alternative meats, such as lab-based. While meat consumption is on the rise, some of it is offset by high quality products being sought. Changes in consumer attitudes and tastes regarding meat consumption along with its effects on environment health and global greenhouse gas emissions may prompt consumers to shift away from animal-based proteins altogether, leading to a decrease in demand for animal-based proteins and delaying adoption of animal genetics technologies.Genus PLC

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844630,Somaliland sincere about its relations with Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Somaliland is “very reliable” in its relations with Taiwan, Somaliland Representative Mohamed Hagi said on Thursday (March 23).
Hagi said his country wants to have good relations with its partners and like-minded countries, and this includes Taiwan. Somaliland considers its ties with Taiwan “very important,"" he said.
Taiwan is helping the East African nation in many ways, he said.
In education, it provides scholarships to Somaliland students. There are currently 20-21 scholarship recipients in Taiwan, the representative said.










Taiwan is also helping the country improve its maternity and infant care as well as implementing a digital health information system to help medical institutions organize patient information. Additionally, there is a Taiwanese medical mission at Hargeisa Group Hospital, Hagi said.
In terms of information and communication technology cooperation, Taiwan is working on an e-government project called the Somaliland E-government Capability Enhancement Project, which is meant to boost Somaliland's e-government capability and improve government network management by establishing a data exchange platform among government institutions, according to the International Cooperation and Development Fund.
Taiwan is also backing the Somaliland Innovation Zone, which serves as an ICT training center, which was established in 2021. A Taiwanese agriculture team is currently helping Somaliland grow watermelon, guava, oranges, lemons, and wax apples, Hagi said.
The representative pointed out that because of its geographical location, Somaliland acts as a gateway to Eastern Africa and the rest of the continent and is able to facilitate travel and logistics needs for Taiwanese traveling in the region.
Somaliland is rich in oil, minerals, and other natural resources, Hagi said, but it needs Taiwan’s help to extract and process them. There is much potential in this regard, he said, adding that the results will aid in his country’s economic development.
Last week, Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs officials met with counterparts in Somaliland at the Ministry of Energy and Materials in Hargeisa to discuss joint resource development projects.
Somaliland “feels the pain” of being a politically isolated nation, the representative said, which is why he hopes Taiwan ties will grow. He said nearly all Somalilanders know of Taiwan and that he was “happy” about future bilateral ties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844631,Eric Chu's bombshell powergrab in Taiwan's KMT,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — In possibly one of the most audacious power grabs in modern Taiwanese politics, Kuomintang Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫) said Wednesday (March 22) there would be no primary for the party’s presidential candidate.As previously mentioned, how political parties structure their primaries to choose candidates is a major factor in Taiwanese politics. Until recently, it has been more common to hold public opinion polls, or a mixed public opinion poll and party member vote.Here the KMT website describes how choosing the presidential candidate will work:""Kuomintang Chairman Eric Chu stated during the Central Standing Committee meeting today (22nd) that after consulting with mayors and county magistrates, members of the Legislative Yuan party caucuses, and many advanced members of the party, the consensus is to adopt a nomination approach to avoid controversy and unite for victory in the presidential election. He emphasized that the party has a responsibility to help the main candidate overcome obstacles, gain more support, unite all the ""blue"" forces, and strive together with all non-""green"" friends.""There is a lot to unpack here. At the same time, details of the legislative nomination committee were released.Notice there is no mention of a committee or who will be choosing the presidential candidate. It seems to suggest that he will be “consulting with mayors and county magistrates, members of the Legislative Yuan party caucuses, and many advanced members of the party,” but not forming an actual committee that would vote.If so, it means he can pick whomever he wants to be the party’s candidate because he can “consult” with whomever he likes or knows supports his pick. In fact, it’s possible he might even skip that step and just simply choose on his own.On one level, it makes some sense to avoid a bruising primary with all the candidates damaging each other before engaging in battle with the soon-to-be-officially-nominated Lai Ching-te (賴清德) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). That is no doubt what he is referring to by “avoid controversy and unite.”The three declared candidates vying for the party’s nomination are media figure and Broadcasting Corporation of China head Jaw Shaw-kong (趙少康), the head of the KMT’s Sun Yat-Sen School Chang Ya-chung (張亞中) and — if the party gives him a special waiver to rejoin the party — Foxconn founder Terry Gou (郭台銘). All three are deep blue ideologues with opinions far outside of the mainstream of public opinion. All three are very outspoken and get plenty of press attention.Chu is right that they would damage the image of the party and almost certainly cause damage to whomever is the eventual candidate. In 2015, Gou made a mess of that year’s presidential primary.However, this decision is already driving controversy and I expect we will be seeing a lot more in the coming days and weeks as people weigh in on the subject. However, Chu is probably right that the damage and controversy caused by this decision will be less than that generated by those three already declared candidates.There are two other possibilities as to why Chu chose this path: To block New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) and/or choose himself to be the party’s candidate. Almost exactly one year ago I wrote:""The catch here is that the reason the rules have been different is that in the last two primary elections the party chair at the time managed to get the rules changed while the process was ongoing. In short, if Hou decided to take this route, he would have to be confident that the chair either supported him, or supported keeping rules that gave a high weighting toward public opinion polling–otherwise it is quite likely that the party will simply find a way to block him.”There are several good reasons why Chu would want to block Hou. There is also one very good reason Chu might not be blocking him at all and simply wants to pick Hou.It has been widely speculated that Chu and Hou don’t get along, in spite of Hou owing his current position to Chu’s patronage. It was Chu who made Hou a New Taipei vice mayor, and handpicked him as his successor.However, Hou has often made damaging statements and taken stands that have seriously undermined Chu. There have also been instances when they have avoided each other publicly.Hou is also widely disliked and distrusted by the power party elites, especially those from 49er families who fled the Chinese Civil War. As a Hoklo-speaking Taiwanese, they suspect Hou of being a secret Taiwan independence supporter, and that he will turn out to be “Lee Tung-hui 2.0.” They accuse him of having “blue (KMT) skin, green (DPP) bones.”There isn’t any proof of such suspicions. Hou has not laid out what he thinks one way or another. In spite of having been the nation's most popular politician for years, one recent poll showed that only 65% of pan-blue supporters would vote for him, which is shockingly low.There are also signs that Hou’s support is eroding fast. In December, riding high on the KMT’s landslide victory, Hou was the frontrunner in almost every poll taken.He has since dropped behind the DPP’s Lai in every poll, and in some polls, dropped dramatically. Worse for Hou, after being the most popular politician in the country for years, there are signs that is no longer the case.A recent TVBS poll of New Taipei City residents found 61% were satisfied with Hou, down from 79% last August. For the first time, that put him behind Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen (盧秀燕), who got 67%.However, it is possible that Chu still plans on nominating Hou, and he is simply helping Hou “overcome obstacles.” Hou is still a very popular politician, and Chu recently said publicly several times that Hou is the KMT’s “strongest hen,” meaning the strongest high-end candidate able to boost the campaigns of “chicks” (downstream candidates).If Chu is planning on picking someone else, it would most likely be one of three people: Himself, Terry Gou or Lu Shiow-yen.Chu is ambitious and probably wants to be president, after all he ran in the 2016 race. His problem is that his polling is miserable, and quite likely he could come in third.Terry Gou is a mixed bag. On one hand he is from a 49er family, is moderately popular and is extremely rich, which could be quite an advantage for the cash-strapped KMT.On the other hand, Gou is volatile, thin-skinned and ideologically too deep blue for mainstream voters. After taking part in the primary last time and losing, he trashed the KMT and left the party. This means that unless an exception is made for him, he isn’t allowed to rejoin the party until September, when the primary will be over.The ideal candidate may turn out to be Lu Shiow-yen. She has emphatically ruled out being vice president, but has not entirely ruled out a presidential run, merely saying she does not have any plans to run.She’s popular, is strong in the crucial battleground of central Taiwan, and she’s from a 49er family. She’s also a woman, and Chu knows that is an electoral advantage — in last November’s elections, two-thirds of female candidates won their races compared to only half of the men.Which of these options Chu goes for remains uncertain, but it’s going to be interesting to watch it all play out.",2023/03/23,3547,Opinion

The fine for vaping is now the same as for smoking in areas designated as non-smoking, between NT$2000 and NT$10,000.The amendments passed on Wednesday also increase the legal age for purchasing cigarettes from 18 to 20, and prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. Importers, manufacturers, and sellers can now be fined up to NT$50 million.A government press release outlining the changes said that previous legal mechanisms to enforce vaping bans had been insufficient, and that cooperation between central and local authorities to clamp down on the distribution of illegal tobacco products will be increased. There are presently about 200 vape stores across Taiwan, according to Storm Media.The global market for e-cigarettes has an estimated value of US$8.28 billion, and as the debates over the merit of vaping as a smoking cessation aide rage on, over 40 countries have banned the practice. According to John Hopkins Medicine, while vaping is less harmful than smoking tobacco, it is still not safe, and it is not the most effective aid to quitting smoking.The U.K. health services have cautiously embraced vaping as an aide to quitting smoking, though recent studies have challenged this approach.",2023/03/23,4056,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844641,Swiss regulator defends its decision to write off AT1 bonds,"ZURICH, March 23 (Reuters) - Switzerland's financial market regulator FINMA defended its decision to impose steep losses on some of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) bondholders on Thursday, saying the decision was legally watertight.
On Sunday, Switzerland announced a multi-billion franc rescue of Credit Suisse, which will see it taken over by UBS.
As part of that deal the Swiss regulator said 16 billion Swiss francs ($17.49 billion) of the lender's Additional Tier 1 debt to be written down to zero, while shareholders received some compensation.
The decision that prioritised shareholders over AT1 bondholders rattled the $275 billion AT1 bond market, prompting a sharp fall in prices on Monday. Some Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders are seeking legal advice.
""The AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse contractually provide that they will be completely written down in a 'viability event', in particular if extraordinary government support is granted,"" FINMA said.
""As Credit Suisse received extraordinary liquidity assistance loans secured by a federal default guarantee on 19 March 2023, these contractual conditions were met for the AT1 instruments issued by the bank,"" it added.
Tier 2 bonds will not be written down, FINMA said.
FINMA Director Urban Angehrn said that ""a solution was found on Sunday to protect clients, the financial centre and the markets"".
European regulators on Monday stepped in to say they would continue to impose losses on shareholders before bondholders - unlike the treatment of bondholders at Credit Suisse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844644,"Taiwan central bank unexpectedly raises rates, cuts GDP forecast","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank raised its policy rate on Thursday in a surprise move reflecting continued concerns about inflation despite recent turmoil on global financial markets, and cut its outlook for the island's economic growth this year.
The central bank, in a unanimous decision, raised the benchmark discount rate (TWINTR=ECI) by 12.5 basis points (bps) to 1.875%.
Governor Yang Chin-long told a news conference after the meeting that the rate hike was mainly because of inflation concerns and that their monetary policy goal was to maintain the stability of domestic prices.
Taiwan's rate hikes are mild and gradual, he added.
Economists in a Reuters poll had mostly expected the central bank to stand pat, though eight of the 24 economists surveyed expected the central bank would lift the rate to 1.875%.
Taiwan's trade-dependant economy is rapidly losing momentum as consumer demand swoons in major markets China, the United States and Europe, and as global inflation, rate rises and geopolitical pressures add more strains on business activity.
The island's February exports fell annually for a sixth straight month to their lowest in two years due to a deteriorating global economy, with the outlook remaining dim for at least the first half of the year.
Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors used in everything from cars to smartphones, but with global consumer demand hit by high inflation and the war in Ukraine, GDP shrank 0.41% in the fourth quarter of last year.
The central bank said in a statement after the meeting that a rise in domestic food and electricity prices were pushing up inflation, but that it expected a gradual overall easing this year.
The decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases in borrowing costs after the recent collapse of two U.S. banks.
Taiwan's banks are in good financial health, Yang said.
The central bank again cut its 2023 estimate for economic growth to 2.21% from its previous forecast of 2.53% in December.
It also raised its consumer price index forecast for this year to 2.09% from a previous prediction of 1.88%.TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank raised its policy rate on Thursday in a surprise move reflecting continued concerns about inflation despite recent turmoil on global financial markets, and cut its outlook for the island's economic growth this year.The central bank, in a unanimous decision, raised the benchmark discount rate (TWINTR=ECI) by 12.5 basis points (bps) to 1.875%.Governor Yang Chin-long told a news conference after the meeting that the rate hike was mainly because of inflation concerns and that their monetary policy goal was to maintain the stability of domestic prices.Taiwan's rate hikes are mild and gradual, he added.Economists in a Reuters poll had mostly expected the central bank to stand pat, though eight of the 24 economists surveyed expected the central bank would lift the rate to 1.875%.Taiwan's trade-dependant economy is rapidly losing momentum as consumer demand swoons in major markets China, the United States and Europe, and as global inflation, rate rises and geopolitical pressures add more strains on business activity.The island's February exports fell annually for a sixth straight month to their lowest in two years due to a deteriorating global economy, with the outlook remaining dim for at least the first half of the year.Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors used in everything from cars to smartphones, but with global consumer demand hit by high inflation and the war in Ukraine, GDP shrank 0.41% in the fourth quarter of last year.The central bank said in a statement after the meeting that a rise in domestic food and electricity prices were pushing up inflation, but that it expected a gradual overall easing this year.The decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases in borrowing costs after the recent collapse of two U.S. banks.Taiwan's banks are in good financial health, Yang said.The central bank again cut its 2023 estimate for economic growth to 2.21% from its previous forecast of 2.53% in December.It also raised its consumer price index forecast for this year to 2.09% from a previous prediction of 1.88%.",2023/03/23,1054,Business

From this date, only moderate and severe cases were to be reported to the center.Epidemic prevention measures have gradually been loosened, and on Monday mild cases were no longer required to undergo quarantine. However, masks are still required to be worn at medical institutions and on all modes of mass transit.On Saturday (March 18) CECC Spokesman Philip Lo (羅一鈞) said the mask requirement on buses, trains, and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) could end. However, he said the decision would depend on the COVID situation following the April 1-5 Tomb Sweeping Festival.During a press conference on Thursday (March 23), CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said the mask policy on public transport will be changed to non-compulsory, but this is still under discussion with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844649,Princeton Tigers add to their March Madness lore,"PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) — Two years ago, Mitch Henderson was coaching a Princeton team that was basically on sabbatical.The Ivy League had called off sports again amid the pandemic as other leagues and the NCAA pushed ahead so the Tigers blended in with other hoops junkies and watched March Madness like fans. Henderson ordered pizzas and smoothies, gathered the Tigers at their on-campus gym, and they watched tournament games on the big screen.“That was fun and we got to do something,” Henderson said. “It really brought us closer.”Princeton’s bonding period over a season of Zooms and tournament watch parties fueled the Tigers' growth into this season’s brainy basketball bullies of March. See ya, Arizona. Maybe next year, Missouri.Oh, and that’s not the delivery driver this week dropping pizzas off at Jadwin Gym. That was Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, who made a cameo appearance at a practice before the Tigers left for their first Sweet 16 since 1967. Murphy raised his arm with the rest of the Tigers and coaching staff and broke the huddle on the three count with “together!”“I don’t think any of us have had a governor roll into practice,” Tigers standout Ryan Langborg said, laughing. “That was a really cool experience. But at the same time, it was just another day at the office.”The cubicle is getting cramped.Politicians, professors, media hordes, anyone who can snag a spot has popped by the gym to glean insights on how the 15th-seeded Tigers have pulled this off. Ousting second-seeded Arizona by 4 points looked every bit an upset; blowing out Missouri by 15 in the second round did not.“Things are going to be different as much as I try to keep it normal,” Henderson said. “At Princeton, we don’t get this that often. I love that they’re getting a chance to feel like celebrities.”Take 2022 Ivy League Player of the Year Tosan Evbuomwan. He picked up food at Winberie’s -- “where extraordinary people are regulars” -- and received a standing ovation. Henderson, himself a March hero for Princeton under Pete Carril in the 1990s, was shuttled with his players to New York for spots on CNN and “The Dan Patrick Show.” Blake Peters became a March meme when he channeled Kevin Garnett and yelled “ anything is possible!” Even late night host Jimmy Fallon dropped a lyric that “Missouri got served by some old Princeton nerds, now you’re busted” in a campy song about the spate of extreme upsets.Up next, Princeton’s biggest game since the 1967 team that boasted three All-Ivy League first-team players lost to North Carolina in the Sweet 16,- when only 23 teams were in the tournament. The Tigers are 9½-point underdogs to No. 6 seed Creighton on Friday in Louisville, Kentucky, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.Still, Princeton has yet to be overwhelmed by the big stage. Missouri lost as a 6½-point favorite and Arizona was a 13½-point favorite.Henderson recalled some advice former Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan once offered about the tournament.“All you’ve got to do is win six game in a row,” Henderson said. “It is a bit of a math thing.”Princeton kids love a good equation and the late John Nash is perhaps more well-known than Carril, the basketball legend who died last summer. The downtown university store didn’t have a single tournament T-shirt in the window, or on the racks. The stately buildings that house Princeton’s clubs -- private social and networking facilities for students and alumni -- seemed naked without banners and flags that would fly at more traditional basketball schools.“It’s not a very big sports school,” sophomore Elise Kait said inside the student union. “I think the athletes are probably all pretty excited. I’d say a good number of students are. But I’d say a good number of them don’t really care.”Kait was likely to juggle game updates as she hits up a performance Friday night of Princeton’s rock ensemble, PURE.“It’s unfortunate it happened at the same time so I can’t really cheer on the guys as much,” ensemble singer Samara Samad said. “But that’s how the cookie crumbles""The Tigers practiced Tuesday at the same time “Star Wars” actress Kelly Marie Tran was speaking at the school’s center for equality. Many of the Tigers consider themselves movie buffs. Langbord, the senior guard, had a midterm essay due this week on the Federico Fellini film “Amarcord.” The Tigers made it a habit of watching movies together before every game. One of last weekend’s selections? The Tom Hanks hijacking film “Captain Phillips.”Just ask Arizona, the Tigers are the captains now.“I should have said that in the postgame press conference,” Langborg cracked.Langborg and Evbuomwan are also focused on the NBA but as fodder for senior theses. Evbuomwan, Princeton’s British big man, is writing about “How Diversity in Executive Management in the NBA Affects Team Performance.” Langborg is researching how traveling through time zones affects players, results and how that could factor into sports betting lines.Hey, didn’t the Tigers just fly 2,800 miles to Sacramento, California, and win two games?“Maybe it doesn’t make that much difference after all,” Langborg said, laughing. “It would be hard to throw all those other studies I’ve been looking at out the door.”What did go out the door? His deadline. Langborg was granted a one-week extension on completing the thesis.“You’d be surprised at these Ivy League schools, You’d think they’re not going to give you any leeway on this stuff. I have personal relationships with so many professors,” he said.Langborg, who hit a jumper and then a layup to give the Tigers the lead for good against Arizona, will play next season at another school as a graduate student.There’s no guarantee that the 47-year-old Henderson, who has only one losing season in 11 years at Princeton, will stay much longer, either. He could parlay this deep run into a job at a school where scholarships and other support await. It's lately a Jersey thing — Shaheen Holloway bolted Saint Peter’s for Seton Hall after last season’s Elite Eight run and Farleigh Dickinson’s Tobin Anderson used last week’s monumental 16-over-1 win against Purdue to leave for Iona.Henderson sidestepped questions about his future.He recalled a lesson from his past, when Carril told Henderson when he was hired, “don’t be me.” Henderson’s retort: “You’re in the Hall of Fame.”Henderson, though, has grown the program in the era of an Ivy League Tournament and the game has evolved to the point where there is no more Princeton offense in Princeton’s offense. There was not a single backdoor cut -- a staple in Carril’s heyday and the spark that punctuated Princeton’s famed upset over UCLA in 1996 -- in last week’s wins.Henderson has picked the basketball minds of national championship-winning coaches such as Jay Wright and Tony Bennett and said he realized “sustained winning over time is on the defensive end.”One thing Henderson won’t do and that is compare this team to the ’96 team. The photo of Henderson forever frozen with his arms outstretched in his victory leap after that upset remains the iconic snapshot in program history. His players bust his chops over his hang time.“Why didn’t we try to replicate that moment and all of us just jump up and pump our fists?” Langborg said.Maybe they will get another chance.___ AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844650,"Faith, family carry Miami's Meier deep into March Madness","CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Katie Meier’s practices at Miami always end the same way. Every player and coach gathers around the midcourt circle, clasps the hand of the person next to them and someone then quietly offers a few words from the heart.It’s about faith.This season, Meier's faith was tested. And rewarded.For the first time in more than 30 years of college basketball — counting her time as a Duke player, then an assistant coach at UNC Asheville and Tulane, then eventually head coach at Charlotte and Miami — Meier is in the Sweet 16. Miami (21-12), the No. 9 seed in the Greenville 2 Region, takes on No. 4 Villanova (30-6) on Friday.“We talk about faith a lot,” Meier — Katie to most, Kate to friends and family — said after her Hurricanes kept their season alive by upsetting top-seeded Indiana in the second round. “Not religiously. I’m talking about faith, which is just confidence with a lot of patience, and we needed it. Your confidence can kind of come and go, but faith has some patience to it.”Such is the story of Miami’s season.It started ominously; Meier was suspended by the university for the first three games of the season in anticipation of NCAA sanctions related to her helping to arrange impermissible contact between transfers Haley and Hanna Cavinder and a booster. The meeting occurred before the Cavinders signed with the Hurricanes, and the final agreed-upon penalty — mainly a year of probation — marked the first time the NCAA had levied sanctions related to an investigation into name, image and likeness deals.Those who know Meier best were furious that she was sanctioned. Faith, indeed, was tested. It was tested again when Miami found itself on the NCAA bubble going into the tournament. Tested yet again when down by 17 at the half of the first-round game against Oklahoma State. Tested yet again when Indiana, on its home floor, has the ball for the last possession and a chance to tie or win the game.And Miami’s still standing.“There’s one word that just sticks out to me: Perseverance,” said Mike Lutzenkirchen, Meier’s brother-in-law. “Kate is such a deep thinker. She’s so intellectually smart when it comes to English, writing, and philosophy. I think that win validates her perseverance and how she doesn’t coach these girls she gets blessed to have on our team -- but she gets to raise them through four or five years of their critical age of life. It’s the perseverance of succeeding through life’s challenges.”Oh, and there have been many.Meier never met her father; Gerry Meier, who played for Ray Meyer at DePaul, died in a plane crash four months before she was born. Meier became part of what she has often called “a Brady Bunch family,” one that was formed when her mother married a widowed man and each brought four kids into the mix.Another tragedy hit her family nine years ago. Meier wears a pin with “43″ on it to every game — a nod to the jersey number of her nephew Philip Lutzenkirchen, Mike’s son and a star tight end at Auburn who died in June 2014 in a car crash in which he was not wearing a seat belt. The family quickly started the Lutzie 43 Foundation in his memory, trying to inspire people to make better decisions as drivers and friends.The Brady Bunch days formed her. Family, Meier learned, isn't always what you're born into, but who you love. Her players become family every year.“She’s such a role model, someone you can lean on, no matter what,” Miami forward Karla Erjavec said. “You can come in, you can cry in her office, you can laugh in her office, she’s always going to be her authentic self.”Meier didn’t need a Sweet 16 to prove anything. She’s a past Associated Press national coach of the year, a past USA Basketball coach of the year, a member of the Miami Sports Hall of Fame and the Hall of Honor at Duke, her alma mater. Her legacy is secure.But getting her to this stage also means plenty to her team, especially after the challenge of this season.“Learning about who she is, the competitor she is, you can see why Miami was so attractive to us,” Hanna Cavinder said.Meier’s first NCAA Tournament game was when she played for Duke in 1987. She had what was then only the fourth triple-double in the history of the women’s tournament and Duke rolled past Manhattan. In the second round two nights later, Duke lost.Thus started the pattern: The Sweet 16, somehow, always escaped Meier's reach.As an assistant coach, Meier also was part of teams that made the second round in 1997 and 2000. As a head coach, Meier had another second-round chance in 2011. And 2012. And 2015. And 2017. And 2019. And 2022. Never got the breakthrough.Until now.“We're here,” Miami forward Lola Pendande said. “We’re really here.""Down 17 to Oklahoma State in Round 1, Miami pulled off a comeback so good it tied the fifth-biggest in NCAA women’s tournament history. It happened after a halftime where there were plenty of tears, none of them related to what was happening on the scoreboard.“I’m an emotional coach, if you haven’t noticed, but I got teary-eyed to remind them when life gets hard and doesn’t look good, just remember this moment,” Meier said.That moment won’t be forgotten. Nor will beating Indiana, on Destiny Harden’s shot in the final seconds. Clemson also happened to win Monday night, prevailing at home in a Women’s NIT game. Amanda Butler, one of Meier’s former assistants and still someone close to the Miami coach, is coach at Clemson. Butler’s mother called her to celebrate after that win.“I’m proud of you,” she said, “but I was watching Kate’s game.”Meier allows herself a postgame treat only after wins: Pizza. There was pizza on Saturday. There was pizza on Monday. Pizza on Friday would probably represent the best couple slices she’s ever had.Faith would be rewarded, again.“For her to finally get through to the Sweet 16, with all the challenges she had, and it happens this year,” Mike Lutzenkirchen said. “A lot of faith went into this.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844651,"Credit Suisse deal averted crisis, Swiss central bank says","GENEVA (AP) — The Swiss central bank hiked its key interest rate Thursday and declared that a government-orchestrated takeover of troubled Credit Suisse by rival bank UBS ended the financial turmoil.In a statement, the Swiss National Bank said it is providing large amounts of support for the deal to merge Switzerland's biggest banks and that the late Sunday announcement by the federal government, financial regulators and the central bank “put a halt to the crisis.”“An insolvency of Credit Suisse would have had severe consequences for national and international financial stability and for the Swiss economy,” said Thomas Jordan, chairman of the Swiss central bank’s governing board. “Taking this risk would have been irresponsible.”The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland's second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank's plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers. The deal was done after the country's executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.“The extensive liquidity assistance provided the time needed to find a solution to safeguard financial stability,” the central bank said in a statement. “This solution had to be worked out under considerable time pressure in order to be ready before the Asian markets opened this week.”To support the deal announced late Sunday, the Swiss National Bank has said it is providing a loan of up to 100 billion francs ($109 billion) and that the government is providing another 100 billion francs of support as a backstop if needed.Jordan said Thursday that the loans are ""not gifts“ but are backed by collateral and subject to interest.The central bank hiked its key interest rate by half a percentage point to counter inflation that has risen since the beginning of the year, to 3.4% last month. It said more hikes “cannot be ruled out.”The bank said inflation was “above the range the SNB equates with price stability” and that economic growth is expected to be modest this year, forecasting a 1% increase in gross domestic product. The SNB said the global economic outlook was uncertain, with the main risks being an economic downturn and fallout from the global financial turmoil.It comes as central banks around the world are pressing ahead with their fight against inflation even as banking sector chaos has created a global crisis of confidence in the financial system.The U.S. Federal Reserve went ahead with a quarter-point rate hike Wednesday, Norway's central bank did the same Thursday and the Bank of England is expected to approve a increase after inflation unexpectedly grew last month. The European Central Bank raised rates by a half-point last week.The ECB and Fed chiefs both voiced assurances that the financial system is resilient and that money is safe in banks.Adrian Prettejohn, a Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the Swiss National Bank “was clearly keen to try to draw a line under the Credit Suisse saga.”“They seem relaxed about any hit to macroeconomic activity from the Credit Suisse debacle,” he said in a note, pointing to the upgraded forecast for economic growth this year.Meanwhile, Swiss financial regulators defended how the deal wiped out about 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds, which left investors with hefty losses.Typically, shareholders face losses before those holding bonds if a bank goes under — a hierarchy that the European Central Bank and Bank of England reiterated in statements this week.The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, said Thursday that contracts for the higher-risk bonds show that they can be written down in a “viability event,” particularly if the government offers extraordinary support.That happened under the executive branch's emergency measures Sunday, which also allowed regulators to order a writedown of the bonds, FINMA said.Global law firm Quinn Emanuel says it has put together an international team of lawyers from Switzerland, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that is in discussions about possible legal action with bondholders representing “a significant percentage” of the total amount that was issued. The firm convened a call for bondholders Wednesday that drew more than 600 participants.When it comes to interest rates, the Swiss National Bank has hiked three times over the last six months. A year ago, Switzerland drew international headlines for its unusual policy of maintaining negative interest rates — at negative 0.75%. That policy aimed to help depress a highly valued Swiss franc and meant that some investors actually had to pay interest for the privilege to keep their money in Switzerland, not reap interest from it.___McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844652,Uno leads Malinin after men's short program in figure skate,"SAITAMA, Japan (AP) — Defending titleholder Shoma Uno of Japan edged American teen Ilia Malinin to lead the men's short program at the world figure skating championships on Thursday.Uno opened with a triple flip at Saitama Super Arena and followed with a quadruple toeloop, double toeloop combination. He finished with a triple axel for a season-best 104.63 points, 4.25 ahead of Malinin.“I was quite worried about my jumps heading into this competition,” Uno said. ""But I was able to get through my program with no major mistakes and am happy with the result.”Cha Jun-hwan of South Korea was third with 99.64.Skating to “I Put A Spell On You,” Malinin received 100.38 points after a powerful routine that featured a quadruple lutz, triple toeloop combination, a quad toeloop and a triple axel.""I've been working for this moment my whole life,” Malinin said. “It was an amazing moment for me. This gives me a lot of motivation and self-confidence for the free skate.”Coached by his parents who represented Uzbekistan, the 18-year-old Malinin is the only skater to land a quadruple axel, widely regarded as the hardest jump in figure skating, in competition.Meanwile, Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara became the first skaters from Japan to win the pairs.Miura and Kihara were first after the short program on Wednesday and finished second in the free skate with 141.44 points, behind defending champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier of the United States.But their two-day total of 222.16 points was good enough for a 4.68-points win over Knierim and Frazier, who scored 142.84 in the free for a 217.48 total.Frazier fell in the short program on the triple toe which proved to be costly for the Americans.European champions Sara Conti and Niccolo Macii of Italy were third with 208.08.Miura and Kihara won the silver medal at the last worlds. Their personal best of 80.72 in the short program gave them a 6.08 lead over the Americans and a shot at history heading into the free program.Miura and Kihara started strong with a triple twist, a triple toe-double toe-double axel sequence and a difficult lift. But Miura doubled the side-by-side salchow and touched down on the throw triple loop.The Japanese team dominated this season with gold at the Grand Prix Final and the Four Continents, and added the worlds.“After the Four Continents, we worked really hard to have no regrets,” Miura said. “In the short program we were able to show what we've been working on, but today in the free skate my weakness came out and I feel regret, but I am happy.”Other Japanese winners of world championships are Yuzuru Hanyu in the men’s individual, and Kaori Sakamoto, who leads after the short program and is aiming to become the first Japanese woman to win back-to-back titles.Russia’s typically dominant skating team has been excluded from the world championships for the second straight year because of the invasion of Ukraine.Japan’s Shoma Uno was set to defend his men’s title starting with the short program later Thursday. ___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844653,Heavily indebted Chinese developer proposes restructuring,"BEIJING (AP) — A Chinese real estate developer whose struggle to manage more than $300 billion in debt rattled global financial markets announced a long-awaited plan Thursday to restructure what it owes to foreign bondholders.The Evergrande Group, the global real estate industry's most heavily indebted company, ran short of cash after Beijing tightened controls on corporate debt the ruling Communist Party worries is dangerously high. Some other Chinese developers collapsed, leaving half-finished apartment blocks standing empty.Evergrande’s struggle prompted fears about possible shockwaves for the global financial system. The Chinese central bank tried to reassure investors, saying its problems could be controlled and were unlikely to spill over.A deputy central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, said this month the real estate industry finally was recovering following a wave of defaults. Pan said financing conditions for healthy developers had “improved significantly.”Evergrande’s plan would cover foreign bondholders who are owed about $20 billion. They would receive new bonds and other debt linked to two Evergrande subsidiaries that make electric cars and manage real estate. It wasn't clear how much bondholders might lose compared with a full payout under the original terms.The proposed terms are a “substantial positive milestone in achieving the restructuring” and represent “significant progress,” the company said in a statement through the Hong Kong stock exchange. It said investors would be asked for approval by the end of March.The announcement comes at a time when Chinese leaders are trying to revive economic growth that fell to 3% last year, its second-lowest level since the 1970s. The ruling party set an official growth target of “around 5.5%” for this year.Chinese regulators stepped in to supervise Evergrande’s debt restructuring, but economists said they rejected a bailout to avoid sending the wrong message to companies about the need to reduce their debts.Foreign creditors were left guessing whether they would receive anything after the company missed two earlier deadlines to announce repayment terms.China’s economic growth slid in mid-2021 after Evergrande and other heavily indebted developers were blocked from borrowing more money. That added to disruption from anti-virus controls.Local governments took over some unfinished projects to make sure families got apartments that already were paid for.Evergrande reported 2.3 trillion yuan ($330 billion) in assets, or more than its 2.1 trillion yuan ($305 billion) in debt to banks and bondholders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844656,Pro-labor? Biden aims to prove it with unionized 2024 staff,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden likes to say he's the most pro-union president in U.S. history. When he announces his expected reelection campaign in the coming weeks, he'll get the chance to prove it to his own staffers.Workers on his 2024 campaign will be unionized, political allies say, making him the first president to run a reelection campaign with staff represented by a union. That means hammering out a collectively bargained agreement that could establish salary minimums, set work hours and offer overtime pay, among other things, easing the demands on a workforce that has historically been required to put in long hours for meager pay and guaranteed joblessness after Election Day.The move allows Biden to further demonstrate to his base just how deep his pro-labor convictions are, providing a strong contrast with his Republican opponents, whose staffers aren't likely to embrace unionizing. It also means extra work for those at the top of Biden's campaign to negotiate a contract and could present financial and workforce constraints, but union organizers and Democratic operatives insist that having a unionized staff would only make Biden's 2024 bid stronger.“The marquee name, the person who’s running, wants the cred for being union,” said Janice Fine, a Rutgers University professor of labor studies and employment relations and director of the workplace justice lab@RU. “But the people who are running the campaign are going to have more trepidation because they know what it takes to actually lift up a campaign.”It's not unprecedented for a presidential campaign to be unionized, though Biden's would be the largest unionized workforce by far. Democratic White House candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Julián Castro had unionized campaign staffs in 2020. Even Biden’s campaign unionized after clinching that year’s Democratic nomination. The Democratic National Committee’s staff is also unionizedFormer President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign staff hasn't unionized. The staffs of top Republicans thought to be readying presidential runs, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, probably won't, either.“In the old days, there were definitely Republicans who were pro-union,"" Fine said. “But not now.”Biden’s 2020 campaign only unionized that May, when it reached an agreement with field organizers represented by the Iowa-based Teamsters Local 238. As entry-level campaign employees, field staffers are often dispatched to different states. Their agreement established a six-day workweek, a $15-per-hour minimum wage and overtime for working more than 40 hours weekly.This time, Biden’s campaign will unionize earlier in the process and may face pressure to apply the contract to more staffers, including some at its headquarters, given that the president's administration has launched efforts to increase labor organization membership nationwide. Biden has hosted union organizers in the Oval Office, and the White House is paying interns for the first time since the 1970s.“I told you I was going to be the most pro-union president in history,"" Biden said recently. “And I’ve kept my promise.”Biden is expected to announce a reelection campaign as soon as next month, after the first-quarter fundraising period concludes at the end of March.A top adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss a reelection campaign that hasn't yet formally begun, said the campaign’s 2020 union contract won't really be applicable to any contract the reelection campaign reaches for 2024. That's because the division of labor is vastly different for staffers on a sitting president's reelection campaign compared with the campaign of a candidate clinching a contested primary.Most reelection campaign staffers will work for different state Democratic parties around the country and have their own union contracts with them. Or they will be DNC staffers covered by the committee’s own union agreement, the adviser said. Some 2024 national campaign staffers will be covered under a new union contract, but it may not apply to many working at headquarters who are part of management, the adviser said, adding that the scope of who would be covered under a union contract is among the questions that will be sorted out once the campaign formally launches.The Biden adviser said that the reelection campaign would start with a relatively small staff that grows over time and that it will begin work before a union contract has been reached.While acknowledging that unionization is still a requirement for Democratic campaigns that Republican ones do not have to worry about, the adviser said Biden's reelection campaign expects to be able to take having a unionized workforce ""in stride” and reach an agreement that properly supports staffers and lives up to the president's pro-labor beliefs.Outside Biden's inner political circle, however, expectations will be higher.Unionizing by Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot goes far beyond the president, having become far more common in recent cycles — especially last fall's midterms. Taylor Billings, organizing director for the Campaign Workers Guild, said her union has represented workers from more than 60 political firms and campaigns since its founding in 2017, including Castro's 2020 presidential bid.The guild has won negotiated benefits including bonuses for election wins, severance pay and health care coverage that extends past Election Day. Some past discussions have focused on things as basic as having running water in workspaces, Billings said.She said some ardent supporters have disparaged the idea of a top candidate’s campaign unionizing, with the fear being that it will make it tougher to win elections — a dynamic she said is likely to intensify in a presidential race.“It makes the pretty common talking point of ‘Do nothing to sabotage the race’ more seductive, although it’s not more true,” Billings said. “The reality is that presidential campaign workers are in a pretty unique position to make the lives of many workers on the campaign much better and set a standard for the industry.”Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ 2020 campaign manager, oversaw a staff of 1,200 across the country by January of that year, represented by the United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400. He said most employees routinely worked five days a week early in the campaign, then shifted to six- and seven-day workweeks as the primary progressed — all of which were part of the contact.“The discourse around unionized work environments, there’s this mythology that you are a five-day workweek, 40-hours-a-week worker,” Shakir said. “But if you look at a lot of union contracts, they allow and build in the need for labor to be extended beyond normal work hours.”Warren’s 2020 campaign contract calculated 60-hour workweeks. The Sanders campaign contract dictated that staffers working eight hours or more got two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute paid lunch period.Sanders staffers working 12 hours or more got four 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunchbreak. Anyone working 16 consecutive hours would get a 12-hour rest period before starting again. It also gave staffers the right to request time off “blackout days” of up to three days in a row, though such requests were limited as big elections approached, Shakir said.Despite that, some Sanders campaign staffers complained that they weren’t paid the $15 per hour the candidate was pushing to mandate nationwide. Shakir said managers of other Democratic presidential campaigns nonetheless asked to see the Sanders contract so they’d have a better understanding of what to expect when their own staffs embraced unionization.“As a pro-union campaign, we believed that, if you do this the right way, the campaign’s going to be stronger as a result,” Shakir said. “Because the staff feel like you haven’t been burned out, you have rights.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844657,China's Xi invites Spanish PM on state visit next week,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has accepted an invitation from Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a state visit to Beijing as Xi tries to galvanize support for China's peace proposal for Ukraine.Sánchez plans to be in China on March 30-31, Spain’s minister for the presidency, Félix Bolaños, said late Wednesday, citing Xi’s “possible mediation in the war in Ukraine” as a key reason for the visit.Spain takes over the European Union's rotating presidency in July, and Sánchez has portrayed his nation on the world stage as a staunch NATO ally of Ukraine.Sánchez told reporters in Brussels, where he was attending an EU summit on Thursday, that he would “find out first hand what (China’s) position is for peace in Ukraine, and transmit the message that the Ukrainians will be the ones who establish the conditions for peace.”He plans to hold commercially focused meetings during the Boao Forum for Asia on the Chinese island of Hainan on March 30 before traveling to Beijing to meet with Xi on March 31, Sánchez's office said.“China and Spain enjoy sustained, sound and stable development of relations,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Thursday when asked about the prime minister's visit. “The two leaders maintain good communication,” he added, without providing further details.Xi met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to promote Beijing’s peace plan for Ukraine, which Western nations have all but dismissed as unviable. Putin said it could be a basis for ending the fighting when the West is ready but added that Ukraine's Western allies have not shown interest.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844658,Success-starved Kings close in on long-awaited playoff berth,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Sacramento Kings might just be riding the beam all the way to the NBA playoffs.The resurgent Kings are on the verge of ending the longest postseason drought in league history, with first-year coach Mike Brown employing a fast-paced offense led by the dynamic duo of De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis to put Sacramento in first place in the Pacific Division.“It’s a great feeling. It’s great because it’s my first time,"" Fox said of being in the playoff hunt. ""This is something we want to make annual. We want to be contending for a title. ... It’s great for the city and organization. We still want bigger things for ourselves.”The Kings (43-29) are in third place in the Western Conference and might be able to clinch the franchise's first playoff berth since 2006 during the final three games of a four-game homestand that ends Monday night against Minnesota.The 16 seasons without a playoff berth are the longest in NBA history and the longest active postseason drought among any team in the NBA, NFL, NHL or Major League Baseball.“I do feel that that group believes in themselves, not just because I’m telling them they’re good, but because they’ve actually gone out and proven it time after time after time, whether it’s individually in certain situations or collectively as a team,” Brown said. “When you have a team that believes, they can be dangerous. You’ve got a connected team that believes, they can be a very dangerous team and that’s what our group is right now.”The Kings are also one of the best feel-good stories of the NBA this season with an entertaining style of basketball that leads the league in scoring at 120.9 points per game for the highest mark in the league since 1983-84.Each win at home is punctuated with the lighting of the beam — a beam of light from purple lasers atop the Golden 1 Center — and fans have even chanted for the beam at road games around the country.“There’s like a playoff atmosphere every night,” swingman Kevin Huerter, one of the key offseason acquisitions, said after a recent home win. “The only thing that’s missing is handing out the T-shirts and maybe some towels, whatever they’re doing for the playoffs. But it really is this every night.”The Kings have been one of the most success-starved franchises since moving to Sacramento in 1985. They had a losing record in each of their first 14 seasons in California, winning just one playoff game.That all changed in 1999 when general manager Geoff Petrie and coach Rick Adelman built a winner around players like Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic that played an entertaining style in a grind-it-out era that nearly delivered a championship.The Kings posted eight straight winning records and playoff berths under Adelman, but lost a heartbreaking seven-game series to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2002 and then saw their title hopes derailed the following year when Webber went down with a serious knee injury in the second round of the playoffs.Adelman kept the team competitive through 2006 but was let go following a second straight first-round playoff exit.Then the dark era began with 16 straight losing seasons under 11 coaches, an ownership change and fears that the city would lose its only major pro team to Seattle.Vivek Ranadive bought the team from the Maloof family in 2013 and kept the team in Sacramento by building a downtown arena, but there was no on-court success until this year.The Kings traded away star DeMarcus Cousins and botched several high draft picks. But they have been revived following last year's trade with Indiana that sent promising guard Tyrese Haliburton to Indiana for a playmaking big man in Sabonis and the decision to hire Brown as coach.Sabonis proved to be the perfect piece to team with the speedy Fox, giving Sacramento a dynamic duo.Fox is averaging 25.4 points per game and has been the best clutch scorer in the league this season, scoring double figures in the fourth quarter a league-high 25 times.Sabonis, acquired in a controversial trade from Indiana midway through last season for promising guard Tyrese Haliburton, has been the perfect piece to team with Fox with his playmaking ability as a big man. Sabonis is averaging 19 points, 12.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists with 12 triple-doubles.Add in outside shooting from Huerter and rookie Keegan Murray, the veteran presence of Harrison Barnes and scoring off the bench from Malik Monk and the Kings have gained the attention of other contenders.“Give a lot of credit to Mike Brown,” Celtics star Jayson Tatum said. “He has the guys playing a lot better. Fox is playing at an All-NBA level. Sabonis has been great for them. They play with so much pace. All those guys have a lot more confidence.""When you’re playing with confidence, it naturally opens things up for the individual and the group.”___AP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844659,Women hope Sweet 16 next step to own March Madness TV deal,"Women’s college basketball believes it has the makings for a hit reality TV show with star power driving a marketable product that has a growing audience.So they're taking the ensemble on the road for the Sweet 16.The NCAA changed the format of the tournament this year, featuring two regional sites instead of the traditional four. The games in Greenville, South Carolina, and Seattle are the latest step to grow the sport and show the ladies can stand on their own.South Carolina coach Dawn Staley believes the question of whether women’s hoops merits its own March Madness TV contract has already been answered, even though the women's tournament loses money under the current deal.“Somebody’s watching women’s basketball,"" Staley said. ""Somebody feels like we’re in high demand, and obviously the decision-makers that put us on now realize that they've got to keep putting us on.”The women's title game will be broadcast on ABC — the first appearance on network television since 1995. Women's basketball is part of a current contract that bundles all NCAA championships under one deal except for men’s basketball and football.The NCAA is expected to decide by the fall if the women’s tournament will become a separate entity after hiring Endeavor, a consulting firm, to determine how to take championships to market.“It's an exciting time. Year over year, we continue to demonstrate the value that women's basketball brings to that space,"" said Lynn Holzman, the NCAA vice president of women’s basketball. ""It'll be exciting to see what the results are of this for the sport itself, but also for the NCAA more broadly in our championships.”TV ratings have been trending up over the last two years. This year's regular season was the most viewed on ESPN networks in eight years and was up 11% from last season. That came on the heels of last season's title game between South Carolina and UConn that averaged 4.85 million viewers — the most for a women's championship game since 2004. The first round had a 27% ratings increase from last year.“People enjoy watching close games. They like the fact that there’s some semblance of uncertainty of who’s going to win,"" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “There’s been so many changes in the top 10 all year long. ... Teams are in, they start out at the top they go out they come back in. I think all that creates a level of excitement.”People aren't just tuning in during March Madness, they have also been showing up.Attendance at the NCAA Tournament has continued to rise the past five seasons, growing by 60% in the first two rounds from an average of 4,464 in 2016 to 7,240 this year. This season had the highest attendance ever for the first two rounds.“It makes us very bullish on women's basketball,” Holzman said. “It is demonstrative of the growth we've been seeing in the sport.”Now the NCAA hopes that growth is reflected in increased television revenue.ESPN pays $34 million per year for the championships package, which it agreed to in 2011, including women's basketball. But the law firm the NCAA hired to investigate equity issues in 2021 said in its report that estimated women’s basketball annual broadcast rights would be worth $81 million to $112 million.The NCAA said the 2019 women’s tournament lost $2.8 million and those losses have multiplied the last two years since the the sports governing body increased spending after disparities between the men's and women's tourneys were pointed out.If the NCAA can get close to the numbers projected in the 2021 report, it might be able to offer revenue shares — known as financial units — to women's teams in the tournament in a structure similar to what the men receive from their March Madness tournament.Men's teams earn a slice of the money pie for their conference for every game they play excluding the championship. Each unit is paid by the NCAA over a six-year cycle. This year the NCAA will dole out $170 million to conferences from the men's tournament.It's fair to say the women have a lot riding on this weekend at the two regional sites.The NCAA is hoping the success of the Final Four — which sells out every year — translates to its new “mini Final Fours.”Holzman believes the new format gave fans a better chance to know where their teams would be headed. The NCAA vice president of women’s basketball also anticipated greater economic impact on host cities would lead to more bids to host in the future.But for some coaches, it's all about location.The regional sites the next two years will again be held in cities on opposite coasts. The closest team playing in Seattle this year is Colorado, located 1,300 miles away.Texas coach Vic Schaefer is “a little concerned” about the distance some teams will have to travel, but eager to see how the tournament unfolds.“The powers that be believe it’s going to be great, and I’m hopeful that it will be,” Schaefer said. ""Those are two opposite ends of the spectrums, west and east, three time zones between both of them. And there’s just nothing in the Midwest. And we have a lot of teams in the Midwest. We’ll see.”___AP Sports Writers Pete Iacobelli, Pat Eaton-Robb and Jim Vertuno contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
