https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827756,The Surprising Health Benefits of Coffee Drinking,"It’s no secret that coffee has a lot of caffeine, but did you know that it can actually be beneficial to your health?

            It’s no secret that coffee has a lot of caffeine, but did you know that it can actually be beneficial to your health? Studies have shown that drinking coffee in moderation can reduce the risk of certain diseases, improve physical performance, and even boost mental performance. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits of drinking coffee.
Lower Risk for Diabetes and Heart Disease

            Studies have found that people who drink coffee regularly may be at a lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease than those who don’t consume coffee. This is likely due to the fact that coffee contains polyphenols, which are compounds that may help reduce inflammation. Additionally, some studies suggest that regular consumption of caffeinated coffee could help protect against stroke and coronary heart disease.
Coffee Can Improve Physical Performance











            Coffee has been known to improve physical performance by increasing alertness, focus, and energy levels. Caffeine is responsible for this effect; it helps to stimulate the central nervous system and can increase glucose levels in your blood. This means that coffee can give you an extra boost when you’re feeling fatigued or need an extra burst of energy during physical activity.
Coffee Can Lower The Risk of Parkinson’s disease

            Recent medical research has indicated that drinking coffee may be helpful in preventing Parkinson’s disease. This neurological disorder afflicts millions of people around the world, greatly impairing movement and causing extreme fatigue and other debilitating symptoms. The exact cause of Parkinson’s is still unknown, but studies suggest that there might also be a genetic component to this devastating condition.

            While more research is necessary in order to confirm any links between coffee consumption and lower risk for Parkinson’s, one promising study looking at the data from a group of participants demonstrates that drinking coffee may protect against developing Parkinson’s disease. The findings imply that regular intake of coffee could potentially make those who are genetically predisposed to the disorder less vulnerable to its onset. Further study is needed if we aim to make use of these potentially beneficial effects of coffee on this debilitating disorder impacting so many lives.
Coffee May Reduce Feelings Of Depression

            Recent studies are providing evidence to suggest that drinking coffee can help reduce the effects of depression. Much like exercise, coffee has been shown to increase levels of a chemical in the brain called serotonin, which is commonly known as the ‘feel-good’ hormone. A low level of serotonin has been linked with depression and anxiety, so the boost provided by caffeine can actually help sufferers feel better without necessarily having to take medication.

            Coffee also increases dopamine levels in the brain, so it can improve concentration and alertness for those suffering from depression who might otherwise struggle with cognitive tasks. So next time you’re feeling down, why not put on your favorite mug and brew yourself a cup of Joe – it just may give you the pick-me-up you need!
Mental Performance Boosting Effects

            Coffee also contains antioxidants which can help protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules linked to aging and some diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have also suggested that drinking coffee could improve cognitive function such as memory and attention span; it could even help prevent age-related mental decline or dementia in older adults.
Conclusion:

            Overall, while there are many potential health benefits associated with drinking coffee, it’s important to remember to enjoy it in moderation—as too much caffeine can lead to uncomfortable side effects like headaches, insomnia, jitters, or anxiety. That said, if you’re looking for a way to get an extra boost throughout the day while reaping the potential health benefits of drinking coffee in moderation—it might just be worth giving it a try!

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.You Can Browse The Full Report here: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352349In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Molnupiravir Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827874,Taiwanese put off by costly advance care planning services: Experts,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Experts in Taiwan are calling for subsidized consultation for advance care planning, as they believe cost is a major impediment in the promotion of advance directives.Since the implementation of the Patient Right to Autonomy Act (病人自主權利法) in January 2019, only 45,621 individuals have created an advance decision document as of February, most of them ages 55 to 74. Taiwan currently has 246 medical institutions providing counseling services, said Deputy Minister Chou Jih-haw (周志浩) of the Minister of Health and Welfare.Hsieh Ching-hsiang (謝景祥) from the Taiwan Community Hospital Association argued at a hearing on the act on Monday (March 6) that preparing for future decisions about one’s medical care should be a fundamental right, along with free counsel.He urged the ministry to set aside a five-year budget of NT$5 billion (US$164 million) in subsidies for people ages 65 and older for their healthcare arrangements. He argued that this will be conducive to more effective hospice care and allocation of medical resources, which can be directed to National Health Insurance-covered intensive care.According to the Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation, the cost for one session of advanced care planning ranges from NT$2,000 (US$65) to NT$4,000 (US$132) per hour.Cheng Shao-yi (程劭儀) from the Taiwan Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine believes that the growth of advance care planning is hindered by a lack of awareness and inadequate effort to promote the idea in hospitals.Frank Fu (傅達仁), a former renowned sports commentator, passed away via assisted suicide in Switzerland in 2018 after his fruitless campaign to push for the legalization of euthanasia in Taiwan. At the hearing, his son pleaded in support of the enactment of a similar law that allows critically ill patients, like his father, to die with dignity.",2023/03/06,1045,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827880,51% of Americans back strong stance against China to prevent Taiwan invasion,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A new poll has found that more than half of Americans think that standing up to China to prevent an invasion of Taiwan is more important than maintaining close ties with Beijing.As cross-strait tensions continue to escalate, a survey of 1,500 American adults conducted by the Economist and the polling company YouGov from Feb. 25-28 found that 51% of respondents feel it is more important the U.S. government ""take a strong stand so that China does not take over Taiwan by force,"" while only 24% believe maintaining good relations with China is a higher priority. In the event of a Chinese invasion, 37% of respondents support the U.S. sending troops to defend Taiwan.Among those who claimed to closely follow Taiwan Strait issues, 70% believe the U.S. should take a tough stance against China to prevent it from invading. In contrast, only 18% of respondents who keep abreast of the region believe that maintaining good relations with China is more important, while 12% were not sure.Unlike other divisive issues, when it comes to Taiwan, views were similar among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. When asked whether the U.S. should take a strong stand against China, Republicans led the way with 58%, followed by Democrats with 55%, and independents with 41%.On whether the U.S. should mobilize military power to protect Taiwan in the event of a conflict, 37% said they supported it, 22% said they did not support it, and the other 41% felt that they did not know enough about the issue to provide an opinion. However, among those who claim to monitor cross-strait developments, 63% believe that the U.S. should send troops, 25% do not support it, and 12% did not feel they know enough about the topic.Again, Republicans, Democrats, and independents shared similar views. When asked if the U.S. should use force to defend Taiwan, 41% of Republicans agreed, followed by 38% of Democrats, and 32% of independents.Regarding House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's anticipated visit to Taiwan later this year, 48% of respondents support McCarthy's visit, while only 25% disagreed and 26% were unsure. Republicans were the most in favor of the visit at 58%, followed by 46% of Democrats.Support for then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022 was lower, at 34% of the respondents in general, of which 44% were Democrats, and 29% were Republicans.In addition, 24% of respondents regard Taiwan as an ""ally"" and 37% think of it as a ""friend."" Meanwhile, three-quarters of respondents have a bad impression of China. 40% consider China an ""enemy,"" and 35% think China is ""unfriendly"" to the U.S.Over the past few months, more and more Americans have started to view China as an enemy, while before 2020, only one in five Americans had that view.",2023/03/06,1435,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827883,Analysis: Foxconn races to become an EV player and the clock is ticking,"TAIPEI/DETROIT, March 6 (Reuters) - Foxconn wants to do for electric vehicles (EVs) what it has done with the iPhone, but first, it needs to find the next Apple – and fast.
The Taiwanese contract manufacturer faces competition in the market for creating white-label EVs that can be tailor-made for clients, whether that's a major automaker or a delivery provider or any other company.
And while the electronics giant brings established strengths to the mostly loss-making EV industry, Foxconn needs to win a big contract to prove it can ride the wave of disruption, analysts say.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), will provide an update on its EV manufacturing business when it reports results on March 15.
""The results of many of our collaborations will be realized one after the other in 2023,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. ""The demand for EVs is driving industry disruption where prominent traditional automakers have and are pivoting to finding solutions for mobility that are cleaner and smarter.""
The company's proposition is simple: let us build your next EV. It is developing a specialized supply chain, including chips and batteries, and has acquired the former General Motor Co (GM.N) plant in Lordstown, Ohio. It has also hired a former Nissan (7201.T) executive, Jun Seki, to lead its efforts.
For now, by building in Ohio, Foxconn can offer customers access to U.S. federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Kylie Huang said. That's a selling point as traditional automakers juggle building gasoline-powered vehicles with plans to build their own EV capacity.
""If they don't get one this year, next year will be more difficult,"" Huang said of Foxconn's search for an EV contract with a traditional automaker.
Failure to ""catch this wave"" could force Foxconn to vie with lower-tier Chinese automakers who might switch to EV contract manufacturing and compete on cost, Huang said.
Canada's Magna International (MG.TO), a top auto supplier, already builds cars for others, and China's Geely (0175.HK) has expressed interest. China's Guangxi Automobile Group has started to make EVs on contract for Japanese delivery company, Sagawa Express Co.
Foxconn is counting on its Mobility in Harmony EV platform, or MIH, to win customers. It calls MIH ""the Android system"" for EVs and is soliciting partners in an effort to standardize technologies so model variants can be developed quickly and cheaply.
""We want to create that kind of ecosystem so anyone - for example, like United Airlines – can say, 'I want to make a car,'"" Foxconn chief product officer Jerry Hsiao told Reuters during a tour of the company's sprawling Ohio plant.
""Sooner or later, maybe the top, traditional (automakers) say, 'Hey, I want to become a product marketing company. Why do I need to carry so many employees?'"" he said.
Hsiao also worked on the first Android phone for Google and now sees EVs at a similar commercial inflection point.
Foxconn's ambitions are aggressive. Initially targeting 5% of the global EV market and the equivalent of $33 billion in revenue from manufacturing EVs and components by 2025, Foxconn's longer-term goal is to make nearly half the world's EVs.
EV sales have been rising, led by China. Five percent of the market, assuming an EV adoption rate of about 20% by 2025, would be around 900,000 vehicles, roughly what market-leader Tesla (TSLA.O) sold in 2021.
'NOT MAKING IPHONES'
""In the EV market, everyone's eyes are bigger than their stomach,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions.
His firm estimates Foxconn hitting about 65,000 vehicles in 2025 and 157,000 in 2026. ""They're not making iPhones here,"" he said.
EV outsourcing will reach $36 billion in 2025 and $144 billion in 2030, with 800,000 and 3.2 million EVs, respectively, Goldman Sachs estimates.
Key for Foxconn will be scoring the first big customer to anchor its Ohio plant, which currently builds a small number of electric Endurance pickup trucks for Lordstown Motors, in which it owns a stake. It has announced plans to build a vehicle for EV startup Fisker (FSR.N).
Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told reporters last month he plans to visit U.S. customers, Foxconn's Ohio plant and Mexico, where Foxconn has made significant investments in auto parts, in March or April.
""There should be some related signing activities,"" Liu said.
Foxconn already supplies parts to Tesla and makes camera modules for automakers and suppliers.
""They can probably buy things cheaper than anyone on earth,"" Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company, said of Foxconn.
The race for volume in an industry where Tesla and other EV makers are cutting prices raises the stakes.
The former GM plant in Ohio that Foxconn purchased from Lordstown Motors is one of the highest volume single-line vehicle assembly plants in the world. It could build about 320,000 vehicles a year, excluding overtime.
Foxconn wants to build around 300,000 EVs at the plant, Ian Upton, director of production control at Foxconn Ohio, told Reuters.
""We would love to find a customer that's in the 250,000-or-so range and then we can fill up some of the other stuff with niche type things,"" he said.TAIPEI/DETROIT, March 6 (Reuters) - Foxconn wants to do for electric vehicles (EVs) what it has done with the iPhone, but first, it needs to find the next Apple – and fast.The Taiwanese contract manufacturer faces competition in the market for creating white-label EVs that can be tailor-made for clients, whether that's a major automaker or a delivery provider or any other company.And while the electronics giant brings established strengths to the mostly loss-making EV industry, Foxconn needs to win a big contract to prove it can ride the wave of disruption, analysts say.Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), will provide an update on its EV manufacturing business when it reports results on March 15.""The results of many of our collaborations will be realized one after the other in 2023,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.

Initially targeting 5% of the global EV market and the equivalent of $33 billion in revenue from manufacturing EVs and components by 2025, Foxconn's longer-term goal is to make nearly half the world's EVs.EV sales have been rising, led by China. Five percent of the market, assuming an EV adoption rate of about 20% by 2025, would be around 900,000 vehicles, roughly what market-leader Tesla (TSLA.O) sold in 2021.""In the EV market, everyone's eyes are bigger than their stomach,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions.His firm estimates Foxconn hitting about 65,000 vehicles in 2025 and 157,000 in 2026. ""They're not making iPhones here,"" he said.EV outsourcing will reach $36 billion in 2025 and $144 billion in 2030, with 800,000 and 3.2 million EVs, respectively, Goldman Sachs estimates.Key for Foxconn will be scoring the first big customer to anchor its Ohio plant, which currently builds a small number of electric Endurance pickup trucks for Lordstown Motors, in which it owns a stake. It has announced plans to build a vehicle for EV startup Fisker (FSR.N).Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told reporters last month he plans to visit U.S. customers, Foxconn's Ohio plant and Mexico, where Foxconn has made significant investments in auto parts, in March or April.""There should be some related signing activities,"" Liu said.Foxconn already supplies parts to Tesla and makes camera modules for automakers and suppliers.""They can probably buy things cheaper than anyone on earth,"" Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company, said of Foxconn.The race for volume in an industry where Tesla and other EV makers are cutting prices raises the stakes.The former GM plant in Ohio that Foxconn purchased from Lordstown Motors is one of the highest volume single-line vehicle assembly plants in the world. It could build about 320,000 vehicles a year, excluding overtime.Foxconn wants to build around 300,000 EVs at the plant, Ian Upton, director of production control at Foxconn Ohio, told Reuters.""We would love to find a customer that's in the 250,000-or-so range and then we can fill up some of the other stuff with niche type things,"" he said.",2023/03/06,603,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827884,Turkey thanks Taiwan for earthquake assistance,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After the strongest earthquake in a century rocked Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6, Taiwan deployed 130 search and rescue specialists and five dogs to search for survivors.AKUT Search and Rescue Association Chairwoman Zeynep Yosun Akverdi spoke via video conference with CNA, expressing gratitude to Taiwan rescuers and their high morale despite the demanding conditions. Her organization, AKUT, is a Turkish NGO specifically devoted to disaster search and rescue.Akverdi said AKUT was still a small NGO in August 1999 when an earthquake struck Izmit, Turkey, killing 18,000 people. AKUT’s involvement in this earthquake gave her team valuable experience which it would apply to its next mission: Taiwan’s 921 earthquake in 1999.On that mission, the Turkish government formed a 36-person search and rescue team, 17 of which were AKUT members. Upon arriving in Taiwan on Sept. 22, 1999, the team completed their first rescue, discovering a survivor 50 hours after the earthquake.Devastating effects of Turkey's Feb. 6 earthquake. (CNA photo)AKUT is self-funded with 3,000 volunteers, raising its own budget for search and rescue operations. Akverdi thanked Taiwan for donations which will be used to establish two training centers, one near Istanbul and another in southern Turkey.After the training centers are completed, AKUT plans to also hold joint training exercises with Taiwan's search and rescue team. Both Taiwan and Turkey share a history of devastating natural disasters, with the possibility of more occurring in the future.Akverdi said earthquakes by their very nature cannot be predicted, so preparation is necessary. Although Taiwan's building code is rigorous, which leads to safer structures, more can still be done when it comes to training.Public education is also important, according to Akverdi, elucidating that more than 90% of search and rescue operations are completed by residents prior to the arrival of rescue crews. Therefore, first aid education and earthquake rescue techniques should be taught to the general public.Turkish NGO thanks Taiwan for sending a search and rescue team. (CNA photo)As for ongoing aid, the pace of rebuilding is slow as many NGOs are still working to stabilize current conditions for the remaining survivors.Currently, Tzu Chi is still operating in the disaster-stricken areas of Hatay and Gaziantep, providing supplies to more than 4,000 families. Tzu Chi volunteer Faisal Hu (胡光中) says the organization is distributing aid to the neediest and most vulnerable based upon a list provided by the Turkish government.Nearly a month after the relief, Hu says the biggest challenge is simply locating people on the government assistance list. Hu conveyed that many survivors may have traveled to nearby communities less affected by the disaster, such as Adana and Sanliurfa.As for the next stage of disaster aid, Hu said Tzu Chi will continue to give out blankets and stored value cards to earthquake survivors.",2023/03/06,342,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827902,S. Korea announces fund to compensate forced labor victims,"South Korea on Monday announced plans to compensate victims of Japan's forced wartime labor.Foreign Minister Park Jin told a televised news conference the victims would be compensated through a local foundation that would be funded by civilian donations.He said South Korea and Japan were at a ""new window of opportunity"" to overcome conflicts of the past.Since taking office in May last year, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been pushing to mend historical grievances with Japan.Both South Korea and Japan are US allies in the region, and Washington has pressed both countries to mend ties so they're able to cooperate on countering North Korea's nuclear threat.Even though South Korea and Japan are economically and culturally closely linked, tensions have risen between them because of issues stemming from the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula between 1910 and 1945.Tensions came to a head in 2018, when South Korean courts ordered two Japanese companies — Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries — to compensate Koreans over the issue of forced labor.The companies and the Japanese government dismissed the rulings, arguing that all compensation issues had been settled in 1965 when the two countries restored bilateral ties.The dispute prompted the two governments to downgrade each other's trade status, with Seoul scrapping its military intelligence agreement with Japan.South Korea first unveiled the plan of creating a foundation as a way to compensate former forced laborers this January.Both countries have continued talks in recent months to resolve the dispute over court rulings.South Korean media reported that a key sticking point was whether the two Japanese companies would contribute money to a South Korean foundation to compensate former victims of forced labor.But the plan, when it was unveiled in January, faced fierce backlash from victims and their families.""It's a complete victory by Japan, which has said it cannot pay a single yen on the forced labor issue,"" Lim Jae-sung, a lawyer for several victims, said in a Facebook post on Sunday, citing initial media reports of the proposed foundation.Park Jin said Monday that he thinks the foundation is the ""last opportunity,"" adding that ""if we compare it to a glass of water, (I) think that glass is more than half full with water.""""We expect that the glass will be further filled moving forward based on Japan's sincere response,"" he added.rm/sri (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/06,,

Painful and difficult.""Zelenskyy's tribute came after Ukraine's general staff reported that Ukrainian forces had pushed back ""more than 130 enemy attacks"" the previous day.Zelenskyy said Ukraine's troops ""repelled assaults, destroyed the occupier, undermined enemy positions and logistics, and protected our borders and cities.""The Donbas region is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia claims to have annexed despite never fully having controlled it.The region includes the war-ravaged city of Bakhmut, which Russian troops seem determined to take.The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) issued a warning that Ukrainian supply routes to Bakhmut were narrowing.""The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,"" the report said.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Monday, March 6:Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Russian mercenary force Wagner, has warned that the group's position in Bakhmut will be at risk unless they receive ammunition.In a video released over the weekend, he said that if his troops are compelled to retreat from the city in eastern Ukraine then the entire front ""will collapse.""""The situation will not be sweet for all military formations protecting Russian interests,"" he said.The video was released on a Telegram channel that associates itself with the Wagner group. It was not published on Prigozhin's usual press service channel.On Friday, Prigozhin had said that his troops had ""practically surrounded Bakhmut,"" but on Sunday he said that the ammunition that was promised by Moscow in February has not been shipped yet.""For now, we are trying to figure out the reason: is it just ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal,"" Prigozhin said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said there is ""no evidence so far"" suggesting that China is considering sending weapons to Russia.In February 2022, shortly before Russia had launched its invasion of Ukraine, China and Russia had declared a ""no limits"" partnership.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month Washington had information suggesting China could provide ""lethal support"" to Russia. Beijing has rejected the claim.Von der Leyen said that Russia and China's relationship is under the European Union's close watch.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said there would be ""consequences"" if China supplies weapons to Russia for Moscow's war in Ukraine.The comment from Scholz came in an interview to CNN, two days after he met US President Joe Biden in Washington.Answering a question on probable sanctions if China helps Russia, he said, ""I think it would have consequences, but we are now in a stage where we are making clear that this should not happen, and I'm relatively optimistic that we will be successful with our request in this case, but we will have to look at (it) and we have to be very, very cautious.""Before visiting the US, Scholz had urged China to refrain from sending weapons and instead persuade Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine.Images of the death and destruction in Ukraine are everywhere. Compassion fatigue is a natural response to such overexposure, but empathy can be rebuilt. It's all in the way media and social media users represent crises.

            TSMC said it is looking for young engineers with associates, bachelor’s, master’s, or doctorate degrees in electrical engineering or software-related fields in all cities around Taiwan, according to Reuters. The world’s largest contract chipmaker said that the average overall pay for a new engineer with a master’s degree starts at NT$2 million (US$65,425), the report added.

            The hiring push comes amid a global slowdown in the semiconductor sector. A reduction in the overall demand for consumer electronics has led to a glut of chips at some companies, after years of shortages during the pandemic.

            The Taiwanese chipmaker, however, has so far been able to avoid most of the downturn affecting the rest of the sector due to its dominance in the high-end chip segment. The company had 61,777 employees registered for 2022, a year-on-year increase of 7,584 workers.

The agency also said that from 2020 to the end of 2022, 179,000 tons of waste has been cleared from Taiwan’s shores.Environmental consulting firm Indigo Waters carried out a separate survey and estimated that the amount of waste on Taiwan’s shorelines was 955 tons. They surveyed 10 sites, and showed the shorelines of Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan were the dirtiest, accounting for 26% of the waste, followed by the Kaohsiung-Pingtung section at 11%, and Taiwan’s east coast at 5%.They also found that the plastic bottles and cans on Taiwan’s shores were largely domestically produced, accounting for up to 90% in Pingtung, and more than half in Yunlin and Chiayi, per UDN. Kinmen was the outlier in this regard with 90% of the waste coming from China.Indigo Waters CEO Yen Ning (顏寧) also said that fisheries produced about 60% of Taiwan’s coastal waste through discarded buoys, fishing lines, and other detritus.

Although commercial flights were slated to begin in February, a China Eastern Airlines C919 jet suffered an engine malfunction on Feb.1, leading to further delays in its debut.When landing at Beijing Capital International Airport on a short flight from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport that day, one of the plane's engines ""failed to open the thrust reverser,"" reported Asia Times. This technical issue will likely delay plans for the aircraft to finish its first 100 hours of flight tests, which is required for the airline to receive a certificate to operate it commercially.Thus far, China Eastern Airlines is the only Chinese carrier to attempt to put the C919 in service, while other domestic airlines are slow to place orders. As a new, Chinese-funded, low-cost carrier, GBA, would seem to be the ideal candidate as it is headquartered in Hong Kong and founded by Shenzhen-based property tycoon Bill Wong Cho-bau.However, on March 3, the firm announced that instead of ordering the C919, it announced that it will purchase 15 Boeing 737-9s. Its agreement with the American company also includes a commitment for five 787 Dreamliners, according to a Boeing press release.The 739-9 MAX airliner costs about US$52 million (NT$1.5 billion) each and the order of 15 jets is estimated to be worth between US$780 million and US$800 million, aviation expert David Yu told SCMP.When asked by Nikkei whether GBA would acquire the C919, Wong, who is a former member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the airline does not currently plan to acquire any aircraft from Comac.

Through this partnership, businesses in the region will be able to ""plug-and-play"" decarbonisation solutions as they undertake ESG transformation towards meeting net zero goals. They will also be able to raise green financing, gain credible accreditations and certifications, and leverage digital tools for cost effective growth. A major focus of the partnership will be to facilitate low carbon and energy efficiency project origination, structuring, financing and implementations.   The four partnering organisations are Bureau Veritas (BV), Energy Institute (EI), Maybank Singapore (Maybank) and two research institutes at the National University of Singapore (NUS) - Energy Studies Institute (ESI) and Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN). These four organisations have each signed a Memorandum of Understanding with KPMG to provide their complementary expertise to catalyse businesses' decarbonisation goals via the Hub.   KPMG and the four partnering organisations will work together to help businesses manage the impact of climate change (see figure 1 below). Leveraging their complementary skills, they will provide businesses with customised plans to achieve their net-zero goals, including creating a carbon reduction roadmap and supporting implementation. Companies will also receive tools and solutions to pilot environment-friendly projects that offer economic incentives for reducing carbon emissions. In addition, Maybank will provide sustainable financing to encourage a strong pipeline of decarbonisation projects - this will set a precedent for successful use cases across the decarbonisation value chain, thereby increasing financing for similar projects in the region.   Finally, the Hub will also be running industry workshops in collaboration with the Energy Institute and develop thought leadership and research in the decarbonisation space together with NUS. Some of the capability development and transformation tools slated to be covered include energy efficiency across the value chain, electrification of vehicles, greening of buildings, renewable energy integration, smart grids and carbon sequestration, among others. KPMG plans to collaborate with more organisations in the future, via the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub, to provide businesses with greater capabilities and expertise that can address their decarbonisation requirements.   Annex A outlines the roles of each partnering organisation.   Sharad Somani, Partner, Head of KPMG ESG, KPMG in Singapore said, ""As businesses strive to achieve net-zero commitments, they must develop implementable plans and document their carbon footprint through climate accounting infrastructure to demonstrate progress. Unfortunately, not all companies are equipped to do so. To successfully tackle climate change, collaboration is essential. That's why KPMG created the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub – to bring together organisations with complementary skills, with the shared goal of net-zero emissions – which we are seeing in this collaborative alliance with Bureau Veritas, Energy Institute, Maybank and the National University of Singapore. KPMG is also expanding the tools, financing and access to expertise for both public and private sectors to help build resilience and reach sustainability objectives during uncertain economic conditions – all in pursuit of achieving net-zero emissions.""   In a  KPMG 2022 CEO Outlook survey, Singapore CEOs identified the main barriers to their ESG strategies as the difficulties in identifying and measuring metrics (28 percent), lack of skills for implementation (28 percent) and lack of budget for investing in ESG transformation (20 percent). Hence, this collaborative alliance with its plug-and-play solutions, expertise and training for decarbonisation are intended to address these concerns and help move Singapore closer to reaching its goal of reducing emissions to 60 million tonnes by 2030.   Decarbonising of industries is expected to create 5.5 million jobs globally by 2050, and 50,000 in Singapore by 2030. These jobs may include those in areas such as energy efficiency, supply chain decarbonisation, green procurement, new energy technologies, carbon trading and green finance.

In today's world where sustainability knows no borders, I am delighted that Bureau Veritas, as a Business to Business to Society company, has shown its critical role to shape trust between businesses, public authorities and consumers.""   Peter Godfrey, Managing Director - APAC of the Energy Institute said that ""creating a just energy transition towards a greener, cleaner future represents one, if not the greatest, of challenges of our time, and decarbonisation lies at the very heart of this challenge. But at the time, the energy transition has the potential to become a massive opportunity, not only by transforming our lives but by creating fundamentally new ways of value creation and increased prosperity focused on the creation of a more sustainable future for us all. To achieve these opportunities requires collective effort by governments, businesses, and individuals to ensure that economic, social and political challenges such as energy security, job creation and addressing energy poverty are overcome as part of our journey to a more sustainable world. The Energy Institute's is focused on ""Creating a better energy future for our members and society by acceleration a just global energy transition to net zero"" and, within this context, is proud to be working in partnership with KPMG to develop its newly established ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub. There is much that can be done to improve the regulatory, technical and investment/financial inertia directed at accelerating sustainable business practices with the SE Asia region and we look forward to assisting in the process of building the capacity required to build appropriate pathways towards the more sustainable future we all strive for"".   Dr John Lee, Maybank Singapore Country Chief Executive Officer & CEO, said, ""Maybank Singapore is proud to be part of this forward step in driving our leadership position in the sustainability agenda through this joint partnership. This is also aligned with the Maybank Group's approach to develop strategic alliances with like-minded sustainability advocates to facilitate knowledge exchange in today's business environment, where ESG is increasingly an important agenda for many companies. We will continue to advocate sustainable financing solutions that can drive down emissions. As a leading bank in Asia and as the only bank with an omnipresence in all 10 ASEAN countries, we want to drive long-term value creation for businesses and the community, remaining true to our mission of Humanising Financial Services. As decarbonisation is a transition journey for many, we will help potential clients to navigate their ESG journey with us to create a sustainable future yet meet their business objectives at the same time.""   Associate Professor Lee Poh Seng, Director of NUS Energy Studies Institute, said, ""ESI is thrilled to partner with KPMG on this important initiative. Together, we will be able to leverage our collective expertise to tackle some of the most pressing energy challenges of our time, including decarbonization and the development of new digital tools and methodologies. We believe that this collaboration will expand the range of opportunities, and depth of impact we have in accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future for Singapore and beyond.""   Professor Sumit Agarwal, Managing Director of Sustainable and Green Finance Institute at NUS, said, ""SGFIN enthusiastically supports this crucial initiative as a part of NUS' broader push towards a more sustainable world. Data-driven research is an important driver of potential innovations, tools and solutions that will accelerate the development of businesses' capability in tackling difficult challenges towards a lower-carbon society.""   About the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub   Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles are becoming critical for companies not only from regulatory and compliant perspectives, but primarily as a key business imperative. To help provide pathways and solutions for decarbonisation, the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub is working with companies across ASEAN countries in a 'hub-and-spoke' model. It also works with both governments and corporate sector to create sustainable financing models and facilitate large scale ESG transformation.   The coverage extends to projects across the three identified targets sectors with high carbon footprint – Energy, Transport & Logistics, and Built Environment & Real Estate. Some examples of projects that the Hub has started to work on include: replacing diesel with renewable energy, setting up funds for early retirement of coal fired power projects under the Energy Transition Mechanism, developing pilot green hydrogen projects in emerging markets, setting up solar and wind energy platforms, developing use cases for smart & sustainable cities, advising on emerging technologies including carbon capture and storage, and facilitating the raising of green and sustainable finance for environmentally friendly projects.   The Hub will help businesses operationalise decarbonisation by using strategies like pursuing energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy. Companies can also gain regulatory agility through introducing new policies and technologies internally, as well as carrying out training programmes.   The Hub will also assist in forming and nurturing climate-focused partnerships across supply chains - such as working with smaller suppliers - in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the final product. Finally, it can support companies in gathering data, leveraging technology to detect patterns of consumption and emissions, demonstrating progress made in decarbonisation programmes, as well as gaining the trust of stakeholders.    Annex A: Roles and involvement in collaboration        Company    Roles and involvement      KPMG in Singapore                KPMG, a leading professional services firm, will work together with BV, Maybank and NUS to originate decarbonisation opportunities. KPMG will also build ecosystem capabilities in decarbonisation, ESG and transformation by running workshops for businesses on knowledge sharing and industry best practices. To aid companies looking to scale in global competitiveness while being relevant locally, KPMG will enable access of participating companies to its global network of experts on ESG and decarbonisation. Finally, KPMG will also afford participating companies its anticipatory thought leadership in energy diversification, operational decarbonisation, supply chain management and sustainable finance as well as its digital tools backed by artificial intelligence and blockchain to capture, measure and verify emissions data – these tools and insights are expected to help companies project long-term to take advantage of upcoming trends in their business models and decarbonisation pathways.                     Bureau Veritas                Bureau Veritas (BV) a world leader in testing, inspection and certification services, will collaborate with KPMG in providing industry players end to end solutions in their decarbonisation projects.

Energy Institute                Energy Institute (EI) will work closely with the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub, through the MOU, with a view to assisting in the provision of quality continuous professional development including, where appropriate, links to its technical and operational guidance activities related to decarbonisation and the energy transition. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, EI is the internationally recognised chartered professional membership body for people who work across the world of energy. Its purpose is ""to create a better energy future for its members and society at large by accelerating a just global energy transition to net zero"" with three core objectives underpinning its activities:-                                 Attracting, developing and equipping the diverse future energy workforce                                 Informing energy decision-making through convening expertise and advice                                 Enabling industry and consumers to make energy lower carbon, safer and more efficient                       Maybank Singapore                Maybank Singapore (Maybank) will work together with KPMG to mobilise funding for low carbon and green projects originated by the ASEAN Decarbonisation Hub. This joint partnership underlies the importance of advancing sustainable financing as there is a growing pressing need to mitigate climate change impact. According to a 2017 United Nations Environment Programme report, annual flows of green finance in Southeast Asia were estimated at              US$40 billion, and an estimated              US$200 billion green investment is needed in ASEAN per year till 2030 against climate change effects to protect the people's livelihoods and ASEAN economies. As green financing is key to unlocking a sustainable future which is aligned with the Maybank Group commitment to mobilise RM80 billion in sustainable finance by 2025 to support the transition to a less carbon intensive economy, Maybank Group has as of 30 September 2022, mobilised about RM29 billion– out of which 59 per cent of the green financing was from Singapore. Maybank has also been involved in arranging and participating in Shariah compliant sustainability-linked loans and green loans, totalling S$4.5 billion. Additionally, Maybank has facilitated Worldwide Hotels Group's first green loan facility worth S$405 million for its new hotel and commercial development, marking one of the largest bilateral green financing for a hospitality asset in Singapore.                   National University of Singapore                National University of Singapore (NUS) will collaborate in joint research and consultancy projects of mutual interest in the areas of energy technology assessment, decarbonisation pathways, carbon pricing & climate finance, development and enhancement of digital tools, and life-cycle accounting methodologies. The Energy Studies Institute (ESI) will bring its deep industry research and modelling capabilities to develop innovative frameworks that will help transform the sectors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827966,Far East Film Festival celebrates 25 years of supporting Taiwanese filmmakers,"UDINE (Taiwan News) — A film festival in a small city in northern Italy in April will celebrate 25 years of introducing popular Asian cinema to the world and 25 years of championing the cause of Taiwan cinema in particular.

            The Far East Film Festival (FEFF) has been staged in Udine, Italy—about an hour’s drive out of Venice—since 1998 and over the years it has both played host to and helped introduce the wider world to the cinema of such famous Taiwanese filmmakers as Wei Te-sheng and Giddens Ko. And this year’s staging of FEFF25—from April 21 to 29—will be celebrating those past collaborations while exploring new ones.

            “Our festival has connected with Taiwan since our very beginnings and we have watched Taiwanese cinema continue to grow and produce exciting new talent every year,” FEFF co-founder and president Sabrina Baracetti told Taiwan News.

            In recent years, the link between FEFF and Taiwan cinema has been formalized through a partnership with the Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA). It’s a collaboration that includes the presentation of new and recently released Taiwanese films as part of the main festival program as well as the attendance of Taiwanese filmmakers at FEFF’s film development sidebars, the Focus Asia All Genres Project Market and the Far East in Progress production initiative, as well as The Ties That Bind production workshops.











            Just this week, the TAICCA-FEFF collaboration announced a new cash prize of €10,000 (NT$327,027) for the best project from this year’s All Genres Project Market and their callout for submissions from Taiwan has been extended until March 10. Organisers are looking for people with “a film in advanced development phase and find the most suitable co-production and financing partners through a series of individual meetings with over 150 film professionals and decision makers from Asia and Europe.”

            These programs are concerned with the business of getting films made, and to that end, FEFF has been helping provide forums where Taiwanese projects can reach international partners, including investors and buyers.

            Past Taiwanese success stories to emerge from FEFF and its partners include the Golden Horse-nominated family drama Moneyboys (2021) by director C.B.Yi and Tomorrow Is A Long Time (2023) by director Jow Zhi Wei, which was screened as part of this year’s Generation 14plus program at the Berlin International Film Festival.

            And while this year’s FEFF line-up—and news of the Taiwanese films and filmmakers who will be making the trip—will be announced closer to the actual event, another of the festival’s sidebars in the FEFF Campus initiative has been launched and is actively looking for applicants from Taiwan.

            The FEFF Campus is a fully hosted program that gives 10 young film industry hopefuls, five from Europe and five from Asia, a chance to embed themselves in daily festival life, and life in Italy. Applicants must be “aged 26 or under, obsessed by Asian cinema, and keen to join a program that includes seminars and workshops that look into the world of Asian film, and how to review and write about it.""

            Successful applicants will join the campus for 10 days of immersion in the world of FEFF, during which time they will be able to interview some of the biggest names in Asian cinema, while working on both their writing and reviewing skills under the mentorship of seasoned industry professionals. All reviews and articles will be published on international platforms such as Taiwan News.

            “Across the years, we have continued to support Asian cinema and to encourage Asian film fans to join the industry that we love. The FEFF Campus does exactly that as we gather Asian film lovers from across the world and we give them the opportunity to learn—and to have a lot of fun,” said Baracetti. “The Campus is a platform through which aspiring film industry professionals can launch their careers— and we are happy to help them on their way. This year, as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, we would especially love to hear from Taiwan’s young generation of film fanatics.”

""We will exercise restraint and won’t launch the first strike,"" said Chiu per Storm Media.KMT lawmaker Chiang Chi-chen (江啟臣) also asked whether small-scale joint military exercises between Taiwan and the U.S. would be upgraded to the battalion level, and whether it would be possible for the U.S. to set up a military advisory group based in Taiwan for future military exchanges.Chiu said no such discussions were underway, nor had he heard any talk of the matter. Chiu, however, did say military negotiations are regularly conducted between Taiwan and the U.S., per Liberty Times.As for whether foreign weapons or munitions could be stored in Taiwan, Chiu said this was not an issue that required consultation with the U.S., noting that Taiwan is free to decide its own fate on this matter.Chiu was also asked whether an increase in U.S. military inventory in East Asia could potentially be stored in Taiwan. He responded that discussions were underway, though progress of such talks are private and only shared with members of the legislature’s Foreign and Defense Committee.",2023/03/06,2758,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827986,South Korea says its own companies will pay to resolve forced labour dispute with Japan,"SEOUL/TOKYO March 6 (Reuters) - South Korea said on Monday that its companies would compensate people forced to work under Japan's 1910-1945 occupation, seeking to end a dispute that has undercut U.S.-led efforts to present a unified front against China and North Korea.The proposal was welcomed in Tokyo but faced immediate backlash from some victims and South Korea's main opposition party, who accused the government of capitulating to Japan.U.S. President Joe Biden, whose administration has pressed its two allies to reconcile, hailed the announcement as ""groundbreaking.""A Japanese government source close to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the United States has been pressing both countries to reconcile, but that a main factor that triggered Yoon's push for reconciliation is the geopolitical threat from North Korea.The disagreements over labour and women forced into Japanese military brothels have bedevilled ties between the two pivotal U.S. allies for years, but South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has made a push to repair the relationship.Under the plan, South Korea would compensate former forced labourers through an existing public foundation funded by private-sector companies, Foreign Minister Park Jin told a briefing.""The soured South Korea-Japan relations should no longer be neglected, and we need to end the vicious cycle for the national interest, for the people,"" Park said. He said he hopes Japan responds sincerely, including by ""implementing its previous public statements expressing remorse and apology.""Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he welcomed the proposal and said he would work closely with Yoon.Japanese companies will not be expected to make any payments under the plan, but would not be blocked from donating if they want, said Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi.""We welcome this as a step that returns Japan-South Korea relations to a healthy one,"" he said.Poor relations between the two have been a point of concern for the United States, which is seeking to present a more unified front with its allies against the rising power of China and threats from North Korea's expanding missile and nuclear arsenal.In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden said the announcements were a ""a groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership between two of the United States’ closest allies"" and a ""critical step to forge a future for the Korean and Japanese people that is safer, more secure, and more prosperous.""SOUTH KOREAN FUNDSRelations plunged to their lowest point in decades after South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered Japanese firms to pay reparations to former forced labourers. Fifteen South Koreans have won such cases, but none has been compensated.Japan has said the compensation issue was settled under a 1965 treaty, and Hayashi said his government's stance had not changed.When Seoul first raised its proposal in January, it sparked backlash from victims and their families because it did not include contributions from Japanese companies, including those ordered by South Korean courts to pay reparations.About a dozen protesters demonstrated outside as Park made the announcement.""Today's humiliating resolution is a result of (the South Korean government's) consistently low posture towards the Japanese government,"" representatives of some of the victims said at a separate event.Some of the 15 plaintiffs say they will reject the government's plan, setting the stage for more legal battles.""It's not a proper apology,"" Yang Geum-deok, one of the victims, told reporters. ""It should never be like this when there are people who actually did the wrong.""The main opposition Democratic Party denounced the plan as ""submissive diplomacy.""""It's a day of shame,"" An Ho-young, a spokesperson for the party, said in a statement. ""Japanese companies embroiled in war crimes received indulgence without even budging, and the Japanese government managed to remove a trouble by having the grace to repeat past statements.""The South Korean companies include KT&G 033780.KS, Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) 015760.KS and other companies that benefited from a 1965 treaty between South Korea and Japan.KT&G said it is carefully monitoring the discussions on compensation for victims of forced labour and plans to faithfully cooperate in implementing the agreements. KEPCO said it would review the issue.POSCO holdings said it would consider how to support the intent of the government's announcement.Asked whether Japanese companies will pitch in to compensate, Park said both Japanese and South Korean businesses were considering a plan to make voluntary payments.South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing unnamed government sources, had said that as part of the deal Seoul and Tokyo had tentatively agreed to create a separate ""future youth fund"" to sponsor scholarships with funds from companies in both countries.Two of the companies ordered by South Korean courts to make restitution, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd 7011.T and Nippon Steel Corp 5401.T, declined to comment on the agreement, referring to their long-held stance that the issue of compensating wartime labourers had been resolved under the 1965 treaty.The row spilled over into a trade dispute in 2019, with Tokyo tightening curbs on exports to South Korea of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips and Seoul filing a World Trade Organization (WTO) complaint in response.Hayashi said the export curbs are separate from the forced labour dispute, but on Monday both countries' trade ministries said South Korea would put its WTO complaint on hold while the two sides negotiate to return trade to its pre-2019 status.",2023/03/06,166,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828011,Taiwan's Delta becomes Thailand's most valuable company,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Thai subsidiary of a Taiwanese electronics and auto parts supplier has become the most valuable company on Thailand’s stock exchange as the country experiences an electric vehicle (EV) boom.Delta Electronics Thailand is now more valuable than its Taiwanese parent company, and has also overtaken the world’s most valuable airport operator, Airports of Thailand, according to Nikkei. Over the past year, Delta Thailand shares have increased in value by a whopping 163%, exceeding 1000 Thai baht (NT$890) for the first time on Thursday (March 2.)The growth follows the Thai government’s February announcement that it will work towards transforming the country’s highly developed automotive supply chain away from combustion engines and towards EVs. At the same time, the Thai government also announced a range of economic incentives for EV producers and consumers, including reducing import taxes by 40%, and subsidizing EV purchases by 70,000 to 150,000 baht per vehicle.In January Bloomberg reported that despite the record growth, analysts were predicting an over 41% drop in value over the coming year. The company’s share price was down 2.4% at market close on Monday (March 6), but has generally continued to climb since the analysts’ comments.The Taiwanese parent company Delta Electronics Inc. is also riding high on the EV boom and in February recorded a profit for the first time since it entered the EV business in 2008, per Business Next. The company is expected to post a revenue of over NT$384 billion (US$12 billion) in 2022.Delta Electronics’ Chairman Hai Ying-chun (海英俊) appears to be highly optimistic about the company’s prospects, as the company has solidified its position in a sector with relatively high barriers to entry. Estimates suggest it would take a producer at least 5 years to begin production if starting from nothing.""Even if there are competitors, the competition is not too fierce,” Hai said. “We have already received the orders.”Delta Electronics was founded in Taiwan in 1971 and has facilities in China, Europe, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and the US.",2023/03/06,2021,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828019,Petition calls for dropping Donnie Yen from Oscars over CCP ties,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A petition is calling for the removal of Hong Kong martial arts actor Donnie Yen as a presenter for next week's Academy Awards ceremony due to his overt support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), recent promotion in the party, and criticism of the Hong Kong democracy protests.At the height of the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests, Yen in 2020 drew criticism for uploading a post to Facebook showing himself shaking hands with Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping (習近平) at an event in 2017 which he fondly described as the day ""Hong Kong returned to the motherland."" The actor has also drawn criticism for doing blackface for two different roles in the film ""All's Well, Ends Well 2011.""Yen, who renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2010, was appointed to the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in January. On Sunday (March 5), Yen told Chinese state-run media that it was an honor to be a member of the CPPCC. ""It’s a great responsibility and I will try my best to do this job well and serve everyone. I want to do something practical for the country,"" said Yen.In an interview with GQ published on Feb. 28, Yen gushed with praise for the ""modernization"" brought to China by the CCP and ""the progress — the freeways, the architecture, the convenience of lifestyle."" In contrast, he described the Hong Kong pro-democracy far more negatively: “It wasn’t a protest, okay, it was a riot.""Incensed by Yen's recent comments, netizens who called themselves ""a group of people from Hong Kong"" on Saturday (March 4) started a Change.org petition titled ""Cancel inviting an actor Donnie Yen as a presenter for the Oscars."" In the petition, the organizers criticized Yen for backing the CCP's violation of human rights and argued that the Oscars should ""represent respect for human rights and moral values, rather than support for actions that violate them.""The petition's creators wrote that Yen's words of support for the CCP's policies, including the imposing of the Draconian National Security Law in Hong Kong ""not only violate the spirit of freedom of speech but also deny the rights of the people of Hong Kong to fight for their freedom and democracy."" The authors condemned the academy for showing ""contempt for the people of Hong Kong"" by inviting him to the awards.The petition warned that allowing Yen to present on the program would ""damage the image and reputation of the film industry and cause serious harm to human rights and moral values."" The group called on the Oscars committee members to reconsider their decision and work to ""uphold human rights and moral values.""With 89 likes, the most popular reason for signing was posted by Jenny Lam, who wrote ""He doesn't stand up for freedom and democracy, which could violate the values of the Oscar prizes."" Close behind at 78 likes was Matthew Leung, who wrote ""Oscar should prevent this CCP clown (from) contaminate(ing) the show.""As of publication, the petition has gained over 32,000 signatures.",2023/03/06,4730,World

JPEX announced that it plans to apply for the latest crypto trading license given by the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government in Hong Kong.            JPEX announced that it has plans to apply for the latest crypto trading license given by the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government in Hong Kong. Some of the services JPEX will provide to customers in Hong Kong once the license has been granted include, but are not limited to spot trading, derivatives, and other crypto services such as staking.    SFC Launched a Consultation on Licensing    Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced a consultation On February 20 to solicit ideas from the market on ""whether licensed platform operators should be permitted to provide services to retail investors"" and ""how to protect investors"". Under the new licensing system, which will come into effect on June 1, 2023, all centralized virtual asset trading platforms operating in Hong Kong or marketing to Hong Kong investors will need to be licensed by the SFC. And the consultation will end on March 31. JPEX hopes that the new policy direction will set a new milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.    Jpex Is Fully Prepared to Apply for Hong Kong Crypto Trading License    JPEX is now fully prepared to apply for Hong Kong crypto trading license, after previously giving up several times due to the Hong Kong government's restrictions on the crypto industry.   Previously, the Hong Kong government only allowed users with a portfolio of at least HK$8 million (US$1 million) to trade in cryptocurrency investments. However, since Hong Kong is an international financial center, it should be open and accommodating to emerging financial services, including virtual asset services and new entrants to the global cryptocurrency industry, regardless of their assets. The impact of the previous policy has made it difficult for new users to participate in virtual asset trading.   JPEX said it will review related systems and controls to prepare for the new system, compliance with rules and regulations to ensure the application provides better service to customers.   With SFC finally changing its stance on cryptocurrencies which signifies the SAR government's open and friendly attitude, JPEX will continue to collect information about licensing system. And it will also be holding extensive discussions with personnel in its legal department to advance the licensing process. Hashtag: #JPEX

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828127,"Kinmen, Matsu military presence pointless: Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Following complaints of food shortages from frontline troops stationed in Matsu, Taiwan politician and former DPP heavyweight Shih Ming-teh (施明德) has reiterated his call on the government for immediate demilitarization of the outlying Taiwan islands of Kinmen and Matsu.He said the two islands’ defense commands only exist to benefit senior military leaders.Shih made the comments on Monday (March 6) in a social media post following news the army was struggling to supply fresh food to the soldiers stationed in Matsu. He said the troops being stationed there was pointless.He added that everyone knows Kinmen people get their daily necessities and food from the Chinese city of Xiamen, which is just 5 kilometers away at the nearest point.“I advocate a complete withdrawal of troops to remove the most likely thing to cause a conflict on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and offer China the most meaningful olive branch in the past 70 years,” Shih posted on Facebook.He added that turning what was now the “small war zone” of Matsu and Kinmen into a zone of peace would ensure mutual respect, equality, and peaceful coexistence.Shih blasted politicians and generals who he said support the militarization of the islands ""out of self-interest,"" rather than being rational.""It is making the remote islands vulnerable to enemy invasion and the ill-motivated politicians or generals would profit if there was a conflict between the U.S. and China,"" he said.He noted that even though the number of troops on Kinmen and Matsu has been massively reduced over the years, two large defense commands for the islands still exist.Soldiers made headlines on Monday after they wrote messages in the sand of a Matsu beach complaining about the lack of fresh food.In February, a bipartisan group of Kinmen legislators submitted a petition to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also calling for the island’s permanent demilitarization. They cited concern over mounting tensions between China, Taiwan, and the U.S.The legislators said they did not want history to repeat itself, referencing the heavy shelling endured over the course of two Taiwan Strait crises throughout the 1950s.Shih said that he had discussed the issue with legislators last month, and that he hopes to report to President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文）what was discussed.“I saw that members of the Kinmen Council, regardless of party affiliation, have put forward a call for a ‘Kinmen Permanent Demilitarized Zone,’ hoping to get rid of the threat of war, engage in regional exchanges, and improve their living standards,” he said.Shih is a major figure in Taiwan’s current and historical political landscape. He was an early champion of the Tangwai movement, which was the first in Taiwan to challenge the Kuomintang’s military dictatorship.Shih spent a total of 25 years in prison as a political prisoner between 1962 and 1990, and was elected to the legislature for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan’s first-ever free elections in 1992. He became the chair of the DPP in the mid-1990s, and in 2006 led a large anti-government corruption campaign.",2023/03/06,1866,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828191,Vingroup Chairman Establishes Electric Vehicle Rental and Taxi Service Company,"HANOI, VIETNAM -      Media OutReach - 6 March 2023 - Vingroup Chairman Pham Nhat Vuong announced the establishment of the Green and Smart Mobility Joint Stock Company (GSM), an entity dedicated to using VinFast electric cars and scooters for rental and taxi services. GMS is the world's first multi-platform green transport rental and taxi service aiming to popularize the experience of electrified mobility while advocating Green Lifestyle.            With a charter capital of 3,000 billion VND (approximately $125.7 million), GSM was founded by Vingroup Chairman, Mr. Pham Nhat Vuong, who holds a 95% stake. The company will use VinFast electric vehicles and operate in the two sectors of vehicle rentals and electric taxi services.            Specifically, GSM will offer electric car rental services for traditional and online taxi service providers and their employees. At the same time, GSM will also operate its own electric car taxi service. Vietnam's first pure electric taxi firm is planned to commence its operation by next month in Hanoi and will expand nationwide in 2023.   All vehicles provided and used by GSM are VinFast electric vehicles. The initial investment scale is 10,000 cars and 100,000 motorbikes.   Mr. Nguyen Van Thanh, CEO of GSM JSC said: ""GSM was established to further the development of the green and smart mobility ecosystem in Vietnam, providing people with more options to use electric vehicles at reasonable pricing.Whether it is just a few dozen minutes in a taxi or a few weeks or months of renting, customers will have the opportunity to experience the smart features and convenience of electric vehicles. In this way, we can accelerate the smart electric vehicle revolution faster and stronger in Vietnam.""   GSM aims to promote the usage of electric vehicles by raising awareness about the convenience, intelligence, and sustainability of electric vehicles. By offering direct driving experiences (with test drive customers) and opportunities to enjoy smart technology features and amenities in vehicles (rental customers, electric taxi passengers,...), GSM will introduce VinFast electric cars to the broader public and gradually establish the habit of using smart and environmentally friendly transport in the daily lives of Vietnamese people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828210,Nord Stream: Putin's pipeline into German politics?,"It seems like a scene from a crime movie, but it actually happened in northeastern Germany in the spring of 2022: A tax official found tax documents relating to a gift of €20 million ($21 million) from Russia to a German climate foundation. The documents had been urgently sought in her office, but no one could find them. Instead of handing them in, the official took the files home and burned them in her fireplace.What went up in flames were documents from the Climate and Environmental Protection Foundation in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the Baltic Sea, the endpoint of the two Russian gas pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2, which were later damaged by explosions in the fall of 2022.The climate foundation was established at the request of the state's Social Democrat (SPD) State Premier Manuela Schwesig in early 2021, a time when US sanctions threatened the completion of Nord Stream 2. According to the statutes, the non-profit foundation was allowed to set up a business operation that was to ""contribute to the completion of the pipeline"" — while the United States were threatening Germany with sanctions.""This foundation had a cover mission,"" Mario Czaja, secretary general of the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU), recently told the Bundestag. ""Instead of protecting the climate, it was to bring Nord Stream 2 online at all costs, circumvent possible sanctions and pave the way for business for the Russian state-owned company.""What Czaja says is undisputed. His CDU was in a coalition government with the SPD in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania at the time and also supported starting the foundation in a vote in the state parliament. Today, the CDU admits this was a mistake.The foundation then took over the construction of the pipeline, so it placed orders and paid companies for their work. It also bought the ""Blue Ship,"" which was used to attach the pipeline's pipes to the Baltic Sea floor.On top of that, the foundation also bought shares in a shipbroker, tools, and vehicles such as wheel loaders and machinery. Some 80 companies stopped working for Nord Stream but carried on as subcontractors of the foundation. The order volume totaled €165 million.""The foundation had no other purpose than to act as a general contractor for the Kremlin, as Putin's long arm, and to pave the way for business for the Russian state-owned corporation,"" Czaja told the Bundestag. For this reason alone, he argues, Gazprom made a donation of €20 million to the foundation.The CDU criticism is shared by the business-oriented Free Democrats (FDP), the smallest party in Olaf Scholz's federal coalition government.A central question is ""what expectations the Kremlin"" had associated with the payment, says Hagen Reinhold, an FDP Bundestag member from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. ""Who seriously believes that €20 million were transferred from Gazprom to this foundation to create seagrass meadows in the Baltic Sea? No one believes that!""State Premier Schwesig insists that the money was only ever intended for the foundation's non-profit sector, i.e. climate and environmental protection. However, this was never put in writing.Schwesig says it was an agreement made in private with the head of Nord Stream 2, Matthias Warnig, who was acting on behalf of Russia.Warnig is a colorful figure. A former Stasi secret service agent in the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR), he has been a close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin for decades. The two are believed to know each other from Putin's time as a KGB officer in Dresden. After the end of communist East Germany, Warnig became one of the most influential German managers in Russia and sat on numerous supervisory boards of German-Russian companies and banks.Schwesig was trying to get Nord Stream 2 up and running until the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Why did she hold on to the project so vehemently, even though the German federal government had long since backed away from the pipeline, her political opponents ask?The premier has a degree in finance and, before her political career, worked for twelve years as a tax official for the tax investigation department and later in the Finance Ministry. She, therefore, had to know that the €20 million would only remain tax-free only if the charitable status had been fixed in writing.Without this stipulation, the donation would be taxable as a gift, because the money could have been spent for the foundation's other purposes, i.e. also for the pipeline.Was this what Schwesig and Warnig intended? That would mean that money from Russia would have flowed into the state coffers.A parliamentary investigative committee in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has been trying to clarify this question since June 2022 but is not making much progress. One reason is that many of the files are only to the members of parliament in largely redacted form, which the CDU's Mario Czaja has described as ""trickery, deception, and cover-up.""Schwesig moved quickly to put an end to the Climate Foundation after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. In March 2022, she announced that the organization would be dissolved, and its capital used for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. But to date, this has not happened, partly because the foundation's board is bitterly opposed to the dissolution and is also appealing against the tax assessment requiring payment of €9.8 million in tax.This brings us back to the tax office, where the foundation's tax return remained unprocessed for months and in the end, could not be found. As it turned out, it had been misfiled. When the tax officer responsible for it found it again by chance, she feared personal consequences, panicked, and burned the documents. The 26-year-old later confessed to investigators. The public prosecutor's office was called in, and disciplinary proceedings are underway against the officer.Schwesig claims to have learned of the burned file only recently from the media. ""I don't believe that,"" responded Mario Czaja. ""A head of government who keeps pretty much everyone in her sphere of influence on a short leash in order to have everything under control is supposed to have known nothing about all this, is supposed not to have been informed about this process by her finance minister, by her justice minister?""Schwesig rejects this criticism. ""A state premier does not interfere in fiscal and prosecutorial matters, and that is none of her business,"" the Social Democrat countered on public broadcaster ARD. But she did not answer the question as to whether she would also testify under oath.She may yet have to do exactly that before the parliamentary investigative committee. A subpoena is becoming increasingly likely. Schwesig can't escape the past.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/06,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828214,Why the cult of Joseph Stalin is flourishing,"It was an unusually cold March, even by Russian standards. Following Joseph Stalin's sudden death due to a hemorrhagic stroke at the age of 74, four days of national mourning were declared ahead of his state funeral on March 9, 1953.Despite the bitter cold, the population gathered in long queues to pay their respects to the sole ruler and dictator of the giant Soviet Union. So many people wanted to see the body of the ""Father of Nations,"" as the Soviet press referred to him then, that hundreds of people were crushed to death on the day of the funeral.It took the Soviet leadership several years to distance itself from ""Stalin's personality cult,"" and it wasn't until the 1960s that it was publicly stated for the first time who he really was: a mass murderer.Born Iosif Dzhugashvili in Georgia, the professional revolutionary, whose pseudonym means ""the steel one,"" was already de facto ruler of the Soviet Union by 1923.According to historians' estimates, up to 40 million people were victims of Stalin's terror during his three-decade rule. They were executed, sent to forced labor camps, or starved to death through famines he had engineered. There were mass deportations, and members of the intelligentsia — leading writers, poets, actors, scientists, directors — were denounced as ""enemies of the people,"" tortured or killed.""It may sound strange, but Stalin's death is my first conscious childhood memory,"" Irina Sherbakova told DW. The co-founder of the human rights organization Memorial received the Nobel Peace Prize at the end of 2022.""I was a toddler then, in 1953, but I remember Stalin's death well,"" says the 72-year-old historian. ""I perceived it in a childish way, especially the atmosphere: how the icy cold and fear — the last months of the Stalin era were very oppressive, very depressing — became an expectation of spring.""And spring indeed followed, as Soviet authorities uniformly condemned the tyrant a few years later and began a de-Stalinization process.The dictator's embalmed body, which had initially been placed next to Lenin's in a mausoleum on Red Square in the center of Moscow, was removed from public display and buried outside the walls of the Kremlin in 1961.Countless Stalin monuments and busts in the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, formerly an integral part of the cityscape, were destroyed on a large scale — melted down, buried or thrown into rivers.The Khrushchev Thaw period of the 1960s changed the country forever, laying the groundwork for perestroika policy reforms 20 years later.Created in 1989, Memorial was an international network of human rights organizations whose main focus was addressing the impact of Stalin's terror. But it was shut down by Russia in 2021.For a long time, a rebirth of a Stalin cult seemed unthinkable. But a trend in that direction ""started around 2014, with the annexation of Crimea,"" according to Russian cultural journalist and author Irina Rastorgueva, who, like Sherbakova, currently lives in Berlin.Rastorgueva told DW that in the 1990s and 2000s, there were already attempts to erect Stalin monuments or busts, especially in the provinces or in Stalin's birthplace of Gori in Georgia. Her colleagues working on the Russian-language Wikipedia have been keeping detailed records of all neo-Stalinist monuments.She says that it evolved from individuals putting up busts of Stalin in their allotment gardens to monuments being set up in front of Communist Party headquarters. But what is happening now doesn't even compare, Rastorgueva notes: The Russian state itself is inaugurating new Stalin monuments in the center of big cities.The latest Stalin monument was unveiled on February 1, 2023, in the city of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad), to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the battle of Stalingrad.The mayor of Volgograd stated at the inauguration ceremony that ""certain countries want to erase the memory of the great victory of the Soviet army today,"" but they would not allow that to happen.For the anniversary event, Volgograd was even renamed Stalingrad for a day. ""They could have directly renamed the city Putingrad,"" says Rastorgueva, tongue-in-cheek. The monument stands for the current paradigm of how authorities are ""interpreting history from above,"" she adds.Putin is seeking to rehabilitate the dictator as the leader who fought off the Nazis and turned the Soviet Union into a major world power.""The World War II victory is the last unifying denominator, the last trump card of Russian propaganda,"" explains Rastorgueva.

Amid losses in the war in Ukraine, it becomes all the more important for Moscow to promote the idea that, like Stalin in 1945, Putin is the one who will lead the country to victory, she adds.What is new, according to Irina Sherbakova, is that the Second World War is no longer described as being won by the Allies, the Red Army or even by the ""heroic Soviet people"" — a label coined by Khrushchev in his anti-Stalinism speech in 1956 — but rather by Stalin himself, ""which is also a notion that emerged recently under Putin,"" she notes.Irina Sherbakova believes nothing will stop the neo-Stalinist cult as long as Vladimir Putin leads the country.In fact, the country never completed its de-Stalinization process in the first place: ""Our organization, Memorial, did a great job until it was shut down, but we were just an NGO. It should be the state's duty to confess to its crimes and the citizens' duty to recognize that they have lived in a criminal state,"" says Sherbakova.The historian is convinced that, one day, there will be chapters on ""Stalinism"" and ""Putinism"" in Russian school books. ""But before that happens, we will have to take responsibility for what's happening in Ukraine right now and pay the price. And that price will be very high.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828215,Is China secretly imposing unilateral sanctions?,"China is particularly vocal in its opposition to unilateral sanctions, even when they concern other countries. Just recently, it released a 12-point document on the war in Ukraine with a whole paragraph dedicated to the criticism of unilateral sanctions.China stands firmly on the position that such measures are illegal because they should only be authorized by the UN Security Council.But Beijing has been intensifying the use of economic sanctions in the last five years. ""Ten or 20 years ago, China did not have strong economic links with countries. So sanctioning by cutting off trade and foreign investment was not possible,"" Yukon Huang, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Asia Program, told DW.However, China is now the world's second-largest economy and its largest trading nation. There is a concern that as China's economic power grows, the government will be more tempted to resort to sanctions to protect its interests.China's unilateral sanctions usually have a common feature. Most of the time they are related to territories with a historically contested status such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet and disputed areas in the South China Sea. They comprise what Chinese officials call China's core interests.For the Chinese government, all the issues related to these territories are domestic matters. Thus, any threat to China's interests or foreign sanctions addressing the situation there is interpreted as interference in China's internal affairs and provokes a response.""The United States would find it very unusual if China sanctioned American officials because of such issues as abortion rights, inequalities and police violence because, as they would say, these are the US domestic concerns. In China's view, the issues that trigger sanctions from China are Chinese issues. Why would a foreign government get involved in a domestic issue?"" Huang said.Gathering information on China's sanctions is difficult because quite often they are not announced publicly. ""If you ask a Chinese diplomat, they won't normally admit to using sanctions except in narrow circumstances,"" Darren Lim, a senior lecturer at the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, commented to DW.China imposes formal sanctions when it is on the defensive, for example, in response to former US President Donald Trump's trade war or high-level American officials visiting Taiwan. When Nancy Pelosi, the then-US house speaker, visited Taiwan in 2022, China Customs Administration suspended imports of more than 2,000 food products from the island as well as exports of natural sand essential for Taiwan.In other cases, China resorts to informal mechanisms. ""Many of the other Chinese sanctions take the form of administrative decisions, for example, not renewing an export license or rejecting an export shipment for labeling or phytosanitary issues,"" Lim explained.Thus, researchers often have to rely on information from individual entrepreneurs involved in business with China to determine which sanctions have been lifted and which are still in force.Another mechanism of China's sanctions is public boycotts. In 2020, the fashion brand H&M expressed concerns about reports of forced labor in Xinjiang, which produces about a fifth of the world's cotton, and stopped buying cotton from the region.""These companies will say something about human rights issues and then that will lead to boycotts from the Chinese public. And the Chinese government is involved in that it is helping foment that boycott. They are just enabling the public to punish these companies,"" Lim told DW.H&M and several other Western fashion brands became targets of public boycotts and then disappeared from China's most popular e-commerce platforms, Tmall and JD.com.Nevertheless, there are very few examples of sanctions that changed the policy of another country in a meaningful way. One of them is sanctions against South Korea in 2016-2017 when the country agreed to deploy the US THAAD missile defense systems (MDS).Although China denied imposing sanctions, large Korean corporations such as Hyundai, Samsung and Lotte Group have been targeted by Chinese regulators. The reasons were alleged poor quality and noncompliance with regulations in China. As a result, South Korea's GDP declined by 0.4 % in 2017.Sanctions forced the South Korean government to provide China with a number of important political commitments such as the nondeployment of new American MDSs and not joining the global US MDS network.However, usually, sanctions fail to bring the desired effects because countries manage to find alternative buyers for their goods. Chinese sanctions did not stop Pelosi from visiting Taiwan in 2022 and failed to coerce the Australian government into dropping its criticism when China blocked investigations of the origins of COVID-19 in 2020. There are many signs that these sanctions are slowly being lifted.""One possible purpose of the sanctions, and I think this is probably an effective purpose, is not to change the behavior of the target government: The audience is actually third parties. It's other governments and other countries who see what happens if you disrespect Chinese interests,"" Darren Lim explained to DW. ""In the future, they will be reluctant to take actions that they know will upset Beijing. So, it has this third-party deterrent impact.""Although sanctions are inefficient in immediately changing the behavior of another country, they have acquired a new role as a signaling mechanism. ""Sanctions are likely to be the major vehicle to express displeasure because this is the only power China has short of military pressure,"" Huang commented.At the same time, Huang dispelled concerns that China's economic power will turn unilateral sanctions into a handy coercion mechanism. ""China will never use these sanctions to the extreme. And the reason is very simple: It's counterproductive,"" Huang explained.""Sanctions, from a Chinese viewpoint, are not costless. They impose costs on Chinese companies and consumers. And that's why sanctions are usually of limited duration. So China may be a great economic power, it might use sanctions, but it realizes that practically all sanctions are a zero-sum game. Both sides lose,"" Huang told DW.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828216,Pakistan bans Imran Khan broadcasts,"Pakistan's Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has imposed a ban on media broadcasts of Imran Khan.The ban came into effect on Monday, with the regulator accusing the former prime minister of ""spreading hate speech.""It comes after Khan held a provocative speech in the city of Lahore in his campaign for early elections.Earlier on Monday morning, police authorities also made a failed attempt to arrest Khan at his residency in Lahore.The development is a result of the ongoing back-and-forth between Khan and his successor, Shahbaz Sharif.The order issued by PEMRA said that Khan was ""leveling baseless allegations and spreading hate speech through his provocative statements against state institutions and officers"" which are ""likely to disturb public peace.""PEMRA also suspended the country's private TV station, ARY News, which has been accused of supporting Khan.In an address to his supporters on Sunday outside his residence in Lahore, Khan said, ""I am being summoned in fake cases and the nation should know about them.""Khan further added that it would ""be a bad omen"" for Pakistan if the citizens do not raise their voices against ""corrupt rulers.""He has also previously accused the current governmentof plotting to kill him.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also criticized the ban, tweeting that it ""deplores PEMRA's decision"" to ban Khan and that it has ""always opposed measures to curb voices in the past.""A similar ban was also imposed in 2020 while Khan was in office.The previous ban by PEMRA prohibited the broadcast of live or recorded speeches of former premier Nawaz Sharif.Fawad Chaudhary, a member of Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, told the Associated Press that the move represents the ""nervousness and fear"" amongst the current Shahbaz government over Khan winning the upcoming elections.Since his ouster, Khan has faced several charges by the government.He has been accused of money laundering, hiding assets, unlawfully selling state gifts, and raising illegal funds for his party in the United States, India, and Europe.Khan, however, has denied the charges.aa/rt (dpa, AP, AFP)",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828217,Belarus sentences exiled opposition leader to 15 years,"A court in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Monday handed a 15-year sentence to exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the state news agency Belta reported.Tsikhanouskaya, who is being tried in her absence, escaped Belarus after running for the presidency in 2020 against Alexander Lukashenko.The 40-year-old was charged with conspiring to seize power and high treason. Mass protests followed the election, with the opposition and Western governments claiming that the vote — which saw Lukashenko tighten his grasp on power with a sixth term — was rigged.The demonstrations were the largest and the most prolonged since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. The regime unleashed a brutal crackdown against the protesters, with more than 35,000 people detained.Tsikhanouskaya is being tried alongside four other opposition figures, also in absentia, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. She currently leads the opposition from exile in Lithuania.The five all fled Belarus in the wake of the election and protests. Tsikhanouskaya's supporters have dismissed the charges against her as a politically-motivated farce.A Minsk court handed a 10-year jail term to Nobel Prize-winning activist Ales Bialiatski on Friday,  in a ruling that was widely condemned internationally.Bialiatski was arrested in 2021 and alongside three co-defendants he was charged with financing protests and smuggling money. The 60-year-old founded the authoritarian nation's most prominent rights group, Viasna, and has repeatedly been targeted by security forcesWhile Russia and Belarus are allied in a ""Union State,"" that sees Moscow as the far more powerful partner, Lukashenko dismissed media reports this week that the Kremlin has drawn up a plan to absorb Belarus by 2030.Lukashenko, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, allowed Belarus to be used as a staging post for Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.rc/rt (AFP, AP)",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828218,Saudi Arabia deposits $5 billion in Turkey's central bank,"Saudi Arabia signed an agreement with Turkey on Monday to deposit $5 billion (€4.7 billion) in the country's central bank.It comes as Turkey is struggling with high inflation and the effects of last month's massive earthquake.The kingdom announced the deal through the state-run Saudi Press Agency, calling it ""a testament to the close cooperation and historical ties that exist between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Turkey and its brotherly people.""The decision was made on the order of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman it said.The kingdom gave no details on how the cash would be used or if it could call for the amount to be returned. Deposits of this nature can help increase a national currency's exchange rates against other international currencies.In December of last year, Minister of Finance Mohammed Bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan had announced his country's intention to make the deposit.The move symbolizes a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Turkey after the relationship suffered a heavy blow following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.Last April, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid his first visit to Saudi Arabia since the Khashoggi killing, where he met Prince Mohammed before traveling to Mecca.Prince Mohammed followed with a visit to Ankara in June.los/rt (AP, Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828219,Why a group of Chinese women became human rights activists,"Since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, one of the groups that has been persecuted the most by Chinese authorities has been human rights lawyers. Following the ""709 mass arrest"" in 2015, in which more than 300 lawyers across China were arrested, many are still in detention, have been given lengthy prison sentences, faced exit bans, or simply disappeared.Amid this yearslong, nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers, it has fallen on family members, especially their wives, to become ""accidental human rights defenders."" They speak out against the Chinese government's abuses on social media and in media interviews. They also try to hold authorities accountable by sharing details of the cases with foreign parliamentarians and diplomats.For many of them, defending their husbands' basic rights has turned their own lives upside down. ""Devoting myself to defend basic human rights was not a responsibility that I took on voluntarily,"" Sophie Luo, engineer and wife of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi, told DW. ""But I can no longer give up this second career, as I witness countless injustices during the process of defending human rights.""""Those injustices remind me of the responsibilities that I have as someone who lives in a free country. I always believe in the saying that 'injustice in one place is injustice in the world.' This is my own choice, and the experience has enriched my life and broadened my perspective,"" Luo, who now lives in the US, said.Ding and more than a dozen other human rights activists were arrested in a nationwide crackdown after taking part in a private gathering in the city of Xiamen in December 2019 where they reportedly discussed human rights issues and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Since then, he has reportedly been tortured and blocked from meeting with his lawyer on several occasions.More than three years into his detention, Chinese authorities still haven't handed down a sentence, forcing Luo to pursue different paths to challenge what she describes as the unlawful detention of her husband.Since Ding's arrest, Luo has been juggling between her full-time job as an engineer in the US, looking after her two children, and her advocacy for her detained husband. Despite the pressure, Luo said the experience has helped her become stronger.""When my husband was first arrested in 2013, I used to feel sad all the time, and I was filled with grief when I tried to write him letters,"" she told DW. ""But now when I write to him, I can try to be positive and optimistic. I know he didn't do anything wrong, but rather it is the Chinese government that is in the wrong.""Nevertheless, there are still moments when she admits that she feels particularly depressed.""It has been very difficult for me emotionally,"" she said, adding that she tries to distract herself by focusing her attention on work or talking with friends. ""But when I think of my husband's case, I am still extremely depressed.""Luo is not the only one advocating for a detained husband. Zijuan Chen, the wife of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Chang Weiping, and Mindy Shi, the wife of detained Chinese NGO worker Cheng Yuan, have both been forced into exile in the US after facing repeated threats and harassment from local authorities in China.""After police repeatedly came to my workplace and threatened me, I had to leave China with my son,"" Chen told DW. ""They told my supervisor that I had a Twitter account and I also had contact with external forces. They emphasized that these are illegal behaviors. At the time, I only had two choices: remain silent on my husband's case or kept protesting, which would cause me to lose my job.""It was difficult for Chen to make up her mind about leaving China. ""A part of me felt like I was abandoning my husband, and I didn't know when I would be able to see him again,"" she said. ""But at the same time, since many family members of activists have faced exit bans in the past, I worried if I stayed in China, my son and I would face difficult situations in the future.""Mindy Shi, who was arrested and detained by Chinese authorities after her husband Cheng Yuan was taken away by police in July 2019, told DW that she often has ""survivor's guilt."" She told DW that Cheng has lost around 15 kilograms (33 pounds) since his detention, and that his hair has turned almost completely gray.""When I look around, people in the United States are living peaceful and wonderful lives, and I will often be reminded of the fact that my husband and I live in two very different worlds,"" she said. ""I often think if I hadn't left China, I would not have been able to change anything and I would have faced more threats, but I would also at least feel like I was sharing my husband's suffering.""""But when I think of my daughter, I realize there are very few options left for me in China. It's hard for me to say whether I regret the decision to leave China, but I do often feel survivor's guilt,"" Shi told DW.Facing similar threats and pressure from authorities, several human rights lawyers' wives have followed in Luo, Chen, and Shi's footsteps to the US. As they attempt to settle down in an unfamiliar country with their children, all while continuing their activism, many of them say the challenges that they face have forged a close bond between them.""Now that they are here in the US, we can work together, talk like real sisters, and encourage each other,"" Luo told DW. ""We are like a family, and this friendship is even closer than a real family.""Chen adds that since family members of Chinese human rights lawyers share similar experiences, she often calls other lawyers' wives to share her feelings or the news she receives. ""This is great support,"" she said. ""We all agree that we are not simply defending our husbands due to our love for them. We are also defending them because we can't tolerate the cruelty shown by the Chinese government.""""While we are saving our husbands, we are also helping the international community to think about how they can support human rights activists and their family members in China. The experience has helped us grow and mature. I'm very proud of our community,"" Luo concluded.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/06,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828305,Jewish perspectives on antisemitism in Germany,"Participants in a new study describe being turned down for apartments because the landlords did not want to rent to Jews; being embroiled in conversations defending Israel and even hearing from the dentist that Jews ""use the Holocaust for political purposes.""Incidents such as these have been documented in a new report on Jewish perspectives on antisemitism in Germany gathered from 2017 to 2020 and published by the Federal Association of Departments for Research and Information on Antisemitism (RIAS).  The information was collected during more than 150 interviews with Jewish people. About 150,000 Jewish people live in Germany today.""What comes through is the everydayness of it, that is, that Jewish people are really confronted with antisemitism in everyday situations, even in very mundane situations that cannot be avoided,"" one of the study's authors, Daniel Poensgen, said, adding: ""Whenever the majority population talks about it, I feel as if they often view antisemitism as a problem on the political fringes, or something which happens in the political sphere, for example at protests, which people are able to avoid. But the accounts we received tell an entirely different story.""""Divergence of perspectives,"" was how the RIAS survey describes the gap between the non-Jewish majority and the Jewish minority affected by antisemitism. The perception of what antisemitism is and how it is expressed can vary greatly, the survey concluded. One example is the way the media spoke of the terrorist attack on a synagogue in Halle in 2019 as a ""wake-up call."" To those affected, however, it was the realization of something they had been anticipating for years.Another example is when ""antisemitism is only ever the antisemitism of others,"" as Poensgen put it, referring to when antisemitism is only called out when it is politically useful, say, to discredit an opponent. Meanwhile, one of the survey's interviewees summed up the Jewish experience by asking: ""Where does it not come from?"" There are different worldviews that produce antisemitism, and Jewish people are confronted with all of them at the same time. Taken together, they ""create a major threat scenario,"" Poensgen said.There is an increasing focus on the perspectives of people affected by antisemitism, racism, and sexism. Victims are also speaking out more. This appears to be changing societal perceptions: A survey conducted by the Allensbach Institute (IFD Allensbach) on behalf of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Berlin last year showed that 60% of respondents perceived antisemitism as a widespread problem. The Federal Government Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight against Antisemitism Felix Klein was pleased with the increased awareness of the problem and noted that when he took office in 2018, only 20% of respondents said they saw antisemitism as a widespread problem.Daniel Poensgen suspects a lot may have changed since the survey ended in 2020. But he added: ""There are still also many approaches in which the perspectives of those affected play no role, that is something that's lacking.""Poensgen cited the documenta fifteen festival in Kassel as an example, when one of the world's most important art exhibitions displayed offensive antisemitic caricatures embedded in a work of art  before eventually removing them. ""The Jewish community in Kassel barely played a role in the public debate,"" Poensgen said. Although individual Jewish voices had their say, the systematic inclusion of Jewish perspectives was lacking.The 150 interviews in the survey make clear: The reality for Jews is starkly different from that of those who are not confronted with antisemitism. ""Every day, those affected by antisemitism must weigh up their commitment to their Jewish identity on the one hand, and a way of living that minimizes the risk of antisemitic incidents on the other,"" the RIAS report stated. That pertains to the security of synagogues and Jewish kindergartens, for example, as well as to the question of how openly Jewish symbols are worn.""Overall, I hope that a stronger consideration of the perspectives of those affected helps bring the everyday nature of antisemitism more into public consciousness,"" Poensgen concluded. ""I also hope antisemitic actions are taken more seriously, even if they do not cross the threshold of criminal liability.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828306,"Five facts about Holi, the festival of colors","1. The origins of Holi

            According to the Hindu calendar, Holi falls on the last full moon of winter. Traditionally, it is celebrated in the northern parts of India, but is now popular across the country.

            Legend has it that a king of the demons — Hiranyakashyipu — demanded that everyone worship him as a god. But his son, Prahlad, opposed him, which made the king angry. Hiranyakashyipu devised many evil plans to kill his son, but failed miserably.

            Finally, the king's sister, Holika, who was a sorceress, decided to make it her mission to kill the boy. She would sit in a giant bonfire with Prahlad and while her magic powers would protect her, the boy would die. However, her plans likewise failed. The boy survived, while the sorceress burned to cinders.











            In many regions, the Holi festival heralds the passing of the cold winter season and the advent of warmer weather, but it also celebrates the victory of good over evil. In Mathura, in northern India, people observe Holi as a celebration of the love between the Hindu god Krishna and his lady love, Radha, and reenact scenes from their lives.
2. Traditional Holi food

            Every Holi festivity in India is associated with the special food that is prepared to celebrate the event. The homemade ""gujiya,"" a mix of nuts and raisins encased in sweet pastry, is traditionally prepared by women in the family on the previous evening of the holiday. Other traditional Holi dishes include ""malpua"" — fried sweet pancakes; stuffed breads, called ""kachoris"" — and the ubiquitous ""laddoos,"" dessert balls made of coconut, wheat or chickpea flour.
3. The traditional Holi drink

            Holi is incomplete without the traditional ""bhang,"" a drink made of fresh cannabis leaves. A couple of days before Holi, ""bhang"" enthusiasts join hands to undertake the tedious task of separating the buds and leaves from the cannabis sativa plant and grind them into a paste. The mixture is added to traditional sweets or mixed with sweetened almond milk as a treat for the special day.
4. It's Holi-day!

            Festivities start in the evening, when families set up bonfires to symbolize the burning of Holika, the sorceress who wanted to kill Prahlad. On the day of Holi, revelers partake of a traditional Indian breakfast and gather with their families and friends to celebrate.

            ""Holi Hai,"" Hindi for, ""It's Holi,"" is a cue for everyone to gather in one spot, throw and spray colors at each other and generally make a racket. If you're lucky, you'll get away with good-quality organic color on your person and minimal harassment. If you're unlucky, enthusiastic crowds may carry and dump you into the nearest muddy puddle or you may find yourself doused with permanent, artificial colors that leave your hair and face purple for days on end.

            Also, be careful if you're a man in Mathura: You may be beaten with a stick if you're participating in the traditional ""lathmaar Holi"" (Hindi for ""beat-with-a-stick Holi"").  If you're a woman, you may join in!

            In western India, revelers often hang a clay pot filled with milk or yoghurt at a certain height, while competing groups of boys make human pyramids to get to the vessel and break it open.
5. Holi songs

            Songs, including folksongs and Bollywood hits, are a Holi fixture. Neighborhoods often blast religious and festive dance music from stereo speakers placed where people gather to play around with paints and colors.

            Many songs, especially Bollywood numbers, have become synonymous with Holi in the last several decades. Perhaps the most popular voice associated with a Holi song is the one sung by Bollywood super star Amitabh Bachchan. ""Rang Barse"" (Hindi for ""It's raining colors"") is quintessential Holi, replete with drugs, dancing, adulterous flirtation and sexual innuendo.

If you're a woman, you may join in!In western India, revelers often hang a clay pot filled with milk or yoghurt at a certain height, while competing groups of boys make human pyramids to get to the vessel and break it open.Songs, including folksongs and Bollywood hits, are a Holi fixture. Neighborhoods often blast religious and festive dance music from stereo speakers placed where people gather to play around with paints and colors.Many songs, especially Bollywood numbers, have become synonymous with Holi in the last several decades. Perhaps the most popular voice associated with a Holi song is the one sung by Bollywood super star Amitabh Bachchan. ""Rang Barse"" (Hindi for ""It's raining colors"") is quintessential Holi, replete with drugs, dancing, adulterous flirtation and sexual innuendo.Edited by: Louisa Schaefer",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828307,Georgia: Lawmakers brawl over proposed 'foreign agents' law,"Members of the Georgian parliament brawled openly on Monday as a committee discussed a controversial law that cracks down on ""foreign agents.""The legislation has been likened to a Russian law introduced in 2012, which the Kremlin has used to stifle dissent in civil society and shut down independent media outlets.Video from the parliamentary chamber in the capital, Tbilisi, appeared to show the chairman of the chamber's legal affairs committee striking the leader of the United National Movement opposition party.Other lawmakers then started to jostle and hit one another. Some of the men were removed from the room amid shouting and a loud scream.One woman threw down her papers as a group of men tried to carry her away from the chairman's podium.Outside the parliament building on Monday, thousands of demonstrators gathered chanting and carrying placards bearing the words ""No to the Russian law.""The placards featured pictures of Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili alongside one another.Ivanishvili, an oligarch who made most of his fortune in Russia and who founded the ruling Georgian Dream party, is seen by many as the country's de facto leader.The incident follows similar scenes last Thursday when protesters disrupted a committee hearing on the same bill. Lawmakers also brawled last week.The law in question, presently only in its draft stage, would apply to any organization that received more than 20% of its funding from abroad, forcing it to register as a foreign agent or face being fined.The law in Russia forces such organizations to undergo additional audits and obliges them to print a 24-word disclaimer on all publications, saying that they are being distributed by a ""foreign agent.""Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, whose party supports the law, says Georgian society should similarly know which organizations are being financed from which sources, and brands opponents of the law as ""spies.""Opponents say the law bears a distinct resemblance to Russia's foreign agent law and that it reflects a shift toward authoritarianism.Giga Bokeria, an opposition politician from the European Georgia Party, said, ""This law, which targets civil society, is just part of the bigger picture, bigger anatomy of the treason, when we have a regime which sees the West and the Free World as our enemy, and tries to cultivate this Putinist idea in our society and betrays the future of Georgia.""She added, ""That's why we're here: to protest that and to deliver the message to society that our future needs this government to be changed.""More than 60 media outlets and civil society groups last month said that, if the law were passed, they would not comply with it.Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has also said she plans to veto the legislation, although this could be overridden by parliament.rc/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/06,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828318,"First Phosphate Engages P&E Mining Consultants to Complete Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on Its 100% Owned, NSR Royalty-Free Lac à l'Orignal Phosphate Project in The Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region of Quebec","Saguenay, Quebec - Newsfile Corp. - March 6, 2023 - First Phosphate Corp. (CSE: PHOS) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has commenced a Preliminary Economic Assessment (the ""PEA"") on the Lac à l'Orignal Phosphate Project located in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. The Company has engaged P&E Mining Consultants Inc. (""P&E"") to lead the PEA which will utilize the latest Mineral Resource Estimate completed by P&E in November 2022.         The Lac à l'Orignal phosphate project contains a high-quality phosphate resource potentially suitable for LFP batteries necessary for the energy transition. Management has board approval to advance the project towards its first economic study, a PEA.             The PEA will include details on project economics encompassing the separation of three marketable concentrates - a phosphate (apatite) concentrate, a titanium oxide (ilmenite) concentrate and an iron oxide (magnetite) concentrate.             The objective of the PEA is to create a mine plan, mine production schedule, capital cost estimate and an operating cost estimate incorporated into a financial model to provide total cash flow, after-tax net present value (NPV), and after-tax internal rate of return (IRR).             The project concept is to outline a development opportunity around a stand-alone open pit mine and concentrator facility for all three concentrates located in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. The region already hosts significant existing and ongoing industrial activity including 4 aluminum smelters, an alumina refinery, forest products operations and hydroelectric power generating stations.             The project design will tie into existing infrastructure including the low-to-no-carbon-emissions Quebec Hydro grid, and to existing municipal and heavy-haul road networks which provide access from the Lac à l'Orignal Project directly to the deep sea port of Saguenay. The Company has in place a memorandum of understanding with Port Saguenay to ship its phosphate concentrate internationally as well as access to greenfield land on which to build eventual advanced processing facilities.             The completion of the PEA is scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.         The Lac à l'Orignal Mineral Resource Estimate is based on 63 drill holes and 17 surface channel samples totalling 7,984 m and 149.5 m respectively. A total of 49 drill holes (6,393 m) and 5 channel samples (27 m) intersected the mineralized wireframes used for the Mineral Resource Estimate. The database for the study contained 2,880 assays with varying percentages of P2O5. The Mineral Resource Estimate is presented below in Table 1.      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/157341_89f62c7574c849be_001full.jpg   ""Undertaking this PEA is an important step in our development of the Lac à l'Orignal property as we move forward along our path to develop cathode active material for LFP batteries for Electric Vehicles,"" said First Phosphate President Peter Kent.   Metallurgical test work has also been successfully conducted by SGS Canada Inc. at their Quebec City facility with additional support by SGS Lakefield, Ontario. Recent test results have confirmed that an apatite concentrate can be obtained assaying over 38% P2O5 and at over 90% process recovery. Additional metallurgical test results indicate that the Lac à l'Orignal Deposit may have the potential to produce two additional, potentially marketable concentrates - an iron oxide (magnetite) concentrate and a titanium oxide (ilmenite) concentrate.   First Phosphate's flagship Lac à l'Orignal Property is located approximately 110 km driving-distance north of the City of Saguenay, Quebec's sixth largest city, which hosts daily flights to Montreal, a skilled industrial workforce, strong local infrastructure, and which is short driving driving-distance from the deep sea Port of Saguenay.   Purchase of Additional Mineral Claims for Shares   Furthermore, First Phosphate has entered into a purchase agreement with an arm's length party to acquire 13 additional mineral claims within the Bégin-Lamarche claim block representing approximately 612 ha. in the area of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec for consideration of $25,000, to be satisfied through the issuance of 27,173 common shares of the Company (the ""Shares"") at a deemed price of $0.92 per Share. These Shares will be subject to a statutory four month and one day hold period from closing of the acquisition. The newly acquired claims are free from any royalty and the Company now holds 2,778 royalty free claims covering an area 1,531 sq. km.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828321,Turkey: Opposition nominates candidate to challenge Erdogan,"Turkish opposition partieson Monday declared Kemal Kilicdaroglu as a candidate against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the upcoming May election.However, disagreements had prevailed over the selection of Kilicdaroglu, with one of the biggest parties in the opposition alliance refusing to endorse his nomination.Kilicdaroglu heads the center-left Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP) party.The  nationalist IYI party, the second-strongest force in the alliance, on Monday proposed two other CHP members — the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, and the mayor of Ankara, Mansur Yavas as candidates for vice president.The CHP accepted the compromise in an attempt to reunite the opposition bloc.IYI leader Meral Aksener had already said on Friday she would not back Kilicdaroglu's nomination and walked away from the six-party group.She had hoped Imamoglu or Yavas would be the main candidate. The two mayors both performed better than their party leader in public opinion polls.""I'm sorry to say that, as of yesterday, the Table of Six has lost its ability to reflect the will of the nation in its decisions,"" Aksener told reporters after meeting senior IYI party officials.According to Aksener, the chances of Kilicdaroglu winning are slim.The bloc vowed in January to end the presidential system set by the country's leader, Erdogan, and bring back parliamentary rule.Erdogan has been in power for the past 20 years.He  gained additional powers after winning the 2018 elections and abolishing the position of prime minister.According to the opposition's mandate, the president would become more of a ceremonial head. The incumbent would not belong to a political party, be stripped of presidential powers to issue decrees, and will hold a maximum of seven-year term.The alliance also announced that they would aim to fight inflation and within two years, will reduce it to a single-digit percentage.Also, it aims to continue Turkey's bid for membership of the European Union and restore independence to the country's central bank.The 74-year-old Kilicdaroglu is the long-time leader of the main opposition party of Turkey — the CHP.His nomination for the presidential election was backed by his own party and four other smaller parties in the alliance.He also has the support of the country's mayors.In the past 13 years of leading the CHP, Kilicdaroglu has not managed to win a national election.aa/ar, rt (dpa, AP)",2023/03/06,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828352,New look: Toblerone to remove Matterhorn from packaging,"The makers of Toblerone are removing images of Switzerland's Matterhorn and the Swiss flag from its packaging of the 35- and 50-gram (1.2-1.75-ounce) bars as they move some production to Slovakia.Mondelez International of Deerfield, Illinois, which owns the Swiss-born brand, says it is in the process of adapting the packaging of Toblerone products to conform with Swiss rulesabout how products qualify for the ""Swissness"" signature.With Toblerone opening a new plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, in the third quarter of 2023, the company must adapt the packaging to the Swissness legislation.Toblerone announced a new plant in Slovakia in June 2022 ""to meet increased global demand,"" according to the brand's owner. The company cited lower wages in Slovakia compared with Switzerland when announcing the outsourcing of production of some Toblerone chocolates.In 2017, Switzerland adopted a law on ""Swissness"" that aimed to protect the prestige of Swiss manufacturing.As far as food is concerned, two criteria must be met: Four-fifths of raw materials in the product must come from Switzerland, and processing that gives a product its ""essential characteristics"" must be carried out in Switzerland.""The redesign of the packaging introduces a modernized and streamlined mountain logo that is consistent with the geometric and triangular aesthetic,"" Mondelez spokeswoman Livia Kolmitz said in an email.""More and more people will see the brand's exciting new visual identity and packaging design,"" the spokeswoman said.The name is a portmanteau of two words: the Tobler family name and ""torrone,"" the Italian name for honey-almond nougat.Toblerone produces about 7 billion chocolate bars annually, with 97% exported to 120 countries.dmn/ar (AP,AFPE)",2023/03/06,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828353,"Von der Leyen to talk raw materials, Ukraine in Canada, US","European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is embarking on a trans-Atlantic charm offensive as Brussels brews up new legislation to shore up raw-material supplies and secure the future of its green technology industries. After a year of tight coordination on Russia's war in Ukraine, the head of the European Union's executive body will be in Canada to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from Monday to Wednesday and then head to the United States, where she is expected to hold talks with President Joe Biden on Friday.On Tuesday, von der Leyen and Trudeau will visit a Canadian Armed Forces base and tour a clean-tech company, before the EU chief delivers an address to the Canadian Parliament. After travelling to the U.S., von der Leyen will head to the White House for talks on Friday.With the fallout of the war in Ukraine felt across the European Union, the bloc is racing to end fossil fuel reliance on Moscow and ramp up production of homegrown renewable energy. But that will require more access to critical minerals and raw materials like lithium, cobalt, or rare earth metals — and that is where Washington and Ottawa could come in.These materials are crucial for manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars, smartphones, and more — and geologist Anouke Borst says Europe is going to need ""a lot more of them.""""Demand for lithium might increase fortyfold by 2050 if we are to follow all the Paris [climate] agreements,"" she told DW.But Borst says these crucial elements can be hard to access. ""For the rare earth elements, it's largely because China is the largest producer, and they control the entire processing chain,"" she said. Aware of this dependence, Brussels wants to diversify supply chains away from Beijing.Though there are rare earth deposits in Europe, Borst thinks the EU will ""stay dependent on imports"" because of opposition to mining on environmental grounds.Sam Ayoub of the independent Canada-Europe Chamber of Commerce (EUCCAN) says mineral-rich Ottawa is now ""starting to be a natural answer and solution for the European Union"" in its raw materials quest ""because of the size of the country and the amount of natural resources that we have."" Geologist Anouk Borst says Canada's history of mining also means it is more likely for a material deposit discovery there to lead to future extraction.The EU and Canada already inked a raw materials partnership in 2021 and last year, German automakers Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz signed deals on access to Canadian minerals.Still, expansion of mining activities may face local complaints. Toronto-based activist group ""Mining Injustice Solidarity Network"" accuse Canadian mining firms of greenwashing. ""Communities across the globe are fighting back to protect their water, their lands, and their livelihoods from the impacts of mining — refusing to become sacrifice zones while investors get rich,"" the organization writes on its website.Canada's Minister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson insists raw materials can be sourced sustainabily. In a January news release announcing approval to a new lithium mine with hundreds of sustainability conditions attached, he said: ""The government is committed to making Canada the global supplier of choice for sustainably and responsibly sourced critical minerals, from exploration and extraction, to manufacturing and recycling, while also fostering mutually beneficial relationships between industry and Indigenous Peoples.""In January, von der Leyen aired the idea of a ""Critical Raw Materials Club"" with ""like-minded partners"" — something the EU Commission chief may try to formalize this week.But bones of contention cloud the backdrop of von der Leyen's planned meeting with President Joe Biden. Brussels is not impressed by landmark U.S. legislation set to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and support for domestically manufactured clean technology like electric cars. The EU fears this massive investment will disadvantage EU firms and tempt them to relocate across the Atlantic.""This is a protectionist piece of legislation, and it's heavily biased in favor of domestic production,"" David Kleimann, a trade law expert and visiting fellow with Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, told DW. The U.S. refutes those accusations.The U.S. is not expected to U-turn on its legislation based on European complaints, but Kleimann thinks von der Leyen will likely push for some creative interpretations of the text to soften the potential blow. One loophole eyed by Brussels would allow EU exporters to qualify for some U.S. subsidies in areas like battery components.But Kleimann says it's ""unclear"" whether this will bring tangible benefits to European industries. ""I think at this stage, we're looking at political deliverables,"" he said.He believes the EU wants to avoid public clashes with the Biden administration, despite ongoing disagreements. Both sides say they do not want a transatlantic trade war, especially while an actual war is raging on the European continent.Forging, maintaining, and financing a response to the war in Ukraine will be high on the leaders' agendas. Analyst Jacob Kirkegaad of the U.S. think tank German Marshall Fund (GMF) says the U.S. will likely welcome EU plans to pool purchases of ammunition for Ukraine.Some fear a possible 2024 comeback of former U.S. President Donald Trump could derail the carefully crafted transatlantic approach to Ukraine aid.  But Kirkegaard is not too concerned. ""There is a very clear, crystallizing, strong disconnect between the senior Republicans in Congress and Trump,"" he told DW.""Sure, if Trump were to win the presidency it would be a huge political bonus for Putin — don't get me wrong — but would it stop American weapons supplies to Ukraine or block all financial aid? No, I don't think so.""Kirkegaad says the real political elephant in the room will be China. Washington believes Beijing may be considering supplying Moscow with lethal support for its war-waging in Ukraine — something China fiercely refutes.President Joe Biden may seek assurances that Brussels would take tough action if China were to help arm Russia. ""I'm sure that they would want, behind closed doors, to go into a lot more detail about what those sanctions or EU actions against China might be,"" Kirkegaad said.On the other hand, von der Leyen may ask for clarity on sources backing up Washington's concerns about Beijing. In February, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said there was ""no evidence"" China was arming Russia, though he added: ""We have to remain vigilant.""Edited by: M. Sass",2023/03/06,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828393,McCarthy to meet President Tsai in California to avoid China's ire,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has reportedly agreed to a suggestion by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) that the two should formally meet in California in order to avoid an aggressive response by China, according to British media.Days before former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last year, McCarthy pledged he would visit if he became house speaker and reiterated that vow in February after taking Pelosi's post. On Tuesday (March 7), the Financial Times cited several sources saying McCarthy agreed with Tsai that it would be better to meet in the U.S. to avoid a repeat of the provocative military maneuvers launched by China after Pelosi's visit.The newspaper cited a Taiwanese official as saying that Tsai had presented McCarthy with ""some intelligence about what the Chinese Communist Party is recently up to and the kinds of threats they pose."" Possibly pointing to internal turmoil, the official reportedly described China as ""not in a good situation.""The official went on to say that China may be enacting policies that are ""even more irrational than in the past."" The source stressed the importance of controlling the situation in order to diminish ""risks.""Another Taiwanese official said McCarthy agreed that Taiwan's concerns about heightened security risks were ""reasonable."" Given Tsai's planned trip to California and New York in April, Tsai's representatives reportedly suggested taking her visit to McCarthy's home state as an opportunity to meet.",2023/03/07,1831,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828400,"From Squid Game and Physical: 100 to K-pop and BTS, translation is central to tectonic shifts in global cultural consumption","The Korean reality survival show Physical: 100 has become a global hit, topping Netflix’s non-English lineup in just a week following its premier on January 24 2023.The name of the show says it all: 100 contestants with superb physiques participate in a variety of challenges to win 300 million Korean won, equivalent to A$335,000.There are several reasons behind the success of the show. First, the idea of finding the fittest body through a series of gruelling real-life challenges is unprecedented.Second, the show is reminiscent of another Korean entertainment success, Squid Game. From the studio settings to the ways the challenges operate, Physical: 100 has obviously been inspired by its fictional blockbuster predecessor. Third, the sheer scale of the challenges – such as moving a 1.5-tonne ship – is just mindboggling.There is one element that is rarely talked about, despite its pivotal contribution to the success of the show: translation.Without translation, the show would never have been able to reach a global audience. The same goes for all the Korean dramas, movies and shows that have gained huge popularity around the world. Translation is central to tectonic shifts in global cultural consumption, which has been traditionally led by the West.For decades, people in the East have looked to the West (mostly the United States and Europe) as a source of cultural consumption. Korea was no exception.Local movies were once looked down upon by Korean people, who considered Western counterparts more advanced. It was not until the late 1990s that the Korean movie industry began to thrive, thanks largely to systematic government support.Another contributor to the global popularity of Korean culture is the ascendance of Korean pop culture, better known as K-pop. This new genre of visually packed musical performance has benefited enormously from YouTube and has produced global household names such as BTS and Black Pink. As of 2021, the number of K-culture fans was estimated at more than 150 million.The rise of Korean culture has witnessed a rapid growth of a dedicated global fandom and, interestingly, fan-led translation. Initiated by BTS fans, an enormous community also known as “Army”, fandom translation basically covers everything relating to their favourite artists. From YouTube videos and lyrics to news articles, fans from around the world who are proficient in the Korean language voluntarily translate it all into other languages and share them through social media.Paid translation work is in demand too. Iyuno SDI, for example, provides translation services in more than 100 languages to global media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon. It is, however, not always humans who translate: AI-enabled machine translation (XL8) does much of the work. Draft translation done by machines is then reviewed and edited by more than 30,000 freelance translators across the world.Despite the growth of the translation industry, working conditions for translators are often problematic, as many translators are short of time to complete work and underpaid. Through this mass production process, cultural consideration may sometimes get lost, as happened in Physical: 100.If you’ve watched the show, you will remember Choo Sung-Hoon, a celebrity mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. After Choo won his first one-on-one match against another MMA fighter, Shin Dong-Kook, Shin bowed deeply before Choo, with his head touching the ground. Is this standard practice among MMA fighters? No, the answer lies in the Korean term, sunbae-nim, which Shin used consistently to refer to Choo, but was not translated in the show.Sunbae-nim refers to a person who is older or more experienced in a workplace, school, military unit or social context. Virtually all Koreans would know several people whom they consider as sunbae-nim.Shin clearly idolises Choo, who is older and has been a big gun in the MMA field for almost two decades. It is therefore only natural for Shin to call Choo sunbae-nim, a term intended to deliver the amount of respect that Shin held for Choo. As there is no exact English equivalent, however, the term was often replaced in the subtitles by Choo’s given name, “Sung-Hoon”.This might have given the wrong impression when Shin suggested to Choo that they have an MMA match, rather than playing the ball game prescribed in the show. Here is what Shin said (in the English subtitles) when he made the suggestion:It would be rude of me to challenge a respected senior just to play with a ball.“Respected senior” here refers to dae-sunbaenim (literally “great sunbaenim”) yet it sounds odd and unnatural. My suggestion? “It wouldn’t do justice to your distinguished MMA career if we just played with a ball.”Titles and forms of address in Korean are always challenging to translate.As someone who specialises in English-Korean translation, I believe it would be best to retain these original expressions. In this digital era, information is at one’s fingertips and is easy to look up. Just as “señor” or “monsieur” need no translation, Korean titles should be respected on their own terms.When we recognise translation as a mutual process of engaging with an audience, a cultural shift from the West to the East may be achieved in a genuine sense.",2023/03/07,496,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828448,FinTech: Taiwan deserves and can deliver more,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — To get the easy bit out of the way, FinTech is quite simply a combination of the words ""financial"" and ""technology.""

            It is technology-enabled financial innovation that is changing the way financial institutions provide — and consumers and businesses use — multiple financial services. FinTech has a cousin called RegTech (regulation and technology) but for the moment we will stick with FinTech, as it is certainly a buzz word these days in Taiwan and globally.

            Late October 2022 saw a large turnout for FinTech Taipei at the World Trade Center in Taipei City. The Financial Services Supervisory Commission (FSC) was the event's advisor, while the organizers were the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance (TABF) and the Taiwan Financial Services Roundtable.

            I attended this event and while there was certainly a buzz and the expected crowds, I did wonder afterward whether a lot of the FinTech I saw on display was really a display of cutting edge technology or, simply a showcase of new payment systems. Don’t get me wrong, payment systems qualify as FinTech, but I want more, and I think Taiwan deserves and can deliver more.











            FinTech should be fundamentally changing the way financial services firms operate by making them more efficient and able to provide a better quality of service to their customers. Also, by being more transparent with their regulators.

            For FinTech to prosper you need world-class talent, locally based expertise, a forward-thinking approach to regulation, access to capital, and proximity to an innovative financial services sector. We certainly have local world-class talent and expertise.

            We also know that FinTech has the clear support of Taiwan's government, the FSC and related industry associations in Taiwan. Less clear to me is whether we have an innovative financial services sector.
What is real story?

            In terms of Taiwan’s history with FinTech, it is arguable that it was not until at least 2014 that Taiwan started to understand the positive impact of FinTech’s continuing technological development in the global financial sector and resulting changes to the financial value chain.

            In 2014, FSC came up with the concept of FinTech 3.0. It recognized five changes that were needed in the Taiwan financial sector:

            Digital technology as the core competency in the sector

Bank branches devolving to more of a support orientation
The internet becoming the main marketing strategy
Social media and real-time online transactions make customers more dominant
Finance merging with e-commerce


            I think that most of these changes have occurred to one degree or another but perhaps not quite as envisaged in 2014.

            In late 2015, the FSC then went on to propose further measures for the continued development of FinTech, with plans to promote the support of FinTech start-ups and to help other related industries. These proposals saw the FSC also establish a FinTech office that directly reports to the FSC and by the first quarter of 2016 we saw the release of the FinTech Development Strategy White Paper.

            This set out Taiwan’s vision and strategy to promote innovative FinTech services. The “vision” included five facets of Taiwan’s financial services that would benefit from FinTech:

Payments
Insurance
Financing
Fundraising
Investment Management
Market Supply


            Again, I think to one degree or another, the proposals in the white paper remain relevant yet did not provide the tipping point for a vibrant FinTech market in Taiwan.

            The next step along Taiwan’s journey saw the development in 2018 of a Regulatory Sandbox for startups and financial institutions by offering a platform through which startups and financial institutions can experiment freely without threatening the wider financial system. But to be frank, the number of institutions that have taken advantage of the Sandbox remains low, perhaps because of internal hurdles within the Sandbox.

            As of June 2022, only 15 applications had been received from institutions seeking to take advantage of the Sandbox. Of that number, nine have been approved by the FSC and five have been completed.

            The FSC also implemented a Business Trial mechanism solely for financial institutions in 2019 to provide a dedicated testing environment for financial institutions and as of May 2022 there have been 47 applications received and 36 cases approved (better numbers than from the Sandbox).

            To its credit, the FSC also created the FinTechSpace (the first FinTech focused co-working space in Taiwan). The intention is to provide a tech-based environment for stimulating and accelerating the latest FinTech innovation.

            FinTechSpace aims to gather the whole Taiwan FinTech ecosystem together and open the window for Taiwan’s FinTech industry to attract talent from campuses and tech startups from around the world.
Right time and place

            FinTechSpace remains active and offers an array of programs for domestic and foreign participants, but I think Taiwan needs to be more proactive in promoting these programs. I will discuss FinTechSpace in greater detail in future articles.

            We’ve also seen the FSC approving internet-only banks that have quickly accumulated customers and are likely to continue to do so, but their success is certainly challenged by Taiwan’s oversaturated banking market. Put simply, even in 2023, Taiwan is overbanked and burdened with aging legacy information technology systems.

            I have no doubt that the FSC sees FinTech as integral to modernizing Taiwan’s financial markets and in future articles we’ll also examine a few ways I think Taiwan’s financial markets may achieve these aims.

            Taiwan’s information technology infrastructure is extremely well-developed, although as noted above, the infrastructure is aging. Taiwan is a strong market for e-commerce, online entertainment, mobile payment, and other technology-driven services, but it remains mainly a domestic market and foreign payment service providers, especially those providing solutions for cross-border transactions, face intense competition with local banks and regulatory obstacles when entering the market.

            There is appetite, development and improvement occurring in Taiwan’s FinTech environment, albeit slowly even in the face of the Taiwan government and the FSC maintaining a consistent message of the importance of FinTech in Taiwan.

            The Taiwan government is clear that FinTech must be at the heart of the important Green Finance Action Plan 2.0 and the 2050 Net-Zero Pathway initiatives.

            Despite the indicators of growth and the support of the government and the regulator, I believe it would be wrong to assume that Taiwan’s FinTech market is set for clear sailing. The FinTech market certainly made rapid progress in 2021, but the major obstacle to further development is still strict regulation of the financial industry.

            Another practical obstacle is user habits. Consumers in Taiwan have long been used to making payment by credit cards and collecting the items they have ordered online at “convenience stores.”

            While COVID-19 saw both financial service providers and consumers trying to reduce physical banking activities, this has not provided adequate impetus to the Taiwan Fintech market.

            Also, if e-payments, often simply backed by credit card applications, represent the largest FinTech product in the Taiwan market, I believe FinTech still has a long way to go.

            I applaud all the achievements to date, but I know Taiwan deserves and can do better.

The Financial Services Supervisory Commission (FSC) was the event's advisor, while the organizers were the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance (TABF) and the Taiwan Financial Services Roundtable.I attended this event and while there was certainly a buzz and the expected crowds, I did wonder afterward whether a lot of the FinTech I saw on display was really a display of cutting edge technology or, simply a showcase of new payment systems. Don’t get me wrong, payment systems qualify as FinTech, but I want more, and I think Taiwan deserves and can deliver more.FinTech should be fundamentally changing the way financial services firms operate by making them more efficient and able to provide a better quality of service to their customers. Also, by being more transparent with their regulators.For FinTech to prosper you need world-class talent, locally based expertise, a forward-thinking approach to regulation, access to capital, and proximity to an innovative financial services sector. We certainly have local world-class talent and expertise.We also know that FinTech has the clear support of Taiwan's government, the FSC and related industry associations in Taiwan. Less clear to me is whether we have an innovative financial services sector.In terms of Taiwan’s history with FinTech, it is arguable that it was not until at least 2014 that Taiwan started to understand the positive impact of FinTech’s continuing technological development in the global financial sector and resulting changes to the financial value chain.In 2014, FSC came up with the concept of FinTech 3.0. It recognized five changes that were needed in the Taiwan financial sector:Digital technology as the core competency in the sectorI think that most of these changes have occurred to one degree or another but perhaps not quite as envisaged in 2014.In late 2015, the FSC then went on to propose further measures for the continued development of FinTech, with plans to promote the support of FinTech start-ups and to help other related industries. These proposals saw the FSC also establish a FinTech office that directly reports to the FSC and by the first quarter of 2016 we saw the release of the FinTech Development Strategy White Paper.This set out Taiwan’s vision and strategy to promote innovative FinTech services. The “vision” included five facets of Taiwan’s financial services that would benefit from FinTech:Again, I think to one degree or another, the proposals in the white paper remain relevant yet did not provide the tipping point for a vibrant FinTech market in Taiwan.The next step along Taiwan’s journey saw the development in 2018 of a Regulatory Sandbox for startups and financial institutions by offering a platform through which startups and financial institutions can experiment freely without threatening the wider financial system. But to be frank, the number of institutions that have taken advantage of the Sandbox remains low, perhaps because of internal hurdles within the Sandbox.As of June 2022, only 15 applications had been received from institutions seeking to take advantage of the Sandbox. Of that number, nine have been approved by the FSC and five have been completed.The FSC also implemented a Business Trial mechanism solely for financial institutions in 2019 to provide a dedicated testing environment for financial institutions and as of May 2022 there have been 47 applications received and 36 cases approved (better numbers than from the Sandbox).To its credit, the FSC also created the FinTechSpace (the first FinTech focused co-working space in Taiwan). The intention is to provide a tech-based environment for stimulating and accelerating the latest FinTech innovation.FinTechSpace aims to gather the whole Taiwan FinTech ecosystem together and open the window for Taiwan’s FinTech industry to attract talent from campuses and tech startups from around the world.FinTechSpace remains active and offers an array of programs for domestic and foreign participants, but I think Taiwan needs to be more proactive in promoting these programs. I will discuss FinTechSpace in greater detail in future articles.We’ve also seen the FSC approving internet-only banks that have quickly accumulated customers and are likely to continue to do so, but their success is certainly challenged by Taiwan’s oversaturated banking market. Put simply, even in 2023, Taiwan is overbanked and burdened with aging legacy information technology systems.I have no doubt that the FSC sees FinTech as integral to modernizing Taiwan’s financial markets and in future articles we’ll also examine a few ways I think Taiwan’s financial markets may achieve these aims.Taiwan’s information technology infrastructure is extremely well-developed, although as noted above, the infrastructure is aging. Taiwan is a strong market for e-commerce, online entertainment, mobile payment, and other technology-driven services, but it remains mainly a domestic market and foreign payment service providers, especially those providing solutions for cross-border transactions, face intense competition with local banks and regulatory obstacles when entering the market.There is appetite, development and improvement occurring in Taiwan’s FinTech environment, albeit slowly even in the face of the Taiwan government and the FSC maintaining a consistent message of the importance of FinTech in Taiwan.The Taiwan government is clear that FinTech must be at the heart of the important Green Finance Action Plan 2.0 and the 2050 Net-Zero Pathway initiatives.Despite the indicators of growth and the support of the government and the regulator, I believe it would be wrong to assume that Taiwan’s FinTech market is set for clear sailing. The FinTech market certainly made rapid progress in 2021, but the major obstacle to further development is still strict regulation of the financial industry.Another practical obstacle is user habits. Consumers in Taiwan have long been used to making payment by credit cards and collecting the items they have ordered online at “convenience stores.”While COVID-19 saw both financial service providers and consumers trying to reduce physical banking activities, this has not provided adequate impetus to the Taiwan Fintech market.Also, if e-payments, often simply backed by credit card applications, represent the largest FinTech product in the Taiwan market, I believe FinTech still has a long way to go.I applaud all the achievements to date, but I know Taiwan deserves and can do better.",2023/03/11,275,Opinion

Ahead of the meeting, Chinese nationalist blogger Zhou Xiaoping (周小平), who has been included as a member this year, posted several of his proposals on his Weibo account.On Friday (March 3), Zhou uploaded a post in which he called on the Chinese government to generate a disciplinary order containing a ""blacklist of separatist figures in Taiwan."" Zhou wrote that people on this list will be ""ordered to stop all Taiwan independence activities"" within a set time frame and ""confess their crimes through open channels or voluntarily surrender.""Zhou warned that when China launches its ""special operation,"" borrowing Russian President Vladimir Putin's term for his invasion of Ukraine, ""anyone can arrest or kill"" people who ""persist in creating divisions and triggering cross-strait conflicts."" He added that any Chinese who launch these reprisals against Taiwanese will not only do so free from culpability but will also ""receive the Medal of Honor for promoting unification.""On Saturday, Zhou claimed that his proposed resolution had already been approved by the CPPCC.Australia-based Chinese political observer and former Chinese diplomat Han Yang (杨涵) on Monday (March 6) posted his English translation of Zhou's proposal on Twitter. Zhou said the fact that his Weibo post has remained untouched for days indicates that the ""Central Propaganda Department approved this vicious message.""Zhou Xiaoping, controversial wolf warrior author, sponsored a resolution at CPPCC for China to set up a black list of “Taiwan separatists” to be killed during China’s Special Military Operation against Taiwan pic.twitter.com/tREbWAh6Bl",2023/03/07,7400,Politics

The Nikkei regretted any concern it caused and will work to ensure impartiality, according to Taiwan’s foreign ministry.The disclaimer comes following Taiwan’s protest against what government officials said is disinformation that has undermined the military’s morale. The article claimed 90% of retired Taiwanese military officials provide intelligence to China for profit and that the U.S. has been cautious in its arms sales to Taiwan over fears that intelligence might flow to Beijing.The defense and foreign ministries have rebutted the claims and demanded clarifications from the Japanese newspaper. Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱國正) said on Monday (March 6) the incident has sparked unease in the military and created rifts in society.In the aftermath of the report, Li Wang (王立楨), a former Lockheed Martin engineer who now resides in Taipei, shared on Facebook on Friday (March 3) that during an MRT ride, a passenger shouted “shame on you” at him, likely because he was wearing a bomber jacket and was mistaken to be retired military personnel.",2023/03/07,690,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828493,Taiwan's '183 Day Tax Residency' conundrum,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — I’m sure most readers have heard of the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, which gives an individual the right to stay and work in Taiwan for one to three years (extendable), and that an individual can apply online without sponsorship. It comes with open-work rights, so the individual can work for any or multiple companies in Taiwan or start their own business.There has been quite a bit of debate recently about the Gold Card, both positive and in some cases quite negative. Regardless of the range of opinions on the Gold Card, there is one aspect of the card that has gained my particular attention — that is, a tax benefit of only being taxed on 50% of annual income above NT$3 million (around US$97,500), for the first five years in which the foreigner is a tax resident provided the Gold Card holder stays in Taiwan for over 183 days.For the record, I am not a Gold Card holder and I still aspire to earn at least, if not more than, NT$3 million in any year. However, it is the 183-day issue that perplexes me for reasons I will explain in due course.Why 183 days? But where did the 183-day concept come from? Thin air? Detailed debate by the Taiwanese government or by the National Development Council?Well, the 183-day convention certainly did not evolve from thin air and it is not a modern invention. To understand it better, we must refer to an international organization called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries.The OECD was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. The OECD touts itself as an international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives by shaping policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity, and well-being for all: Highly aspirational aims.One of the specific ways that the OECD aims to achieve its goals is through its model tax convention. The OECD published its first draft model tax convention in 1963, some 60 years ago.According to the OECD, the model tax convention (which admittedly has seen regular updates over the decades) is a model for countries concluding bilateral tax conventions. The OECD believes it has played a crucial role in removing tax-related barriers to cross-border trade and investment.The OECD's model is designed to assist businesses while helping to prevent tax evasion and avoidance and provides a means for settling on a uniform basis the most common problems that arise in the field of international double taxation. If we research the model tax treaty a bit further, we finally hit “pay dirt” and find that the 183-day tax residency convention was introduced in the 1977 model convention.Let’s keep that year in mind, 1977. We should note that Taiwan is not an OECD Member, but it does participate in three committees, namely the Steel Committee, the Competition Committee, and the Fisheries Committee.Further, despite not being a member of the OECD, Taiwan does adhere to taxation agreement policies with the stated aims of avoiding double taxation, tax evasion and to promote bilateral relations. Treaties and agreements signed are based on the OECD model.Currently, Taiwan has 34 comprehensive income tax agreements and 13 international transportation income tax agreements signed and in force based on the OECD's 183-day convention from 1977. The Gold Card was launched in 2018 and was created as a combined visa, work permit and residence permit, and was introduced via a 2017 piece of legislation that is still seen as a comprehensive Taiwanese government initiative to “attract highly skilled foreign talent to Taiwan.”The website of the Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office also refers to the Gold Card as a 4-in-1 card, that includes a resident visa, work permit, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC), and re-entry permit, which allows the holder to leave and re-enter Taiwan multiple times over the course of one to three years.In the FAQ section on the website, the Gold Card Office touts the existence of these tax benefits and states that the Gold Card is ideal for “digital nomads” but the stated reason why it is great for “digital nomads” is that it contains an open work permit that allows highly skilled foreigners to work for any employer. Continue to scroll through the FAQs and you find the totally reasonable question: “How many days per year do I have to stay in Taiwan?”.The answer apparently is: “There are no requirements.” Then comes the kicker: “However you must stay for more than 183 days per year in order to be eligible for many benefits such as: tax resident treatment and a pathway to permanent residence.”This to me is a carrot-and-stick approach and not one that should apply in a modern market such as Taiwan, which sees the need for foreign talent. Here we are in 2023 and with COVID restrictions being lifted, it's time for entrepreneurs to travel and do business, and that surely must apply to the highly skilled foreign talent that hold the Gold Card.Online calls only get you so far with a client or customer. Face-to-face meetings and conferences are simply far better.But to get the tax benefits that were part of the enticement to obtain the card and move their lives to Taiwan, they must stay for more than 183 days per year. Perhaps the 183-day restriction had some foundation in 1977, but that was an era where the term “digital nomad” would not have been understood.In 1977 we were in an era of typewriters and carbon paper (and if you were lucky, a Dictaphone). If anyone needs an explanation of such antiquities, just let me know and I’ll do my best to explain.Now let’s speak plainly here. If the argument of the 183-day rule is that it somehow ensures proper income/tax reporting by Gold Card holders, then I can say with conviction that I am not convinced by that argument.There is no question that tax evasion is a crime, plain and simple. However, I still can’t make the connection between the allure of tax benefits and the 183-day requirement.Surely, in this day and age, with the vetting of Gold Card applicants and the technology that must be available to the Taiwanese tax authorities, we should not be shackling the Gold Card holders (or any other visa holder/taxpayer) to a 46-year-old convention. People are now able to work from almost everywhere and as a “digital nomad.”Provided Gold Card holders lodge and pay taxes as per their declared tax residency in Taiwan, why should the 183-day requirement apply? Taiwan needs foreign talent (discussion of the brain drain, negative birth rates and a rapidly aging society are already clearly understood).So, maybe it is time for a review of the 183-day requirement and perhaps a full review of Taiwan’s visa regime to make Taiwan even more attractive, modern, and cutting-edge, which is what so many of us wish to see.",2023/03/09,436,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828515,Photo of the Day: BBQ chest surgery ad spotted in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — This bizarre advertisement for a chest surgery workshop featuring succulent baby back ribs slathered with sauce has gone viral in Taiwan.On Friday (March 3), Twitter user Wendy Lee uploaded a photo of an advertisement for a trauma surgery and chest surgery workshop slated for March 25 at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan City's Guishan District. In her post, Lee asked Taiwanese Twitter users why a photo of barbecued ribs was included in a medical workshop poster and soon gained 305,000 views, 1,964 likes, 363 retweets, and 83 quote tweets.The Taiwanese-American woman also took the opportunity to introduce a baked goods business that she is starting up with her French husband in Taichung. Lee told Taiwan News that the photo had actually been taken by her cousin during a recent visit to the hospital.Twitter followers could not help but take a stab at the rationale behind the ad:""Someone used the photo version of ChatGPT to make the flyer?""""Saucy.""""Doctor, why is there a chili pepper on the operating table? Don't worry it's not for you.""""It's more appealing than seeing a human rib cage for sure.""""Rib dinner after chest surgery, that’s a tradition! Not.""On Sunday (March 5), Tu Cheng-che (杜承哲), an attending physician at Cheng Ching Hospital in Taichung, took to Facebook to weigh in on the ad. Tu wrote that generally speaking, the sequence of events is the opposite.He wrote that every time a thoracic surgeon is invited to barbecue ribs at an American-style eatery, ""someone (not necessarily me) will take the ribs and start researching where the muscles attach and the anatomy, and then start talking about surgery...""Tu claimed that it is normal to think about rib surgery when seeing a rack of pork ribs. He suggested that the poster may be a case of self-deprecating humor on the part of surgeons.As the poster is targeted at surgeons, he stressed that its creators did not intend to disrespect patients. Tu closed by stating if the ad makes patients feel disrespected and uncomfortable, Chang Gung will need to step forward and face the situation.(Twitter, Wendy Lee photo)Okay, Taiwan Twitter, explain this please. Why is there a picture of bbq ribs in the background of this ribs and chest surgery workshop at Linkou Chang Gung Hospital?! pic.twitter.com/ab1pK0mg4t",2023/03/07,1352,Photo of the Day

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth.

The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352335In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

During a call with analysts to discuss quarterly earnings, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti acknowledged that January 2023 marked five years and seven months since the last hike and that an increase is due ""about now,"" but said that it is not imminent.When asked by Taiwan News if Costco USA increases its membership fee later this year, whether Costco Taiwan would follow suit, a representative said, ""As of this point, Costco Taiwan does not have any plan to increase the membership fees."" The spokesperson added that it would notify members if there are any changes in services.Asked whether there is a timeline for when a price change may occur, the representative said, ""At this point, we don't have any information about this matter."" She then reiterated that the company will, ""update everyone shall there be any changes to our fees or services.""The American warehouse club's annual fee in the U.S. for its Gold Star Membership is US$60 (NT$1,834), while Executive membership is US$120.

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 7 March 2023 - Watsons announces the launch of its ""DARE TO BE "" campaign on International Women's Day to further its commitment to transcending stereotypes and standing with women to discover the best version of themselves. This follows on the success of the Asia-wide ""The New Beautiful"" campaign that inspired a heightened awareness of holistic beauty. Watsons continues to advance the cause of gender equality with its 90 million female Watsons Club members in the global community.            Watsons believes that everyone has the power to transcend their own limitations and break the stigma that society puts upon them. As a brand trusted by 90 million women in Asia, Eastern Europe and Middle East, Watsons' ""DARE TO BE"" campaign can reach millions and inspire confidence in them. In an interview survey of 11,000 women conducted by A.S. Watson, over 50% of women described themselves as ""unconfident"". ""DARE TO BE"" seeks to change this by featuring women who are breaking down boundaries and leading the way for others.   Malina Ngai, CEO of A.S. Watson (Asia & Europe) says, ""Women have the strength to be the best version of themselves and to transcend societal limitations. Watsons is committed to empowering women to find their faith in themselves. We know they can DARE TO BE bigger than any barrier, bolder than any bias, and stronger than their struggles.""   Affirming the ""Embrace Equity"" theme of International Women's Day, the campaign strives to support  BRAVEHER,  BOLDHER and  STRONGHER Women in a cause of gender equality that embraces women of all walks of life:   Nurturing ""BRAVEHER"" Women in Healthcare    During COVID-19, the bravery of frontline healthcare professionals inspired many to follow this meaningful career path. Through Watsons and Operation Smile partnership, Watsons has supported Operation Smile's ""Women in Medicine'' initiative. Through this initiative, Operation Smile aims to provide educational pathways for women to be global leaders in health care. In support of this initiative, Watsons has sponsored all-women medical programs in low-and-middle income countries to help educate women on advanced medical practices; empower women to become leaders in global medicine; expand opportunities for women health care workers in different specialties; and elevate cleft surgery and comprehensive care. Since the partnership's inception, A.S. Watson Group has sponsored over 6,000 free corrective surgeries to Operation Smile through the Group's Give a Smile signature global community programme.   Kathy Magee, Co-founder and President of Operation Smile says, ""We appreciate the tremendous support from Watsons for the Women in Medicine Initiative to empower women to take on leadership roles in the medical field. Once we mentor these women and equip them with advanced surgical skills and specialty trainings, these women create new opportunities for the next generation of female leaders in health care.""   Empowering ""BOLDHER"" Women in their Community   Watsons is deepening its long-term partnership with YWCA, to empower more women in the community. Mimi Han, Vice President of World YWCA, commends Watsons' efforts in building a more women-friendly community, ""The world needs the voices of more women to be heard. Watsons' and YWCA's joint efforts and commitment will not only empower women but promote the women's meaningful participation and contribution to our society.""   In Hong Kong, Watsons will sponsor YWCA's ""ChariTea"" programme to fund its self-financed women empowerment services, which supports women in marital adversity and young mothers, assists the development of girls, strengthens elderly services for older women and gives women their deserved voices in the society.   Enabling a ""STRONGHER"" Generation of Women   Throughout the month, Watsons will be actively engaging the community of Watsons shoppers through a series of events, workshops, and mentoring opportunities led by key women opinion leaders who have created their own success by defining it on their own terms. Watsons Malaysia is inviting a fashion model with vitiligo (an appearance altering skin condition), a para-cyclist and a CEO from a women-focused charity to share their personal stories and health & beauty tips. In Thailand, Watsons is promoting women empowerment through its ""Green Ribbon"" campaign to help more women to unleash their potential.   There are more programmes in Asia which inspire confidence and empower women to look good, do good, and feel great about themselves. Interested parties can find out more at  www.watsonsasia.com.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828642,US sees China propaganda efforts becoming more like Russia's,"WASHINGTON (AP) — China has long been seen by the U.S. as a prolific source of anti-American propaganda but less aggressive in its influence operations than Russia, which has used cyberattacks and covert operations to disrupt U.S. elections and denigrate rivals.But many in Washington now think China is increasingly adopting tactics associated with Russia — and there's growing concern the U.S. isn't doing enough to respond.U.S. officials and outside experts cite recent examples of China-linked actors generating false news reports with artificial intelligence and posting large volumes of denigrating social media posts. While many of the discovered efforts are amateurish, experts think they signal an apparent willingness from Beijing to try more influence campaigns as part of a broader embrace of covert operations, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.“To us, the attempt is what stands out,” one U.S. intelligence official said.An increasingly pessimistic mood in Washington about Beijing’s expansive political and economic goals and the possibility of war over Taiwan is driving calls for the U.S. to make a stronger effort to counter Chinese influence abroad.Lawmakers and officials are particularly concerned about countries that comprise the “Global South” in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where both the U.S. and China have huge economic and political interests. Many of those countries have populations that support both sides — what an official called “swing states"" in the narrative battle.“This should be a whole of government effort,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, who is the top Democrat on a newly formed House committee focusing on the Chinese Communist Party.“The CCP is going around the world bad-mouthing the U.S., bad-mouthing our institutions, bad-mouthing our form of government,” Krishnamoorthi said in an interview. “We have to counter this because ultimately it’s not in the best interests of the United States.”China's embassy in Washington said in a statement that Beijing “opposes the fabrication and dissemination of false information” and blamed the U.S. in turn for making social media “into its tool to manipulate international public opinion and its weapon to stigmatize and demonize other countries.”“On this issue, it is for the U.S. side to reflect on itself and stop shouting ‘catch a thief,’” said embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu.Chinese state media and affiliated channels, as well as social media influencers with vast followings, routinely spread ideas the U.S. labels exaggerated, false or misleading. In recent weeks, China’s foreign ministry has called attention to the train derailment that released toxic chemicals in Ohio as well as allegations the U.S. may have sabotaged pipelines used to transport Russian gas.The Biden administration has strongly rejected the allegations about the Nord Stream pipelines and defended its response in Ohio.China has long been seen as less willing than Russia to take provocative steps that could be exposed and more concerned about being publicly blamed. U.S. intelligence judged that Russia tried to support Donald Trump in the last two presidential elections, while China in 2020 considered but did not try to influence the election.But some U.S. officials believe China is now undertaking or considering operations it would not have in the past, according to the two people familiar with the matter. That’s partly due to fears in Beijing that they are losing a battle of narratives in many countries, one of the people said.Officials noted public examples identified in recent weeks by groups that track disinformation and influence.The research firm Graphika recently identified AI-generated videos that it linked to a pro-Chinese influence operation. One video attacked the U.S. approach to stopping gun violence; another “stressed the importance of China-U.S. cooperation for the recovery of the global economy,” according to Graphika. And threat analysts at Google said they disrupted more than 50,000 instances of posts and other activity last year linked to a pro-China influence operation known as “Dragonbridge.”The AI-generated videos are clearly fictitious and Graphika said none of them had more than 300 views. Most Dragonbridge posts, Google said, also reached a tiny audience.The U.S. intelligence official said Chinese tradecraft on social media was “uneven"" and less sophisticated than what's normally associated with the Kremlin. But that tradecraft — both in terms of social media operations and efforts to hide any linkage to Beijing — can be expected to improve over time and with practice, the official said.And there are longstanding concerns in Washington about TikTok, the viral video-sharing app whose U.S. operations are currently undergoing a national security review. There’s no public evidence that Beijing has used its sweeping powers over businesses in China to direct content on the app or launch government-sanctioned influence operations, but there's a belief that China could do so quickly enough not to be caught or stopped.China is increasingly viewed unfavorably in the U.S., much of Europe, Australia, South Korea and Japan, according to Pew Research Center data published last year.But in other countries in Asia as well as in much of Africa and Latin America, there are more positive attitudes about the Chinese government, often driven by Beijing’s economic investments and offers of infrastructure and security assistance.Last year’s Africa Youth Survey, which was composed of 4,500 interviews of 18- to 24-year-olds in 15 countries, found that 76% of respondents believed China had a positive influence in their country. Of the U.S., 72% said they believed American influence was positive.In the event of a war over U.S.-backed Taiwan, experts believe shaping global attitudes and narratives will be key in ensuring military and diplomatic support for either side.Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the new congressional committee on China, said in a statement after recently visiting Taiwan that Chinese influence operations are part of a broader strategy of “cognitive warfare.” He added that the committee would “work to expose the truth about the (Chinese Communist Party's) pattern of aggression against America and our friends.”The State Department's Global Engagement Center is charged with countering Chinese messaging outside of both the U.S. and China. Speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the department, a State Department official responded to concerns that the U.S. doesn't directly counter many lines of attack from Beijing.“There was a decision made that we were not going to get in the business of playing whack-a-mole with specific lines of Chinese messaging,” the official said. “Frankly, there's just too much of it. It would be like trying to put your finger in the dam to stop the leak.”The State Department instead tries to fund programs exposing facts and ideas that China wants to suppress. The Global Engagement Center has funded third-party research of China's crackdown in Xinjiang province against Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups. Beijing has long tried to frame its operations in Xinjiang as countering terrorism and radicalism in the face of international criticism about its network of detention camps and its restrictions on movement and religious expression in the province.State has also funded trainings for investigative journalists in countries that have received Chinese investment and a project that tracked Chinese dam construction along the Mekong River, which is a key source of water for Southeast Asian countries downstream from China.The U.S. also uses direct investment as a tool for countering Chinese influence, though critics have questioned whether some funded programs are effective.In one instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development last year proposed using funding from an annual fund for countering Chinese influence to support bakeries in Tunisia. According to two other people familiar with the matter, officials wanted to buy software for bakery owners to help them determine which of their products were most marketable. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency deliberations.In a statement, USAID said the Tunisia program was intended to “create sustainable demand-driven jobs” and promote Western software over Chinese programs that “might be easily accessible” but “less efficient.”“We know that our grants-based assistance can go even further when put together with public and private investments, which far outstrip the resources that the PRC has brought to the table to date,” the statement said.",2023/03/07,399,World

The survey, conducted by Caixin/Markit, revealed that the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the services sector in China rose to 56.3 in January 2023, up from 53.9 in December 2022. This marks the fastest pace of growth in the sector since May 2022 and is a positive sign for the world’s second-largest economy.The Caixin/Markit survey tracks the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises in China’s services sector, which includes businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and retailers. This sector is a crucial part of China’s economy, accounting for around 54% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).The strong performance in China’s services sector is attributed to several factors, including a rebound in consumer spending, strong demand for tourism, and government efforts to boost domestic consumption. The Chinese government has been implementing policies to support small businesses and promote domestic consumption to offset the impact of the trade war with the United States and the slowdown in global economic growth.The positive growth in China’s services sector has had a ripple effect throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Stocks in Hong Kong and China saw significant gains, with the Hang Seng index rising by 1.5% and the Shanghai Composite index gaining 0.9%. Other markets in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, also saw gains as investors were buoyed by the positive economic news from China.Read More Panasia News Here:- https://www.panasiabiz.com/The positive economic news from China is not just good news for the Asia-Pacific region but also for the global economy. China is the world’s second-largest economy and a significant player in global trade. As China’s economy grows, it provides opportunities for other countries to export goods and services to the Chinese market.However, there are still challenges facing China’s economy. The country continues to grapple with high levels of debt, and there are concerns about the impact of the ongoing trade war with the United States. The Chinese government has been implementing policies to address these challenges, including measures to reduce debt levels and promote greater innovation and technological development.In conclusion, the positive growth in China’s services sector is a positive sign for the Asia-Pacific region and the global economy. The strong performance of the sector is due to a combination of factors, including government policies, rebounding consumer spending, and strong demand for tourism. While challenges remain, the growth in China’s economy provides opportunities for other countries to benefit from the expanding Chinese market. Investors will be watching closely to see how China’s economy continues to perform in the coming months and years.",2023/03/07,,

Long considered the gold standard in the music industry, Steinway & Sons pianos are the instruments of choice for many of the world's greatest musicians and artists, with 9 out of 10 professionals choosing a Steinway as their preferred piano to perform with.   Trained in the Netherlands and New York, Joja emerged from the renowned Hamburg scene and has played alongside all-time music legends over the course of his career, such as rock 'n roll icon Chuck Berry and the immortal Joe Cocker. His performances are known to be presented with a large slice of humour, and lots of charm and charisma, and his regular concerts are now the stuff of legend throughout Europe.   Joja is not only a virtuoso musician but likes to also come across as a friend to his audience. His aim is for people to overcome inhibitions for people to fully enjoy a piano performance. Propagating that it is fun to play the piano, Joja's unique brand of music is for everyone, all genders and age groups.   ""My roots of music are in the clubs,"" explains Joja, ""And that helps me today to make the gap between the stage and the audience disappear."" In fact, Joja is known for his interaction and banters with his audience during his performances. Joja's shows are characterised by entertainment, but the Louis Armstrong Award recipient is more than just an entertainer. Considered one of Germany's most successful pianists, no one reaches a huge audience with the piano as Joja does.       The Steinway Crown Jewel on which Joja Wendt performed on during the event    ""Very happy to be in Singapore again for this special event at Steinway Gallery, it's certainly a joy to be playing on the special Crown Jewel piano, The Crown Jewel White Ebony, stunning, it's such a different experience to be playing in an intimate setting surrounded by this amazing audience."" added Joja, referring to The Steinway Crown Jewel White Ebony, part of the esteemed  Steinway Crown Jewel Collection and a masterpiece of exceptional craftsmanship.

Unlocking automated finance workflows through YouBiz and Xero gives business owners a better overview of their spending and effectively digitalises the management of company finances.   Reducing costs was also a top business priority for businesses surveyed in Xero's  2023 Accounting Industry Report, which listed the implementation of business tools and technology as another key priority for companies in the year ahead.   The partnership comes at an opportune time then, as SMEs revamp the way they operate, adopting more digital tools to monitor corporate spend and automate key accounting processes including invoicing, GST returns and bank reconciliations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828667,Animal Health Research Institute joins two global bodies under Taiwan name,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) has become an official partner under the name of Taiwan of two international organizations, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday (March 7).After being registered as a collaborator of the Global Foot-and-Mouth Research Alliance (GFRA) and of the Global African Swine Fever Research Alliance (GARA), Taiwan was for the first time allowed to join the two bodies as a partner in its own name, the Liberty Times reported.In the past, AHRI was only allowed to attend a limited number of events with the two organizations, but thanks to support from the United States, it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the GFRA and the GARA allowing it to participate in all their programs.The change would help Taiwan cement its position as a country free of foot-and-mouth disease and prevent the entry of African swine fever, officials said.The COA was also holding talks with an eight-member delegation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) under the leadership of its administrator, Simon Liu, about zero carbon emissions, sustainable fishing and agriculture, resilient forestry, and exchanges in personnel training.The last topic would include cooperation between the COA, the ARS, and U.S. universities, with two young Taiwanese agriculture specialists already having been selected to study in the U.S. Taiwan’s development of animal vaccines and their distribution overseas would also be helped by the discussions, the COA said.",2023/03/07,359,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828672,Southern Taiwan lacks water despite infrastructure investment,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — On March 1, Tainan implemented “orange light” water restrictions, cutting household and industrial water supply by 20%, becoming the only municipality in Taiwan to impose such restrictions.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Council of Agriculture announced that 19,000 hectares of rice in the Chiayi-Tainan Plain will go fallow. Tainan is clearly suffering from drought despite the fact that it has the most reservoirs and reclaimed water plants in Taiwan, per Storm Media.Furthermore, Tainan will soon have the largest desalination plant in Taiwan. The government’s Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program will invest NT$1.2 billion (US$39 million) in a Tsengwen-Nanhua water pipeline bringing water from Kaohsiung.With so much water-related infrastructure investment in Tainan, why does a water shortage continue to exist? First of all, the region is obviously experiencing a drought of historical proportions. The second reason is more vexing as plans to stimulate the industrialization of Tainan have failed to take into account infrastructure development.Heavy rain simply has not fallen in Tainan in more than 600 days. Last year saw the least rainfall in 30 years, and two years ago (2021) was the worst drought in 100 years, per Storm Media. This has led the South Region Water Resources Office to stimulate rainfall through artificial rain enhancement and dredging of the Tsengwen Reservoir.Investments to stimulate the industrial economy of southern Taiwan has led industrial land to increase significantly in DPP controlled municipalities (Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung). By 2036, industrial land will increase in these four counties by 25% compared to 2020, exacerbating the water shortage problem.But while Kaohsiung also faces a tight water supply, as demonstrated by water levels at the Gaoping River dropping to seven cubic meters per second, municipal water supply has remained normal, indicating better municipal water supply management. For example, Kaohsiung has two reclaimed water plants currently supplying water, three underground water reservoirs, and plans to build a desalination plant.Tainan can learn from this example, or else government efforts to stimulate industrial development in the south will be frugal, since there will be no water to power the industries it seeks to nurture.",2023/03/07,1220,Opinion

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Truck Fuel Rail Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Truck Fuel Rail market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Truck Tire Inflator Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Truck Tire Inflator market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Two-wheeler Ignition Switch Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Two-wheeler Ignition Switch market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Bias Tire Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Bias Tire market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.
