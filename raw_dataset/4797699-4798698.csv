https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797709,"HSBC Reiterates ""Buy"" Rating on Fosun and Raises Target Price to HK$11.50","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 2 February 2023 - On 30 January 2023, HSBC Global Research (""HSBC"") published a report pointing out that Fosun International Limited (""Fosun International"" or the ""Company"") (HKEX: 00656) is recovering vigorously. HSBC maintained ""Buy"" rating on Fosun International and raised the target price to HK$11.50.   HSBC pointed out that Fosun's secured RMB12 billion syndicated loan is the largest private enterprise loan led by five major state-owned banks in cooperation with policy banks and joint-stock banks since the Central Economic Work Conference explicitly proposed in December 2022 to encourage and support the development of the private economy and private enterprises. HSBC expects the official landing of the loan to be of great relief to Fosun's cash crunch; it should also serve as a catalyst to rekindle market confidence in the Company's operating stability.   As of the end of July 2022, Fosun had repurchased or purchased overseas bonds with an equivalent par value of USD366 million prior to maturity, partially replaced by low-yield loans to reduce interest payments. HSBC emphasized in the report that Fosun has demonstrated its active debt management and it is expected that the Company's liquidity and earnings this year will improve with debt optimization.   HSBC believes that although Fosun International recently issued a profit warning on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, overall speaking, the negative impacts will be gone gradually. The bank believes that the worst has passed. With debt optimization and consumption recovery, Fosun International's subsidiaries are well-positioned to capture post-pandemic travel, retail, and medical demand, so should post strong earnings this year.   In addition to HSBC, Morgan Stanley earlier expressed its optimistic view on Fosun International and reiterated its ""Overweight"" rating. According to Morgan Stanley, Fosun's syndicated loan can further improve its liquidity, significantly helping lift market confidence in Fosun's stability. The firm believes that after several months of active deleveraging efforts, Fosun's liquidity risk has been greatly reduced. Looking ahead, the reopening of China will help boost fundamentals, especially in businesses such as tourism, retail, and investment.   It is worth mentioning that the recovery trend has been reflected in Fosun's recent business operations in the tourism, health and other sectors. Regarding the tourism sector, the 2023 Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival being held in the Grand Yuyuan has attracted many citizens and tourists; Club Med's bookings in the first half of 2023 have greatly exceeded the same period in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the Spring Festival holiday, the occupancy rate of Club Med resorts in China continued to rise. As one of the preferred destinations for domestic travel, Atlantis Sanya, a benchmark project of Fosun Tourism Group, has continued to be in high demand since the beginning of 2023. During the New Year holiday period, the average occupancy rate reached 97.4%, the total reception was about 37,000 person-times, and the business volume exceeded the pre-pandemic level.   Regarding the Health segment, as the COMIRNATY® BNT162b2 vaccine and COMIRNATY® bivalent vaccine was officially registered as a drug/product (biological product) in Hong Kong SAR and was approved as a regular imported vaccine in Macao SAR, Mainland Chinese residents visiting Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR to receive COMIRNATY® vaccination has recently attracted great attention, the number of inquiries and appointments have increased significantly during the Spring Festival holiday. As regards Azvudine, the oral medication for COVID-19, it is now included in the medical insurance scheme in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and direct-administered municipalities across the country and is available in primary healthcare institutions in many provinces. The accessibility of Azvudine has been greatly enhanced. In addition, in the global consumer market, Fosun's 48 overseas brands in the Health, Happiness, and Wealth segments are also developing steadily and gradually recovering in their respective fields.   The robust recovery and steady development of various businesses of Fosun signal an upward development trend. With the strong support from the government, the optimization of epidemic prevention and control measures, and the consumption recovery, Fosun, which is financially stable and has abundant cash flow, has ushered in a new growth point. As HSBC mentioned in the report, ""The worst is now behind Fosun and 2023 is looking better.""   Hashtag: #Fosun

Bakhmut has suffered relentless bombardment for months by Russian troops.Separately, Avdiivka, another major target, and the nearby contested town of Maryinka and other settlements were also hit, the statement said.""A definite increase has been noted in the offensive operations of the occupiers on the front in the east of our country. The situation has become tougher,"" Zelenskiy said in a Wednesday evening video address.The Russian forces were trying to make gains that they could show on the anniversary of their Feb 24, 2022 invasion, Zelenskiy said.ROCKET HITS KRAMATORSKAt least three people were killed and 20 wounded on Wednesday night after a Russian strike destroyed a residential building in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, police said, which is about 55 km (34 miles) northwest of Bakhmut town. Local authorities initially said Russia had fired a rocket but the police force later said an Iskander-K tactical missile had struck at 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT).""At least eight apartment buildings were damaged. One of them was completely destroyed,"" police said in a Facebook post. ""People may remain under the rubble.""Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko posted a picture that appeared to show a four-storey building in Kramatorsk that had suffered major damage. Radio Free Europe's Ukrainian outlet published a brief video clip that showed rescuers working under floodlights as snow fell on the rubble.At least 44 people were killed in January when a Russian missile hit an apartment building in the city of Dnipro. In April 2022, Ukraine said 57 people died when a Russian missile hit the train station in Kramatorsk. Moscow denied responsibility, saying the missile was Ukrainian.Ukraine and its Western allies have accused Russian forces of war crimes and targeting civilians, charges Russia rejects.RUSSIAN OFFENSIVEAfter a failed advance on the capital Kyiv early in the campaign, Russia said it was reorienting its military drive to secure control of the industrial eastern region known as the Donbas.It is made up of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, which were declared annexed by Moscow in September following sham referendums denounced by most countries. Moscow-aligned fighters seized large areas of both in 2014, and in recent months after a slow advance south and east, Russian forces control most of Luhansk region. Local proxies say Russian forces have captured about half of Donetsk region.""Fierce fighting rages in the east. The enemy is trying to expand the area of its offensive in the Lyman sector,"" the deputy minister Mylar said on the Telegram messaging app. ""It is making powerful attempts to break through our defences.""Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces out of Lyman in October, a significant setback for a military with more troops and weapons.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered what he called a ""special military operation"" to protect Russian security and Russian speakers nearly a year ago. The invasion has killed thousands of civilians, uprooted millions and reduced cities to rubble.More recently Russia has characterized the conflict as confronting what it says is an aggressive and expansionist U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory.A former commander of Russia's Wagner mercenary group who fled to Norway in January told Reuters he wanted to apologise for fighting in Ukraine. The group has been locked in battle in Donetsk region.""Many consider me to be a scoundrel, a criminal, a murderer,"" Andrei Medvedev, 26, said in an interview. ""First of all, repeatedly, and again, I would like to apologise, and although I don't know how it would be received, I want to say I'm sorry.""Medvedev said he wanted to speak out about his experiences so ""the perpetrators are punished"" for their crimes in Ukraine.ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVEMeanwhile, Zelenskiy is cracking down on corruption in his government, a campaign that appears to reflect determination to demonstrate that it can be a steward of billions of dollars in Western aid and shed a reputation for endemic graft.Security services searched the home of one of Ukraine's most influential businessmen, Ihor Kolomoiskiy, two days before senior European Union officials visit Kyiv on Friday. Ukraine sees the meeting as important to its hopes of one day joining the EU, a process that can take years.A Ukrainian political shake-up has led to more than a dozen officials quitting or being dismissed.Zelenskiy said he is prepared to make more personnel changes to fight corruption.(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; writing by Grant McCool; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2023/2/2,249,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797720,"Brazil's Congress reelects leaders, aiding Lula's agenda","BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazilian lawmakers on Wednesday voted to reelect the heads of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, bolstering President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's prospects for passing legislation and governing in the polarized nation.

            Chamber Speaker Arthur Lira won in the biggest landslide since Brazil returned to democracy almost four decades ago, with 91% of the votes. Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco secured victory with a sizeable margin, outdoing analysts' expectations for a tight contest and even possible upset by his challenger. 

            Neither are outright allies of Lula, who assumed office Jan. 1, but the leftist president backed their candidacies and has been distributing Cabinet positions and other appointments to shore up votes. In the Senate, his effort aimed to rout the bid of Sen. Rogério Marinho, who was a minister in the government of Lula's far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. 











            The two congressional leaders play important roles in Brazil's democracy. They set the daily agenda for proceedings, choosing which bills are put up for debate and vote, and they have the power to greenlight congressional investigations. 

            The Chamber of Deputies' speaker also can trigger impeachment proceedings against the president — which Bolsonaro allies have already called for Lula to face — or sit on requests indefinitely. The Senate president can do the same for Supreme Court justices, some of whom Bolsonaro and his supporters have fiercely criticized.

            When Lira became speaker three years ago, he promised to remain neutral amid deepening political animus. He later became a staunch Bolsonaro ally, however, and refused to give his go-ahead for any of the roughly 150 requests for impeachment proceedings targeting the then-president. He also backed Bolsonaro's 2022 reelection campaign. 

            Such support came largely in exchange for Bolsonaro allowing Lira to steer federal funds to lawmakers for allocation as they pleased, without specifying amounts or destinations, said Sérgio Praça, a political analyst at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank. Local media dubbed it the “secret budget,” given its lack of transparency, and critics have said it facilitated systematic corruption. 

            Lula railed against the mechanism on the campaign trail, and promised to scrap it. When Lula won, however, Lira was the first prominent Bolsonaro ally to publicly recognize the results — an important gesture, given that the incumbent had been sowing doubt in the nation's electronic voting system for months and never conceded defeated.

            “When Lira has something to gain, such as access to resources and positions, his posture tends to be pro-government,” said Mayra Goulart da Silva, a political scientist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 

            In December, the Supreme Court ruled that the “secret budget” is unconstitutional. Lira said in an interview on Jan. 31 with the television network GloboNews that ending it will make it harder for Lula to negotiate with Congress. 

            His outstanding performance in the Wednesday vote was viewed by analysts consulted by The Associated Press as stemming from his prowess in securing allies with favors and leading the Chamber of Deputies through several crises with a steady hand. 

            “He has the capacity to articulate, which creates an almost irrefutable situation that (Lula’s) Workers’ Party saw it could not compete against,” said Creomar de Souza, political analyst at Dharma Politics. 

            Lira and the Workers’ Party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies have said that for the next year a party member will lead the Constitution and Justice Committee, a highly sought position because the body must approve any significant legislative proposals before they are put to a vote. That includes the tax reform Lula's finance minister has said he intends to present in the first half of this year, as well as an increase to the minimum wage and managing the government's budget for other social initiatives. 

            Lula's outlook appears more complicated in the Senate, where members are free to make individual agreements, unlike in the Chamber of Deputies, and battle lines more clearly reflect the nation's polarization, analysts and senators said. Bolsonaro, who has been in Florida since Dec. 30, said at an event in Orlando on Tuesday that he had been calling senators and asking them to vote for Marinho in the failed effort to unseat Pacheco.

            Pacheco sold himself as a staunch supporter of democracy in the wake of the Jan. 8 rampage through the federal government's most important buildings by supporters of Bolsonaro seeking to overturn the election. In his victory speech Wednesday, Pacheco told senators that “democracy is still standing” and that “toxic polarization must be erradicated.”

            “We must abandon the discourse of us against them, and be on the right side of history,” he said. 

            Sen. Carlos Viana, a member of Bolsonaro’s party, said Marinho's candidacy was intended, among other things, to hold Supreme Court justices to account for allegedly overstepping their authority, for example by blocking social media accounts ofright-wing lawmakers for supposedly anti-democratic statements. 

            Marinho would have put the Senate “at the center of discussions in matters that we believe go beyond the Supreme Court’s attributions,” Viana said. 

            He added that right-wing senators won’t automatically vote against Lula administration proposals that can benefit the country, such as “a good” tax reform.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797721,Review: 'Knock at the Cabin' twists the home invasion horror,"Knock. Knock. 

            It being mid-winter (typically a doldrums in movie theaters), it's a cozy relief to be able to throw open the door and find M. Night Shyamalan standing there with his near-annual helping of high-concept thriller. His last one, “Old,” about vacationers trapped on a private beach where aging is accelerated — a kind of high-speed “White Lotus” — fittingly arrived in the summer. But this quieter, gloomier time of year seems perfectly designed for Shyamalan to burst in with his signature brand of big-screen bonkers and some new twists to the age-old question of ""Who's there?""

            
                “Knock at the Cabin,” which opens in theaters Friday, is at once like every previous Shyamalan film and a thrilling departure. Gimmicky set-up? Check. Queasy spiritualism? You bet. But as a self-contained, handsomely staged thriller — after the knocking, the film takes place almost entirely within a remote cabin — Shyamalan's latest finds the filmmaker working in an appealingly straightforward and stripped-down fashion. 











            We have our cabin, our small cast of characters and, above all, our preposterous premise. Though Shyamalan's films often flirt with higher powers and existential conundrums, nothing reigns in his movie universe more than The Concept. And in the gripping “Knock at the Cabin,” he carefully teases it, exploits it and dutifully follows it to its ultimate conclusion with the command of a seasoned professional. 

            Just outside a cabin in a wooded forest, 7-year-old Gwen (Kristen Cui) is collecting grasshoppers in a glass jar. “I'm just going to learn about you for a while,” she tells one as she slides it into the jar. Shyamalan, too, is gathering specimens into a hermetically sealed vessel for inquiry. One calmly walks right out of the woods. A hulking, bespectacled man (Dave Bautista) strides up to Gwen, politely introduces himself as Leonard and makes kindly chit chat while occasionally glancing back over his shoulder. Then he says the reason he's there makes him heartbroken. He describes it as “maybe the most important job in the history of the world.”

            Before you exclaim “Podiatry!” Leonard's job turns out to be a tad more sinister. He and three others, who soon also emerge from the forest, are there, as Leonard patiently lays out, to give Gwen's parents a choice that will dictate the fate of the world. After forcing their way into the cabin, Leonard — flanked by Sabrina (Nikki Amuka-Bird), Redmond (Rupert Grint) and Adriane (Abby Quinn) — informs Gwen's two dads, Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Andrew (Ben Aldridge) — that they must make a sacrifice to stave off global apocalypse. Each has come to the cabin after all-consuming visions — like warped versions of those that preoccupy the characters in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” — of the doom that awaits if the family in this random cabin doesn't, within hours, kill one of themselves.

            This isn't, like last year's “Barbarian,” another chastening example of the dangers that lurk within the poorly chosen Airbnb, (though I, for one, will henceforth not be clicking “Shyamalanian allegory” in all future bookings). This is, like most of Shyamalan's schemes, a sincere metaphorical proposition. What's more important: Preserving one's family or the larger world?

            There are, of course, reasons to be dubious of strangers who turn up in your vacation rental asking for blood to spare humanity. Are they delusional? Has this gay couple been targeted? Do their demands not sound a little like the nuttery of some of today's real-world attackers? Eric and Andrew sense the same kind of brutality that they've experienced all their lives as gay men. Flashbacks to their past, including moments of bliss and pain, suggest this lurid episode is part of a larger narrative of a loving family forged against a harsh world. “Always together” is the couple's mantra. 

            But the way the four intruders speak is at odds with that possibility. They seem genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of the family. They identify themselves as regular people, some with families of their own, who are reluctantly but necessarily carrying out a duty. They are making their own sacrifice, too. Bautista, in one of his finest performances, is more sweet than menacing, even while wielding a heavy weapon. Amuka-Bird, too, is an affectingly sensitive presence. 

            The performances, all around, are convincing, and Shyamalan arrestingly stages the intense standoff as blood begins to spill and calamities, seen on television, mount. The tale, adapted from Paul G. Tremblay's 2018 novel “The Cabin at the End of the World” with a notable tweak to the ending, cleverly inverts the home invasion thriller.

            There are, undoubtedly, deeper avenues of exploration left unexamined. But there are also B-movie pleasures that deviate from horror convention, and even some of the director's own trademark sensibilities. Shyamalan doesn't pump up the violence, nor does he rely on plot twists to carry “Knock at the Cabin” along. Instead, the film works as a brutal, neatly distilled kind of morality play that toys with fatalism, family and climate change allegory. What most distinguishes Shyamalan's film is how it dares to consider whether some things are more important than family. In apocalyptic big screen spectacles, family is almost always the last and most abiding refuge. Here, it may be an impediment. 

            “Knock at the Cabin,"" a Universal Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for violence and language. Running time: 100 minutes. Three stars out of four.

Knock.It being mid-winter (typically a doldrums in movie theaters), it's a cozy relief to be able to throw open the door and find M. Night Shyamalan standing there with his near-annual helping of high-concept thriller. His last one, “Old,” about vacationers trapped on a private beach where aging is accelerated — a kind of high-speed “White Lotus” — fittingly arrived in the summer. But this quieter, gloomier time of year seems perfectly designed for Shyamalan to burst in with his signature brand of big-screen bonkers and some new twists to the age-old question of ""Who's there?""“Knock at the Cabin,” which opens in theaters Friday, is at once like every previous Shyamalan film and a thrilling departure. Gimmicky set-up? Check. Queasy spiritualism? You bet. But as a self-contained, handsomely staged thriller — after the knocking, the film takes place almost entirely within a remote cabin — Shyamalan's latest finds the filmmaker working in an appealingly straightforward and stripped-down fashion.We have our cabin, our small cast of characters and, above all, our preposterous premise. Though Shyamalan's films often flirt with higher powers and existential conundrums, nothing reigns in his movie universe more than The Concept. And in the gripping “Knock at the Cabin,” he carefully teases it, exploits it and dutifully follows it to its ultimate conclusion with the command of a seasoned professional.Just outside a cabin in a wooded forest, 7-year-old Gwen (Kristen Cui) is collecting grasshoppers in a glass jar. “I'm just going to learn about you for a while,” she tells one as she slides it into the jar. Shyamalan, too, is gathering specimens into a hermetically sealed vessel for inquiry. One calmly walks right out of the woods. A hulking, bespectacled man (Dave Bautista) strides up to Gwen, politely introduces himself as Leonard and makes kindly chit chat while occasionally glancing back over his shoulder. Then he says the reason he's there makes him heartbroken. He describes it as “maybe the most important job in the history of the world.”Before you exclaim “Podiatry!” Leonard's job turns out to be a tad more sinister. He and three others, who soon also emerge from the forest, are there, as Leonard patiently lays out, to give Gwen's parents a choice that will dictate the fate of the world. After forcing their way into the cabin, Leonard — flanked by Sabrina (Nikki Amuka-Bird), Redmond (Rupert Grint) and Adriane (Abby Quinn) — informs Gwen's two dads, Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Andrew (Ben Aldridge) — that they must make a sacrifice to stave off global apocalypse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797722,Barcelona says it missed out on Araujo signing by 18 seconds,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona missed out on signing Mexican right back Julián Araujo because it was 18 seconds late turning in his transfer documentation.

            Barcelona director of soccer Mateu Alemany said Wednesday that a “system error” caused the club to miss the midnight deadline at the end of the transfer window Tuesday.

            Alemany said the club was talking to FIFA to see if the transfer could still be completed.











            The 21-year-old Araujo was born in the United States and would transfer from the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer.

            Alemany said the club planned to bring Araujo to be initially used at Barcelona's “B” squad.

            Still struggling to comply with the Spanish league's strict financial fair-play rules, Barcelona did not make any additions to its squad at the transfer window, but it was able to give young star Gavi a first-team contract.

            The Catalan club cleared some salary cap room with the retirement of veteran defender Gerard Piqué and the departures of forward Memphis Depay to Atletico Madrid and defender Héctor Bellerín to Sporting Lisbon.

            “The three departures brought us significant economic savings,” Alemany told Movistar.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797723,Lawsuit can proceed against Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A federal judge in Wisconsin ruled Wednesday that a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the father of a man shot and killed by Kyle Rittenhouse during a protest in 2020 can proceed against Rittenhouse, police officers and others. 

            The father of Anthony Huber, one of two men shot and killed by Rittenhouse, filed the lawsuit in 2021, accusing officers of allowing for a dangerous situation that violated his son's constitutional rights and resulted in his death. Anthony Huber's father, John Huber, also alleged that Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, conspired with law enforcement to cause harm to protestors. John Huber is seeking unspecified damages from city officials, officers and Rittenhouse. 

            U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Wednesday dismissed motions filed by Rittenhouse and the government defendants seeking to dismiss the civil rights lawsuit. 











            In allowing the case against Rittenhouse and the others to proceed, the judge said that Anthony Huber's death “could plausibly be regarded as having been proximately caused by the actions of the governmental defendants.”

            Rittenhouse attorney Shane Martin said in a phone interview that it's important to note the ruling doesn't address the merits of the case, it only allows it to proceed to the next phase.

            “While we respect the judge’s decision, we do not believe there is any evidence of a conspiracy and we are confident, just as a Kenosha jury found, Kyle’s actions that evening were not wrongful and were undertaken in self defense,” Martin said.

            Attorneys and private investigators for John Huber spent over 100 hours trying to locate Rittenhouse, tracking down addresses in seven states before they found the home of his mother and sister in Florida. The lawsuit was served on Rittenhouse’s sister, who said that he wasn’t home. Adelman said that was sufficient to qualify as being served.

            Rittenhouse had argued that the case against him should be dismissed because he wasn’t properly served with the lawsuit. Adelman dismissed that, saying that Rittenhouse “is almost certainly evading service.”

            “Rittenhouse has been deliberately cagey about his whereabouts,” Adelman wrote. “Although he denies living in Florida, he does not identify the place that he deems to be his residence.”

            Attorneys for the law enforcement and government officials being sued did not immediately return emailed messages seeking comment.

            The ruling puts Anthony Huber's family ""one step closer to justice for their son’s needless death,” said Anand Swaminathan, one of the attorneys for parents John Huber and Karen Bloom. 

            “The Kenosha officials that created a powder keg situation by their actions tried to claim that they cannot be held accountable for their unconstitutional conduct; that argument was soundly rejected today,"" Swaminathan said in a statement.

            Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and wounding a third person with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer.

            Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges in November 2021 after testifying he acted in self-defense. Rittenhouse’s actions became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the U.S. 

            Rittenhouse went to Kenosha from his home in nearby Antioch, Illinois, after businesses were ransacked and burned in the nights that followed Blake’s shooting. He joined other armed civilians on the streets, carrying a weapon authorities said was illegally purchased for him because he was underage.

            Rittenhouse first killed Rosenbaum, 36, in the parking lot of an auto dealership and as Rittenhouse ran from the scene he stumbled and fell. Anthony Huber, 26, struck Rittenhouse with his skateboard and tried to disarm him. Rittenhouse fell to the ground and shot Anthony Huber to death and wounded demonstrator Gaige Grosskreutz, 27.

            This case is one of several ongoing civil lawsuits filed in the wake of the shootings. Grosskreutz last year filed a similar lawsuit against Rittenhouse.

            Rittenhouse has maintained a high public profile, particularly on social media, where he is an outspoken advocate for gun rights. He has nearly 1 million followers on Twitter and has spoken at conservative gatherings.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797724,"Shanahan 'content' with Purdy, Lance as top 2 QBs for 2023","SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan is “content” going into next season with Brock Purdy and Trey Lance as the top two quarterbacks for the 49ers even after both head into the offseason rehabilitating major injuries.

            Purdy could be sidelined until training camp with an elbow injury suffered in the NFC championship game, while Lance is still recovering from a second operation on his broken right ankle but is expected to be ready for the offseason program.

            But that uncertainty doesn't mean the 49ers are looking for a veteran option to compete as the starter on one of the NFL's most talented rosters.











            “I know we have two starters on our team right now that I believe we can win with, so when you have that situation, you’re not that eager to go looking around,"" Shanahan said Wednesday.

            Lance began the season as the starter but got hurt early in his second game. He has thrown only 102 passes in two seasons in the NFL after San Francisco traded three first-round picks to draft him third overall in 2021.

            Purdy came in with much less fanfare as the last pick in the 2022 draft but shined late in the season after Lance's replacement, Jimmy Garoppolo, went down with a broken foot.

            Purdy won his first seven starts before losing 31-7 to Philadelphia in the NFC championship game. Purdy hurt his elbow on the opening drive and returned to play the second half in an emergency even though he couldn't throw the ball more than a few yards because of a torn ligament in his right elbow.

            Purdy is still seeking additional opinions on his treatment options, but the most likely scenario is a repair to the elbow that would allow him to be back before the start of next season. 

            “He’s continuing to go through that process,” general manager John Lynch said. “I think the positive bit of news is that it seems to be consistent that the right approach is that one that takes about that six-month mark.”

            Under that scenario, Purdy would be able to start a throwing program in about three months and be back to his old self well before the start of next season. 

            ""He (would be) the same dude and full go, so that was the most encouraging part that I heard,” Shanahan said. 

            Shanahan said he wasn't focused at this point on who would go into training camp as the starter and wasn't worried about another offseason of questions at quarterback after dealing with those the past few years.

            “I don’t think there’s much to handle,"" he said. “One guy can’t go and the other guy should be ready for OTAs.”

            One quarterback not in San Francisco's plans is Garoppolo, who started 55 games over the past six seasons for the Niners. Garoppolo returned this season as a surprise on a reduced contract when offseason shoulder surgery hurt his trade market. 

            When asked about a possible Garoppolo return for 2023, Shanahan said: “I don’t see any scenario of that.”

            In other news: 

            — Shanahan said he has started looking for a new defensive coordinator after DeMeco Ryans was hired as head coach in Houston. He said he's looking for someone who can run a similar defense that Ryans did and wants to keep as many of his defensive assistants as possible.

            ""I’m hoping to find someone who fits with us personality-wise and scheme wise,” he said.

            — Shanahan said two of his assistants have been requested for offensive coordinator interviews. Niners passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik will interview in Houston. Running backs coach Anthony Lynn is a candidate in Washington.

            — Lynch said he plans to return for a seventh season as general manager. He was offered a broadcasting job last offseason by Amazon, but remains focused on winning a Super Bowl with the 49ers. 

            “I’m committed to doing this and I’m having a great time doing it and committed to finding a way to get a little bit better,” he said. 

            — Lynch said locking up All-Pro defensive end Nick Bosa with a long-term deal is a priority. He expects to get it done, but many of San Francisco's big-ticket extensions haven't gotten finalized until July. 

            “It takes time, it takes patience, it takes persistence, and we’ll have that on our side,” Lynch said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797725,"Lawsuit: WVa abortion ban irrational, unconstitutional","CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — An abortion provider filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn West Virginia's near-total ban, saying it is unconstitutional, irrational and causes irreparable harm to the state's only abortion clinic and its patients.

            The lawsuit asks for a halt to the four-month-old abortion ban while the case is heard in federal court. Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Sept. 16 signed a bill passed earlier that week making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling overturning its constitutional protection.

            The law requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital — a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia. It has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic.











            Under the law, providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison. 

            According to the lawsuit, the law “severely restricts the circumstances in which abortion can be provided and imposes new, irrational requirements on how abortion care can be provided.” 

            The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Women's Health Center by the American Civil Liberties Union and its West Virginia chapter, Mountain State Justice, and the Cooley law firm. It said the law's care restrictions ""are out of touch with modern medicine, lack any rational justification, and are not logically connected to any legitimate government interest and are therefore unconstitutional"" under the 14th Amendment's due process and equal protection rights. 

            The Charleston clinic suspended abortions shortly after lawmakers passed the bill and provided West Virginia women with resources to book appointments out-of-state and funding to help cover travel and the procedure, clinic Executive Director Katie Quiñonez said.

            According to the lawsuit, the law's care restrictions are “continuing to inflict irreparable harm not only on Plaintiffs’ mission, purpose, and ability to practice their profession and their constitutional rights, but also on the health and wellbeing of their patients and West Virginians seeking access to this essential care.” 

            The lawsuit names West Virginia Board of Medicine President Ashish P. Sheth and board Secretary Matthew Christiansen as defendants. An after-hours message left Wednesday evening with the board seeking comment on the lawsuit was not immediately returned.

            Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said his office was ready to defend the law, which ""reflects the will of the majority of the citizens of the state as relayed by their elected representatives in the State Legislature.”

            The state's abortion ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police.

            When he signed the legislation, Justice described it as “a bill that protects life.”

            Quiñonez said the law “pushes essential abortion care out of reach.”

            “With each day this ban remains in effect, we are forced to turn patients away because politicians took away their power to make the best medical decisions for themselves during pregnancy,"" she said in a statement. ""Whether it’s in the statehouse or courthouse, we will never stop fighting to ensure our patients can access essential care they need.” 

            More than a dozen states now have abortion bans, though most were approved before the Supreme Court ruling and took effect once the court threw out the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — An abortion provider filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn West Virginia's near-total ban, saying it is unconstitutional, irrational and causes irreparable harm to the state's only abortion clinic and its patients.The lawsuit asks for a halt to the four-month-old abortion ban while the case is heard in federal court. Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Sept. 16 signed a bill passed earlier that week making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling overturning its constitutional protection.The law requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital — a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia. It has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic.Under the law, providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison.According to the lawsuit, the law “severely restricts the circumstances in which abortion can be provided and imposes new, irrational requirements on how abortion care can be provided.”The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Women's Health Center by the American Civil Liberties Union and its West Virginia chapter, Mountain State Justice, and the Cooley law firm. It said the law's care restrictions ""are out of touch with modern medicine, lack any rational justification, and are not logically connected to any legitimate government interest and are therefore unconstitutional"" under the 14th Amendment's due process and equal protection rights.The Charleston clinic suspended abortions shortly after lawmakers passed the bill and provided West Virginia women with resources to book appointments out-of-state and funding to help cover travel and the procedure, clinic Executive Director Katie Quiñonez said.According to the lawsuit, the law's care restrictions are “continuing to inflict irreparable harm not only on Plaintiffs’ mission, purpose, and ability to practice their profession and their constitutional rights, but also on the health and wellbeing of their patients and West Virginians seeking access to this essential care.”The lawsuit names West Virginia Board of Medicine President Ashish P. Sheth and board Secretary Matthew Christiansen as defendants. An after-hours message left Wednesday evening with the board seeking comment on the lawsuit was not immediately returned.Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said his office was ready to defend the law, which ""reflects the will of the majority of the citizens of the state as relayed by their elected representatives in the State Legislature.”The state's abortion ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police.When he signed the legislation, Justice described it as “a bill that protects life.”Quiñonez said the law “pushes essential abortion care out of reach.”“With each day this ban remains in effect, we are forced to turn patients away because politicians took away their power to make the best medical decisions for themselves during pregnancy,"" she said in a statement.

            The airport tweeted at around 2:30 p.m. PT that some terminals, along with traffic lights and other systems, may have lost power, although it said the airfield was operating normally.

            The Transportation Security Administration stopped screening passengers in most terminals, the airport said, and it urged people to allow extra time for security checks.











            The airport later tweeted that most terminals had lost electricity and added that some departing flights may have been affected because the jet bridges used to board passengers weren't working.

            The airport said most power was restored shortly after 3 p.m.

            “Our crews were able to make switches in the field to reroute power to LAX and restore service,” the city Department of Water and Power tweeted.

            It wasn't immediately clear how many flights were affected but the LAX website showed that at least three dozen departing flights scheduled to take off during the outage period were delayed.

            The cause of the outage wasn't immediately clear.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797727,Mourners call Australian Cardinal Pell victim of injustice,"SYDNEY (AP) — Mourners at the Sydney funeral for Australian Cardinal George Pell, who was once the most senior Catholic convicted of sex abuse, remembered him Thursday as a victim of a campaign to punish him regardless of his guilt.

            Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters yelled slogans from the street denouncing Pell, a staunch conservative who had riled gay rights supporters and was among church leaders blamed for inaction on clergy sex abuse. 

            Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher told the mourners at St. Mary’s Cathedral that the once third-highest-ranking cleric in the Vatican was the author of a dozen books including three volumes of a diary he wrote in prison before his child abuse convictions were overturned in 2000.











            “That was one happy fruit from 404 days spent in prison for crimes he did not commit following a media, police and political campaign to punish him whether guilty or not,” said Fisher, a longtime supporter of the man he succeeded as Sydney archbishop.

            “Even after he was unanimously exonerated by the High Court of Australia, some continued to demonize him. But many appreciate the legacy of this most influential churchman in our nation’s history,” Fisher added.

            Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a friend of Pell and a former seminarian, described the cardinal’s prosecution as a “modern day crucifixion.”

            “He was made a scapegoat for the church itself,” Abbott told the mourners. Pell was a lightning rod for disagreements over whether the Catholic Church has been properly held to account for past child sex abuse.

            Outside the crowded cathedral, mourners watched the service on large screens.

            A few hundred protesters yelled “George Pell, go to hell” from the street. Tensions had briefly flared earlier when several mourners tried to remove ribbons the protesters had tied to the cathedral's fence to symbolize abuse victims.

            As his coffin was moved in a hearse from the cathedral to the crypt where he was interred, more than 50 protesters yelled “shame” and sang the AC/DC hit “Highway to Hell.”

            Pell died last month in Rome at age 81.

            The abuse allegations against him were reported in the news media before Australian detectives flew to Rome in 2016 to question him.

            Pell returned to Australia from the Vatican in 2017 to fight abuse allegations made by multiple complainants over decades in his home state of Victoria. Only charges that he abused two choirboys in his early months as archbishop of Melbourne in the late 1990s led to convictions.

            His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury, but he was convicted after his second trial with a unanimous verdict. He lost his first appeal in a 2-to-1 ruling but was acquitted by all seven High Court judges.

            He had spent more than a year in prison mostly in solitary confinement before he was cleared. But his Vatican career by then had ended.

            Pope Francis, who in 2014 appointed Pell to be the first prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy tasked with reforming the Vatican’s notoriously opaque finances, sent a message to the funeral that said Australia’s most senior Catholic had “laid the foundations with determination and wisdom” of the Vatican’s economic reforms.

            Pell was revealed soon after his death to have been an influential critic of Francis’ papacy.

            Pell was revealed as the author of a memo that had been circulating for many months in church circles. In the memo, Pell had lamented that the current papacy as a “disaster” and a “catastrophe.”

            Separately, the day after Pell died, a conservative magazine published what it said was an article by the cardinal decrying as a “toxic nightmare” Francis’ determination to sound out Catholic laity on such issues as church teaching on sexuality and the role of women. Those issues will likely spark sharp debate later this year in a meeting of bishops summoned by Francis to the Vatican.

            Sydney-based gay rights group Community Action for Rainbow Rights had called for people to join what it calls its “Pell go to Hell!” protest outside the cathedral.

            Pell had riled gay activists with views including: “Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking.”

            Pell was archbishop of Sydney from 2001 until 2014 when he was called to the Vatican.

            He was archbishop of Melbourne from 1996 to 2001, the period during which he was alleged to have sexually abused two choirboys in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. 

            As church leader of Melbourne and later of Sydney, Pell repeatedly refused to give Communion to gay activists wearing rainbow-colored sashes.

            Pell was also a lightning rod for disagreements over whether the Catholic Church has been properly held to account for past child sex abuse.

            A national inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse found in 2017 that Pell knew of clergy molesting children in the 1970s and did not take adequate action to address it.

            Pell later said he was “surprised” by the inquiry’s findings. “These views are not supported by evidence,” Pell’s statement said.

            He died on Jan. 10 in Rome from heart complications following hip surgery. Francis imparted a final blessing at Pell’s funeral Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica on Jan. 14.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797728,Hunter Biden seeks federal probe of Trump allies over laptop,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer for President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, asked the Justice Department in a letter Wednesday to investigate close allies of former President Donald Trump and others who accessed and disseminated personal data from a laptop that a computer repair shop owner says was dropped off at his Delaware store in 2019.

            In a separate letter, Hunter Biden’s attorneys also asked Fox News host Tucker Carlson to retract and apologize for what they say are false and defamatory claims made repeatedly about him on-air, including implying without evidence that he had unauthorized access to classified documents found at his father’s home.

            The request for a criminal inquiry, which comes as Hunter Biden faces his own tax evasion investigation by the Justice Department, does not mean federal prosecutors will open a probe or take any other action. But it nonetheless represents a concerted shift in strategy and a rare public response by the younger Biden and his legal team to years of attacks by Republican officials and conservative media, scrutiny expected to continue now that the GOP has taken over the House.











            It also represents the latest salvo in the long-running laptop saga, which began with a New York Post story in October 2020 that detailed some of the emails it says were found on the device related to Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. It was swiftly seized on by Trump as a campaign issue during the presidential election that year.

            The letter, signed by prominent Washington attorney Abbe Lowell, seeks an investigation into, among others, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, Trump's longtime lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Giuliani's own attorney and the Wilmington computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who has said Hunter Biden dropped a laptop off at his store in April 2019 and never returned to pick it up.

            The letter cites passages from Mac Isaac's book in which he admitted reviewing private and sensitive material from Biden's laptop, including a file titled “income.pdf.” It notes that Mac Isaac sent a copy of the laptop data to Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, who in turn shared it with Giuliani, a close ally of Trump's who at the time was pushing discredited theories about the younger Biden.

            Giuliani provided the information to a reporter at the New York Post, which first wrote about the laptop, and also to Bannon, according to the letter. Hunter Biden never consented to any of his personal information being accessed or shared in that manner, his lawyer says.

            “This failed dirty political trick directly resulted in the exposure, exploitation, and manipulation of Mr. Biden’s private and personal information,” the letter says, adding, “Politicians and the news media have used this unlawfully accessed, copied, distributed, and manipulated data to distort the truth and cause harm to Mr. Biden.”

            Mac Isaac declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday evening. Costello, asked to comment on behalf of him and Giuliani, called the letter “a frivolous legal document” and said it “reeks of desperation because they know judgment day is coming for the Bidens.""

            A lawyer who represented Bannon at a trial in Washington, D.C., last year did not immediately return a call seeking comment. A Fox News representative had no immediate comment.

            The letter to the Justice Department was addressed to its top national security official, Matthew Olsen. It cites possible violations of statutes prohibiting the unauthorized access of a computer or stored electronic communication, as well as the transport of stolen data across state lines and the publication of restricted personal data with the intent to intimidate or threaten. 

            It also asks prosecutors to investigate whether any of the data was manipulated or tampered with in any way.

            “The actions described above more than merit a full investigation and, depending on the resulting facts, may merit prosecution under various statutes. It is not a common thing for a private person and his counsel to seek someone else being investigated, but the actions and motives here require it,” Lowell wrote in the letter.

            A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. 

            Separate letters requesting investigations were also sent to the Delaware state attorney general's office and to the Internal Revenue Service. Spokespeople there did not immediately return emails seeking comment.

            “This is the best job I've ever had,” said Klain, immediately crying after he said he couldn't promise a tear-free speech. Biden gently patted him on the back. 

            The East Room was packed with White House staff, aides and Cabinet members there to send Klain off, a Biden loyalist who has worked for the president off and on for 36 years.

            “I learned everything I know about how to be a good father from Joe Biden,” said Klain, the father of three, choking up. 

            Klain led the White House through its highs — passage of consequential legislation like the massive infrastructure bill and the Democrats’ climate, health care and tax law, as well as dozens of judges confirmed in the first two years and the first Black woman named to the U.S. Supreme Court — as well as its lows, such as the rocky withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

                Klain is succeeded by Jeff Zients, who led the administration's COVID-19 response. The 56-year-old Zients is tasked with leading operations as the Democratic administration shifts from ambitious legislating to implementing those policies and fending off Republican efforts to defang the achievements.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797733,Fed delivers small rate increase; Powell suggests 'couple' more hikes coming,"The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it had turned a key corner in the fight against high inflation, but that ""victory"" would still require its benchmark overnight interest rate to be increased further and remain elevated at least through 2023.
In announcing its latest policy decision, the U.S. central bank scaled back to a quarter-percentage-point rate increase after a year of larger hikes and swept aside in its statement the long list of reasons, from war to the pandemic, that were driving prices higher to say simply that ""inflation has eased.""
Yet policymakers also projected ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs would be needed, a still open-ended commitment that did not yet pinpoint when the rate hikes might stop, and pushed back against an expectation in financial markets that the Fed would pause soon and, indeed, cut rates later this year.
Investors nevertheless took a dovish cue from remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who referred repeatedly during a news conference to the ""disinflationary"" process that now appeared to be underway. Equity markets rose as Powell spoke and investors slightly boosted bets for coming rate cuts.
Meanwhile, Powell insisted that rate cuts are not in the offing, and took pains to walk what has become an increasingly fine line between the flow of data showing inflation in steady decline with the need to keep the public and investors attuned to the fact that interest rates will continue rising.
""We can now say for the first time that the disinflationary process has started,"" Powell told reporters after the end of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, with goods prices slowing, pandemic-related shortages easing, and supply chains getting back to normal. ""This is a good thing.""
'EARLY STAGES'
From a peak of nearly 7% in June, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation was 5% in December, still well above its 2% target but heading steadily in the right direction.
Yet ""it's just the early stages,"" Powell said. ""We're going to be cautious about declaring victory and ... sending signals that we think that the game is won, because we've got a long way to go.""
Important segments of the economy, including broad swaths of the service sector, have yet to see inflation slow, the Fed chief said, while a high level of job openings and still-strong wage increases showed the labor market was ""extremely tight.""
""The labor market continues to be out of balance,"" Powell said, flagging the fact that Fed officials feel it is likely that the unemployment rate will need to rise from its current low level of 3.5% for inflation to complete the journey back to the 2% level.
The Fed's statement on Wednesday marked its first explicit acknowledgment of slowing inflation after a year in which prices accelerated much faster than anticipated - requiring a series of rapid three-quarters-of-a-percentage point and half-percentage-point rate increases to match the outbreak of rising prices.
Dynamics that the Fed during the past year has said were driving prices higher, including the pandemic, were either dropped from the statement altogether or, in the case of the war in Ukraine, cited only as a source of ""global uncertainty"" rather than inflation.
The rate hikes imposed by the Fed since March have now totaled 4.5 percentage points, with the policy rate now in a range between 4.50% and 4.75%, the highest since 2007. That is reflected in an array of consumer borrowing costs from home mortgages to car loans.
The full impact of that monetary policy tightening has yet to be felt in the economy, but has so far been absorbed without derailing the ""modest"" economic growth and ""robust"" job gains that the Fed cited in its latest statement.
It is in part that resilience that has the central bank poised for ""ongoing increases"" in its policy interest rate.
With inflation still high and demand in the economy stronger than many anticipated, Powell said it remains unclear just how much higher rates will need to go. As of December, Fed policymakers projected a peak policy rate in a range between 5.00% and 5.25%, consistent with what Powell said, as an aside during his news conference, were likely a ""couple"" more rate hikes to come.
Stocks, modestly lower ahead of the Fed rate decision, turned sharply higher as Powell spoke. The benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) index ended the day with just over a 1% gain.
At the same time, the yield on the 2-year Treasury note , the maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, dropped abruptly and traded down more than 10 basis points at 4.10%. The U.S. dollar slid against a basket of major trading partner currencies.
""If you were hoping for clear signs of an upcoming pause in interest rate hikes, you were left wanting. The Federal Reserve retained the phrase 'ongoing increases' in their statement, leaving their options open depending on what upcoming economic data says,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
INFLATION TARGET REAFFIRMED
The Fed statement indicated that any future rate increases would be in quarter-percentage-point increments, dropping a reference to the ""pace"" of future increases and instead referring to the ""extent"" of rate changes.
Fed policymakers hope the central bank can continue nudging inflation lower without triggering a deep recession or causing a substantial rise in unemployment.
The Fed did not issue new economic projections from its policymakers on Wednesday, but did reaffirm its commitment to its 2% average inflation target as part of its annual review of operating principles.The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it had turned a key corner in the fight against high inflation, but that ""victory"" would still require its benchmark overnight interest rate to be increased further and remain elevated at least through 2023.In announcing its latest policy decision, the U.S. central bank scaled back to a quarter-percentage-point rate increase after a year of larger hikes and swept aside in its statement the long list of reasons, from war to the pandemic, that were driving prices higher to say simply that ""inflation has eased.""Yet policymakers also projected ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs would be needed, a still open-ended commitment that did not yet pinpoint when the rate hikes might stop, and pushed back against an expectation in financial markets that the Fed would pause soon and, indeed, cut rates later this year.Investors nevertheless took a dovish cue from remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who referred repeatedly during a news conference to the ""disinflationary"" process that now appeared to be underway. Equity markets rose as Powell spoke and investors slightly boosted bets for coming rate cuts.Meanwhile, Powell insisted that rate cuts are not in the offing, and took pains to walk what has become an increasingly fine line between the flow of data showing inflation in steady decline with the need to keep the public and investors attuned to the fact that interest rates will continue rising.""We can now say for the first time that the disinflationary process has started,"" Powell told reporters after the end of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, with goods prices slowing, pandemic-related shortages easing, and supply chains getting back to normal. ""This is a good thing.""From a peak of nearly 7% in June, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation was 5% in December, still well above its 2% target but heading steadily in the right direction.Yet ""it's just the early stages,"" Powell said. ""We're going to be cautious about declaring victory and ... sending signals that we think that the game is won, because we've got a long way to go.""Important segments of the economy, including broad swaths of the service sector, have yet to see inflation slow, the Fed chief said, while a high level of job openings and still-strong wage increases showed the labor market was ""extremely tight.""""The labor market continues to be out of balance,"" Powell said, flagging the fact that Fed officials feel it is likely that the unemployment rate will need to rise from its current low level of 3.5% for inflation to complete the journey back to the 2% level.The Fed's statement on Wednesday marked its first explicit acknowledgment of slowing inflation after a year in which prices accelerated much faster than anticipated - requiring a series of rapid three-quarters-of-a-percentage point and half-percentage-point rate increases to match the outbreak of rising prices.Dynamics that the Fed during the past year has said were driving prices higher, including the pandemic, were either dropped from the statement altogether or, in the case of the war in Ukraine, cited only as a source of ""global uncertainty"" rather than inflation.The rate hikes imposed by the Fed since March have now totaled 4.5 percentage points, with the policy rate now in a range between 4.50% and 4.75%, the highest since 2007.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797738,10 states mull cross-border rules to tackle teacher shortage,"DENVER (AP) — Every Colorado school district, like many across the country, began 2023 understaffed. That's caused classes to be crammed together, school bus routes to shrink, Spanish language courses to get cut from curriculums, and field trips to be nixed. 

            This has prompted lawmakers in Colorado and other states to suggest legislation that would get rid of relicensing requirements for teachers when they move across state lines — an oftentimes cumbersome and costly process of waiting periods, licensing fees, and expensive exams. 

            The idea for an Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact was first proposed by the U.S. Department of Defense and is designed, in part, to support military spouses. It would effectively allow teaching licenses to be viable across members of the compact, cutting through the current 50-state patchwork of disparate requirements.











            Colorado’s House education committee voted nine to two on Wednesday to send the legislation forward in a hearing. 

            Nine other statehouses are considering joining the compact, including Hawaii, Washington, Kansas, Georgia and Mississippi. For the compact to take effect, 10 states must approve it. 

            The national teacher shortage, exacerbated by deep losses during the pandemic, has left states scrambling to hire and retain educators. It's pushed school districts across the South to accept candidates without teaching certificates or formal training to staunch the losses. 

            “The idea of this bill is that it removes a barrier for moving into the state,” said Colorado Democratic Rep. Meghan Lukens, one of the bill’s sponsors. “By participating in this compact we will allow the seamless transfer of teachers to our state while maintaining the integrity of our teacher licensing.”

            Some worry the change won't make significant difference as long as teachers are underpaid in a state with sky-high housing costs. 

            In 2020, Colorado paid teachers an estimated average of just over $60,000 annually, below the national average of about $65,000, according the National Center for Education Statistics, even though it's one of the most expensive states to live  in. On those salaries, only about 20% of available homes in Colorado are affordable to teachers, according to a study by the Keystone Policy Center.

            “I think this is another example of a solution that isn’t meeting the problem,” said Philip Qualman, superintendent at Eagle County School District, which includes the ski town of Vail west of Denver.

            Qualman said the district is struggling with about 90 vacant positions — the most they’ve ever had — including custodians, teachers and bus drivers. Applicants who receive a job offer often end up turning it down when they can’t find housing within their budget, he said.

            “I think it’s great to reduce the barriers to licensure for those who want to come here. But in reality, who’s going to want to come here when our compensation is so horrible?” Qualman said.

            Adam Diersing, a policy analyst for the Council of State Governments which is working with the Department of Defense in developing and spreading the compact, said “in past compacts we have not seen evidence that accessibility of a license is an impetus for somebody to move to a new state.”

            Still, Diersing added that teachers move for a plethora of reasons, including caring for aging relatives or joining their military spouse, and that state licensing barriers can push them to leave the field altogether.

            “This can be an effective tool to keep folks in the profession when they want to,” said Diersing.

            Amie Baca-Oehlert, president of the Colorado Education Association, pointed to underfunding as principle cause of teacher shortages. Baca-Oehlert did testify in support of the bill at Wednesday’s hearing, arguing that “it certainly opens the door to addressing the bigger issue.”

            “We need something that attracts them to our state,” Baca-Oehlert said in an interview after the hearing, adding that Colorado must also focus on retaining teachers.

            Agreeing that underfunding is a key problem, Democratic Rep. Mary Young said “We have to continue to recognize that this is a destination state, we’ve seen the number of people moving here and we want to make their experiences positive.”

            Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis declined to say whether he supports the measure or not. 

            The legislation is receiving tentative bipartisan support in Colorado, along with other states where the bill is pending. But Diersing, the policy analyst, was unsure whether enough legislatures will sign on to the compact in 2023 to launch it.

            He did point to the Nurse Licensing Compact, which passed in 2000 and now has 39 members states as of last year. As for the proposed teacher compact: “It’s tough to say.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797740,Mariners hope offseason additions have closed gap in AL West,"SEATTLE (AP) — Jerry Dipoto saw up close last year during the regular season and again in October where the differences lie if the Seattle Mariners expect to close the gap on Houston in the AL West. 

            While this winter lacked any significant splashes in free agency, Dipoto said Wednesday the Mariners are confident they’re an improved team from the one that last season ended the longest playoff drought in baseball. 

            “The goal every year is to win the division, get into the postseason and try to do some damage. We’ve never been more convinced of this team’s ability to do those things than we were at the end of last season,” said Dipoto, Seattle's president of baseball operations. “I think that goes for all the players in the clubhouse because for us in the front office, our staff, we do feel like we got meaningfully better this offseason and we are a deeper, more complete team than we were at the end of last season.”











            There is a buzz and excitement about the Mariners in the Pacific Northwest that’s been missing for the better part of two decades. Last season’s run to a wild-card berth and playoff series win over Toronto — and all the dramatics that surrounded it — reinvigorated the slumbering baseball region. 

            But capitalizing on that — in a season that also includes Seattle hosting the All-Star Game — means closing ground on the World Series champion Astros both when it comes to the regular season but also in the playoffs. It was Houston that won the AL West by 16 games and then swept second-place Seattle out of the Division Series on the strength of a few big swings.

            So the question remains whether the Mariners did enough this offseason to be a threat to the Astros. Seattle’s foundation will continue to be its starting pitching and the everyday players back from last year like AL Rookie of the Year Julio Rodríguez, Ty France, J.P. Crawford and others. 

            The Mariners added second baseman Kolten Wong, outfielders Teoscar Hernández and AJ Pollock, and infielder Tommy La Stella. And while those additions should give Seattle a deeper and more versatile roster, they were not viewed from the outside as being impactful enough to make up the difference.

            “It was a struggle for us offensively last year, certainly early in the season, getting consistent offense up and down the lineup,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “So with more experience, guys going through things late in the season, in the playoffs, hopefully will really help us getting off to a little bit better start. And we’ve added some pieces.”

            WBC IMPACT

            Seattle is expected to lose several players to the World Baseball Classic during spring training. Rodríguez, Hernández and reliever Diego Castillo are all expected to play for the Dominican Republic; third baseman Eugenio Suárez with Venezuela; reliever Matt Festa with Italy; reliever Matt Brash with Canada and top prospect Harry Ford with Great Britain. 

            One name notably missing from the list is starting pitcher Luis Castillo, who was expected to be part of the formidable Dominican staff. Dipoto said Castillo has opted not to pitch in the event. 

            “It’s something that we are pleased with that he’ll be (at spring training),” Dipoto said. “It’s a choice that we made together and I’m excited to see him from beginning to end.”

            Seattle is notably antsy about the WBC after losing pitcher Drew Smyly to Tommy John surgery after pitching in the tournament in 2017. Felix Hernandez also pitched in the WBC that year and ended up with two lengthy stints on the injured list due to shoulder troubles. 

            “It’s early in the season and these guys are playing at such a high intensity level when they haven’t been doing that for a number of months, so you’re always worried about injury,” Servais said. “You want those guys to be healthy. These are certainly key contributors for us going into the season.”

            INJURY UPDATES

            The Mariners expect to be mostly healthy when spring training begins. Seattle catcher Cal Raleigh is fully recovered from offseason thumb surgery. Sam Haggerty had surgery to repair a groin injury sustained late last season, but has started full baseball activity. Relief pitcher Andrés Muñoz had foot surgery but should pitch during spring training, and Dipoto said former first-round draft pick Evan White is fully healthy after two-plus seasons of dealing with injuries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797741,Coach Prime comes up big in 1st recruiting class at Colorado,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders proudly recited the numbers from his first recruiting class at Colorado. 

            Two five-star recruits. A No. 21 overall class ranking, which was the highest in 15 years, he pointed out. A top-five class from the transfer portal, according to 247 Sports. 

            Then, a quick reminder — he’s not done gathering talent. Not by a long shot. This is just a brief pause, he teased, with possibility of more skilled players arriving sometime after the spring. 











            It's taken Sanders less than two months in Boulder not only to revamp a downtrodden program but to give a starved fan base something else — hope.

            “We’re not recruiting just no ordinary Tom, Dick and Harry,” Sanders said Wednesday on signing day. “We recruited some guys that can light up the scoreboard and prevent touchdowns from occurring. We’re coming. We’re serious about that.

            ""Hope is in the house. Hope is in the air. Hope is in the city. Hope is in the community.”

            Sanders and his veteran staff have been busy scouring the nation for talent. The Hall of Fame NFL player known then as “Prime Time” has also posted on social media for recruits to reach out to him as well: “I ain't hard to find.”

            The Buffaloes signed players from 16 states and two from England. Not only that, they brought in a pair of five-star recruits in high school cornerback Cormani McClain and transfer cornerback/receiver Travis Hunter, who followed Sanders from Jackson State. 

            In all, there are around 35 newcomers on the spring roster. Maybe that’s why Sanders didn’t really want to talk about each of them by name.

            “We’ve got names on the back of their shirts right now,” cracked Sanders, who starts spring practice March 19 with the intrasquad game scheduled for April 22. “I’m not familiar with every kid. I’m not being disrespectful. I’m just being honest.”

            Only natural, given that he's completely overhauled the roster from a team that went 1-11 last season. The class has four players from Georgia and seven from Sanders’ home state of Florida. There are eight defensive backs, which will come in handy given the level of quarterback play in the Pac-12. 

            In addition, Sanders brought in eight wide receivers, including Adam Hopkins, a four-star from Georgia. There's also running back Dylan Edwards, who switched after verbally committing to Notre Dame. 

            Of course, don't forget that transfer quarterback named Shedeur Sanders, who just happens to be the son of “Coach Prime” and threw 70 TD passes in two seasons at Jackson State.

            Deion Sanders said he's only getting warmed up, too.

            “This is just a comma, because there’s a lot of people that’s going to bungee jump into the portal after spring because they’re going to be disappointed in playing time, commitment or the level of participation they're garnishing,” Sanders said. “We’re going to take full advantage of that. So we’re not done. This is just the comma for the spring. But I love where we are, and what we have.”

            It hasn't taken long for Sanders to settle into the city of Boulder, calling it a “hidden gem.” He can't wait to move into a house and have ""a dog run around the yard.” He even doesn't mind the snow, which blanketed Folsom Field on Wednesday. Quite honestly, he’s not sure why any player would want to go anywhere else.

            “We expect to go get that kid,” Sanders said. “Only thing that can keep that kid from coming and signing with us, is a bag — someone paying them, the collectives or whatever. That’s it. Just outkicking the coverage. That’s it.

            “Because the coaching staff, the atmosphere, the city, the publicity, the structure, the discipline, the academics, the graduation rate, the food in the cafeteria — I can keep going, because this thing is getting good. Just everything. It’s hard to say no. It really is.”

            Listening in was athletic director Rick George, who appreciated the tone of what he heard. Sanders has quickly built the framework for a speedy turnaround. 

            “He’s brought a lot of energy and passion to this program again,"" George said. “It’s what we desperately needed.”

Not only that, they brought in a pair of five-star recruits in high school cornerback Cormani McClain and transfer cornerback/receiver Travis Hunter, who followed Sanders from Jackson State.In all, there are around 35 newcomers on the spring roster. Maybe that’s why Sanders didn’t really want to talk about each of them by name.“We’ve got names on the back of their shirts right now,” cracked Sanders, who starts spring practice March 19 with the intrasquad game scheduled for April 22. “I’m not familiar with every kid. I’m not being disrespectful. I’m just being honest.”Only natural, given that he's completely overhauled the roster from a team that went 1-11 last season. The class has four players from Georgia and seven from Sanders’ home state of Florida. There are eight defensive backs, which will come in handy given the level of quarterback play in the Pac-12.In addition, Sanders brought in eight wide receivers, including Adam Hopkins, a four-star from Georgia. There's also running back Dylan Edwards, who switched after verbally committing to Notre Dame.Of course, don't forget that transfer quarterback named Shedeur Sanders, who just happens to be the son of “Coach Prime” and threw 70 TD passes in two seasons at Jackson State.Deion Sanders said he's only getting warmed up, too.“This is just a comma, because there’s a lot of people that’s going to bungee jump into the portal after spring because they’re going to be disappointed in playing time, commitment or the level of participation they're garnishing,” Sanders said. “We’re going to take full advantage of that. So we’re not done. This is just the comma for the spring. But I love where we are, and what we have.”It hasn't taken long for Sanders to settle into the city of Boulder, calling it a “hidden gem.” He can't wait to move into a house and have ""a dog run around the yard.” He even doesn't mind the snow, which blanketed Folsom Field on Wednesday. Quite honestly, he’s not sure why any player would want to go anywhere else.“We expect to go get that kid,” Sanders said. “Only thing that can keep that kid from coming and signing with us, is a bag — someone paying them, the collectives or whatever. That’s it. Just outkicking the coverage. That’s it.“Because the coaching staff, the atmosphere, the city, the publicity, the structure, the discipline, the academics, the graduation rate, the food in the cafeteria — I can keep going, because this thing is getting good. Just everything. It’s hard to say no. It really is.”Listening in was athletic director Rick George, who appreciated the tone of what he heard. Sanders has quickly built the framework for a speedy turnaround.“He’s brought a lot of energy and passion to this program again,"" George said. “It’s what we desperately needed.”___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/2/2,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797742,Austin's Manila visit to bring deal on expanded base access - Philippines official,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's visit to the Philippines this week is expected to bring an announcement of expanded U.S. access to military bases in the country, a senior Philippines official said on Wednesday.Washington is eager to extend its security options in the Philippines as part of efforts to deter any move by China against self-ruled Taiwan, while Manila wants to bolster defense of its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea.Austin arrived in Manila on Tuesday night, and will meet his Philippine counterpart and other officials on Thursday ""to build on our strong bilateral relationship, discuss a range of security initiatives, and advance our shared vision of a free and open Pacific,"" he said on Twitter.On Wednesday morning, Austin visited U.S. troops stationed at a Philippine military camp in the southern city of Zamboanga, according to Roy Galido, commander of the Western Mindanao Command.""Our working relationship to them is very strong,"" Galido told reporters, adding that U.S. troops help in counter terrorism, and humanitarian and disaster response missions.U.S. officials have said Washington hopes for an access agreement during Austin's visit, which began on Tuesday, and that Washington has proposed additional sites under an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) dating back to 2014.""There's a push for another four or five of these EDCA sites,"" the a senior Philippines official said. ""We are going to have definitely an announcement of some sort. I just don't know how many would be the final outcome of that.""The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Manila and Washington have a mutual defense treaty and have been discussing U.S. access to four additional bases on the northern land mass of Luzon, the closest part of the Philippines to Taiwan, as well as another on the island of Palawan, facing the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.EDCA allows U.S. access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence. The U.S. military already has access to five such sites.The Philippines official said increased U.S. access needed to benefit both countries.""We don't want it to be directed to just for the use of the United States purely for their defense capabilities ... it has to be mutually beneficial,"" he said.""And obviously, we want to make sure that no country will see ... anything that we're doing ... was directed towards any conflict or anything of that sort,"" he added.Manila's priorities in its agreements with Washington were to boost its defense capabilities and interoperability with U.S. forces and to improve its ability to cope with climate change and natural disasters, the official said.He said that after cancelling an agreement for the purchase of heavy-lift helicopters from Russia last year, Manila had reached a deal with Washington to upgrade ""a couple"" of Blackhawk helicopters that could be used for disaster relief.""The deal with Russia was very attractive because for a certain budget we were able to get something like 16 of these heavy-lift helicopters,"" the official said. ""Now with the United States, obviously their helicopters are more expensive, so we're looking at how we can fit in the budget that we've had.""Gregory Poling, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said access to sites in northern Luzon would help U.S. efforts to deter any Chinese move against Taiwan by putting the waters to the south of the island within range of shore-based missiles.He said the U.S. and Philippine marines were pursuing similar capabilities with ground-based rockets, with Manila's particular interest being to protect its South China Sea claims.The Philippines is among several countries at odds with China in the South China Sea and has been angered by the constant presence of vessels in its exclusive economic zone it says are manned by Chinese militia. China is also Manila's main trading partner.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington and Neil Jerome Morales and Karen Lema in Manila; Editing by Gerry Doyle)",2023/2/2,456,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797744,Australia to replace Queen Elizabeth's image on A$5 banknote,"Australia will replace the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II from its A$5 currency note with a new design to reflect and honour the history of its Indigenous culture, the country's central bank said on Thursday.The decision follows consultation with the federal government, which supports the change, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in a statement. The other side of the note will continue to feature the Australian Parliament, it said.Queen Elizabeth's death last year has reignited debates in Australia about its future as a constitutional monarchy. Voters narrowly chose to maintain the British monarch as its head of state in a 1999 referendum.King Charles III, who became British monarch after his mother's death, is the head of state in Australia, New Zealand and 12 other Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom, although the role is largely ceremonial.Australia in September 2022 said the image of King Charles would not automatically replace Queen Elizabeth on A$5 notes, and that she might be replaced by Australian figures.Authorities have said the decision to include the queen's image on the A$5 dollar note was about her personality as opposed to her status as the monarch.The decision to update the note comes as Australia's centre-left Labor government pushes for a referendum, required to alter the constitution, to recognise Indigenous people in the document and require consultation with them on decisions that affect their lives.In 2021, Australia officially amended its national anthem to remove reference to the country being ""young and free"" amid calls to recognise that its Indigenous people are the oldest civilization in the world.The Reserve Bank said it would consult with Indigenous groups in designing the A$5 banknote. It will take a number of years to design and print the new banknote. Until then, the current note will continue to be issued.(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",2023/2/2,283,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797745,Dollar plunges as Fed says disinflation now in play,"The dollar tumbled on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it had turned a corner in the fight against inflation, giving markets a confidence boost that the end of its rate-hike campaign is near.Investors took a dovish cue from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday that ""the disinflationary process has started"" in the world's largest economy, although he also signalled that interest rates would continue rising and that cuts were not in the offing.The Fed's statement on Wednesday, which came after the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting where policymakers agreed to raise rates by 25 basis points, marked the central bank's first explicit acknowledgment of slowing inflation.The dollar dived following Powell's remarks, and against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index =USD fell to a fresh nine-month low of 100.80.It was last 0.12% down at 100.83, having fallen more than 1% on Wednesday.""It was very much a sort of relief ... that there was nothing there to really seriously challenge the market's prevailing view,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (NAB).""(Powell) said that rates are going to have to be restrictive for some time, but that doesn't dissuade the market from saying some time might be six months, rather than two years.""The Aussie AUD=D3 jumped to a new eight-month high of $0.7158 in early Asia trade on Thursday, after rallying 1.2% in the previous session.Against the Japanese yen JPY=EBS, the dollar fell 0.55% to 128.21.The kiwi NZD=D3, which similarly jumped more than 1% on Wednesday, was last 0.25% higher at $0.6523.With the Fed out of the way, the stage is set for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) to announce their rate decisions later on Thursday, where expectations are for a 50bp hike from each.The euro EUR=EBS rose to a roughly 10-month peak of $1.1034 on Thursday, after gaining 1.2% in the previous session, while sterling GBP=D3 was last 0.19% higher at $1.2399.""The risk is that we get a hawkish 50 from the ECB and a dovish 50 from the Bank of England, that might create some volatility,"" said NAB's Attrill.Euro zone inflation eased for the third straight month in January, data on Wednesday showed, but any relief for the ECB may be limited as underlying price growth held steady and concerns have already been raised about the reliability of the figures.""I don't think that's going to influence the messaging from the ECB, which I think is still going to be that (they've) got a lot to do,"" Attrill said.In the United States, Friday's nonfarm payrolls report will be the next test of the Fed's fight against inflation, though Wednesday's JOLTS report showed that job openings unexpectedly rose in December, pointing to a still-tight labour market.Markets are now expecting the Fed funds rate to peak just under 4.9% by June, compared with earlier expectations of a peak of just below 5%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797759,Colorado man held in Nevada solar plant fire unfit for trial,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Nevada judge has ruled a Colorado dentist unfit for trial following his arrest last month in what authorities characterized as a terror attack on a solar power facility serving Las Vegas Strip casinos.

            Mohammed Reza Mesmarian’s attorney, Nick Pitaro, said Wednesday that two psychiatrists found his client was unable to understand the criminal charges against him, including terrorism, arson, destruction of property and escape.

            Clark County District Court Judge Christy Craig ordered Mesmarian, 34, to remain in custody at one of Nevada’s forensic psychiatric facilities pending further evaluation, Pitaro said.











            Mesmarian is accused of ramming a car through a fence and setting the vehicle afire early Jan. 4 at a sprawling solar array in the desert northeast of Las Vegas. He was arrested later in a recreational vehicle at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.

            The alleged attack followed several incidents and arrests involving electrical substations in states including Washington, Oregon and North Carolina and concerns expressed by federal officials about security of the nation’s electricity transmission network.

            Police said Mesmarian denied attempting an act of sabotage; told investigators he favors renewable, clean energy; said he thought the solar array was a Tesla facility connected to “the network;” and his actions “represented moving forward in the world.”

            The array, owned by Chicago-based Invenergy, serves several Las Vegas Strip properties operated by MGM Resorts International. A casino company official said properties switched to the statewide electric grid and hotel guests and gamblers saw no effect.

            Mesmarian lived in Aurora, Colorado, where state records showed he faced Dental Board discipline and his dentist license was restricted last July.

            It is not the first time Khawaja, who was born in the Pakistan capital of Islamabad, has faced visa challenges when trying to enter India. In 2011, the top-order batter took to social media to say he had not been permitted to enter the country because he was not born in Australia. 

            On Wednesday, Khawaja posted a popular meme on Instagram along with the hashtags “stranded”, “dontleaveme”, “standard” and “anytimenow.”

            The 36-year-old Khawaja hasn't played in India in any of his 56 test matches dating back to 2011, although he has played other formats of cricket there. He has undergone a career revival since returning to Australia's test lineup during the Ashes series win over England in January of last year following an almost three-year absence. 

            He posted centuries in each innings of his test recall in Sydney and has added three more hundreds, including an unbeaten 195 against South Africa last in Sydney last month, and five big half-centuries in 11 matches.

            The four-test series against India begins in Nagpur next Thursday. The second test is set for New Delhi starting Feb. 17, the third March 1 in Dharamsala and the final test beginning March 9 in Ahmedabad.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797761,NY judge jails ex-gynecologist who abused 100s of women,"NEW YORK (AP) — An ex-gynecologist convicted of sexually abusing hundreds of patients was ordered to spend the next two months in jail as he awaits sentencing, a federal judge in New York City ruled Wednesday.

            After hearing statements from some of the victims during the bail hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Berman tersely shot down defense attorneys seeking to allow the doctor, Robert Hadden, to remain free while awaiting an April sentencing hearing.

            “I’m done, and you’re done,” Berman was quoted by the New York Daily News as saying. Afterward, Hadden’s attorneys filed papers appealing the judge’s detention order.











            Hadden had worked at two prestigious Manhattan hospitals — Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — until complaints about his attacks shut down his career a decade ago.

            Hadden, 64, of Englewood, New Jersey, was convicted last week after less than a day of deliberations at a two-week trial, in which nine former patients described how he sexually abused them during examinations, when they were most vulnerable.

            One of his victims was Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who also ran unsuccessfully for New York City mayor.

            Hadden's conviction in federal court on four counts of enticing victims to cross state lines so he could sexually abuse them carries a potential penalty of decades in prison.

            After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams issued a statement calling Hadden “a predator in a white coat.”

            At the time, the judge declined to to send Hadden immediately to jail, but suggested that he was “mystified” that Hadden had avoided prison.

            At Wednesday’s hearing, the judge heard from nine women victimized by the doctor, as well as written statements from 43 other victims — all of whom urged the judge to immediately remand Hadden into custody.

            He had been under electronic monitoring and had been free on $1 million bail.

            Hadden’s attorneys argued that he was not a flight risk, but federal prosecutors urged the judge to consider the severity of his crimes.

            For Hadden’s accusers, the federal case represents a second chance for a harsher punishment for the doctor. In his 2016 plea deal with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, Hadden surrendered his medical license but wasn’t required to serve any jail time.

            The district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., defended his decision. Because a conviction wasn’t assured, he argued, his office sought a plea deal to prevent Hadden from practicing medicine and from victimizing additional women.NEW YORK (AP) — An ex-gynecologist convicted of sexually abusing hundreds of patients was ordered to spend the next two months in jail as he awaits sentencing, a federal judge in New York City ruled Wednesday.After hearing statements from some of the victims during the bail hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Berman tersely shot down defense attorneys seeking to allow the doctor, Robert Hadden, to remain free while awaiting an April sentencing hearing.“I’m done, and you’re done,” Berman was quoted by the New York Daily News as saying. Afterward, Hadden’s attorneys filed papers appealing the judge’s detention order.Hadden had worked at two prestigious Manhattan hospitals — Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital — until complaints about his attacks shut down his career a decade ago.Hadden, 64, of Englewood, New Jersey, was convicted last week after less than a day of deliberations at a two-week trial, in which nine former patients described how he sexually abused them during examinations, when they were most vulnerable.One of his victims was Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who also ran unsuccessfully for New York City mayor.Hadden's conviction in federal court on four counts of enticing victims to cross state lines so he could sexually abuse them carries a potential penalty of decades in prison.After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams issued a statement calling Hadden “a predator in a white coat.”At the time, the judge declined to to send Hadden immediately to jail, but suggested that he was “mystified” that Hadden had avoided prison.At Wednesday’s hearing, the judge heard from nine women victimized by the doctor, as well as written statements from 43 other victims — all of whom urged the judge to immediately remand Hadden into custody.He had been under electronic monitoring and had been free on $1 million bail.Hadden’s attorneys argued that he was not a flight risk, but federal prosecutors urged the judge to consider the severity of his crimes.For Hadden’s accusers, the federal case represents a second chance for a harsher punishment for the doctor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797780,Australia is removing British monarchy from its bank notes,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia is removing the British monarchy from its bank notes.

            The nation's central bank said Thursday its new $5 bill would feature an Indigenous design rather than an image of King Charles III. But the king is still expected to appear on coins that currently bear the image of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

            The $5 bill was Australia’s only remaining bank note to still feature an image of the monarch.











            The bank said the decision followed consultation with the center-left Labor Party government, which supported the change. Opponents say the move is politically motivated.

            The British monarch remains Australia's head of state, although these days that role is largely symbolic. Like many former British colonies, Australia is debating to what extent it should retain its constitutional ties to Britain.

            Australia's Reserve Bank said the new $5 bill would feature a design to replace the portrait of the queen, who died last year. The bank said the move would honor “the culture and history of the First Australians.”

            “The other side of the $5 banknote will continue to feature the Australian parliament,"" the bank said in a statement.

            Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the change was an opportunity to strike a good balance.

            “The monarch will still be on the coins, but the $5 note will say more about our history and our heritage and our country, and I see that as a good thing,” he told reporters in Melbourne.

            Opposition leader Peter Dutton likened the move to changing the date of the national day, Australia Day.

            “I know the silent majority don’t agree with a lot of the woke nonsense that goes on but we’ve got to hear more from those people online,” he told 2GB Radio.

            Dutton said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was central to the decision for the king not to appear on the note, urging him to “own up to it.""

            The bank plans to consult with Indigenous groups in designing the $5 note, a process it expects will take several years before the new note goes public.

            The current $5 will be issued until the new design is introduced and will remain legal tender even after the new bill goes into circulation. 

            The face of King Charles III is expected to be seen on Australian coins later this year.

            One Australian dollar is worth about 71 cents in U.S. currency. 

            British currency began transitioning to the new monarch with the release of the 50 pence coin in December. It has Charles on the front of the coin while the back commemorates his mother.

            This week, there were 208 million $5 notes in circulation worth AU$1.04 billion ($734 million), according to the Reserve Bank of Australia.

            Australia’s smallest denomination accounts for 10% of the more than 2 billion Australian bank notes circulating.

            Albanese’s center-left Labor Party is seeking to make Australia a republic with an Australian citizen as head of state instead of the British monarch.

            After Labor won elections in May last year, Albanese appointed Matt Thistlethwaite as assistant minister for the republic. Thistlethwaite said in June there would be no change in the queen’s lifetime.

            Australians voted in a 1999 referendum proposed by a Labor government to maintain the British monarch as Australia’s head of state.

            When the queen died, the government had already committed to holding a referendum this year to acknowledge Indigenous people in the constitution. The government has dismissed adding a republic question to that referendum as an unwanted distraction from its Indigenous priority. 

            At one time, Queen Elizabeth II appeared on at least 33 different currencies, more than any other monarch, an achievement noted by Guinness World Records.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797781,"Gillis scores 29, No. 1 Purdue rolls past Penn St. 80-60","WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Mason Gillis routinely demonstrates his shooting prowess at Purdue’s practices.

            On Wednesday night, the roaring, sellout crowd at Mackey Arena finally got a glimpse, too.

            The third year forward made an arena record nine 3-pointers and finished with a career high 29 points to lead the top-ranked Boilermakers to an 80-60 rout over Penn State.











            “Honestly to me, it doesn’t feel like I did anything different. I just hit a couple shots and they kept falling,” Gillis said. “I kind of hesitate sometimes in games, but the first couple ones went in and I said, ‘I’m just going to keep taking them.’”

            Nobody complained. Gillis, Zach Edey said, made his job of recording an 18th double-double this season easy. Edey had 18 points and 13 rebounds as the Big Ten-leading Boilermakers (22-1, 11-1) made a season-best 14 3s and won their ninth in a row.

            But to many, Gillis’ incredible game seemed to come out of the blue. Until Wednesday, he had never made more than three 3s in a game or scored more than 14 points. Then suddenly, there he was making 10 of 14 shots and nine of 12 from beyond the arc, thanks in part to the Nittany Lions’ strategy of trying a zone defense to negate the 7-foot-4 Edey.

            Gillis made sure the game plan backfired on his old coach.

            “My opening statement is going to be very succinct,” said Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry, who was an assistant at Purdue before taking the Nittany Lions job two years ago. “Best team in the country, best player in the country, best coach in the country.”

            Seth Lundy had 18 points to lead the Nittany Lions (14-8, 5-6), who have lost six straight in the series and all four during Shrewsberry's tenure.

            Purdue, the only Power Five team left with fewer than two losses, looked like it would run away early when it used a 9-0 run to build a 23-13 lead. But Penn State scored the final five points of the first half to close to 35-29.

            Then, after Jalen Pickett opened the second half with a layup, Gillis answered with a flurry. He made three straight 3s to give Purdue a 44-31 lead, and after Penn State called timeout, Gillis made a mid-range jumper and Ethan Morton added another 3 to make it 49-31.

            The Nittany Lions never recovered as Purdue pulled away and extended the margin to as much as 26.

            “We’re not worried about results, we’re pretty process driven,” Gillis said. “But it definitely felt amazing.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Penn State: Shrewsberry was the first Matt Painter assistant to return to Mackey with a different team. It might go down as a pretty forgettable experience. But the Nittany Lions for an improving team, there are going to be some bumpy obstacles along the way.

            Purdue: The Boilermakers showed just how much firepower they possess — in addition to Edey. When Edey's supporting cast plays this way, Purdue is almost unbeatable.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The Boilermakers left nothing to doubt after becoming the first Power Five team to earn unanimous No. 1 selections in consecutive years in 20 years. Now comes the hard part — adding a win at archrival, No. 21 Indiana, the Big Ten preseason favorite, to the resume.

            TEAMING UP

            Shrewsberry and Painter wore T-shirts to promote Project 44, an initiative to expand bone marrow registries. It honors the late Andrew Smith, who played on Butler's two Final Four teams when Shrewsberry was an assistant there. Smith died in January 2016 at age 25 after a two-year battle with cancer and a bone marrow transplant gave Smith and his wife, Samantha, three additional months together.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797783,Judge cuts soccer equal pay legal fees from $6.6M to $5.5M,"A federal judge granted final approval to the equal pay lawsuit settlement between female players and the U.S. Soccer Federation, cutting legal fees from $6.6 million to $5.5 million.

            The Jan. 4 order on legal fees by U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner in Los Angeles was referenced Wednesday in an order by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asking the parties if they objected to dismissal of the appeal, which remains pending on the docket.

            
                Players sued the USSF in 2019, seeking damages under the federal Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 











            
                Klausner dismissed the equal pay claim in May 2020 while allowing claims on inequitable working conditions to proceed. The sides settled on the working conditions portion that December while players appealed the pay claim to the 9th Circuit.

            The sides announced a pay settlement on Feb. 22 that included $22 million plus a $2 million fund to benefit the players in their post-soccer careers and charitable efforts aimed at growing the sport for women.

            Hope Solo, a goalkeeper who sued the USSF in 2018 alleging violations of the Equal Pay Act and sex status discrimination, filed an objection in October, partly over the proposed legal fees. Players were represented by Winston & Strawn.

            Klausner granted final approval on Dec. 12 while holding off on a legal fees decision until Jan. 4.

            “The court finds that an award of $5.5 million, which represents 22% of the $22 million common fund, is reasonable, and that no special circumstances warrant an upward or downward departure,” Klausner wrote. “Class counsel argues that the circumstances justify a $6.6 million award (30% of the fund), but the court disagrees.

            “Class counsel asserts that the ultimate resolution of this case required a great deal of work: hours dedicated to document review, taking depositions, briefing substantive motions, participating in mediation and litigating an appeal, all over a three-year period. It certainly did. But the amount of work required stems from, in significant part, from the fact that the plaintiffs lost their equal pay claims on summary judgment.

            “This fact undercuts class counsel's other assertion that it achieved an exceptional result. Class counsel undoubtedly succeeded, but not to a degree that warrants departing from the 25% benchmark.”

            Klausner also awarded $1,369,127 in reimbursable costs to cover experts, meals, travel and document preparation, including $50,000 for anticipated settlement administration costs.

            
                The USSF and its women's and men's players' unions reached milestone collective bargaining agreements in May to pay its men’s and women’s national teams equally, deals that were signed in September.

But the amount of work required stems from, in significant part, from the fact that the plaintiffs lost their equal pay claims on summary judgment.“This fact undercuts class counsel's other assertion that it achieved an exceptional result. Class counsel undoubtedly succeeded, but not to a degree that warrants departing from the 25% benchmark.”Klausner also awarded $1,369,127 in reimbursable costs to cover experts, meals, travel and document preparation, including $50,000 for anticipated settlement administration costs.The USSF and its women's and men's players' unions reached milestone collective bargaining agreements in May to pay its men’s and women’s national teams equally, deals that were signed in September.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/2,,World

(AP) — Maddy Siegrist had 24 points, eight rebounds and three blocks, Lucy Olsen added 16 points, six assists and four steals and No. 19 Villanova pulled away in the second quarter to beat Marquette 73-54 on Wednesday night.

            Siegrist scored 10 points during an 18-0 second-quarter run that put Villanova ahead 31-15. Marquette missed 13 straight shots during the seven-minute stretch and the Wildcats led by double figures the rest of the way.

            Siegrist was scoreless in the first quarter but ended the half with 14 points and the Wildcats led 37-17 as Marquette was just 7 of 33 (21%) from the field. The Golden Eagles finished the game 19 of 61 (31%) with 15 turnovers.

The $30 million financing round was comprised of $20 million from Lendable, the global provider of debt to fintech companies in emerging markets, marking their first investment in South Asia.  DHAKA, BANGLADESH -  Media OutReach - 2 February 2023 - ShopUp, the largest full-stack B2B commerce platform in Bangladesh, announces a major milestone in securing $30 million in debt financing. The funds will be used to drive expansion efforts and strengthen the company's supply chain operations, benefiting small businesses and consumers across the country.            The $30 million financing round was comprised of $20 million from Lendable, the global provider of debt to fintech companies in emerging markets, marking their first investment in South Asia. Additionally, ShopUp secured BDT equivalent of $10 million in debt financing from The City Bank, a major commercial bank in Bangladesh, a first for a local startup.   Bangladesh's retail market is highly fragmented, with 4.5 million small shops accounting for 98% of total consumption in the country. These small, scattered shops are responsible for distributing food and household items across the country. Still, they face issues such as product unavailability, unreliable delivery, and lack of access to affordable financing.   ShopUp's commerce platform Mokam partners with manufacturers, brands, and mills to streamline the distribution of food and household necessities to small shops. Currently, 20 million people in Bangladesh access food and essentials through Mokam's network of shops. The company operates the largest last-mile logistics network in Bangladesh, REDX, and is committed to addressing gaps in the country's food supply chain infrastructure.   With over $200 million in investments from global investors already raised, the recent debt financing of $30 million will enable ShopUp to further its efforts in building critical supply chain infrastructure, partnering closely with mills and manufacturers, and expanding its financial services products to support underserved SMEs in the food value chain. The funds will also help address the significant food waste issue in Bangladesh, with over 30% of production going to waste, by implementing a seamless distribution system that reaches 50% of the population, ensuring food security for all.   ""The new debt facilities will help us reach our goal of creating a seamless distribution network for food and essentials that serves 80 million people in Bangladesh,"" says Afeef Zaman, CEO, and Founder of ShopUp. ""Our recent success in securing financing is a reflection of our financial stability and our efforts towards having a positive impact in Bangladesh.""   “We have been impressed by the scale of business and quality of team that ShopUp has built to date and are happy to be supporting the impactful work ShopUp has been doing in providing access to goods and capital to underserved MSMEs in Bangladesh” added Hani Ibrahim, Chief Investment Officer of Lendable. “We continue to work closely with ShopUp to facilitate additional debt capital into their business as they roll out their growth plan”.

You has previously called on the U.S. to formally recognize Taiwan, and when asked if he would bring up the issue again, he said “I still will, this is my position.” In October 2018 You predicted that Taiwan would gain U.S. diplomatic recognition within the next 10 years.You said he was happy to learn that some representatives in the U.S. Congress were in support of establishing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.Meanwhile, the UDN report noted that Taiwan's representative to the U.S. Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) had been spotted visiting McCarthy’s office, though she later said she did not have a chance to meet with him.Hsiao said that maintaining close communications with members of congress who support Taiwan is a normal part of her role.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797798,Florida upends No. 2 Tennessee 67-54 behind Colin Castleton,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Colin Castleton is accustomed to being double-teamed every time he touches the ball, so he was pleasantly surprised — maybe even downright stunned — when Tennessee opted to guard him with a single defender in the second half.

            “I’ve got to take advantage of that,"" Castleton said.

            He did. Castleton scored 20 points, including 16 in the second half, and Florida upended the second-ranked Volunteers 67-54 on Wednesday night.











            Kyle Lofton added 14 points for the Gators, who delivered coach Todd Golden his most significant victory in his first season in Gainesville. It was Florida's second Quad 1 win in the last two weeks.

            The Volunteers, playing with their highest ranking in four years, lost for the first time in five games. They had won nine of 10.

            “Our guys are disappointed,"" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. ""We’re better than this, but tonight we weren’t.”

            Tennessee (18-4, 7-2 Southeastern Conference) looked like it had taken control midway through the second half. They outscored Florida by 10 points in the early going to take a six-point lead.

            But the Gators (13-9, 6-3) stormed back behind Castleton, who scored 11 of 14 points as Florida rallied. The senior had a dunk, two free throws, a three-point play, a layup and a short jumper — essentially putting the team on his back down the stretch.

            “They went small, and I felt like I had a mismatch,” Castleton said. 

            Myreon Jones and Will Richard chipped in nine points apiece for the Gators.

            Zakai Ziegler led the Vols with 15 points on 6-of-19 shooting. Olivier Nkamhoua added 11 points and nine rebounds for the visitors, who also got 11 points and eight boards from Vescovi Santiago.

            The Gators were red hot to start the game, making six of their first eight shots — including all three from 3-point range — while building a 17-4 advantage. But they quickly cooled against the nation’s best defense, missing nine of their next 11 as Tennessee made cut it to 22-21.

            The Vols had it going coming out of the locker room, with Ziegler getting into the paint and making things happen. But it was short-lived — thanks mostly to Castleton.

            “We gave them a chance to start believing in what they’re doing, and they took it,"" Barnes said.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Tennessee surely will drop a few spots in next week’s AP Top 25 college basketball poll.

            BIG PICTURE

            Tennessee: The Volunteers gave up 10 points in the opening four minutes of the games, a rare sluggish start for the nation’s best defense. Tennessee had held four of its first eight SEC opponents scoreless at the first media timeout, roughly the first four minutes of games. It was a sign of things to come.

            “We kept fighting uphill all night long,” Barnes said.

            Florida: The Gators are two games into the toughest stretch of their season. Coming off a loss at Kansas State, they have road games against Kentucky and Alabama up next. So to say they needed this one would be an understatement. 

            “It was a desperation game,"" Castleton said. ""We’ve got a tough schedule here and we’ve got to win games. We were able to claw and fight.”

            IN THE HOUSE

            Football coach Billy Napier watched the game from a few rows behind Florida’s bench alongside his two sons and receiver Ricky Pearsall. Former Florida tennis star Ben Shelton, the NCAA singles champion in 2022, also was in attendance. So was former Gators and NFL quarterback Doug Johnson.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797800,"Juhasz, Muhl lead No. 5 UConn over Providence 64-54","PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Dorka Juhasz had 19 points and 17 rebounds and Nika Muhl added 14 points as No. 5 UConn held off Providence 64-54 on Wednesday night. 

            Lou Lopez Senechal and Aubrey Griffin each finished with 13 points as the Huskies registered their 14th straight win. The quest for the 15th straight win will feature a rematch of last year’s national title game as UConn squares off against undefeated No. 1 South Carolina on Sunday.

            “We’re already focusing on that game. It’s going to be an exciting challenge for us,” said Juhasz.











            The Huskies (21-2, 13-0 Big East) shot 51% and held the Friars to 36%. UConn committed 20 turnovers, many of which helped Providence (13-11, 4-9) stay in the picture. Olivia Olsen led Providence with 13 points while Janai Crooms and Nariah Scott each had 11 points. 

            The Huskies shot 69% in the first quarter in building a 20-14 lead that likely would have been greater had UConn not turned the ball over six times. There were more turnover issues in the second quarter, yet UConn carried a 37-26 lead into halftime.

            UConn coach Geno Auriemma found comfort in Juhasz and her ability to dominate inside while supplying some firepower from the outside.

            “She’s trying really hard. Her effort is good,” said Auriemma. “She goes and rebounds the ball over here and over there. She doesn’t stand there and wait for a rebound to come to her.”

            UConn appeared on the verge of seizing control after a layup from Lopez Senechal made it 45-30, but the underdog Friars made it interesting. Five straight points from Scott capped off a 9-0 run that forced UConn to call timeout with 1:23 left in the third quarter after Providence pulled to within six. 

            “We were getting stops and that was starting our offense,” said Providence coach Jim Crowley. “Really proud of the way our kids kept competing. It’s something we can build on heading into this stretch run.”

            HELPING HAND

            The nation’s leader in assists, Muhl handed out nine assists Wednesday night. She now has 192 assists on the season, good for a spot within the top 10 of the single-season program record.

            “I would say the biggest growth in my game is listening to what I need to do so I can work on it even more,” said Muhl, who had five turnovers against the Friars. “That’s not a reflection of what I can do. I’m disappointed in that part of my performance, but we’ll learn from it.”

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: The busy stretch comes at a time when Auriemma only has eight healthy players. The walking wounded included two sophomore guards as Caroline Ducharme (concussion) and Azzi Fudd (right knee). Ducharme missed her 10th straight game Wednesday while Fudd sat out for the 14th time this season, spanning two stints. Between Ducharme and Fudd, the Huskies are seeking to fill 27 combined points each time they hit the court.

            “I wish I could say, ‘Here’s the date.’ We could certainly use one or both of those guys, for sure,” said Auriemma.

            Providence: The Friars fell to UConn for the 33rd consecutive time. The last time Providence got the better of the Huskies was the semifinals of the 1993 Big East Tournament. … Providence is now 1-3 against nationally ranked opponents this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797802,"No lease extension, but O's and governor tout partnership","The Baltimore Orioles and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced a joint commitment to what they called a “multi-decade, public-private partnership"" to revitalize the Camden Yards sports complex.

            The statement from the team and the state's new governor came Wednesday, the deadline for the Orioles to exercise a one-time, five-year extension to their lease at Camden Yards. The team was not planning to exercise that option, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the club hadn't announced its decision.

            With no extension, the lease is set to expire at the end of this year, but the team and the Maryland Stadium Authority can keep negotiating. Wednesday's joint release seemed to be an attempt to calm any nerves in Baltimore about the team's future.











            “I am looking forward to continuing to collaborate with Governor Moore, his administration, and the Maryland Stadium Authority in order to bring to Baltimore the modern, sustainable, and electrifying sports and entertainment destination the state of Maryland deserves,” Orioles CEO John Angelos said.

            ""We greatly appreciate Governor Moore’s vision and commitment as we seize the tremendous opportunity to redefine the paradigm of what a Major League Baseball venue represents and thereby revitalize downtown Baltimore. It is my hope and expectation that, together with Governor Moore and the new members and new chairman of the MSA board, we can again fully realize the potential of Camden Yards to serve as a catalyst for Baltimore’s second renaissance.”

            Republican Larry Hogan, the state's previous governor, signed a bill last year increasing bond authorization for M&T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens, and Camden Yards. The measure allowed borrowing of up to $600 million for each stadium.

            “When Camden Yards opened 30 years ago, the Baltimore Orioles revolutionized baseball and set the bar for the fan experience,” Moore, a Democrat, said Wednesday. “We share the commitment of the Orioles organization to ensuring that the team is playing in a world-class facility at Camden Yards for decades to come and are excited to advance our public-private partnership.""

            Angelos recently reaffirmed that the Orioles would stay in Baltimore, although he dressed down a reporter who asked for more clarity on the future of the team's ownership situation. Angelos was sued last year by his brother Lou, who claimed John Angelos seized control of the Orioles at his expense.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797803,"Prosecutors: 2 moved into ailing man's home, stole millions","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two people have been charged with stealing nearly $3 million from a wealthy ailing investor, moving into his Malibu beach house, claiming to befriend him and giving him drugs, before attempting to steal another $20 million after his death, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.

            Anthony Flores, 46, of Fresno, was arrested last week and pleaded not guilty to felony charges, while Anna Moore, 39, who lives in Monterrey, Mexico, was arrested Tuesday in Houston after a plane flight, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office for the Central District of California. She appeared in a Texas court but didn't enter a plea.

            Both will be extradited to California.











            They were indicted by a grand jury on Dec. 15. It wasn't immediately clear whether they had attorneys to speak for them.

            Beginning in 2017, Flores, a hairstylist who owned a window cleaning business in Fresno, and Moore, a former yoga studio owner, met an ophthalmologist who was a successful investor but suffered from a mental illness that had gradually left him unable to care for himself, according to prosecutors.

            “Within days of meeting the victim, Flores and Moore moved into the victim’s beachfront Malibu home – rent free – and slowly took control of his life by pretending to be his new ‘best friends' and caregivers,"" the statement said.

            Flores told the victim's elderly mother, who lived in Florida, that they were caring for him and “had the victim's best interests in mind,"" according to the indictment, which didn't identify the victim by name. 

            Flores later got the victim to sign over power of attorney and opened bank accounts in the victim's name, according to prosecutors. 

            For months, Flores and Moore diverted the victim's money into their own bank accounts, “isolated the victim from his family and longtime friends and provided the victim with drugs, including marijuana and LSD,” the U.S. attorney's office statement said.

            In the final days of his life, the two allegedly gave the physician LSD that caused his mental condition to deteriorate, prosecutors said.

            Flores also allegedly changed the phone number and security settings on the physician's $60-million online brokerage account to access it and wired $2 million to his own bank account.

            By this time, the victim had evicted the pair from his home, but they had installed cameras in the beach house and watched his deteriorating condition from a luxury hotel, prosecutors said.

            After the victim died in May 2018 at age 57, Flores and Moore moved back into his home and began taking out large amounts of money from his account, prosecutors said.

            The indictment didn't indicate how he died.

            Flores and Moore are each charged with felonies, including conspiracy, identity theft, mail fraud and money laundering.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797804,"Broome has 19 points, 18 boards, No. 25 Auburn beats Georgia","AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Johni Broome scored 19 points and matched a career high with 18 rebounds, Allen Flanigan scored a season-high 22 points, and No. 25 Auburn defeated Georgia 94-73 on Wednesday night.

            Wendell Green Jr. added 18 points and six assists and made two 3-pointers during a 17-0 first-half run for the Tigers (17-5, 7-2 Southeastern Conference).

            Broome secured his seventh double-double of the season with 2:54 remaining in the first half, then added six points and six rebounds in the second half.











            Flanigan went 8 for 10 from the field to finish with his best scoring performance since February 2021.

            “I actually texted (Flanigan) last night and told him I felt like he was gonna have a big one tonight,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. “I said, ‘You’re gonna have a bunch of points. You’re gonna have a bunch of rebounds. You’re gonna play great defense, and you’re not gonna turn the ball over.’ ... And I love it when I’m right.”

            After a 12-point win over Auburn last month, Georgia (14-8, 4-5) was attempting to complete its first regular-season sweep of the Tigers since 2017.

            Mardrez McBride led the Bulldogs with 20 points. Georgia hit 10 3-pointers after halftime but never trailed by fewer than 15 points in the second half.

            Auburn scored 48 points in the paint, which Georgia coach Mike White was quick to point out.

            “You’ve got no chance to have success on the road in this league with that,” White said. “A lack of physicality and physical toughness, defensive rebounding, loose balls in the paint ... all of those areas, we really struggled tonight.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Georgia: The Bulldogs are led by their starting backcourt, and White’s team didn’t have much of an answer for the 6-foot-10 Broome. After combining for 43 points in their first game against Auburn this season, Terry Roberts and Kario Oquendo got off to slow starts and were unable to recreate the same offensive success away from home.

            “We’ve got to find some answers on the interior,” White said. “We’ve got to figure out what we’re doing here moving forward.”

            Auburn: The Tigers were coming off an 0-2 week that included their first home loss in almost two full years. But they were able to bounce back against the Bulldogs by leaning on their defense and rebounding early, with the dominant play of Broome opening things up for his teammates on the perimeter.

            “We had to be the more physical team,” Broome said. “The last time we played them, they beat us on the offensive glass. We took that personally.”

            STREAK ENDS

            Roberts scored 26 points against Auburn last month but was held to seven points in the rematch, ending a streak of 14 straight games scoring in double figures.

            Pearl said the Tigers’ defensive game plan was to get the ball out of the hands of Roberts and Oquendo.

            “We impacted the ball screens more, stayed on them longer, made them give it up and made the other guys beat us,” Pearl said.

            A SIZZLING SEASON HIGH

            The Tigers eclipsed their previous season high for points in a game — 93 against Colgate on Dec. 2. Auburn shot 56.3% from the field and only committed five turnovers.

            “We knew we couldn’t come out and play around with Georgia,” Broome said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797831,"Embiid, Harden double-doubles lift 76ers past Magic 105-94","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — James Harden refused to stump for an all All-Star bid. After another standout game in a Philadelphia 76ers win in which he fell one rebound shy of a triple-double, Harden can let his statistics sell his candidacy.

            Joel Embiid had 28 points and 11 rebounds, Harden added 26 points and 10 assists and the 76ers beat the Orlando Magic 105-94 on Wednesday night.

            The NBA will reveal, on Thursday, the 14 players — seven from the Eastern Conference, seven more from the Western Conference — who got picked to be reserves for the All-Star Game. The reserves are selected by coaches voting for players in their conference. Embiid figures to be among those selected. Harden might be left out because of a crowded group of stars in the East.











            “If my name is called, great,” Harden said. “If not, bigger and better goals for the season.”

            The Sixers split the home-and-home set this week with Orlando. The Magic stormed back from a 21-point, first-quarter deficit to beat the 76ers 119-109 on Monday night. That loss ended the 76ers’ seven-game winning streak.

            But, despite uneven moments against a young, rising Magic team, the Sixers steadied themselves late and improved to 20-8 at home.

            “I didn't think we played great,” coach Doc Rivers said. “But we played good enough to win. We'll take that.”

            Embiid, the NBA scoring leader, made all 10 of his free throws and was 9-of-17 shooting overall to help keep the Sixers within striking distance of the top seed in the Eastern Conference. 

            Harden, a 10-time All-Star, hit six of Philadelphia's 14 3-pointers and grabbed nine rebounds. 

            “I'm not going to sit here and make a case,” Harden said. “The numbers show it.”

            Markelle Fultz led the Magic with 18 points. The Magic have been the most improved team in the league since a nine-game losing streak left them at 5-20 in early December. They are 15-12 since then, which included a six-game winning streak.

            “I really think it’s a belief system,” coach Jamahl Mosley said. “Having them know that on any given night anything can happen. If you play hard, you give yourself a chance.""

            The Sixers used a 17-0 run in the first quarter to take a 56-53 lead into halftime. The Sixers' play with Embiid out again highlighted Philadelphia’s need to try and acquire a reliable backup option for the big man. The Sixers were a plus-12 when Embiid played in the half, while Montrezl Harrell (minus-6) and Paul Reed (minus-3) struggled in limited action. With the trade deadline ahead next week, 76ers President Daryl Morey will surely try and beef up the bench.

            But don’t expect a seismic deal like the one at last season’s deadline, when the Sixers acquired Harden.

            Rivers declined to talk about potential moves. But the third-year Sixers coach knows he has his best team yet in Philadelphia -- one that should contend for a championship.

            “This team, I think is better, better equipped for the playoffs,” Rivers said. “I think we have toughness. We’re not as young. I think we have less holes. Every team has holes.” 

            TIP-INS

            Magic: Made 6 of 38 3-pointers. 

            “We couldn't throw it in the ocean,” Mosley said.

            76ers: De’Anthony Melton and Tyrese Maxey shot a combined 1 for 11 from the floor through three quarters. Maxey broke through for a 3 midway through the fourth for a 93-83 lead. ... Harden had his 14th game this season with at least 20 points and 10 assists.

            DOC AND BRADY

            Rivers was still the Boston Celtics coach the first time he was invited to be a guest speaker at a New England Patriots practice. Rivers had a casual friendship at the time with now-retired Tom Brady. They golfed together and Brady gave a few pep talks to the Celtics. Rivers recalled the first time he spoke at a Patriots practice, Brady walked in with a notebook, pen and sat dead center, front row.

            “Then Randy Moss walked in,” Rivers said, laughing. “He grabbed Randy. He had an empty seat which he wouldn’t let anyone else sit in and he grabbed Moss and said, right here. It was amazing how much he was writing while I was talking. I wanted to see what he was writing. Like, this guy is nuts. I don’t know what he was writing. But it was really impressive the leadership he showed in that meeting. I thought it was really cool.”

The Magic have been the most improved team in the league since a nine-game losing streak left them at 5-20 in early December. They are 15-12 since then, which included a six-game winning streak.“I really think it’s a belief system,” coach Jamahl Mosley said. “Having them know that on any given night anything can happen. If you play hard, you give yourself a chance.""The Sixers used a 17-0 run in the first quarter to take a 56-53 lead into halftime. The Sixers' play with Embiid out again highlighted Philadelphia’s need to try and acquire a reliable backup option for the big man. The Sixers were a plus-12 when Embiid played in the half, while Montrezl Harrell (minus-6) and Paul Reed (minus-3) struggled in limited action. With the trade deadline ahead next week, 76ers President Daryl Morey will surely try and beef up the bench.But don’t expect a seismic deal like the one at last season’s deadline, when the Sixers acquired Harden.Rivers declined to talk about potential moves. But the third-year Sixers coach knows he has his best team yet in Philadelphia -- one that should contend for a championship.“This team, I think is better, better equipped for the playoffs,” Rivers said. “I think we have toughness. We’re not as young. I think we have less holes. Every team has holes.”TIP-INSMagic: Made 6 of 38 3-pointers.“We couldn't throw it in the ocean,” Mosley said.76ers: De’Anthony Melton and Tyrese Maxey shot a combined 1 for 11 from the floor through three quarters. Maxey broke through for a 3 midway through the fourth for a 93-83 lead. ... Harden had his 14th game this season with at least 20 points and 10 assists.DOC AND BRADYRivers was still the Boston Celtics coach the first time he was invited to be a guest speaker at a New England Patriots practice. Rivers had a casual friendship at the time with now-retired Tom Brady. They golfed together and Brady gave a few pep talks to the Celtics. Rivers recalled the first time he spoke at a Patriots practice, Brady walked in with a notebook, pen and sat dead center, front row.“Then Randy Moss walked in,” Rivers said, laughing. “He grabbed Randy. He had an empty seat which he wouldn’t let anyone else sit in and he grabbed Moss and said, right here. It was amazing how much he was writing while I was talking. I wanted to see what he was writing. Like, this guy is nuts. I don’t know what he was writing. But it was really impressive the leadership he showed in that meeting. I thought it was really cool.”UP NEXTMagic: Play Friday night at Minnesota.76ers: At San Antonio on Friday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/2,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797838,No. 16 Xavier beats No. 17 Providence 85-83 in OT thriller,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Jack Nunge had 23 points and 14 rebounds as No. 16 Xavier held off No. 17 Providence 85-83 in an overtime thriller Wednesday night. 

            Colby Jones and Souley Boum each scored 20 for the Musketeers, who won a first-place showdown in the Big East without injured forward Zach Freemantle.

            Xavier was coming off an 84-67 loss at Creighton on Saturday. 











            “This was not an easy task,"" coach Sean Miller said. ""Traveling back from Omaha and not playing well, then losing Zach on the heels of that. I wouldn't want to play Providence in any tournament. It’s tough to beat them.” 

            Noah Locke had 22 points and Ed Croswell added 21 for Providence (17-6, 9-3), which had beaten Xavier three straight times. 

            A layup by Boum put the Musketeers (18-5, 10-2) ahead 82-79 with 51 seconds remaining in overtime. But a Xavier turnover led to a layup by Devin Carter that cut the margin to one with 24 seconds left. 

            Boum hit one of two free throws, and Jared Bynum's 3-point attempt from the left corner rimmed out at the buzzer as the Musketeers held on. 

            “I was just glad that last shot went in and out,” Nunge said. 

            Bynum hit a 3 at the buzzer to beat Xavier at Cintas Center last season, and his shot on Wednesday night appeared it was going in, too. 

            “I was having flashbacks to last year,” Jones said. 

            Xavier played its first game without Freemantle, the team's leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. He is expected to miss four weeks with a left foot injury, the same foot that required surgery in 2021. 

            “We told him we were going to fight for him,” Jones said. “It was big for us. He does a lot on the court. We just played for him.” 

            Jerome Hunter, who has excelled off the bench for the Musketeers, made his first start of the season and scored nine points with eight rebounds. Xavier had used the same starting lineup in each of its previous 11 Big East games. 

            It was only one game, but Miller was encouraged by how his team responded without one of its top players

            “We worry mostly about him because of how hard he's worked,” Miller said. “For him to go down now, when the spotlight is on college basketball, it's very difficult. Losing Zach can bring out the best in other things and that’s what we’re really in search of right now.” 

            Things started well for the Musketeers. who went on a 12-1 run to build a 25-11 lead. 

            With Boum on the bench with two fouls, the Musketeers didn't have a field goal in the final 4:18 of the first half and the Friars pulled to 39-35 at halftime. 

            “We were just taking quick shots, a lot of 3s,” Jones said. “We did a great job of weathering the storm and sticking to our game plan.” 

            Providence outscored Xavier 8-2 to start the second half and took its first lead, 43-41, with 17:41 left. 

            There was a frantic finish to regulation, with Adam Kunkel's 3-pointer putting Xavier ahead 76-73 with 55 seconds left. But then Bynum banked in a tying 3 and Boum missed two long shots to send the game to overtime. 

            “We went into a hostile environment and I was proud of tenacity,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “Souley (Boum) showed why he’s an all-Big East-caliber guard. When you face these atmospheres and this type of coaching, you’re not going to go undefeated.” 

            BALL CONTROL

            The Musketeers, who average 13 turnovers per game, committed only five — their fewest since they had four in an 81-75 win over Georgetown on Jan. 9, 2019. 

            “The key stat for us was five turnovers in 45 minutes,” Miller said. “That’s why we won the game.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Providence: The Friars, who won their first Big East regular-season title last year, entered the night tied atop the conference standings with Xavier and No. 14 Marquette, which hosted Villanova later.

""Traveling back from Omaha and not playing well, then losing Zach on the heels of that. I wouldn't want to play Providence in any tournament. It’s tough to beat them.”Noah Locke had 22 points and Ed Croswell added 21 for Providence (17-6, 9-3), which had beaten Xavier three straight times.A layup by Boum put the Musketeers (18-5, 10-2) ahead 82-79 with 51 seconds remaining in overtime. But a Xavier turnover led to a layup by Devin Carter that cut the margin to one with 24 seconds left.Boum hit one of two free throws, and Jared Bynum's 3-point attempt from the left corner rimmed out at the buzzer as the Musketeers held on.“I was just glad that last shot went in and out,” Nunge said.Bynum hit a 3 at the buzzer to beat Xavier at Cintas Center last season, and his shot on Wednesday night appeared it was going in, too.“I was having flashbacks to last year,” Jones said.Xavier played its first game without Freemantle, the team's leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. He is expected to miss four weeks with a left foot injury, the same foot that required surgery in 2021.“We told him we were going to fight for him,” Jones said. “It was big for us. He does a lot on the court. We just played for him.”Jerome Hunter, who has excelled off the bench for the Musketeers, made his first start of the season and scored nine points with eight rebounds. Xavier had used the same starting lineup in each of its previous 11 Big East games.It was only one game, but Miller was encouraged by how his team responded without one of its top players“We worry mostly about him because of how hard he's worked,” Miller said. “For him to go down now, when the spotlight is on college basketball, it's very difficult. Losing Zach can bring out the best in other things and that’s what we’re really in search of right now.”Things started well for the Musketeers. who went on a 12-1 run to build a 25-11 lead.With Boum on the bench with two fouls, the Musketeers didn't have a field goal in the final 4:18 of the first half and the Friars pulled to 39-35 at halftime.“We were just taking quick shots, a lot of 3s,” Jones said. “We did a great job of weathering the storm and sticking to our game plan.”Providence outscored Xavier 8-2 to start the second half and took its first lead, 43-41, with 17:41 left.There was a frantic finish to regulation, with Adam Kunkel's 3-pointer putting Xavier ahead 76-73 with 55 seconds left. But then Bynum banked in a tying 3 and Boum missed two long shots to send the game to overtime.“We went into a hostile environment and I was proud of tenacity,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “Souley (Boum) showed why he’s an all-Big East-caliber guard. When you face these atmospheres and this type of coaching, you’re not going to go undefeated.”BALL CONTROLThe Musketeers, who average 13 turnovers per game, committed only five — their fewest since they had four in an 81-75 win over Georgetown on Jan. 9, 2019.“The key stat for us was five turnovers in 45 minutes,” Miller said. “That’s why we won the game.”BIG PICTUREProvidence: The Friars, who won their first Big East regular-season title last year, entered the night tied atop the conference standings with Xavier and No. 14 Marquette, which hosted Villanova later. Providence was picked fifth in the preseason. “There are no moral victories ever in sports,” Cooley said. “But I'm happy where we are.”Xavier: Hunter, who averages 14 minutes, left with three minutes remaining in OT with an apparent cramp in his right leg. With Freemantle out, Hunter played 36 minutes. “I credit Jerome’s toughness, and the energy he exerted on defense,” Miller said. “Just look at how much energy he used guarding Bryce Hopkins.”UP NEXTProvidence: Hosts last-place Georgetown on Wednesday.Xavier: Will host St. John's on Saturday.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/2/2,,World

The Group has integrated the Laku6 team's expertise and proprietary AI-first diagnostic technology with Carousell Group's tens of millions of monthly active users across Greater Southeast Asia to launch new features to make selling and buying secondhand electronics more trusted and convenient.   Laku6's dedicated Diagnostic Centre for the Singapore market, as well as their Singapore team, are now housed in the same space as Carousell's Singapore office and regional headquarters to centralise operations and facilitate collaboration. Additionally, both the Group and Laku6's tech teams have been working closely to continually enhance the recommerce experience for our customers across the Group's platforms.   ""There is huge potential for electronics recommerce in Greater Southeast Asia, which is slated to grow over 2.5X to US$18.6 billion by 2026, and Carousell Group is well placed to cement our leadership.  Together with Temasek unit Heliconia Capital, we had made one of the largest capital investments in the region for electronics recommerce, by earmarking US$25 million for the expansion of electronics recommerce. We have seen strong results in the past few months. Laku6 has continued to maintain its leading position in Indonesia's online mobile recommerce market, having inspected and transacted over half a million mobile phones. Carousell has seen a growth of 55% in the past half year alone in mobile phone transactions,"" said Quek Siu Rui, Group CEO and Co-founder, Carousell Group.   Instant cash for time-starved sellers   One of the new features from the Laku6 integration is the launch of end-to-end service  Sell to Carousell in Singapore, where users have an advanced option to sell their mobile phones directly to Carousell in under 24 hours from the comfort of their homes or by dropping-off their phones at any iStudio outlet. The exclusive partnership with iStudio, the largest Apple Premium Reseller in Singapore, provides Carousell access to over 20 drop-off points across the island, significantly optimising logistics, and in return, provides iStudio with new selling opportunities.   With  Sell to Carousell, users fill in a short form about their phone condition on the app or website to get an estimated quote generated by the Group's smart pricing algorithm.

Sell to Carousell is able to provide quick on-the-spot diagnosis with the use of Laku6's proprietary AI-first diagnostic technology, which can inspect the condition of secondhand mobile phones in under two minutes, and smart pricing algorithm to confirm the final quote. This process is fully automated to remove the element of human error during assessment, and users are free to change their minds on selling with no obligations upon receiving the final quote.   Founder of Laku6 Alvin Yap said, ""Almost 60% of users in our user research say that they do not consider selling their old phones as they felt it was too much of a hassle to do so. Hence we have been working on developing solutions tailored for local market needs, using Laku6's proprietary technology, to provide additional choices on top of our current open marketplace. Since the soft launch in September 2022, the program has shown signs of a strong product market fit with thousands of phones processed,"" said Mr Yap.   ""We have seen how Sell to Carousell has been able to unlock new user segments by reaching out to time-starved buyers who want to sell secondhand phones. We will soon launch similar products in Vietnam and Malaysia, where we have a leadership position in classifieds through our brands  Cho Tot and  Mudah.my respectively, and continue to make the recommerce market more accessible in the region.

            “I think we've had a couple of quality wins,” Lillard said. “This was the best team we've come up with a win against, especially as of late.”











            Portland was able to rally late despite losing two starters — Jusuf Nurkic and Grant — to injuries in the first half. There were key stops down the stretch, and the Trail Blazers defense kept the Memphis shooting at 39%, including converting only 1 of 7 shots in from 3-point range in the fourth quarter.

            “I knew I needed to be a little more aggressive just to give ourselves a chance,” Simons said. “Everybody else played well and everybody was ready to play.”

            Ja Morant had 32 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds for Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 18 points and six blocks, and Desmond Bane had 17 points. 

            Lillard, who had five games of at least 40 points in January, continued the trend, converting 11 of 22 shots and 5 of 13 3-pointers. He also missed only one of his 16 free throws.

            “They just found a way to get open shots,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “... I thought our guys competed. You've just got to tip your hat. Lillard's on a roll right now, and we were on the wrong end of that.”

            The teams were tied at 109 with two minutes to play, but Lillard's 3-pointer and Simons' layup was good on Morant's goaltending. When Drew Eubanks converted a three-point play on a dunk, Portland led 117-109 with just under a minute left.

            Lillard scored 17 points in the third quarter, but Morant countered with 16 points in the period and Memphis took a 90-84 lead into fourth before the Portland rally completed the comeback.

            “I didn't play good enough defense on Lillard,” said Memphis forward Dillon Brooks, who had the defensive assignment most of the night on Portland's top scorer. “He started hitting shots. Even though they were tough shots, I've got to do something to contest. Do something to discourage him from shooting when he started getting hot.”

            TIP-INS

            Trail Blazers: Nurkic left early in the first quarter with left calf soreness and did not return. Nurkic was listed on the pregame injury report with the same injury. ... Lillard has at least 25 points in 12 of his last 13 games. 

            Grizzlies: C Brandon Clarke was 3 of 6 from the field and has made 24 of his last 35 shots. 

            ALL-STAR LOBBYING

            Portland coach Chauncey Billups said he has filled out his All-Star ballot and acknowledged that he received some calls from other coaches lobbying for their teams. And maybe a bit more. “Definitely, there's some bribery going on,” Billups said with a smile.

            GREEN'S RETURN

            Memphis guard/forward Danny Green, who missed the first 50 games of the season, saw his first action, playing 10 minutes and scoring three points, hitting one of his four 3-pointers. Green, acquired by Memphis in a draft night trade, spent the first part of the season rehabbing a knee injury he suffered in last year's playoff when he was with the Philadelphia 76ers.

            “It felt good,” Green said. “Game obviously moved fast, so I had to slow it down a little, but it was good to get out there.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797868,Holmes' 28 points leads No. 4 Indiana past Minnesota 77-54,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Mackenzie Holmes scored 28 points with four blocks and Sydney Parrish added 23 points, eight rebounds and five steals to help No. 4 Indiana beat Minnesota 77-54 on Wednesday night.

            Sara Scalia had a happy homecoming against her former team with 10 points and four rebounds for the Hoosiers (21-1, 11-1), who won their ninth straight game to stay in first place in the top-heavy Big Ten. Grace Berger had nine assists despite shooting 2 for 10.

            “They’re not by any stretch of the means down there in that locker room right now high-fiving. They don’t think they played well,” Indiana coach Teri Moren said.











            Mallory Heyer scored 16 points, Mara Braun had 13 points and Alanna Micheaux added 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Gophers (9-13, 2-9), who have lost eight of their last nine games. They're 0-7 against the top seven teams in the conference with an average losing margin of 21 points.

            Holmes, the Big Ten's second-leading scorer behind Iowa All-American Caitlin Clark, had 10 of her team's first 12 points and went 12 for 14 from the floor. The 6-foot-3 Holmes polished up her post moves with Micheaux unable to disrupt them and the Gophers usually declining to double-team her.

            “She’s confident in herself. She’s confident in her teammates,” Moren said.

            Parrish swished 3-pointers from the wing on three of Indiana's first five second-quarter possessions. Berger's pullup jumper off the break with 1:57 left before halftime gave the Hoosiers a 41-15 lead, their largest of the game.

            The Hoosiers, who this week matched the program's best-ever ranking in the Associated Press poll, have won by an average of 14 points on their current streak. The closest game was a 68-61 win at now-No. 8 Maryland, which visits No. 6 Iowa on Thursday night for control of second place.

            The Gophers, who suffered a season-worst 77-41 loss at home on Sunday afternoon to now-No. 18 Michigan, wound up with another lopsided loss to a conference power. But Braun gave them a spark with a 3-pointer late in the second quarter that spurred a halftime-bridging 11-0 run.

            The Gophers got within 52-40 late in the third quarter on another deep ball by Braun before the Hoosiers began to pull away again. Coach Lindsay Whalen was upbeat about her team's level of competitiveness, but she was miffed by the season-high 29 turnovers.

            “You just end up having to overcome too much,” Whalen said.

            SCALIA RETURNS

            Scalia, one of two Minnesota natives playing for the Hoosiers along with Lilly Meister, was the leading scorer for the Gophers last season and Whalen’s first recruit after she was hired in 2018.

            
                Scalia transferred with the simple goal of more wins in the stacked Big Ten, hesitant to spend her final two years of eligibility with such a young team. She's more of a complementary player now, coming off the bench for the last eight games since Berger returned from a knee injury, but the Hoosiers need her outside shooting touch. 

            Moren recently implored her to keep firing amid a significant slump, with Scalia shooting just 26% from the field (24 for 91) and 19% from 3-point range (8 for 42) in Big Ten games.

            “I liked the aggression she played with. I thought she played within herself,” Holmes said. “We know Sara’s a great player, and we’re extremely happy to have her in an Indiana uniform. She means a lot to the whole program, and we have her back in every way, shape or form.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The six regular season games remaining for the Hoosiers are all against teams in the top half of the Big Ten, including two matchups against Iowa. Their lone loss was on Dec. 29 at Michigan State, when Holmes had a career-high 32 points.

            Minnesota: Braun and Heyer are two of the seven freshmen on the roster, a heralded class that Whalen and her staff have been banking on to accelerate this long rebuild. The Gophers not only need to take better care of the ball, but they've got a long way to go with their shooting too.

The 6-foot-3 Holmes polished up her post moves with Micheaux unable to disrupt them and the Gophers usually declining to double-team her.“She’s confident in herself. She’s confident in her teammates,” Moren said.Parrish swished 3-pointers from the wing on three of Indiana's first five second-quarter possessions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797871,Denver's Michael Malone gets All-Star Game coaching nod,"Michael Malone might coach Nikola Jokic in the All-Star Game. He might get the rare chance to coach against him, too.

            Malone and the staff of the Denver Nuggets have clinched their trip to Salt Lake City for All-Star weekend. Malone will coach Team LeBron — the team that will be drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James — in the Feb. 19 matchup.

            
                Boston interim coach Joe Mazzulla will coach Team Giannis, the team that will be drafted by Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo.











            Malone and the Nuggets’ staff were locked into the All-Star trip Wednesday night when Portland defeated Memphis. That ensured that Denver will have the top spot in the Western Conference when play ends on Sunday; the All-Star coaches are based off which teams have the best record in each conference two weeks before the game.

            “I say it every year and I told our players this. There’s some teams that are dying for the All-Star break and can’t wait to go to Cancun,” Malone said. “No, we are keeping our eyes on the prize and we have to make sure we play all the way to the break.”

            If Malone had plans to go to Cancun or anyplace else over the break, he’ll be leaving from Salt Lake City.

            Jokic, the Nuggets’ center and two-time reigning NBA MVP — and certainly a candidate to make it three in a row — is the only Denver player who’ll start. The Nuggets may have more players selected Thursday when the NBA announces the seven Eastern Conference and seven Western Conference players that will be reserves.

            But there’s no guarantee Malone will coach Jokic. That’s up to James and Antetokounmpo; one of them will draft Jokic, and if it’s James, he’ll be with Malone for the game.

            It’s the second time Malone will have the All-Star coaching job. He coached Team LeBron over Team Giannis in the 2019 game at Charlotte, 178-164.

            He’s one of three coaches to get to the All-Star Game as coach of the Nuggets. Larry Brown had the job in 1977 and George Karl had it in 2010.

(AP) — Jae’ly Withers had 19 points and 13 rebounds, Kamari Lands had 11 points and a big 3-pointer, and Louisville defeated Georgia Tech 68-58 on Wednesday night, for the Cardinals' first ACC win of the season.

            Louisville led 33-28 at halftime and maintained a slim lead through the first 10 1/2 minutes of the second half until Georgia Tech tied it at 45 on a dunk by Ja'von Franklin with 9:26 remaining. The Yellow Jackets never took the lead, making just 2 of 9 shots the rest of the game while the Cardinals finished 6 of 8 from the field.

            Louisville's JJ Traynor scored on an alley-oop dunk to push the lead to six with 5:10 remaining, and a minute later Traynor’s 3-pointer pushed the lead to six again, 57-51 with 3:55 remaining. At 2:40 Mike James hit a 3-pointer for a 60-53 lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797878,"Tatum scores 31, Celtics sizzle in 139-96 rout of Nets","BOSTON (AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 31 points and had nine rebounds and the Boston Celtics rolled to a 139-96 win over the short-handed Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. 

            Jaylen Brown added 26 points as both of Boston’s stars knocked down seven 3-pointers in a game the Celtics never trailed and led by as many as 49 points. Boston dominated on both ends of the floor, shooting 60% through three quarters on the way to its largest victory of the season. 

            “You can tell we were ready to go from the jump,” Tatum said. 











            It marked the eighth time this season Tatum and Brown have each scored at least 25 points in the same game.

            Robert Williams finished with 16 points and nine rebounds in his return from a sprained ankle. Derrick White added 14 points and 10 rebounds. 

            “They're hungry,” Williams said of Tatum and Brown. “They're still (upset) about last year.”

            The NBA-leading Celtics have won all three meetings with the Nets this season. 

            Tatum began the night second in the NBA while averaging 37.5 minutes per game. He played just over 29 on Wednesday and was able to sit most of the fourth quarter. Coach Joe Mazzulla said it was nice to get him some rest, but isn't concerned about the load he has carried so far.

            Tatum credits team trainer Nick Sang and the conversations they had since last season for helping him maintain his body this season.

            “I feel great,” Tatum said. “My body feels so much better at this time than it did last season.”

            Kyrie Irving scored 20 points and Cam Thomas added 19 for Brooklyn, which struggled throughout while shooting 41%, including 9 of 39 beyond the arc. The Nets dropped to 4-7 since Kevin Durant sprained his right knee on Jan. 8. 

            “It's clear as day that they want to win the championship, and they're not wasting any time in the regular season,” Irving said. “Tonight I felt like we were just one of those teams in the way, and you know, we just can't be one of those teams in the way. We've got to be one of those teams that stands up to them.” 

            Brooklyn had managed to keep pace with Boston in the standings without Durant and through recent injuries to Ben Simmons (left knee soreness) and T.J. Warren (left shin contusion), who both sat for the third straight game. 

            The Celtics had their entire rotation available except for Marcus Smart, sidelined for the fifth straight game as he recovers from his sprained right ankle. Boston took advantage, racing to a 33-7 advantage as the Nets started just 2 of 14 from the field. 

            Irving missed four of his first five shots as Boston’s crowd booed whenever he touched the basketball, mirroring the treatment he received during his most recent visits to TD Garden. 

            Tatum finished the quarter with 18 points, single-handedly outscoring the Nets as Boston took a 46-16 edge into the second quarter. The 30-point, first-quarter lead marked the first time in franchise history Boston outscored its opponent by 30 in the opening period.

            The Celtics led 79-45 at halftime. 

            “This was a night where they hit first, they hit hard and it hurt,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797880,"Noesen has goal, assist as Hurricanes rout Sabres 5-1","BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Stefan Noesen had a goal and an assist to help lead the Carolina Hurricanes to a 5-1 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday night.

            Sebastian Aho, Brent Burns, Derek Stepan and Jordan Martinook also scored for the Hurricanes, who have won seven games in a row. Antti Raanta made 29 saves. 

            Alex Tuch scored the lone goal for Buffalo. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 29 saves.











            “We’ve played pretty consistently,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “Our guys work really hard and that’s the cornerstone of our group, contributions up and down the lineup.”

            The Hurricanes completely dominated the Sabres out of the gates, taking control of the game and jumping out to an early 3-0 lead.

            “It felt like that was huge for us,” Aho said. “It was almost the game right there.”

            Aho opened the scoring on the power play 2:35 into the game, finishing a pass through the crease from Teuvo Teravainen for a tap-in. Aho extended his hot streak and has goals in six consecutive games.

            Noesen had a tap-in of his own midway through the first period on a feed from Martin Necas.

            Burns made it 3-0 with 7:13 left in the first, shooting at an open net following a terrific setup by Jesperi Kotkaniemi.

            Tuch got the Sabres on the board with 5:15 left in the first on a wrist shot from the right circle. It was his 24th goal of the season.

            Things went from bad to worse late in the second period for Buffalo. Sabres leading scorer Tage Thompson left the game with an upper-body injury and did not return. Thompson had been trying to play through injury in recent days and missed practice on Monday. Thompson has 34 goals and 68 points in 50 games. The injury puts his status for this weekend’s NHL All-Star Game in jeopardy.

            “Never got in a rhythm and obviously we played a very good hockey team and a capable hockey team,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “It didn’t matter who we played tonight. That result was going to be not a favorable one for lots of the reasons that were well within our control.”

            Buffalo outshot Carolina 8-1 to open the third period but was unable to get on the board before Stepan made it 4-1. Stepan picked up his fifth goal of the season with a deke around Luukkonen at the top of the crease.

            Martinook added an empty-net goal with 1:41 remaining.

            SKINNER MILESTONE

            Sabres forward Jeff Skinner played in his 900th career game. He’s the 63rd active NHL player to play in 900 or more games. Skinner originally entered the league with Carolina after being chosen seventh overall by the Hurricanes in 2010.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797882,SEAC Thailand Launches 456 Smart Learning Ecosystem To Upskill Learners,"The Revolutionary 456 Learning Experience Alters Skills Learning & Development in 3 Stages

  SEAC, Southeast Asia’s SMART Learning leader (meeting modern learning needs) has integrated content, technology, design, and learning experience expertise to reimagine learning for today’s learners using their patented 456 methodologies. Both individuals’ and economies’ futures require more people of all ages and walks of life to have access to upskilling opportunities to create life-changing outcomes. 456 provides an affordable, scalable approach, exponentially improving experiences and capability for every learner, 7-70+ in our AI/Tech transformed world. The 456 Learning Experience brings future-ready learning experiences to more people, in a potential US$7 Trillion market.  BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 2 February 2023 - SEAC, Southeast Asia's SMART learning leader today launch their 456 Smart Learning Ecosystem to address the slow rate at which the education and training industries are evolving their learning approaches . SEAC has innovated and refined its approach over the last ten years to better meet learners needs in this new era of rapid change and upskilling.    SEAC's 456 learning experience solution integrates content, technology, design, and experience expertise to reimagine learning by using their trademarked 456 methodologies.       The solution begins with defining the five phases that a learner must go through to ensure buy-in, value, retention, and application: essentially, a bridge across their skill gap. Following that, SEAC weaves four distinct learning lines to support the learners in crossing that bridge to their future. Finally, SEAC incorporates targeted lab experiences to assist learners in accelerating and applying their new skills with confidence and impact.  SEAC's 4-Line Learning, 5-Phase Development, and 6 Learning Labs are a technology-enabled ecosystem and toolkit for effectively closing the massive skill gaps learners' face.   Understanding the three major frameworks:      4-Line Learning: Weaving four distinct modes of learning, OnLine, InLine, FrontLine, and BeeLine, to foster community and momentum for maximum learning impact.   5-Phase Development: The five stages that learners must go through to effectively buy in, learn, retain, and apply new skills, mindsets, and tools. The suggested order is as follows:   -- Phase 1: Introduce & Enroll: What is the significance of what I am about to learn?  What is the value to me?     -- Phase 2: Baseline and Measure: What does good look like in the context of what I'm about to learn? What am I doing now? Where and with whom might I apply this new mindset/skillset?     --Phase 3: Connect and Inspire: What impact can we have if we truly succeed? How will I/we collaborate with others to learn and grow as a community?      --Phase 4: Build and Integrate: How will I apply this content to my work, and where and with whom will I apply this new mindset/skill?     --Phase 5: Consolidate and Sustain: What mindsets, skills, and tools are the most useful? Where and how will I put them to use and keep the momentum?   6 Learning Labs: Short, powerful, targeted interventions added at the right moment to speed up and boost learning and application. These are some examples:    -- Unpacking: Unpacking for greater comprehension and application     --  Skill Practice: 'Acting out' current situations with my new skills and tools.     -- S.T.A.R. Application and Reflection: Planning, executing, and reflecting on applying my learning in situations in my work/life that I am attempting to change,     -- Group/Individual Coaching: Support for action learning projects and applications on a group, team, and individual basis.     -- Impact Presentations: Documenting and sharing the outcomes of my learning with others.     -- Communities of Practice: A group of lifelong learners who share a passion for sustaining change.      By combining these three learning design and delivery frameworks yield an effective, learner-focused experience that reduces unnecessary content, activities, and distractions in favor of context and application.   ""This ever-changing environment we live in today has brought us great technological advancements as well as unexpected problems,"" said  Arinya Talerngsri, SEAC Chief Capability Officer, Managing Director, and Founder. ""Smart Learning is still getting used to its new normal. As a critical solution provider in Thailand, we are still transitioning from ""short-term surge"" to ""long-term transformation"" while overcoming other obstacles. However, our most recent educational innovations are producing astounding results. The context and learner needs are prioritized over content in SEAC's upskilling methodology. As a result, our star 456 Learning Experience is user-oriented and focuses on learners' immediate needs, as should any similar education and training framework.""

""Practicality and creativity are important parts of who we are as an organization, and they are deeply ingrained in our DNA,""  Ms. Arinya Talerngsri continued. ""We have obligations to everyone, whether they are users or not. Gaining a larger share of the $7 trillion global consumer market for education is both difficult and worthwhile. We will give back to the industry and rely on the capital market to assist us in empowering our learners and partner organizations through learning.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797887,CDC official says Taiwan will likely return to normal by summer,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Center for Disease Control (CDC) official said Taiwan will likely make a complete return to normal life by this summer, with nearly all pandemic control measures removed.Convenor of the Ministry of Health and Welfare Advisory Committee on Vaccination Li Ping-ying (李秉穎) said that while the pandemic was still a serious concern, at this point the majority of infections result in only mild cases, so restrictions such as the indoor mask policy will likely be relaxed soon. Li made the comments on a UDN podcast (新聞放鞭炮) released on Thursday (Feb. 2).His comments follow the WHO announcement that the pandemic is in a “transition period” and that the global situation is improving.Li said that people have largely returned to normal life and that the CDC will likely downgrade Covid-19 from the fifth category of infectious disease to the fourth soon.On Wednesday (Feb. 1), the CDC announced that from Feb. 7 those entering Taiwan will only need to take an at-home rapid test if they develop symptoms during their self-initiated health monitoring period. Li said that the policy change is not likely to have a big effect on Taiwan, and that new variants are something of an inevitability at this point.Li praised the government’s response to the pandemic over the past three years, saying that though the situation will likely require ongoing observation, the threat of COVID will continue to get lower and lower. He said that eventually, he expects that COVID symptoms will be more similar to a mild cold, allowing people to return to a normal life.",2023/2/2,2168,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797920,Vern Cotter steps down as Fiji rugby coach,"Vern Cotter stepped down as Fiji coach on Thursday little more than eight months out from the Rugby World Cup in France.

            Fiji Rugby Union chairman Humphrey Tawake told a hastily arranged news conference in Suva that Cotter’s resignation for undisclosed personal reasons was accepted.

            A new coach will be appointed “in due course.” He hoped this month.











            Cotter was assisted by fellow New Zealanders Daryl Gibson and Glen Jackson in Fiji. In a statement, Cotter expressed regret for his sudden departure.

            “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players and coaches I have worked with during my time with the team,” he said. “I feel the team has made some significant improvements over the last few years both on and off the field.

            “I believe we built a great culture which was testament to some good people working hard and enjoying each other’s company and I’m disappointed to be leaving at this time.”

            Cotter coached Fiji for three years and oversaw 10 tests with wins against Georgia, Tonga and Spain.

            He was the coach of Scotland, which he led to the 2015 World Cup quarterfinals. 

            Cotter also previously led New Zealand's Bay of Plenty and French clubs Clermont and Montpellier.

            Cotter is the latest head coach to leave his role close to the World Cup. England's Eddie Jones and Wales' Wayne Pivac were dismissed in December. Jones then took over as Australia coach from Dave Rennie.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797921,Sabonis' double-double helps Kings power past Spurs 119-109,"SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Domantas Sabonis scored a season-high 34 points and had 11 rebounds and the Sacramento Kings beat San Antonio 119-109 on Wednesday night, handing the beleaguered Spurs their seventh straight loss.

            “If they are going to be down there trying to guard him one-on-one, ‘Hey, yo, go score,’” Kings guard De’Aaron Fox said. “If you have to shoot the ball 10, 15 times in a row, do it.”

            Sabonis finished 15 for 20 from the field.











            Fox added 31 points, 10 assists and had just one turnover for Sacramento, which has won two straight and nine of 12 to remain atop the Pacific Division. 

            The Spurs, who have lost 12 of 13, were led by a season-high 22 points from rookie Malaki Branham. But already without Devin Vassell, the Spurs lost starters Tre Jones and Jeremy Sochan to injury in the first quarter.

            Even without three of its top six scorers, San Antonio kept pace with Sacramento’s league-leading offense for most of the game. Josh Richardson added 19 points for the Spurs in his return after missing three games with a sore left knee. 

            “They do it every game,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “They stick with it and they play hard every game. One out of every 10 or so, we might lay and egg, but everybody else does the same thing. I have always been pleased with their effort and their stick-to-itiveness.”

            Sacramento, which matched its season average of 119.5 points per game, went on a 14-2 run in taking a 49-37 lead midway through the second quarter.

            The Kings were 8 for 27 on 3-pointers, but compensated for the poor outside shooting with a season-high 74 points in the paint.

            Sabonis ignited the inside dominance, scoring 17 points primarily in the paint in the first quarter while shooting 7 for 9.

            “In the first quarter, they were trying to play him one-on-one and not allow him to spread the ball,” Fox said. “Obviously, he’s a super unselfish guy, but if they are going to guard him like that, we all tell him, go score the ball because at some point they are going to have to start helping.”

            The Spurs pulled within three points twice in the third quarter and cut the deficit to 89-88 two minutes into the fourth on Doug McDermott’s cutting layup. But the Kings responded each time with a short run to maintain their advantage.

            “Stopping them from getting in the paint,” Sacramento guard Malik Monk said. “After they made a little run, we locked in. Went to the timeout, said, ‘We can’t let them in the paint,’ and we did that. That’s how we held the lead.”

            Monk added 22 points while playing 33 minutes off the bench.

            TIP-INS

            Kings: Sabonis’ previous high was 31 points against Denver on Dec. 28. ... Sacramento did not have a single player listed on its injury report. ... The Kings clinched the season series with their third victory over The Spurs. The series finale is April 2 in Sacramento. The Kings’ last loss to the Spurs was 136-117 on Nov. 10, 2021, in San Antonio.

            Spurs: Popovich said there was no update on Sochan and Jones’ status after the game. Sochan exited with 5:11 remaining in the first quarter after clutching at his lower back. Sochan was fouled while fighting for position under the rim against Fox. Jones left with 2:58 remaining in the first after injuring his left foot. ... G Romeo Langford missed his fifth straight game with left adductor tightness. … C Zach Collins had 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting.

            ALL-STAR NODS

            Sabonis and Fox put up double-doubles in their final game before All-Star reserves are announced Thursday.

            Sacramento coach Mike Brown hopes their outings serve as a punctuation to their selections given how well both have played for the surprising Kings this season.

            “I hope so,” Brown said. “You’ve got to think people would take into consideration your record. To me, Fox and Domas are clear All-Stars, but at the end of the day, it’s not just my decision.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797922,Japan's Honda outlines hydrogen power plans to go green,"TOKYO (AP) — Honda is expanding the use of hydrogen to include trucks and construction equipment, electricity for buildings and even outer space, not just cars on the roads.

            Honda Motor Co. plans a new fuel cell vehicle for sale next year, packed with a fuel cell stack developed with General Motors Co. of the U.S., its general manager, Testsuya Hasebe, told reporters Thursday. 

            That will lower the cost of the fuel cell stack to a third of what it is now, he said. By 2030, costs of Honda’s fuel cells will become comparable with diesel engines, Hasebe said.











            The new fuel cell stack, which charges faster than previous versions, will be produced in Ohio, then roll out to other North American and Japan sites, said Arata Ichinose, its operating executive. 

            All the world’s automakers, including newcomers like Tesla, are coming up with electric vehicles and those that run on fuel cells and hybrid systems, which switch back and forth between a gas engine and a green technology. 

            Fuel cells are powered by hydrogen and are emissions-free.

            “Compared to electric batteries, fuel cells are efficient in producing energy and so they offer a good emission-free solution,” said Hasebe, who oversees the development of the hydrogen business at Honda. 

            Honda was among the pioneers in fuel cells, showing a prototype car in 1998, and its first market product in 2002. 

            Honda plans to provide its fuel stack to JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, this nation’s equivalent of NASA. In using hydrogen for commercial trucks, Honda is working with Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors and has begun tests with Dongfeng Motor in China. Honda’s fuel cell started providing electricity to a Honda site in the U.S. this month.

            Honda’s announcement on fuel cells underlines how Japanese automakers have for years insisted on working on various solutions to climate change, not just electric vehicles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797928,"Gordon, rookie Eason help Rockets defeat Thunder 112-106","HOUSTON (AP) — Eric Gordon had a season-high 25 points and rookie Tari Eason added career-high 20 to lead the Houston Rockets to a 112-106 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday night. 

            The Rockets (13-38), who have the worst record in the Western Conference, have won three of their last five games after dropping 18 of the previous 19. 

            Eason, the 17th overall pick in the 2022 draft, also had 13 rebounds off the bench, matching a career best on a night Jalen Green sat out with an injury. 











            Coach Stephen Silas credited Gordon for keeping this young team focused when the game was close down the stretch. 

            “Eric tonight was so steady and when we went down five or six he was the one settling the guys down, and that’s important,” Silas said. “That veteran presence … was huge tonight.” 

            Gordon, who is in his 15th NBA season, takes pride in helping his inexperienced teammates.

            “My mentality is all about winning,” he said. “And for me it’s all about just giving these young guys confidence.” 

            Houston was up by five after consecutive baskets by Josh Christopher before the Thunder got a free throw from Darius Bazley and a jump shot from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to get within 100-98 with about four minutes left. 

            But the Rockets scored the next five points, with a 3 from Kenyon Martin Jr., to push the lead to seven about a minute later. Gordon missed two free throws after that, and Gilgeous-Alexander made two for Oklahoma City, cutting the lead to 105-100. 

            But Daishen Nix made a layup before Martin had a two-handed dunk seconds later to extend Houston’s lead to 109-100 with less than a minute to go. 

            Gilgeous-Alexander had 24 points to lead the Thunder and Josh Giddey scored 20 with eight rebounds and eight assists. 

            “The best thing Houston did tonight was the way they were ready to play from the jump.” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. 

            Silas was impressed with his team's defense on Gilgeous-Alexander, who entered the game ranked fifth in the NBA by averaging 30.9 points.

            “It was a team effort,” Silas said. 

            Tre Mann opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer to extend Oklahoma City’s lead to five points. But Houston got consecutive 3s from Garrison Mathews and Eason after that to go on top 90-89.

            Eason got a steal a couple of minutes later and drove in for a layup, but missed. It was the first of four straight misses — and four rebounds — by Eason on that possession as he kept grabbing rebounds and missing shots at the rim until finally making a fifth shot that he was fouled on. He made the free throw to put Houston up 93-89. 

            “That just shows the fight that we had at that moment of the game,” Silas said. 

            Eason said the moment was both fun and exhausting.

            “It’s a little bit of both,” he said. “Any time I step on the court, I want to bring a lot of energy, a lot of hustle and that’s just what I do.”

            Houston was up by eight after baskets by Gordon and Martin early in the third quarter before the Thunder used a 9-0 run, with seven points from Jaylin Williams, to take a 72-71 lead. 

            Their lead was short-lived as the Rockets made the next four points to go back on top 75-72 midway through the quarter.

            Oklahoma City used a 7-0 run after that, with a 3 from Isaiah Joe, to take a 79-75 lead with about four minutes left in the third. 

            The game was tied later in the third before Gilgeous-Alexander made all the Thunder’s points in a 7-1 spurt, capped by a three-point play, to put them up 86-80. 

            The Rockets scored the last four points of the quarter to cut the lead to two entering the fourth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797952,"No. 14 Marquette beats Villanova 73-64, wins 4th straight","MILWAUKEE (AP) — The jug full of sticky notes that Marquette kept near its bench Wednesday night helped the Golden Eagles pour it on down the stretch and maintain a share of the Big East lead.

            Tyler Kolek scored 20 points and No. 14 Marquette rallied to beat Villanova 73-64, keeping pace with Xavier atop the conference standings.

            Kolek credited Marquette's latest motivational ploy.











            “We went in the film room the other day and every guy wrote down on a sticky note what they were going to do to help the team positively,” he said. “For me, it was stay super positive and encourage every guy even if everything isn't going our way.”

            All the sticky notes were placed in a pitcher that Marquette had nearby througout the game.

            “Most of the stuff I do is stolen from other people, but that actually was one I just kind of came up with,” coach Shaka Smart said. “I said, ‘Guys, we’ve got to pour into each other.' That's our biggest advantage — the way that everyone feels about each other in our room. I said, ‘Let’s get a pitcher and let's have everybody write one thing that they can do that's under their control and fold it up and put it in a pitcher.' We carried that around with us for two days in practice and, most importantly, in the game.""

            Marquette (18-5, 10-2) has won four straight and nine of 10. The Golden Eagles remain tied for first place in the Big East with No. 16 Xavier, which won 85-83 in overtime against No. 17 Providence earlier.

            Xavier, Providence and Marquette began the night in a three-way tie for first.

            Kam Jones had 18 points for the Golden Eagles. Eric Dixon and Caleb Daniels scored 14 each for Villanova, which committed a season-high 19 turnovers. 

            Villanova (10-12, 4-7) made Marquette work for this one.

            In a game neither team led by more than six until the final minute, Kolek put the Golden Eagles ahead for good at 63-62 by sinking two free throws with 4:32 remaining. That started a 10-0 spurt that put the game away as Marquette’s defense made seven straight stops.

            After shooting 57.9% overall and 7 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half, Villanova shot 40% from the floor and went 4 for 14 from beyond the arc the rest of the way. Wildcats coach Kyle Neptune said the difference in Marquette's defense during the second half was apparent.

            “They just played harder,"" Neptune said. ""They were nasty. They got in passing lanes. They got some deflections. They’re just a tough, nasty team.”

            Villanova took a 59-55 lead on Brendan Hausen’s 3-pointer with 7:42 remaining but didn't make another basket until Daniels dunked with 10 seconds left.

            BIG PICTURE

            Villanova: The Wildcats showed they're better than their record, particularly with Justin Moore back. Moore played just his second game of the season after tearing his Achilles tendon in last season's NCAA Tournament. But the Wildcats were hamstrung by foul trouble involving three starters: Dixon, Cam Whitmore and Brandon Slater. Whitmore, who was coming off a 21-point performance in a loss to Providence, played less than 14 1/2 minutes and scored five points. Slater had five points in 28 minutes, while Dixon played 23 minutes.

            Marquette: The latest example of how far the Golden Eagles have come is that Marquette has swept the regular-season series with Villanova — the Big East's traditional standard bearer — for two straight seasons. ... The Golden Eagles should feel good about starting February with a victory. They entered the month with a 17-24 combined post-January record over the past four seasons. ... Marquette should get even stronger whenever reserve guard Sean Jones returns. Jones missed a second consecutive game with a wrist injury. Smart said Jones' status for Saturday's game against Butler remains uncertain.

            
                POLL IMPLICATIONS
              

            Marquette owns its highest ranking since it was No. 10 in February 2019. This winning streak could have the Golden Eagles flirting with another top-10 spot.

            “I thought we were with them nearly the whole way,” said Leafs forward Mitchell Marner, who had a power-play goal in the second. “Just in the third, I don’t know if I’d call it cheating but we were pushing hard and gave up a couple of odd-man chances and it cost us.”











            Derek Forbort and Brandon Carlo both had goals in the second period as Boston snapped a three-game winless skid. A.J. Greer also scored in the final period and Linus Ullmark made 33 saves.

            Of the four Bruins scorers, only Zacha has double digits in goals this season, with his two on Wednesday lifting him to 11. Carlo said it’s important for Boston to count on its depth players for offense, too.

            “We all want to contribute in that aspect when we can,” said Carlo, who has two goals on the season. “It’s great when you do get the result from it. I think it gives the rest of the guys a boost as well.

            “We want to be a great support system to the guys who are scoring all the time and occasionally do our part, too.”

            Marner scored on the power play, his 19th goal of the season, for Toronto. Calle Jarnkrok had a goal in the third to keep the Maple Leafs in the game. Ilya Samsonov stopped 24 shots in his eighth consecutive game in net for Toronto. 

            Forbort snapped home a short-handed goal 6:57 into the second. 

            Marner replied on the power play 2:28 later. After a long leading pass off the boards from Samsonov, Marner skated through the left faceoff circle and snapped a shot past Ullmark to tie it at 1.

            Carlo reestablished Boston’s one-goal lead a little over three minutes later, taking a pass from Hampus Lindholm and deflecting it past Samsonov from a wide angle.

            Zacha's second goal of the night came at 12:19 of the third. Standing just a few feet from Samsonov’s crease, he dropped to a knee to one-time a pass from David Krejci into the net.

            “I think that line is very dynamic,” said Bruins coach Jim Montgomery. “It’s one of the most creative lines in the league.

            ”(Zacha’s) a little bit of a glue guy that has to do a lot of the dirty work, so to speak, drive the middle lane, be the first guy on the forecheck, first guy in the back check.”

            TAVARES PUNK’D

            John Tavares celebrated his 1,000th game in the NHL on Sunday with two assists in Toronto’s 5-1 win over the Washington Capitals. Timothy Liljegren decided to have a little fun at his captain’s expense after the game, awarding the team’s MVP belt to Mark Giordano instead of Tavares. Giordano said on Wednesday he had intended to give a long speech to really rub salt in Tavares’ wound but when he looked around the room he knew he had to give the belt to its proper recipient.

            “The joke got a few guys and they were already pretty upset that we didn’t give it to John so I had to turn it over pretty quick,” laughed Giordano.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797954,"Russell, Edwards help Timberwolves beat Warriors in OT","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — D'Angelo Russell scored 14 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, Anthony Edwards took over in overtime after Russell fouled out and the Minnesota Timberwolves outlasted the Golden State Warriors 119-114 on Wednesday night.

            Russell fouled out after two quick whistles in the first minute of overtime. That set the stage for Edwards.

            After a scoreless fourth quarter, Edwards was aggressive in overtime, driving to the basket and scoring in traffic on multiple possessions. Edwards helped the Timberwolves — who trailed by 11 after three — complete the comeback. He scored just four of his 27 points in overtime but was the catalyst on offense in the extra session.











            “We needed it,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said about Edwards. “It was good to see him get to the paint.”

            Minnesota moved half-game ahead of the Warriors in the Western Conference standings.

            Stephen Curry had 29 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State. Jordan Poole added 18 points, Klay Thompson had 14, and Draymond Green had 10 points and 12 rebounds. The Warriors had won three in a row.

            Golden State committed nine total turnovers between the fourth quarter and overtime after turning the ball over eight times through the first three quarters.

            “We had control of the game, and I thought we just kind of gift wrapped it,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “They took advantage of our mistakes and our lack of execution. ... Everything we had done to that point to have control of the game, we stopped doing, so we got what we deserved.”

            Russell hit three 3-pointers early in the fourth to help the Wolves claw back. After Russell got Minnesota back in it, Naz Reid hit multiple go-ahead shots, including a 3-pointer that made it a 110-108 game with 1:50 to play in regulation.

            “I just think as a group, we did it collectively,” Russell said. “It was just a balanced game from our group. Everybody pitched in.”

            Curry tied it at 110 on a driving layup and had a good look with five seconds to play in regulation, but missed. Minnesota couldn't get a good shot off at the buzzer, sending the game to overtime.

            With Russell watching from the bench, Edwards hit a big shot in the lane to put Minnesota up 115-112 with 1:43 left. Reid, who had 24 points and 13 rebounds for Minnesota, closed out the victory with an emphatic dunk after rebounding his own miss in the final seconds.

            “That's a team that's not going to back down,"" Reid said about the Warriors. “They're accustomed to winning, so when we bring it to them early, it just shows that we're not here to back down. We're really here to fight.”

            Curry was held to six points in the fourth and didn't score in overtime for Golden State.

            The Timberwolves struggled from the free-throw line from the second straight game. Minnesota finished 13 of 24 after going 15 of 22 on Monday night against Sacramento.

            Wednesday was Minnesota's second overtime game in a row. The Wolves were outscored 15-8 on Monday night in overtime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797976,PG&E to face manslaughter trial over deadly California fire,"REDDING, Calif. (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric will face trial for manslaughter over its role in a 2020 wildfire in Northern California that killed four people, a judge ruled Wednesday.

            The judge in Shasta County ruled after a preliminary hearing that there was enough evidence for the nation's largest utility to face trial on 11 felony and misdemeanor charges, including involuntary manslaughter and recklessly starting a fire.

            Twenty other charges were dismissed.











            The company, which is the nation’s largest utility, pleaded not guilty to the charges last June and was scheduled for arraignment on Feb. 15.

            The Zogg Fire that began in September 2020 tore through the forested county south of the Oregon border. The blaze burned 88 square miles (228 square kilometers) of land and destroyed more than 200 homes before it was brought under control.

            Four people died, including an 8-year-old girl and her mother who were caught by the flames while trying to drive away from their home.

            State fire officials said the fire began when a pine tree fell into a PG&E distribution line. The California Public Utilities Commission last year proposed fining PG&E more than $155 million, saying it had failed to take down the tree, one of two that had been marked for removal.

            Company executives do not face criminal charges, while the company could be fined and ordered to take corrective measures.

            In a statement, PG&E said the loss of life was tragic and while it accepts the conclusion its equipment caused the blaze, “we believe PG&E did not commit any crimes.""

            “We continue our work to make it safe and make it right, both by resolving claims from past fires and through our work to make our system safer every day,"" the utility said. 

            PG&E has an estimated 16 million customers in central and Northern California. The company has been blamed for starting some of California's worst wildfires through neglect of its aging power grid.

            All told, PG&E has been blamed for more than 30 wildfires since 2017 that wiped out more than 23,000 homes and businesses and killed more than 100 people. 

            Last year, former executives and directors agreed to pay $117 million to settle a lawsuit over 2017 and 2018 California wildfires, including the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed much of the town of Paradise in Butte County.

            The complaint was an offshoot of a $13.5 billion settlement that PG&E reached with wildfire victims while the utility was mired in bankruptcy from January 2019 through June 2020.

            PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter for causing the Camp Fire and was fined $4 million, the maximum penalty allowed.

            Also last year, PG&E agreed to pay more than $55 million to avoid criminal prosecution in a settlement with prosecutors in six counties ravaged by the 2021 Dixie Fire and the 2019 Kincade Fire. 

            The Dixie Fire burned more than 1,300 homes and other buildings. The blaze was caused by a tree hitting electrical distribution lines west of a dam in the Sierra Nevada.REDDING, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797980,"Markkanen, Conley power Jazz to 131-128 win over Raptors","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Lauri Markkanen had 28 points and 13 rebounds and Mike Conley added a three-point play and two clutch free throws in the closing minutes to lift the Utah Jazz to a 131-128 win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night.

            “Taking my time, having a little more patience, not just going right away and being a little bit stronger with the ball,” said Markkanen of finishing strong against the physical Raptors after a slow start.

            Toronto’s Fred VanVleet had his second career triple-double with 34 points, a career-best 12 rebounds and 10 assists, but the Jazz overcame that effort by shooting 53% and making key play after key play down the stretch.











            Conley, who had 19 points and eight assists, drew Pascal Siakam’s sixth foul on a head fake and completed a three-point play to give the Jazz a 120-113 lead with 2:13 remaining. 

            “(Siakam) reached in but I was able to finish it. Really was the best of both worlds there. It was a big play and I think it got us going enough able to finish the game,” Conley said.

            VanVleet kept the Raptors close with his 3-point shooting, but Toronto couldn’t complete the comeback effort.

            “If we’re up three at the end of the night, then a lot of these stats look a lot better. We’d be celebrating … just got to find ways to win and that’s really all that matters,” VanVleet said.

            Conley hit two free throws with 12.2 seconds left to seal the win and the Jazz moved above .500 at 27-26.

            “Mike has been such a steadying force for us late in games. He and I have developed a very good communication about what we would like to do and he does a good job communicating that to the team and getting them organized. His decision-making continues to be great late in games,” Utah coach Will Hardy said.

            Jordan Clarkson scored seven of his 23 points in the final 1:39 and Walker Kessler added 17 points, 14 rebounds and matched a career best with seven blocked shots for Utah, which has won five of its last seven games.

            “(Kessler) got seven blocks tonight and I don’t know how many more he affected. Guys just stopped going in on him at some point,” Markkanen said.

            Siakam scored 21 before fouling out, Gary Trent Jr. had 20 points and the Raptors stayed in the game with a season-high with 25 offensive rebounds.

            “Obviously you saw a lot of those rebounds were off our own misses,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “I thought we had some really good chances down there that we didn’t finish and those led out to some transition 3s.”

            Kessler had NBA season-best six blocked shots in the first quarter, tying the franchise record that Mark Eaton set on Feb. 18, 1989, against San Antonio. Eaton had six blocks in both the second and fourth quarter and 14 overall in that game.

            VanVleet had his first career triple-double last season (37 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds) against the Jazz on Jan. 7.

            The Jazz, at times, showed their youth — failing to box out for rebounds, turning the ball over and slow getting back on defense, which led to 28 fast-break points for Toronto. 

            Malik Beasley had four 3s and all 14 of his points in the first half as the Jazz led by as many as 14 points. The Raptors cut it to 65-60 at the break, thanks to 15 points off Utah’s 11 turnovers. Toronto had just two giveaways and 15 offensive rebounds in the same span.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798006,Biden approval steady after document discovery: AP-NORC Poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — More U.S. adults disapprove than approve of the way President Joe Biden has handled the discovery of classified documents at his home and former office, a new poll shows, but that seems to have had little impact on his overall approval rating. 

            The new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 41% of Americans say they approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, about the same as the 43% who said that in December. In the new poll, 77% of Democrats approve of how Biden is handling his job, while 91% of Republicans disapprove, both little changed since late last year.

            Biden, who will address a joint session of Congress in his State of the Union address next week, needs all the support he can muster as he strategizes his expected reelection campaign, and has been working to focus voters on his agenda and big legislative wins instead of the documents flap. 











            Biden's attorneys discovered classified items in a locked closet in November, as they cleared out his office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank where he briefly worked after he left government. The records were turned over to Justice Department officials. The discovery touched off a special counsel investigation and additional documents have turned up at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, in searches by his lawyers and by the FBI. Agents also searched Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and his former office at the Penn Biden Center. 

            More people disapprove than approve of his handling of situation since the classified documents were found, 39% to 23%, Another 36% say they neither approve nor disapprove. Democrats are more likely to approve than disapprove, 44% to 15%, with 40% saying they have no opinion either way.

            A majority of Republicans, 68%, say they disapprove, with 6% saying they approve and 24% expressing no opinion either way. Republicans are also somewhat more likely than Democrats to say they’ve heard at least some about the situation, 71% to 63%.

            “To me, it seems like he’s doing the right things, and this happens, people have these documents, Trump and now Mike Pence, too,” said Candace Porth, 72, of Phoenix, a Biden supporter. “It happens. I think people who are supportive of Biden, they understand.” 

            In follow-up interviews, some poll respondents said they distinguish between Biden voluntarily turning over documents and the behavior of former President Donald Trump, who refused to hand over hundreds of documents, prompting the FBI to raid his home. Still, many are troubled that leaders can't seem to properly handle sensitive information. 

            “I feel like it is a big problem in general,"" said Jenifer Hudgins, 36, of Gadsden, Alabama, a Democrat who voted for Biden. “I do not feel like any official should have classified documents in their possession, especially at personal residences. It does make you wonder why they have these documents at their residences.” 

            
                Trump is facing a special counsel investigation into his retention of several hundred classified documents and other government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida — and his resistance to giving them up, which led to an FBI warrant and nighttime search to seize them last August.

            Banty Patel, a 46-year-old Republican from New Brunswick, New Jersey, said it seems like the same problem to him, but Trump and Biden are being treated very differently.

            “I think it looks worse for Joe Biden. He went on the news and said he’d always comply with the FBI and then later they discovered he had documents, too.” 

            Most Americans have paid at least some attention to the ongoing investigation into classified documents, but they’re not necessarily following it closely. The poll shows that 28% say they’ve read or heard a lot about the situation, while another 35% say they’ve heard some about it but not a lot. An additional 37% say they’ve heard little or nothing about it.

            On Wednesday, the FBI searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, but did not find any classified documents there, according to his personal attorney. The Bidens purchased that home, which overlooks a state park adjacent to the beach, in June 2017, months after he left the vice presidency.

            Agents did take some handwritten notes and other materials relating to Biden’s time as vice president for review, just as they did last month when they searched his Wilmington home, where they also found classified items. 

            Biden has said he was surprised by the initial discovery of the documents. His lawyers have described his mishandling of the documents as a “mistake.” 

            The administration’s public response has been marked by delayed and incomplete information. There are many unanswered questions — on what information the documents contained, exactly how many were discovered and why Biden had them in his possession. Nonetheless, Biden’s attorneys and officials in the White House counsel’s office insist they are being as transparent as possible with the public. 

            “I am more favorable to Biden than Trump, but I think none of this should be in private hands, it is not correct. They should be kept in government buildings,” said Memduh Can, 45, of Falls Church, Virginia, who said he was an independent who voted for Biden. “For me, though, the most important thing is the economy. If it is managed well, the country will be more secure.”

            The poll of 1,068 adults was conducted Jan. 26-30 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.WASHINGTON (AP) — More U.S. adults disapprove than approve of the way President Joe Biden has handled the discovery of classified documents at his home and former office, a new poll shows, but that seems to have had little impact on his overall approval rating.The new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 41% of Americans say they approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, about the same as the 43% who said that in December. In the new poll, 77% of Democrats approve of how Biden is handling his job, while 91% of Republicans disapprove, both little changed since late last year.Biden, who will address a joint session of Congress in his State of the Union address next week, needs all the support he can muster as he strategizes his expected reelection campaign, and has been working to focus voters on his agenda and big legislative wins instead of the documents flap.Biden's attorneys discovered classified items in a locked closet in November, as they cleared out his office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank where he briefly worked after he left government. The records were turned over to Justice Department officials. The discovery touched off a special counsel investigation and additional documents have turned up at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, in searches by his lawyers and by the FBI. Agents also searched Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and his former office at the Penn Biden Center.More people disapprove than approve of his handling of situation since the classified documents were found, 39% to 23%, Another 36% say they neither approve nor disapprove. Democrats are more likely to approve than disapprove, 44% to 15%, with 40% saying they have no opinion either way.A majority of Republicans, 68%, say they disapprove, with 6% saying they approve and 24% expressing no opinion either way.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798007,"Biden, Black caucus agree on path forward on police reform","WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of the Congressional Black Caucus left a meeting Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris with an agreement on how to address the issue of policing in America after the recent killing of Tyre Nichols.

            “We have agreement on how we will continue to work forward both from a legislative standpoint as well as executive and community-based solutions, but the focus will always be on public safety,” Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, the chairman of the Black Caucus, told reporters later Thursday. 

            Also at the White House were Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Cory Booker of New Jersey — two of the three Black senators — and Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Joe Neguse of Colorado.











            The group of Black lawmakers did not disclose details about the agreement made in the room but said there will be more information about the “legislative package” in the days ahead. 

            “This is going to require all of us, including Republicans, to get across the finish line,” Horsford said. 

            Before the meeting began, Biden said his hope was that “this dark memory spurs some action that we’ve all been fighting for.”

            At Nichols' funeral Wednesday in Memphis, Tennessee, Harris said the White House would settle for nothing less than ambitious legislation to address police brutality. 

            “We should not delay. And we will not be denied,"" Harris said. ""It is nonnegotiable.”

            Bipartisan efforts in Congress to reach an agreement on policing legislation stalled more than a year ago, and Biden ended up signing an executive order named for George Floyd, whose murder at the hands of Minneapolis police set off nationwide protests nearly three years ago.

            Even some political allies of Biden are frustrated with what they view as his excess caution on the issue.

            “I think the president is missing the opportunity to be a historic president when it comes to the social issues that continue to plague our country,"" said Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. “That’s what we need.”

            Bowman described Biden as “a champion of the status quo in many ways” and said Biden needs to be “a champion of a new vision for America.”

            The solution, Bowman said, is not “thoughts and prayers, come to the State of the Union after your kid gets killed,"" a reference to Nichols' mother and stepfather being invited to attend next week's speech. 

            Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he was in touch with the White House last Friday, when video of Nichols' beating became public, about whether the situation could be a catalyst to “get things moving again.”

            His organization, the nation's largest police union, had participated in previous attempts to reach a bipartisan deal, and Pasco said “we welcome any constructive effort to help us do our jobs better.” The union's president, Patrick Yoes, has condemned Nichols' killing and said that “our entire country needs to see justice done — swiftly and surely.""

            Pasco said “we’re kind of in a wait-and-see mode right now,"" with Republicans recently regaining control of the House, making legislative progress much harder. “You’ve got to look at the political realities here,” he said. 

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Thursday signaled an openness to discussing the issue. 

            South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the sole Black Republican senator, said resurrecting the previous Democratic bill is a “nonstarter.” He has implored Democrats to put aside “tribalism” in order to strike a deal.

            “I’ve been working toward common ground solutions that actually have a shot at passing,"" Scott said. ""Solutions to increase funding and training to make sure only the best wear the badge.”

            Biden has embraced calls for overhauling how police do their jobs while also emphasizing his longtime support for law enforcement and rejecting proposals to cut money. He was elected with strong support from Black voters and is now preparing a reelection campaign for 2024.

            Harris, a former prosecutor and the first person of color to serve as vice president, has faced scrutiny for her approach to police issues. 

            Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said he was encouraged that Harris attended the funeral. ""This is what people expect, that you’ll be there for them at a time of need,"" he said. 

            Now, Morial said, “we need a substantive response, not a political response where they say, ‘Let’s just pass something.’”

            
                Biden's executive order was the product of negotiations among civil rights leaders and law enforcement organizations. It mostly focuses on federal agencies by requiring them to review and revise policies on the use of force. The administration is also encouraging local departments to participate in a database to track police misconduct. 

            But steps such as making it easier to sue officers for misconduct allegations have remained elusive. And the White House made it clear Thursday that no executive action taken by the president can substitute for federal legislation.

            “We haven’t gotten even a fraction of the changes that are necessary,"" said Rashad Robinson, president of the activist group Color of Change. ""We haven’t gotten the kind of structural change to policing that is required.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798008,"After bitter RNC meeting, Democrats look to project unity","WASHINGTON (AP) — A week after bitter divisions dominated a national Republican gathering, Democrats holding their own meeting are eager to showcase just how much they agree on.

            There will be no party chair fight since Jaime Harrison isn’t up for reelection until 2025. There is no candidate jostling for a White House bid since President Joe Biden is expected to seek a second term. And there is no national reckoning after a surprisingly strong midterm showing.

            The only real point of contention for the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting in Philadelphia this weekend is a proposed overhaul of the 2024 presidential primary calendar, which has angered top party leaders in New Hampshire. But even that is largely moot since Biden isn’t expected to face a major challenge for the nomination.











            The DNC on Saturday is expected to approve a new lineup for the party's presidential primaries, deferring to Biden, who has championed South Carolina's primary opening voting on Feb. 3. New Hampshire and Nevada would jointly follow three days later, on Feb. 6, with Georgia coming next on Feb. 13 and Michigan two weeks after that.

            The president has argued that replacing the party's leadoff caucuses in Iowa, a majority white state, with a presidential primary in South Carolina, where nearly 27% of the population is Black, would empower the voters of color whom Democrats rely on but have taken for granted. 

            The party is solidly behind Biden seeking a second term despite his being the oldest president in U.S. history and revelations that he may have mishandled official documents. Unity remains its mantra after Republicans took 15 ballots last month just to elect a House speaker, with GOP members nearly coming to blows on the House floor.

            “We’re fending off a Republican House that’s crazy and actually defending our gains from the first years. So it just doesn’t make sense to be saber-rattling right now about a future race when we’re all just sort of in the fight together,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, rather than Biden, in Democrats' 2020 presidential primary. 

            Warren, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other major 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, say they expect Biden to run again and will support him when he makes a bid official.

            Sanders is instead urging the DNC to ban accepting funding from super PACs and other outside political groups during future Democratic primaries. That's an idea some Democratic elders have opposed, arguing that Republican candidates will continue to accept such financial support and that their party shouldn't ""unilaterally disarm."" 

            Still, most top progressive organizations and grassroots activist groups have also shied away from suggesting Biden could face a major primary challenge. President Jimmy Carter's loss to Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election followed a strong primary challenge from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.

            Harrison, who rose to national prominence with an unsuccessful 2020 bid against South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, will remain chair until after next year's presidential race. That's in stark contrast to Ronna McDaniel, who won another term as head of the Republican National Committee during a contentious meeting last week in California. Members openly questioned the GOP's midterm performance and former President Donald Trump's continued hold on the party. 

            Harrison teared up during a December party rules committee meeting when Democrats' new primary calendar was first approved and predicts he may get emotional again this weekend. He recalled going to vote with his grandfather before his death in 2004 and how the U.S. Constitution once counted his Black ancestors in South Carolina as three-fifths of a person.

            “They didn’t always think I was a whole man in this state,"" Harrison remembered his grandfather saying, before urging him, “Never let anyone tell you that you don’t matter.” 

            “That this president would step into the tradition of the Democratic Party — go into Iowa, go into New Hampshire to say, you know what, it is now time that we elevate the voices of people like my grandfather, like my grandmother, to allow them to get a say in determining who should be president of the United States,” Harrison added. “For me, I was emotional because of that.”

            But the new lineup has its detractors. New Hampshire, already a general election battleground state, has a law that mandates holding the nation's first presidential primary, which Iowa only circumvented with its caucus. Its Democrats have joined with top state Republicans in vowing to hold the nation's first presidential primary next year regardless of the DNC calendar. 

            That raises the possibility that, if Biden were to bypass a rogue New Hampshire primary, he could lose the state to a challenger who campaigns there unopposed.

            Such a scenario may trigger “potential embarrassment"" for Biden that creates “an opening for an insurgent candidate — serious or not — who can garner media attention and capitalize on Granite Staters' anger about being passed over,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley wrote to the DNC rules committee. 

            DNC rules committee member Joanne Dowdell of New Hampshire seized on the same theme, noting, ""This is not how any of us would like to kick off a reelection campaign."" 

            That's unlikely to keep the DNC from approving the new primary calendar. But the proposal has drawn some opposition beyond New Hampshire. 

            Matt Hughes, a DNC member who is second vice chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party, was the first signature on a letter released Thursday to DNC members from local officials in his state, as well as Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.

            It urged the party to choose the first primary state from a competitive state like those four — arguing that doing so would allow Democrats to concentrate campaign resources on areas that are more competitive in the general election than deeply Republican South Carolina. 

            Hughes said such calls shouldn't be seen as defying Biden. Instead, he said, the party having an incumbent president who won't face primary opposition is the perfect time to make changes that shape future cycles. 

            “What we should be thinking about is absolutely the long-term impact. In 2024, it makes a lot of sense. This is relatively low impact,"" Hughes said. ""This is the perfect opportunity to talk about the lineup of states without regard to possible candidates in the field, who benefits and who losses.”WASHINGTON (AP) — A week after bitter divisions dominated a national Republican gathering, Democrats holding their own meeting are eager to showcase just how much they agree on.There will be no party chair fight since Jaime Harrison isn’t up for reelection until 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798010,"AP sources: Dylan Moore, Mariners agree to nearly $8.9M deal","SEATTLE (AP) — Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners have agreed to a three-year contract worth $8,875,000, avoiding a salary arbitration hearing, two people familiar with the deal told The Associated Press.

            The people spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday night because the agreement, first reported by ESPN, had not been announced.

            Moore had asked for a raise from $1.35 million to $2.25 million, and the Mariners had offered $1.9 million when proposed arbitration figures were exchanged on Jan. 13.











            The 30-year-old utilityman would have been eligible for free agency after the 2024 World Series, but the new agreement pushes that back a year.

            Moore played every position except pitcher and catcher last year, including 39 games in right field, seven in center, 18 in left, two at third base, 26 at shortstop, 12 at second, eight at first and three at designated hitter.

            He is expected to play more second base this season, sharing time with Kolten Wong, and also is likely to spell J.P. Crawford at shortstop. 

            Moore was selected by Texas in the seventh round of the 2015 amateur draft, traded to Atlanta a year later and then released by the Braves in March 2018. He signed with Milwaukee, was released at the end of the season and then signed with Seattle that November.

            Moore made his big league debut in March 2019 when Seattle played Oakland in Tokyo.

            He hit .224 with six homers and 24 RBIs last year, down from 12 homers, 43 RBIs and a .181 batting average in 2021. Moore is a .208 career hitter with 35 homers and 112 RBIs.

            Seattle defeated Diego Castillo on Wednesday in the first salary arbitration decision this year, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000. 

            Outfielder Teoscar Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto, also remains on track for a hearing. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and Seattle offered $14 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798012,House GOP votes to oust Democrat Omar from major committee,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led House voted after raucous debate Thursday to oust Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar from the chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee, citing her anti-Israel comments, in a dramatic response to Democrats last session booting far-right GOP lawmakers over incendiary remarks.

            House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was able to solidify Republicans to take action against the Somali-born Muslim in the new Congress although some GOP lawmakers had expressed reservations. Removal of lawmakers from House committees was essentially unprecedented until the Democratic ousters two years ago of hard-right Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona.

            The 218-211 vote, along party lines, came after a heated, voices-raised debate in which Democrats accused the GOP of going after Omar based on her race. Omar, who has apologized for 2019 remarks widely seen as antisemitic, defended herself on the House floor, asking if anyone was surprised she was being targeted. Democratic colleagues hugged her during the vote.











            “My voice will get louder and stronger, and my leadership will be celebrated around the world, as it has been,” Omar said in a closing speech. 

            House Republicans focused on six statements she has made that “under the totality of the circumstances, disqualify her from serving on the Committee of Foreign Affairs,” said Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, the incoming chairman of the House Ethics Committee.

            “All members, both Republicans and Democrats alike who seek to serve on Foreign Affairs, should be held to the highest standard of conduct due to the international sensitivity and national security concerns under the jurisdiction of this committee,” Guest said.

            Republicans have clashed with Omar since she arrived in Congress, and former President Donald Trump frequently taunted her at his rallies in ways that appealed to his supporters.

            The resolution proposed by Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former official in the Trump administration, declared, “Omar’s comments have brought dishonor to the House of Representatives.” 

            Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Omar has at times “made mistakes"" and used antisemitic tropes that were condemned by House Democrats four years ago. But that's not what Thursday's vote was about, he said.

            “It’s about political revenge,"" Jeffries said.

            Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., went further, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attack as she called the GOP's action part of one of the “disgusting legacies after 9/11, the targeting and racism against Muslim-Americans throughout the United States of America. And this is an extension of that legacy.""

            She added, “This is about targeting women of color.""

            McCarthy denied the Republican decision to oust Omar was a tit-for-tat after the Greene and Gosar removals under Democrats, though he had warned in late 2021 that such a response might be expected if Republicans won back the House majority. 

            “This is nothing like the last Congress,"" he said Thursday. He noted that Omar can remain on other panels, just not Foreign Affairs, after her anti-Israel comments.

            Omar is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. She is also the first to wear a hijab in the House chamber after floor rules were changed to allow members to wear head coverings for religious reasons.

            She quickly generated controversy after joining Congress in 2019 with a pair of tweets that suggested lawmakers who supported Israel were motivated by money.

            In the first, she criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” she wrote, invoking slang about $100 bills.

            Asked on Twitter who she thought was paying members of Congress to support Israel, Omar responded, “AIPAC!”

            Omar's remarks sparked a public rebuke from then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats who made clear that she had overstepped.

            She soon apologized.

            “We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me about my identity,” Omar tweeted. “This is why I unequivocally apologize.”

            Also, in a May 2021 tweet, she made reference to Israel as “an apartheid state” over its treatment of Palestinians. 

            Democrats rallied Thursday in a fiery defense of Omar and the experiences she brings to the Congress. 

            “This clearly isn’t about what Ilhan Omar said as much as who she is — being a smart, outspoken Black woman of the Muslim faith is apparently the issue,"" said Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. 

            Black, Latino and progressive lawmakers in particular spoke of her unique voice in the House and criticized Republicans for what they called a racist attack.

            “Racist gaslighting,” said Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo. A “revenge resolution,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chair of the progressive caucus.

            “It’s so painful to watch,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who joined Congress with Omar as the first two female Muslims elected to the House.

            “To Congresswoman Omar, I am so sorry that our country is failing you today through this chamber,” Tlaib said through tears. “You belong on that committee.”

            In the weeks leading up to the vote, the chairman of the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, argued for excluding Omar from the panel during a recent closed-door meeting with fellow Republicans.

            “It’s just that her worldview of Israel is so diametrically opposed to the committee’s,” McCaul told reporters in describing his stance. “I don’t mind having differences of opinion, but this goes beyond that.”

            At the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of the ouster, “It’s a political stunt.”

            
                McCarthy has already blocked Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both California Democrats, from rejoining the House Intelligence Committee once the GOP took control of the chamber in January. While appointments to the intelligence panel are the prerogative of the speaker, the action on Omar required a House vote.

            Several Republicans skeptical of removing Omar wanted “due process” for lawmakers who face removal. McCarthy said he told them he would work with Democrats on creating a due process system, but acknowledged it’s still a work in progress. One Republican, Rep. David Joyce of Ohio, voted present.

            In the last Congress, several Republicans had joined Democrats in removing Greene and Gosar from their committees. 

            Before being elected to Congress in 2020, Greene made many remarks that drew rebuke. In an online video, she said former Pelosi was a “traitor” to the country, noting “it’s a crime punishable by death.""

            Greene questioned the veracity of mass shootings, and in a 2018 video she talked about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, referring to a “so-called” plane that crashed into the Pentagon. She suggested a massive 2018 fire in California could have been caused by lasers or a collection of forces, including banks controlled by the Rothschild family, who are Jewish.

            The House moved swiftly in February 2021 to remove Greene from both her committees. Greene sought to dissociate herself from her “words of the past.” In a floor speech at the time, she told colleagues she believed the 9/11 attacks and mass school shootings were real and no longer believed QAnon conspiracy theories. 

            Gosar faced a rare vote of House censure and removal from his committees in November 2021 after he posted a video depicting him killing fellow lawmaker Ocasio-Cortez with a knife.

            Amid the criticism, Gosar deleted the tweet, but he retweeted the video shortly after the evening vote.

            In the new Congress, McCarthy allowed both Greene and Gosar to join House committees.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798013,NATO chief warns of severe consequences if China tries to change Taiwan Strait status quo,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — NATO’s secretary general has said that any attempt by China to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait will cause severe consequences for regional and global security.Speaking to Nikkei Asia in Tokyo on Wednesday (Feb. 1,) NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said China’s threats against Taiwan have “no justification” and that a conflict around Taiwan would be detrimental to all. The comments came on the same day as a speech Stoltenberg gave at Keio University announced a plan to step up NATO-Japan cooperation in cyber security, technology, and defense.President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said Taiwan would strengthen cooperation with Japan, in December last year. Stoltenberg said that he believes Beijing is watching the war in Ukraine closely and may base future decisions on the way NATO responds to the conflict.He added that last year’s NATO summit in Madrid marked the first time China was addressed in the security alliance’s “Strategic Concept.”“Beijing is substantially building up its military forces, including nuclear weapons, without any transparency. It is attempting to assert control over the South China Sea, and threatening Taiwan.”“We don't regard China as an adversary and we don't seek confrontation with China, actually, we don't see confrontation with anyone. NATO is a defensive alliance. We will continue to engage with China on issues where we see common or potential common interest, on arms control, on climate change and other issues,” Stoltenberg said.“At the same time, we will be remiss if we did not expose the challenges that China poses to our security, to our values and to our interests. And that is exactly what is also reflected in the New Strategic Concept that we agreed last year.”Stoltenberg said that China’s “assertive behavior, not least in the South China Sea,” and the threats against Taiwan, are important issues for both regional security and for NATO countries.“This idea that we can say that China doesn't matter for NATO is wrong, it doesn't work. Security is global, security is not regional,” he said.",2023/2/2,2115,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798023,"'A big deal': US, Philippines tighten military ties","MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines said Thursday it was allowing U.S. forces to broaden their footprint in the Southeast Asian nation, the latest Biden administration move strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan.

            Thursday's agreement, which gives U.S. forces access to four more military camps, was announced during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. He has led efforts to reinforce regional security partnerships and update the arming and positioning of American and allied forces in Asia in the face of China’s increasing military strength and its assertiveness regarding its claims to Taiwan and in the South China Sea.

             “It's a big deal,” Austin said at a news conference, while noting the agreement did not mean the reestablishment of permanent American bases in the Philippines.











            In a televised news conference with his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez Jr., Austin gave assurances of U.S. military support and said the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which obligates the U.S. and the Philippines to help defend each other in major conflicts, “applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, public vessels or aircraft anywhere in the South China Sea.”

            “We discussed concrete actions to address destabilizing activities in the waters,” Austin said. “This is part of our effort to modernize our alliance, and these efforts are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea.”

            American leaders have long sought to reorient U.S. foreign policy to better reflect the rise of China as a significant military and economic competitor, as well as to better deal with the lasting threat from North Korea. 

            The tensions between China and Taiwan will be high on the agenda next week when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to meet with China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang.

            China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory — to be taken by force if necessary. Beijing responded to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan last summer by sending warships, bombers, fighter jets and support aircraft into airspace near the island on a near-daily basis, sparking concerns of a potential blockade or military action.

            The announcement from the Philippines follows Austin's announcement with South Korean leaders Tuesday that the U.S. would be sending more fighter jets and bombers, and his Jan. 11 declaration with Japanese counterparts that the U.S. would be shifting its deployment there to make for a more nimble fighting force. There have been other announcements from the Biden administration on arms, exercises and pacts, including a 2021 decision to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. 

            China's threat to international order was “unprecedented,” U.S. and Japanese diplomats and defense chiefs said after that deal. “This behavior is of serious concern to the alliance and the entire international community, and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.”

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswomen Mao Ning said the U.S. military's strengthening in the region was escalating tensions and risking peace and stability. “Regional countries need to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the U.S.,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing.

            U.S. and Philippine officials also said that “substantial” progress has been made in projects at five Philippine military bases, where U.S. military personnel were earlier granted access by Filipino officials. Construction of American facilities at those bases has been underway for years but has been hampered by unspecified local issues.

            China and the Philippines, along with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan, have been locked in increasingly tense territorial disputes over the busy and resource-rich South China Sea. Washington lays no claims to the strategic waters but has deployed its warships and fighter and surveillance aircraft for patrols that it says promote freedom of navigation and the rule of law but have infuriated Beijing.

            Austin thanked President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whom he briefly met in Manila, for allowing the U.S. military to broaden its presence in the Philippines, Washington’s oldest treaty ally in Asia.

            “I have always said that it seems to me that the future of the Philippines and for that matter the Asia-Pacific will always have to involve the United States simply because those partnerships are so strong,” Marcos told Austin.

            A few dozen leftist activities held a noisy protest Thursday and set a mock U.S. flag ablaze outside the main military camp where Austin held talks with his Philippine counterpart. While the two countries are allies, leftist groups and nationalists have resented and often protested boisterously against the U.S. military presence in this former American colony.

            The country used to host two of the largest U.S. Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland. The bases were shut down in the early 1990s after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension, but American forces later returned for large-scale combat exercises with Filipino troops.

            The Philippine Constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreign troops and their involvement in local combat. The countries' Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement allows visiting American forces to stay indefinitely in rotating batches in barracks and other buildings they construct within designated Philippine camps with their defense equipment, except nuclear weapons.

            Galvez, the Philippine defense chief, declined to give the location of the four additional camps, saying that announcement would come after talks with surrounding communities.

            Philippine military and defense officials said in November the U.S. had sought access to five more local military camps mostly in the northern Philippine region of Luzon.

            Two of the camps where the U.S. wanted to gain access are in Cagayan province near Luzon island’s northern tip, across a sea border from Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait and southern China. Other camps are along the country’s western coast, including in the provinces of Palawan and Zambales, which face the disputed South China Sea.

            Austin is the latest high-ranking American official to travel to the Philippines after Vice President Kamala Harris visited in November, in a sign of warming ties after a strained period under Marcos’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.

            Duterte had nurtured cozy ties with China and Russia and at one point threatened to sever relations with Washington, eject American forces and abrogate the Visiting Forces Agreement that allows thousands of American forces to come each year for large-scale combat exercises.

            “I am confident that we will continue to work together to defend our shared values of freedom, democracy and human dignity,” Austin said. “As you heard me say before, the United States and the Philippines are more than just allies. We’re family.”

            Knickmeyer reported from Washington. Associated Press journalists Joeal Calupitan in Manila and Kiko Rosario in Bangkok contributed to this report.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines said Thursday it was allowing U.S. forces to broaden their footprint in the Southeast Asian nation, the latest Biden administration move strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan.Thursday's agreement, which gives U.S. forces access to four more military camps, was announced during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. He has led efforts to reinforce regional security partnerships and update the arming and positioning of American and allied forces in Asia in the face of China’s increasing military strength and its assertiveness regarding its claims to Taiwan and in the South China Sea.“It's a big deal,” Austin said at a news conference, while noting the agreement did not mean the reestablishment of permanent American bases in the Philippines.In a televised news conference with his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez Jr., Austin gave assurances of U.S. military support and said the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which obligates the U.S. and the Philippines to help defend each other in major conflicts, “applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, public vessels or aircraft anywhere in the South China Sea.”“We discussed concrete actions to address destabilizing activities in the waters,” Austin said. “This is part of our effort to modernize our alliance, and these efforts are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea.”American leaders have long sought to reorient U.S. foreign policy to better reflect the rise of China as a significant military and economic competitor, as well as to better deal with the lasting threat from North Korea.The tensions between China and Taiwan will be high on the agenda next week when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to meet with China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory — to be taken by force if necessary. Beijing responded to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan last summer by sending warships, bombers, fighter jets and support aircraft into airspace near the island on a near-daily basis, sparking concerns of a potential blockade or military action.The announcement from the Philippines follows Austin's announcement with South Korean leaders Tuesday that the U.S. would be sending more fighter jets and bombers, and his Jan. 11 declaration with Japanese counterparts that the U.S. would be shifting its deployment there to make for a more nimble fighting force. There have been other announcements from the Biden administration on arms, exercises and pacts, including a 2021 decision to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.China's threat to international order was “unprecedented,” U.S. and Japanese diplomats and defense chiefs said after that deal. “This behavior is of serious concern to the alliance and the entire international community, and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswomen Mao Ning said the U.S. military's strengthening in the region was escalating tensions and risking peace and stability. “Regional countries need to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the U.S.,” Mao told reporters at a daily briefing.U.S. and Philippine officials also said that “substantial” progress has been made in projects at five Philippine military bases, where U.S. military personnel were earlier granted access by Filipino officials.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798027,Asian shares trade mixed ahead of US jobs report,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were trading mixed Friday ahead of a closely watched U.S. jobs report that may affect global interest rates.

            Weaker than expected earnings reports from U.S. technology companies, announced after Wall Street trading ended, pulled Chinese benchmarks lower. 

            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.4% in early trading to 27,515.13. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.4% to 7,538.80. South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,482.08. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.9% to 21,552.19, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 1.4% to 3,240.64. 











            Economists expect the U.S. jobs report to show a slowdown in hiring. The job market has largely remained resilient despite big rate hikes by the Federal Reserve over the last year.

            Big tech companies have announced high-profile layoffs recently, but a report on Thursday suggested job cuts are not that widespread. Fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, and the number dropped to its lowest level since April. 

            “The key risk event will be today’s U.S. jobs reports, where the pace of payroll additions is expected to cool again, while the unemployment rate is likely to have risen slightly,” said Anderson Alves at ActivTrades.

            On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rallied 1.5% to 4,179.76 a day after hitting its best level since August. The Nasdaq composite soared 3.3% to 12,200.82, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged because it has less of an emphasis on tech. It slipped 0.1% to 34,053.94. 

            
                Meta helped lead the way with a 23.3% leap after it reported better revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected and said it expects to spend less this year than earlier forecast. Its profit fell short of expectations but Facebook's parent also announced a program to buy back $40 billion of its stock.

            Stocks have gained since the year began on hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon pause interest rate hikes. Such increases help stamp out inflation but also hurt the economy and investment prices.

            “The market is saying the Fed may have its cake and eat it, too: inflation falling and growth not falling off a cliff so far,” said Ella Hoxha, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. 

            She said the market seems to be putting a 75% probability on the Fed engineering a “soft landing” for the economy, where inflation can drop from its soaring heights without sending the economy into a painful recession. 

            Among the Big Tech earnings reports that came after trading closed were Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which had jumped more than 7%, while Apple rose 3.7%. 

            They tumbled back in afterhours trading after releasing disappointing results. The stocks are among the biggest by value so their movements carry outsized sway. 

            The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.40% from 3.42% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, held at 4.10%. 

            In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 9 cents to $75.78 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 9 cents to $82.08 a barrel.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798028,Pakistan arrests prominent political ally of ex-PM Khan,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani police arrested a prominent political figure in an overnight raid on his home near Islamabad days after he accused the former president of the country of plotting to kill ex-prime minister Imran Khan, officials said Thursday.

            The latest government move is likely to deepen political turmoil at a time when the government is facing one of its worst economic crises and is in talks to convince the International Monetary Fund to revive a $6 billion bailout.

            Police are expected to bring Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who served as interior minister in Khan's government, before a judge to get permission to question him for any evidence supporting his allegation against former President Asif Ali Zardari.











            Islamabad police confirmed the arrest, saying Ahmed, who is the president of his small Awami Muslim League party, was in custody. Ahmed is a staunch critic of the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif.

            Ahmed’s nephew, Rashid Shafiq, told reporters that dozens of police officers forcibly entered his uncle’s house on the outskirts of Islamabad before dawn and arrested him, although Ahmed had already obtained a protective bail.

            Police say Ahmed's arrest came after a complaint from Inayat-ur Rehman, a senior politician from Zardari’s Pakistan People’s Party. Rehman told police that Ahmed was inciting people to violence by levelling a serious allegation against Zardari.

            Khan has accused Zardari of plotting to kill him by hiring an assassin from an unnamed military group. Zardari denies that and has said he will sue Khan. 

            Ahmed’s arrest comes days after police in Lahore detained a senior leader from Khan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf Party, Fawad Chaudhry, on charges of threatening the chief of the elections board and other officials. 

            Chaudhry was released on bail on orders from the court the previous day.

            Shortly after Ahmed’s arrest, Khan took to Twitter to denounce his arrest.

            Footage released later by Ahmed’s supporters showed police taking Ahmed to a hospital for medical examination, as officers alleged that the man was drunk when arrested. Speaking to reporters at an Islamabad hospital, Ahmed denied the charge.

            The arrest of Ahmed was a setback to Khan, who retains a robust grassroots following after he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He now leads the opposition. 

            Meanwhile, police also arrested a TV anchorperson, Imran Riaz Khan, in Lahore. It was unclear on what charges he was taken into custody. Riaz Khan is not related to the ex-premier, but he is one of his staunch supporters in the electronic media. Months ago, police had said that they were seeking his arrest for hate speech against the country's institutions.

            A former cricket star-turned-Islamist politician, Khan was wounded in a gun attack while leading a rally toward Islamabad last November. One of Khan’s supporters was killed and several others were wounded in the shooting. Since then, Khan has been leading an antigovernment campaign from his home in Lahore, the capital in the eastern Punjab province. He wants the government to agree to a snap vote. The government has rejected that demand, saying the elections will be held on time later this year.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani police arrested a prominent political figure in an overnight raid on his home near Islamabad days after he accused the former president of the country of plotting to kill ex-prime minister Imran Khan, officials said Thursday.The latest government move is likely to deepen political turmoil at a time when the government is facing one of its worst economic crises and is in talks to convince the International Monetary Fund to revive a $6 billion bailout.Police are expected to bring Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who served as interior minister in Khan's government, before a judge to get permission to question him for any evidence supporting his allegation against former President Asif Ali Zardari.Islamabad police confirmed the arrest, saying Ahmed, who is the president of his small Awami Muslim League party, was in custody.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798029,Sony CFO to lead entertainment-electronic giant as president,"TOKYO (AP) — Sony appointed a veteran executive as its president Thursday to lead the Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate through changing times, and reported a decline in its profit in the last quarter. 

            Hiroki Totoki, Sony's chief financial officer, will become its president and COO, Sony Corp. said in a statement.

            Kenichiro Yoshida remains chairman and chief executive, signaling continuity at the Tokyo-based maker of PlayStation game machines, Bravia TVs and Spider-Man movies. 











            Also Thursday, Sony reported a 6% decline in net profit for the October-December quarter, at 326.8 billion yen ($2.5 billion). That was down from 346 billion yen a year earlier, as profitability in its financial services was countered by losses in its Pictures division. Quarterly sales grew 13% to 3 trillion yen ($23 billion).

            Yoshida proposed the executive change last year to strengthen Sony’s management across its diverse operations. It won unanimous board approval Thursday.

            Sony, for decades synonymous with Japan’s technological prowess, brought mobile entertainment to the world with the music-on-the-move Walkman more than four decades ago. In recent years it been faulted for struggling to coordinate its sprawling operations spanning financial services to video games and music to digital cameras and robot dogs. 

            Totoki said he will try to live up to the challenge of leading the iconic company.

            “I would like to create a positive spiral that begins with Sony being chosen by customers, which then energizes our employees, enables us to attract more new talent, increases our corporate value, and ultimately enables us to give back to society,” he said. 

            The games division has faced headwinds lately, but its new HBO series “The Last of Us,” for instance, is proving popular and is expected to boost sales in coming months. 

            Sony is forecasting an 870 billion yen ($6.8 billion) profit on 11.5 trillion yen ($89 billion) sales for the fiscal year that ends in March. The latest projection is an improvement over last year's. But expected profit still falls short of the 882 billion yen Sony recorded in the previous fiscal year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798030,"Murray scores 21 points, Hawks roll past Suns 132-100","PHOENIX (AP) — Trae Young rose up for a 3-pointer in the second half that left his hands way too hard, hurtling toward the basket before slamming off the backboard and through the hoop.

            Atlanta's star guard shrugged and ran back down the court with a sheepish grin.

            Things were going the Hawks way Wednesday night, leading to a blowout victory. Dejounte Murray scored 21 points, Young added 20 points and 12 assists and Atlanta rolled past the Phoenix Suns 132-100.











            The Hawks had lost four of five games coming into Wednesday's game, but played much better on both ends of the floor.

            “We wanted to win really bad and knew it had to start on the defensive end,” Murray said. “The defense took care of the offense.”

            The Hawks never trailed, jumping to a 9-4 lead with three 3-pointers. Atlanta never let up, pushing to a 102-67 advantage by the end of the third quarter and leading by 43 points in the fourth.

            Just about everyone was hitting shots for the Hawks, who made 52 of 91 shots (57.1%), including 19 of 33 (57.6%) on 3-pointers. Bogdan Bogdanovic added 18 points off the bench.

            “When you're getting downhill, moving the ball, sharing the ball, things like that can happen,” Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. “I thought tonight we did a good job moving the ball and getting it to the open man.”

            Phoenix — with star guard Devin Booker close to returning from a groin injury — lost for just the second time in eight games. The Suns were sloppy with 16 turnovers that turned into 31 points for the Hawks and had a dismal shooting night, hitting just 4 of 28 (14.3%) shots from 3-point range.

            “They were a lot faster then us especially in transition and we just couldn’t make a shot for whatever reason,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. 

            Mikal Bridges led the Suns with 23 points but shot just 6 of 18 from the field, including 1 of 7 on 3s. Deandre Ayton added 20 points and nine rebounds.

            “It felt like we were on a treadmill,” Ayton said. “It felt like we were hamsters running in one spot. The game was going too fast and we were making some points but not putting a dent into the lead.”

            The Hawks used a 13-0 run early in the second quarter to take a 66-47 lead into halftime. Murray led Atlanta with 15 points before the break while Bridges had 17 for the Suns.

            Phoenix shot just 18 of 47 (38.5%) in the first half, including 2 of 16 (12.5%) from 3-point range.

            SUNS SIGN LEE

            The Suns announced Wednesday that they've signed guard Saben Lee for the rest of the season.

            Lee has emerged as the team's backup point guard over the last three weeks after being signed to back-to-back 10-day contracts. He's filling in for Cam Payne, who remains out with a foot injury.

            To make room for Lee on the roster, the Suns released Duane Washington Jr., who played in 31 games this season, starting three. He averaged 7.9 points, but shot just 36.7% from the field.

            Lee had six points, three assists, three steaks and three rebounds in 21 minutes against the Hawks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798059,Taiwan's Tsai welcomes retired US admiral for China talks,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday welcomed the former head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, who had warned the island could face an invasion from China this decade, as the mainland ramps up pressure on the self-governing island. 

            Retired Adm. Phil Davidson, along with a group including colleagues from the U.S. think tank the National Bureau of Asian Research, arrived Monday in the capital Taipei following a string of delegate visits to Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, since tensions with the mainland spiked in August with the visit of then-U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 

            “I’m here to listen and learn from our hosts; thus far, I’ve done both,” he said. “I'm looking forward to continuing our discussions with President Tsai today and hearing her perspectives on the security environment and her outlook on U.S.-Taiwan relations.”











            China’s People’s Liberation Army has stepped up its pressure on Taiwan in the past few years, sending navy vessels and fighter planes near the island.

            Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that 20 Chinese aircraft crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait — a long-time unofficial buffer zone between the sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949. It sent 14 other planes in nearby airspace.

            A day later, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said 17 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line Wednesday, with a total of 23 planes sent to fly around the island.

            “Faced with the expansion of authoritarianism, Taiwan must strengthen our ability to defend ourselves,” she said, pointing to the upcoming extension of mandatory military service that she had just announced in December.

            Tsai thanked Davidson on Thursday for his contributions to the “safety of the Taiwan Straits.”

            Davidson, while still serving as the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, had warned that China's claims over Taiwan were a rising and tangible threat. 

            “Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before then, and I think the threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” he told the Senate Armed Forces Committee in 2021. 

            He clarified this remark while in Japan just before his visit to Taiwan, saying that the scenario would not necessarily be an all-out war. 

            “In my mind, that can be many lesser things than an all-out invasion. One of those would be the threats to outer islands, and I think it’s a grave security concern of Taiwan’s,” he told the Japan Times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798060,Phil’s Groundhog Day prediction: 6 more weeks of winter,"PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) — A furry critter in a western Pennsylvania town has predicted six more weeks of winter during an annual Groundhog Day celebration.

            People gathered Thursday at Gobbler’s Knob as members of Punxsutawney Phil’s “inner circle” summoned the groundhog from his tree stump at dawn to learn if he has seen his shadow — and they say he did. According to folklore, if he sees his shadow there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn’t, spring comes early.

            The “inner circle” is a group of local dignitaries who are responsible for planning the events, as well as feeding and caring for Phil himself.











            The annual event in Punxsutawney, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, originated from a German legend about a furry rodent. The gathering annually attracts thousands.

            The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration compared Punxsutawney Phil’s forecast to the national weather the last 10 years and found “on average, Phil has gotten it right 40% of the time.”

            This year, Phil's prediction came during a week when a mess of ice, sleet and snow has lingered across much of the southern U.S.

            According to records dating back to 1887, Phil has predicted winter more than 100 times. Ten years were lost because no records were kept, organizers said.

            The 2021 and 2022 forecasts also called for six more weeks of winter.

            While Punxsutawney Phil may be the most famous groundhog seer, he’s certainly not the only one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798061,"Inside the hunt for a serial kidnapper, and a bloody finale","SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Police in rural southwest Oregon were on high alert: A man with a history of kidnapping and torturing women in two states was on the run in their territory. 

            When a tip came in from a cab company that had given him a ride, they went house-to-house to check on residents. Peering through a window of one home, they found a gruesome scene: the bodies of two men who had been beaten to death.

            The discovery Tuesday near Grants Pass, Oregon, was a bloody link in a chain of dramatic events that ended hours later with the suicide of the wanted man, 36-year-old bartender Benjamin Obadiah Foster. The finale, played out on a normally quiet residential street in Grants Pass, marked an end to the largest manhunt in the state in recent memory and brought relief to terrified residents in the region of forested mountains.











            Authorities in Grants Pass say none of this would have happened if authorities in Nevada hadn't been so quick just over a year ago to release Foster from prison, where he was serving time for holding his then-girlfriend in Las Vegas captive for two weeks and torturing her. And a Grants Pass woman would not now be in a hospital, comatose and in critical condition, they say.

            It's “extremely troubling,” Grants Pass Police Chief Warren Hensman said.

            In the 2019 incident in Las Vegas, Foster broke seven of his girlfriend's ribs, gave her two black eyes, choked her to the point of unconsciousness and forced her to eat lye before she managed to escape, authorities said. Foster already had a suspended jail sentence on a concealed-weapons charge and was awaiting trial in another domestic violence case.

            In a plea deal with prosecutors, Foster was sentenced to one to 2 1/2 years. He was set free on Oct. 21, 2021, the same day he was transferred to a Nevada state prison because he had already served 729 days in jail for the crimes before he was sentenced, according to a Nevada corrections official.

            Fifteen months later, Foster was living in Oregon and in a relationship with the Grants Pass woman. On Jan. 24, her friend grew concerned because she hadn't been seen for several days. The friend went to the woman's house, where she was found bound and beaten to unconsciousness.

            The case rattled the town of 40,000, which has seen high unemployment and poverty rates and public safety layoffs with the decline of the timber industry. Law enforcement authorities said they were bringing all their resources to bear to find Foster.

            On Jan. 26, police, sheriff’s deputies, an Oregon State Police SWAT team and federal agents carried out a raid in Wolf Creek, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Grants Pass, after receiving word Foster was there. Agents seized his car, but Foster had vanished. 

            The next day, police announced that Foster was using dating apps to find people who could help him avoid the police or find new victims. Authorities offered a $2,500 reward for Foster and set up a tip line.

            Then, a major break in the case. One of the tips came from a cab company saying a man had requested a taxi from Sunny Valley, just south of Wolf Creek, Hensman said Wednesday. 

            Police went around checking homes Tuesday in Sunny Valley, to ensure residents hadn't been harmed. But in one house, they found the bodies of Richard Lee Barron Jr. and Donald Owen Griffith, who were killed sometime between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, according to Oregon State Police Capt. Kyle Kennedy. 

            “It’s a brutal scene, unfortunately, that we’re processing,” Kennedy said Wednesday, adding that police firmly believe Foster had killed the men, who lived together. Barron, age 73, and Griffith, who was 64, apparently didn't know Foster.

            Several items were taken from the house, including the men's dog. On Tuesday, Foster was spotted in Grants Pass — with the dog. Police rushed to the neighborhood, the same one where Foster's girlfriend had been found.

            The officers, carrying rifles and using an armored personnel carrier, massed outside the house. Area residents were told to shelter in place.

            “While we’re deploying teams to secure the residence, we also have to take into account what this man just did: He brutally murdered two innocents in Sunny Valley, and we didn’t know when he was going to stop,” Hensman said.

            Associated Press writers Rio Yamat in Las Vegas and Martha Bellisle in Seattle contributed to this report.SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Police in rural southwest Oregon were on high alert: A man with a history of kidnapping and torturing women in two states was on the run in their territory.When a tip came in from a cab company that had given him a ride, they went house-to-house to check on residents. Peering through a window of one home, they found a gruesome scene: the bodies of two men who had been beaten to death.The discovery Tuesday near Grants Pass, Oregon, was a bloody link in a chain of dramatic events that ended hours later with the suicide of the wanted man, 36-year-old bartender Benjamin Obadiah Foster. The finale, played out on a normally quiet residential street in Grants Pass, marked an end to the largest manhunt in the state in recent memory and brought relief to terrified residents in the region of forested mountains.Authorities in Grants Pass say none of this would have happened if authorities in Nevada hadn't been so quick just over a year ago to release Foster from prison, where he was serving time for holding his then-girlfriend in Las Vegas captive for two weeks and torturing her. And a Grants Pass woman would not now be in a hospital, comatose and in critical condition, they say.It's “extremely troubling,” Grants Pass Police Chief Warren Hensman said.In the 2019 incident in Las Vegas, Foster broke seven of his girlfriend's ribs, gave her two black eyes, choked her to the point of unconsciousness and forced her to eat lye before she managed to escape, authorities said. Foster already had a suspended jail sentence on a concealed-weapons charge and was awaiting trial in another domestic violence case.In a plea deal with prosecutors, Foster was sentenced to one to 2 1/2 years. He was set free on Oct. 21, 2021, the same day he was transferred to a Nevada state prison because he had already served 729 days in jail for the crimes before he was sentenced, according to a Nevada corrections official.Fifteen months later, Foster was living in Oregon and in a relationship with the Grants Pass woman. On Jan. 24, her friend grew concerned because she hadn't been seen for several days. The friend went to the woman's house, where she was found bound and beaten to unconsciousness.The case rattled the town of 40,000, which has seen high unemployment and poverty rates and public safety layoffs with the decline of the timber industry. Law enforcement authorities said they were bringing all their resources to bear to find Foster.On Jan. 26, police, sheriff’s deputies, an Oregon State Police SWAT team and federal agents carried out a raid in Wolf Creek, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Grants Pass, after receiving word Foster was there. Agents seized his car, but Foster had vanished.The next day, police announced that Foster was using dating apps to find people who could help him avoid the police or find new victims. Authorities offered a $2,500 reward for Foster and set up a tip line.Then, a major break in the case. One of the tips came from a cab company saying a man had requested a taxi from Sunny Valley, just south of Wolf Creek, Hensman said Wednesday.Police went around checking homes Tuesday in Sunny Valley, to ensure residents hadn't been harmed. But in one house, they found the bodies of Richard Lee Barron Jr. and Donald Owen Griffith, who were killed sometime between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, according to Oregon State Police Capt. Kyle Kennedy.“It’s a brutal scene, unfortunately, that we’re processing,” Kennedy said Wednesday, adding that police firmly believe Foster had killed the men, who lived together. Barron, age 73, and Griffith, who was 64, apparently didn't know Foster.Several items were taken from the house, including the men's dog. On Tuesday, Foster was spotted in Grants Pass — with the dog. Police rushed to the neighborhood, the same one where Foster's girlfriend had been found.The officers, carrying rifles and using an armored personnel carrier, massed outside the house. Area residents were told to shelter in place.“While we’re deploying teams to secure the residence, we also have to take into account what this man just did: He brutally murdered two innocents in Sunny Valley, and we didn’t know when he was going to stop,” Hensman said.Police searched the house, but didn't find anyone. Then they sent a sheriff’s department robot to a crawlspace and found signs that Foster was burrowed deep underneath the home. His presence was confirmed by a camera. The fugitive had water and other supplies stashed there, apparently in hopes he could wait out the police presence undetected.The officers expected a gunfight. Instead, Foster shot himself in the head, Hensman said. Police found Foster still breathing, unconscious and holding a .45-caliber pistol.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798063,"France seizes Iran assault rifles, missiles heading to Yemen","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — French naval forces in January seized thousands of assault rifles, machine guns and anti-tank missiles in the Gulf of Oman coming from Iran and heading to Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said Thursday.

            While Iran denied being involved, images of the weapons released by the U.S. military's Central Command showed them to be similar to others captured by American forces in other shipments tied to Tehran. 

            The announcement comes as Iran faces increasing Western pressure over its shipment of drones to arm Russia during its war on Ukraine, as well as for its violent monthslong crackdown targeting protesters. 











            Regional tensions also have heightened after a suspected Israeli drone attack on a military workshop in the central Iranian city of Isfahan on Saturday. Previous cycles of violence since the collapse of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers have seen the Islamic Republic launch retaliatory attacks at sea. 

            The seizure occurred Jan. 15 in the Gulf of Oman, a body of water that stretches from the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, through to the Arabian Sea and onto the Indian Ocean. CENTCOM described the interdiction as happening “along routes historically used to traffic weapons unlawfully from Iran to Yemen.”

            A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who took the country's capital in late 2014 and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the country's internationally recognized government since March 2015.

            The Wall Street Journal first reported on the seizure, identifying the forces involved as elite French special forces. Two officials with knowledge of the interdiction, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly on the operation's details, similarly identified the French as carrying out the seizure. 

            The French military did not respond to requests for comment about capturing the weapons. 

            Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani in an online message rejected the assessment Tehran supplied the weapons on the vessel and described the accusations as “politically motivated.” Iran's mission to the United Nations told the AP that Tehran ”adheres to the resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council related to Yemen.""

            While France maintains a naval base in Abu Dhabi, it typically takes a quieter approach in the region while maintaining a diplomatic presence in Iran. 

            Iran has long denied arming the Houthis, though Western nations, U.N. experts and others have traced weaponry ranging from night-vision scopes, rifles and missiles back to Tehran. In November, the U.S. Navy said it found 70 tons of a missile fuel component hidden among bags of fertilizer aboard a ship bound to Yemen from Iran. Houthi ballistic missile fire has targeted Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the past. 

            Images taken Wednesday by CENTCOM and analyzed by the AP, showed a variety of weapons on board an unidentified ship apparently docked at a port. The weapons appeared to include Chinese-made Type 56 rifles, Russian-made Molot AKS20Us and PKM-pattern machine guns. All have appeared in other seizures of weapons attributed to Iran. 

            CENTCOM said the seizure included more than 3,000 rifles and 578,000 rounds of ammunition. The released images also showed 23 container-launched anti-tank missiles, which also have turned up in other shipments tied to Iran.

            The war in Yemen has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. However, Saudi-led airstrikes haven't been recorded in Yemen since the kingdom began a cease-fire at the end of March 2022, according to the Yemen Data Project. 

            That cease-fire expired in October despite diplomatic efforts to renew it. That has led to fears the war could again escalate. More than 150,000 people have been killed in Yemen during the fighting, including over 14,500 civilians.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798084,"Targeting Iran, US tightens Iraq's dollar flow, causing pain","BAGHDAD (AP) — For months, the United States has restricted Iraq’s access to its own dollars, trying to stamp out what Iraqi officials describe as rampant money laundering that benefits Iran and Syria. Iraq is now feeling the crunch, with a drop in the value of its currency and public anger blowing back against the prime minister.

            The exchange rate for the Iraqi dinar has jumped to around 1,750 to the dollar at street exchanges in some parts of the country, compared to the official rate of 1,460 dinars to the dollar. 

            In Baghdad, exchange houses were closed on Thursday, while the Kurdistan Regional Government banned exchange companies in Sulaimaniyah from making transfers. 











            Mustafa Al-Karawi, a member of the parliamentary budget committee, told the state news agency that the Central Bank “must meet the requirements of the Federal Reserve to...reduce the scarcity of hard currency in the country."" He said new domestic procedures would be rolled out to improve access to currency, while a delegation of Iraqi officials will travel to the U.S. for negotiations next Friday.

            The devaluation has already sparked protests. If it persists, analysts said, it could challenge the mandate of the government formed in October after a yearlong political stalemate.

            The dinar’s deterioration comes even though Iraq’s foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high of around $100 billion, pumped up by spiking global oil prices that have brought increasing revenues to the petroleum-rich nation. 

            But accessing that money is a different story. 

            Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq’s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the United States' Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq’s supply of dollars. The Central Bank of Iraq requests dollars from the Fed and then sells them to commercial banks and exchange houses at the official exchange rate through a mechanism known as the “dollar auction.” 

            In the past, daily sales through the auction often exceeded $200 million per day.

            Ostensibly, the vast majority of the dollars sold in the auction are meant to go to purchases of goods imported by Iraqi companies, but the system has long been porous and easily abused, multiple Iraqi banking and political officials told The Associated Press. 

            U.S. officials confirmed to the AP that they suspected the system was used for money laundering but declined to comment in detail on the allegations or the new restrictions.

            For years, large quantities of dollars were transferred out of the country to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Lebanon through “gray market trading, using fake invoices for overpriced items,"" a financial adviser to the Iraqi prime minister said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 

            The inflated invoices were used to launder dollars, with most of them sent to Iran and Syria, which are under U.S. sanctions, leading to complaints from American officials, he said. 

            In other cases, the currency is smuggled across land borders under the protection of armed groups that take a cut of the cash, said Tamkeen Abd Sarhan al-Hasnawi, chairman of the board of Mosul Bank and first deputy of the Iraq Private Banks League. He estimated that as much as 80% of the dollars sold through the auction went to neighboring countries.

            “Syria, Turkey, and Iran used to benefit from the dollar auction in Iraq,” he said.

            A member of one of Iraq’s Iran-backed militias, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said the majority of Iraqi banks are owned indirectly by politicians and political parties that have also used the dollar auction to their benefit.

            Late last year, the Fed began imposing stricter measures. 

            Among other steps, at the request of the U.S., the Central Bank of Iraq started using an electronic system for transfers that required entering detailed information on the intended end-recipient of the requested dollars. One hundred Central Bank employees were trained by the Fed to implement the new system, the prime minister’s financial adviser said.

            “This system started rejecting transfers and invoices that used to be approved by the central bank,” he said. “Around 80% of transactions were being rejected.”

            The amount of dollars sold daily in the auction plummeted to $69.6 million on Jan. 31, from $257.8 million six months earlier, according to Central Bank records. Far fewer of the dollars are going toward buying imports as well, down to around 34% from 90%.

            Even when transactions are approved, it takes banks up to 15 days to get the funds rather than two or three days, Hasnawi said.

            Unable to get dollars at the official price through banks, he said, traders turned to the black market to buy dollars, causing the price to rise. 

            In November, the Central Bank of Iraq added four new banks to the list of those banned from dealing in dollars. Two U.S. officials confirmed that the Fed requested the four banks be blocked because of suspected money laundering. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the case.

            A spokesperson for the New York Fed declined to discuss the specific measures taken with regards to Iraq. But the Fed said in a statement that it enforces “a robust compliance regime” for the accounts it holds. The statement said that this regime “evolves over time in response to new information, which we gather in the regular course of monitoring transactions and events that may impact an account and in communication with other relevant U.S. government agencies.” 

            The system of keeping Iraq’s oil revenues at the Fed was originally imposed by U.N. Security Council resolutions after the 2003 ouster of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein by the U.S-led invasion. Later, Iraq chose to maintain the system to protect its revenues against potential lawsuits, particularly in connection to Iraq’s 1990s invasion of Kuwait. 

            The new U.S. restrictions come at a time of increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Negotiations over a nuclear deal are floundering. Washington has imposed new sanctions and condemned Iran for cracking down on protesters and providing drones for Russia to use in Ukraine.

            Also, in Iraq, allegations came to light in October that over $2.5 billion in Iraqi government revenue was embezzled by a network of businesses and officials from the country’s tax authority

            The case “brought (U.S.) attention to the scale of corruption in Iraq” and how the corruption can benefit Iran and other parties hostile to the U.S., said Harith Hasan, head of the Iraq unit at the Emirates Research Center, an Abu Dhabi-based think tank.

            The new Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who came to power via a coalition of Iranian-backed parties, does not have a strong relationship with the U.S. that could have enabled him to soften the implementation of the new financial measures, Hasan said.

            Al-Sudani has downplayed the current devaluation as “a temporary issue of trading and speculation.” He replaced the Central Bank governor and instituted measures intended to ensure a supply of dollars at the official rate.

            Al-Hasnawi said the government's recent measures will not stop the financial bleeding. If the current situation persists, he said, “within one year, most banks will declare bankruptcy” and there is likely to be mass civil unrest.

            “This U.S. pressure impacts the Iraqi street in a clear manner, and we do not see clear solutions until now,” he said.

The Central Bank of Iraq requests dollars from the Fed and then sells them to commercial banks and exchange houses at the official exchange rate through a mechanism known as the “dollar auction.”In the past, daily sales through the auction often exceeded $200 million per day.Ostensibly, the vast majority of the dollars sold in the auction are meant to go to purchases of goods imported by Iraqi companies, but the system has long been porous and easily abused, multiple Iraqi banking and political officials told The Associated Press.U.S. officials confirmed to the AP that they suspected the system was used for money laundering but declined to comment in detail on the allegations or the new restrictions.For years, large quantities of dollars were transferred out of the country to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Lebanon through “gray market trading, using fake invoices for overpriced items,"" a financial adviser to the Iraqi prime minister said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The inflated invoices were used to launder dollars, with most of them sent to Iran and Syria, which are under U.S. sanctions, leading to complaints from American officials, he said.In other cases, the currency is smuggled across land borders under the protection of armed groups that take a cut of the cash, said Tamkeen Abd Sarhan al-Hasnawi, chairman of the board of Mosul Bank and first deputy of the Iraq Private Banks League. He estimated that as much as 80% of the dollars sold through the auction went to neighboring countries.“Syria, Turkey, and Iran used to benefit from the dollar auction in Iraq,” he said.A member of one of Iraq’s Iran-backed militias, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said the majority of Iraqi banks are owned indirectly by politicians and political parties that have also used the dollar auction to their benefit.Late last year, the Fed began imposing stricter measures.Among other steps, at the request of the U.S., the Central Bank of Iraq started using an electronic system for transfers that required entering detailed information on the intended end-recipient of the requested dollars. One hundred Central Bank employees were trained by the Fed to implement the new system, the prime minister’s financial adviser said.“This system started rejecting transfers and invoices that used to be approved by the central bank,” he said. “Around 80% of transactions were being rejected.”The amount of dollars sold daily in the auction plummeted to $69.6 million on Jan. 31, from $257.8 million six months earlier, according to Central Bank records. Far fewer of the dollars are going toward buying imports as well, down to around 34% from 90%.Even when transactions are approved, it takes banks up to 15 days to get the funds rather than two or three days, Hasnawi said.Unable to get dollars at the official price through banks, he said, traders turned to the black market to buy dollars, causing the price to rise.In November, the Central Bank of Iraq added four new banks to the list of those banned from dealing in dollars. Two U.S. officials confirmed that the Fed requested the four banks be blocked because of suspected money laundering. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the case.A spokesperson for the New York Fed declined to discuss the specific measures taken with regards to Iraq. But the Fed said in a statement that it enforces “a robust compliance regime” for the accounts it holds. The statement said that this regime “evolves over time in response to new information, which we gather in the regular course of monitoring transactions and events that may impact an account and in communication with other relevant U.S. government agencies.”The system of keeping Iraq’s oil revenues at the Fed was originally imposed by U.N. Security Council resolutions after the 2003 ouster of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein by the U.S-led invasion. Later, Iraq chose to maintain the system to protect its revenues against potential lawsuits, particularly in connection to Iraq’s 1990s invasion of Kuwait.The new U.S. restrictions come at a time of increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Negotiations over a nuclear deal are floundering. Washington has imposed new sanctions and condemned Iran for cracking down on protesters and providing drones for Russia to use in Ukraine.Also, in Iraq, allegations came to light in October that over $2.5 billion in Iraqi government revenue was embezzled by a network of businesses and officials from the country’s tax authorityThe case “brought (U.S.) attention to the scale of corruption in Iraq” and how the corruption can benefit Iran and other parties hostile to the U.S., said Harith Hasan, head of the Iraq unit at the Emirates Research Center, an Abu Dhabi-based think tank.The new Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who came to power via a coalition of Iranian-backed parties, does not have a strong relationship with the U.S. that could have enabled him to soften the implementation of the new financial measures, Hasan said.Al-Sudani has downplayed the current devaluation as “a temporary issue of trading and speculation.” He replaced the Central Bank governor and instituted measures intended to ensure a supply of dollars at the official rate.Al-Hasnawi said the government's recent measures will not stop the financial bleeding. If the current situation persists, he said, “within one year, most banks will declare bankruptcy” and there is likely to be mass civil unrest.“This U.S. pressure impacts the Iraqi street in a clear manner, and we do not see clear solutions until now,” he said.____AP staff reporters Samya Kullab in Baghdad and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798086,Israeli settler population in West Bank surpasses 500K,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's West Bank settler population now makes up more than half a million people, a pro-settler group said Thursday, crossing a major threshold. Settler leaders predicted even faster population growth under Israel's new ultranationalist government.

            The report, by WestBankJewishPopulationStats.com and based on official figures, showed the settler population grew to 502,991 as of Jan. 1, rising more than 2.5% in 12 months and nearly 16% over the last five years. 

            “We’ve reached a huge hallmark,"" said Baruch Gordon, the director of the group and a resident of the Beit El settlement. “We’re here to stay.”











            The milestone comes as Israel’s new government, made up of ultranationalist parties who oppose Palestinian statehood, has placed expanding settlements at the top of its priority list. Already the government has pledged to legalize wildcat outposts that have long enjoyed tacit government support and to ramp up approval and construction of settler homes around the West Bank. 

            “I think that in the coming years of this government there will be more building than there has been in the last 20 years of governments,” Gordon said.

            Settlements have flourished under every Israeli government, including at the height of the peace process in the 1990s. Even Israel's short-lived previous government, which included parties supporting Palestinian statehood along with those opposing it, continued to build settlements. 

            The report also comes as a new spasm of violence is shaking the region and days after a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who pledged support for an independent Palestinian state. The settler population has continued to grow under the Biden administration, despite renewed American appeals to rein in construction following years of President Donald Trump's hands-off approach. 

            The settler population report does not include annexed east Jerusalem, home to more than 200,000 settlers. The West Bank and east Jerusalem are together home to some 3 million Palestinians.

            Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for an independent state. 

            Although Israel withdrew troops and several thousand settlers from Gaza in 2005, it has charged ahead with settlement building in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Dozens of settlements dot the territory, some as small as a few mobile homes and others sprawling cities, with malls and public transport of their own. 

            Much of the international community views the settlements as illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. The Palestinians see them as a land grab that undermines their chances to establish a viable, contiguous state.

            “All settlements are illegal. There is no legitimacy for settlements or the presence of settlers in the Palestinian territories,” said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. “The increase in the number of settlers is the result of Israeli government policies that do not believe in the two-state solution,” which would create an independent Palestinian state next to Israel.

            Israel claims the West Bank is disputed territory, rather than occupied, saying that terminology denies the Jewish people's historical presence in the land. It argues that the fate of settlements should be part of negotiations to bring about an end to the conflict. 

            Peace efforts have been moribund for nearly 15 years, while Israel continued to establish facts on the ground with more settlement construction and a Palestinian political rivalry complicated peacemaking.

            The settlers and their many supporters in government view the West Bank as the biblical and historical heartland of the Jewish people and are opposed to any partition.

            Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank live under a two-tiered legal system that grants settlers special status and applies much of Israeli law to them including the right to vote in Israeli elections and the ability to access certain public services. Palestinians live under Israeli military rule and they do not enjoy the legal rights and protections afforded to settlers.

            The open-ended military occupation has led three well-known human rights groups to conclude that Israel is committing the international crime of apartheid by systematically denying Palestinians equal rights. Israel rejects those accusations as an attack on its very existence as a Jewish-majority state and points to the achievements of its citizens of Palestinian origin to counter the argument.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798087,Florida could end unanimous jury requirement for executions,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers proposed legislation making it easier to send convicts to death row by eliminating a unanimous jury requirement in capital punishment sentencing — a response to anger from victims’ families following a verdict sparing a school shooter from execution.

            The proposal comes after a divided 9-3 jury spared Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz in November from capital punishment for killing 17 at the school in 2018. The Parkland school shooter instead received a life sentence. 

            The Cruz decision outraged many and is likely the catalyst for Florida's move to drop its unanimity requirement for capital punishment. 











            Republican legislators, at the governor’s urging, introduced legislation to allow the jury to choose the death penalty with only eight of the 12 jurors in favor, which would make Florida the only state to use that standard.

            Only three states out of the 27 that impose the death penalty do not require unanimity. Alabama allows a 10-2 decision and Missouri and Indiana let a judge decide when there is a divided jury.

            Tony Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina died in the massacre, said changing the requirement from unanimity to 8-4 would prevent “an activist juror from denying the victims’ families justice.”

            “The people subject to the death penalty are already convicted murderers, they are not people picked off the street,” Montalto said. 

            DeSantis, a Republican expected to launch a 2024 White House bid in the late spring or early summer, has not signed death warrants at the same rate as his predecessors, but said Cruz deserved capital punishment and he would have expedited Cruz’s execution if given the chance. 

            With Florida’s legislative session approaching, DeSantis advocated for the change as part of a larger criminal justice legislative package, described by the governor as a counter to the “soft on crime” policies in Democrat-led states. 

            “I don’t think justice was served in that case. If you’re going to have capital, you have to administer it to the worst of the worst crimes,” DeSantis said of the Cruz case, adding that it “should be the vast majority” of jurors for a death sentence. 

            DeSantis, who has leaned into issues that resonate with the conservative voters who typically decide GOP primary contests, has emerged as a fierce opponent of so-called “woke” policies on race, gender and public health and staunch backer of law-and-order policies to fight crime. He also has floated the idea of exploring ways to institute capital punishment for people convicted of sexually assaulting children.

            Republican legislative leaders in the GOP-dominated statehouse appear receptive to abolishing the unanimity requirement for capital juries and tend to carry out the governor’s agenda. The bills, filed by Republicans in the House and Senate, are expected to be taken up when Florida’s legislative session begins in March.

            For decades, Florida had not required unanimity in capital punishment, allowing a judge to impose capital punishment as long as a majority of jurors were in favor of the penalty. But in 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court threw out state law, saying it allowed judges too much discretion.

            The state Legislature then passed a bill requiring a 10-2 jury recommendation, but the state Supreme Court said such recommendations should be unanimous, prompting lawmakers in 2017 to require a unanimous jury. 

            Three years later, the state Supreme Court, with new conservative jurists appointed by DeSantis, rescinded its earlier decision and ruled that a death recommendation does not need to be unanimous. Florida’s unanimity standard has remained untouched, though there had been no overwhelming desire to change state law. 

            Republican state Senate President Kathleen Passidomo said she is open to revisiting Florida’s unanimous verdict requirement following the Cruz decision and the state Supreme Court ruling. She said she shared the shock many felt over the Cruz verdict. 

            “The looks on the faces of the victims’ families were heartbreaking. In my view, the case raises a number of issues related to Florida’s laws regarding sentencing in capital felonies, and I understand that many Floridians feel that justice was denied,” she said in a statement. 

            A database on the website of the anti-execution Death Penalty Information Center shows 1,558 people have been executed since the death penalty was reinstated in the mid-1970s, including 99 in Florida. National support for capital punishment has fallen in recent decades, with most polls finding between 50% and 60% of people now back the death penalty. 

            President Joe Biden campaigned on a pledge to work toward abolishing the death penalty but has not taken major action to end the practice. The U.S. Justice Department still presses for the death penalty in certain cases but has a moratorium in place, making federal executions unlikely. 

            Issuing a death sentence is a two-step process in Florida. 

            First, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt through a unanimous vote at least one of 16 aggravating factors under Florida law. Those include the murder of a law enforcement officer or government official; killings that are especially heinous, atrocious or cruel; the killing of a child under 12 years old; and murders that are cold, calculated and premeditated, or committed during an act that created a great risk of death to many people. 

            The change would impact the second step: under the current law, jurors also must unanimously agree the aggravating factors “outweigh” any mitigating circumstances the defense might offer, such as the killer’s mental health, intellect or upbringing. The proposals would change that burden to eight out of 12 jurors. 

            Richard Dieter, interim executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said it was understandable for people to be upset with the Cruz sentencing, but he took issue with the potential upending of the jury unanimity standard on the basis of the case. 

            “It’s a big deal sort of going back on something so fundamental as our jury system in the country. It’s not just changing from 9-3 to 10-2, that might not be a big deal, but doing away with unanimity, I think a lot of caution should be practiced in that change,” he said. “And in the sense that this is happening in response to one case is a concern.”TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798121,Bank of England rate hike says 'too soon to declare victory',"LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England announced another “forceful” increase in interest rates Thursday, saying it was too soon to declare victory against inflation that has slowed slightly but is still fueling a cost-of-living crisis, public-sector strikes and fears of recession.

            The bank raised its key rate by half a percentage point, to 4%, resisting the temptation to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in easing its response to the crisis. The British central bank has approved four straight increases of a half-point or more since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered sharp rises in food and energy prices.

            “We have done a lot on rates already … but it is too soon to declare victory just yet,” bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said at a news conference. “Inflationary pressures are still there … and we need to be absolutely sure that we really are turning the corner on inflation.”











            Even so, the bank moderated expectations for further rate increases, dropping suggestions that it would respond “forcefully"" to price pressures and implying that future moves would be smaller. Getting rid of that language was intentional and designed to send a signal to financial markets, Bailey said.

            Central bankers worldwide are struggling to balance competing economic demands as they try to rein in inflation, which erodes savings and increases costs for consumers and businesses, without unnecessarily hurting economies that are still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            The Federal Reserve has started tapering its response, boosting its key rate by just a quarter-point Wednesday. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, went big again Thursday, approving another half-point increase.

            Economists had previously suggested that the Bank of England's decision Thursday would be the last big rate increase after inflation slowed to 10.5% in December from a 41-year high of 11.1% two months earlier. 

            The bank said the outlook for Britain’s economy is better than it was three months ago, with a steep decline in natural gas prices expected to reduce the squeeze on consumers and investment.

            It expects inflation to fall sharply in the second half of this year and keep dropping to below the bank’s 2% target by June 2024.

            As a result, the bank says Britain is likely face a less severe recession than previously forecast, with the overall size of the economy shrinking less than 1% over the next two years. A recession is often defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity, though economists differ on how to measure it.

            “This is nevertheless a much shallower decline than expected"" in November, Bailey said. “The projected downturn in the economy, while still technically a recession by common definition, is now significantly milder than past recessions.”

            The International Monetary Fund said this week that the U.K. was on track to be the only major economy to shrink this year, even as the outlook for the rest of the world improves.

            Higher interest rates tend to crimp price rises because they increase the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other loans. But that also reduces demand for goods and services, slowing economic growth. The impact of rate hikes takes months to filter through into the wider economy, so policymakers have to make educated guesses about when to moderate their intervention.

            Bailey warned that further rate increases would be needed if inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected, adding that there was plenty of uncertainty around the bank’s forecasts.

            Of particular concern is the price of natural gas.

            
                Wholesale gas prices in Britain soared to record highs last year as Russian President Vladimir Putin curtailed supplies to Europe to punish the West for supporting Ukraine. While prices have dropped 75% from their peak in late August, predicting energy prices is notoriously difficult, especially as the war persists.

            The rise in energy bills has helped lead to the U.K.’s biggest drop in living standards since the 1950s. That has triggered a wave of strikes — including the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade on Wednesday — as nurses, train drivers, border guards and teachers demand pay increases that keep pace with inflation.

            The government has spent billions to help consumers and businesses hit by high energy costs this winter, which has squeezed public finances. Officials also are trying to prevent higher wages from causing a second round of domestically driven inflation that could be more difficult to tamp down.

            The central bank also highlighted concerns about a shortage of workers, which is feeding through into rising wages, and the impact higher interest rates may have on economic activity.

            “For now then, it looks like the Bank is erring on the side of caution when it comes to inflation, but that comes with the risk of pressuring businesses and consumers more than is necessary,’’ said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at financial services company AJ Bell.LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England announced another “forceful” increase in interest rates Thursday, saying it was too soon to declare victory against inflation that has slowed slightly but is still fueling a cost-of-living crisis, public-sector strikes and fears of recession.The bank raised its key rate by half a percentage point, to 4%, resisting the temptation to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in easing its response to the crisis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798122,"Iran blames Israel for drone attack, threatens retaliation","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran on Thursday blamed Israel for a drone attack that targeted a military workshop in its central city of Isfahan over the weekend, warning that it “reserves its legitimate and inherent right” to retaliate. 

            Iran's mission to the United Nations, in a letter it published on its website, attributed the attack , which happened late Saturday, to Israel. 

            “Early investigations suggest that the Israeli regime was responsible for this attempted act of aggression,” the letter signed by Iranian Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said. The letter did not elaborate on what evidence supported Iran's suspicion.











            Israeli officials declined to comment. However, Israel has carried out a series of attacks targeting Iran's nuclear program and other sites since the collapse of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as part of a yearslong shadow war between the Mideast rivals. 

            
                Details on the Isfahan attack, which happened around 11:30 p.m. Saturday, still remain scarce, days after the assault. A Defense Ministry statement said three drones were launched at the facility, with two of them successfully shot down. A third apparently made it through to strike the building, causing “minor damage” to its roof and wounding no one, the ministry said.

            Iran's state-run IRNA news agency later described the drones as “quadcopters equipped with bomblets.” Quadcopters, which get their name from having four rotors, typically operate from short ranges by remote control. Iranian state television later aired footage of debris from the drones, which resembled commercially available quadcopters.

            It remains unclear what the workshop produced. Iravani referred to it only as a ""a workshop complex of the Iranian Defense Ministry"" in his letter.

            Israel had been initially suspected as possibly being behind the attack. Iran’s Intelligence Ministry in July claimed to have broken up a plot to target sensitive sites around Isfahan. 

            A segment aired on Iranian state television in October included purported confessions by alleged members of Komala, a Kurdish opposition party that is exiled from Iran and now is based in Iraq, that they planned to target a military aerospace facility in Isfahan after being trained by Israel’s Mossad intelligence service. However, activists say Iran has aired hundreds of coerced confession on state TV over the last decade.

            Iravani's letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council warned that Tehran could respond to the attack.

            “The Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its legitimate and inherent right ... to defend its national security and respond resolutely to any threats or wrongful actions by the Israeli regime, wherever and whenever deemed necessary,” the letter read.

            Israeli officials rarely acknowledge operations carried out by the country’s secret military units or its Mossad intelligence agency. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently re-entered the premiership, has long considered Iran to be the biggest threat to his nation. 

            Iravani’s letter separately complained about Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who tweeted after the drone attack: ""Explosive night in Iran ... Ukraine had warned you.” Iran has supplied Russia with bomb-carrying drones that Moscow has used to target power plants and civilian sites in Ukraine in its war on the country. 

            Meanwhile Thursday, the head of Iran's civilian nuclear program disputed comments by the International Atomic Energy Agency over Iranian enrichment operations at Fordo. The facility sits under a mountain near the holy Shiite city of Qom, some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Tehran, and has long been a worry for the West — it was initially built in secret and with the likely ability to withstand airstrikes.

            The U.N. nuclear watchdog on Wednesday said its inspector conducted an unannounced visit to the underground facility and found two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges “interconnected in a way that was substantially different from the mode of operation declared by Iran to the agency in November last year.”

            The IAEA did not elaborate on what that meant, though the agency described it as “a substantial change.” Those cascades now enrich uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. 

            Responding the IAEA, Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran claimed the inspector had been wrong and clarified their remarks to the watchdog. 

            “During a visit to inspect what is done at Fordo, (the inspector) had an impression which was not correct and they immediately reported this to the IAEA in writing,” Eslami claimed. “We sent our senior safeguard representative along with that same inspector to Fordo again, and they realized that their understanding was not correct.”

            The IAEA said Thursday it stood by its earlier assessment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798123,Hong Kong woos tourists with air tickets and vouchers,"Hong Kong (AP) — Hong Kong will give away air tickets and vouchers to woo tourists back to the international financial hub, racing to catch up with other popular travel destinations in a fierce regional competition. 

            During the pandemic, the city largely aligned itself with mainland China’s “zero-COVID” strategy and has relaxed its entry rules months slower than rivals such as Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. Even after it reopened its border with mainland China in January, tourism recovery was sluggish.

            On Thursday, Chief Executive John Lee launched a tourism campaign “Hello Hong Kong,” saying the city will offer 500,000 free air tickets to welcome tourists from around the world in what he called “probably the world's biggest welcome ever”. 











            “Hong Kong is now seamlessly connected to the mainland of China and the whole international world and there will be no isolation, no quarantine,"" he said at a ceremony. “This is the perfect timing for tourists, business travelers, and investors from near and far to come and say, ‘Hello, Hong Kong.’” 

            Under the campaign, most of the plane tickets — worth 2 billion Hong Kong dollars ($255 million) — will come from three Hong Kong-based airlines through various promotional activities, including lucky draws, “buy one, get one free” promotions and games. The project will begin in March and last about six months, said Fred Lam, CEO of the Airport Authority.

            “We hope those who secure the air tickets can bring two or three more relatives and friends to the city. Although we are just giving away 500,000 air tickets, we believe this can help bring Hong Kong over 1.5 million visitors,” Lam said. 

            The airlines will distribute the tickets in phases, with the Southeast Asian markets set to benefit in the first stage, he said.

            An additional 80,000 air tickets will be given away to Hong Kong residents in the summer, Lam said. Those living in the Greater Bay Area will also benefit from the policy that offers over 700,000 tickets in total. The Greater Bay Area is a Chinese government initiative to link Hong Kong with neighboring mainland cities, including the technology and finance hub of Shenzhen and the manufacturing powerhouses of Dongguan and Foshan.

            Visitors can also enjoy special offers and vouchers among other incentives in the city, Lee said. 

            Hong Kong received 56 million visitors in 2019 — over seven times its population — before the pandemic began. But its strict COVID-19 restrictions have been keeping visitors away over the past three years, devastating the tourism sector and its economy. The city’s GDP last year fell 3.5 % from 2021, according to the government’s provisional data.

            In the past few months, it finally dropped its mandatory hotel quarantine rule and PCR tests for incoming travelers, resulting in a slight increase in arrival figures. Still, its 2022 visitor numbers were just 1% of the 2019 level.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798124,Sunak marks 100 days as UK prime minister as problems mount,"London (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has angry unions to the left of him, anxious Conservative Party lawmakers to the right and, in the middle, millions of voters he must win over to avert electoral defeat.

            It’s a daunting situation for Sunak, who on Thursday marks 100 days in office, more than twice the number of his ill-fated predecessor, Liz Truss. Installed as Conservative leader after Truss’ plan for huge tax cuts sparked panic, the 42-year-old Sunak calmed financial markets and averted economic meltdown after he assumed the post of prime minister on Oct. 25. 

            Next, Britain’s youngest leader for two centuries — and its first prime minister of South Asian heritage — has promised to tame soaring inflation, get the sluggish economy growing, ease pressure on the overburdened health care system and “restore the integrity back into politics” after years of scandals under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.











            Easier said than done.

            “The things that happened before I was prime minister, I can’t do anything about,” Sunak told a group of health workers this week. “What I think you can hold me to account for is how I deal with the things that arise on my watch.”

            Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, said Sunak had succeeded in overcoming the impression that the U.K. “had a completely lunatic government.”

            “You would chalk that up as the first thing that he had on his to-do list,” she said. “Otherwise, it’s slightly hard to see concrete achievements.”

            Sunak is a former U.K. Treasury chief, and his top priority has been the country's economic malaise. Gross domestic product remains smaller than it was before the coronavirus pandemic, and the International Monetary Fund forecast this week that the U.K. will be the only major economy to contract this year, shrinking by 0.6%. 

            Sunak blames global forces — disruption from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Critics say the elephant in the room is Brexit, which has led to a sharp reduction in trade between the U.K. and the European Union.

            Sunak, a longtime advocate of Britain’s departure from the bloc, insisted Wednesday that the cost-of-living crisis had “nothing to do with Brexit.”

            Whatever the causes, Sunak has little economic room to maneuver. Annual inflation hit a four-decade high of 11.1% in October and remained at a painful 10.5% in December. The U.K. is in the midst of its biggest wave of strikes in decades as nurses, paramedics, teachers, border agents and other workers seek pay increases to offset the soaring cost of living and the stresses of holding a job in an increasingly threadbare public sector.

            Meanwhile, a faction inside the Conservative Party is pushing for immediate tax cuts to encourage growth, despite the damage done by “Trussonomics” just months ago.

            “We need growth or our debts will get bigger,” lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, said this week. “Targeted tax reductions will help achieve that.”

            Sunak is resisting both labor unions and tax-cutting Tories. He argues that double-digit public sector pay raises would drive inflation even higher and that “the best tax cut right now is a cut in inflation.” 

            Economists say U.K. inflation will likely fall during 2023, allowing Sunak to meet one of his key pledges. Other goals are likely to be harder to achieve.

            He is seeking to improve relations with the 27-member EU, and both sides have made progress toward resolving a dispute over Northern Ireland trade rules that has burdened businesses and shuttered the regional government in Belfast.

            But any agreement will anger Conservative euroskeptics, who are likely to see rapprochement with Brussels as a betrayal of Brexit. A compromise also faces opposition from Northern Ireland’s British unionists, who say post-Brexit customs checks undermine Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.

            Sunak also has struggled to rid the Conservative Party of its reputation for scandal and sleaze. A member of his Cabinet, Gavin Williamson, quit in November over bullying claims. On Sunday, Sunak fired party chair Nadhim Zahawi for failing to come clean about a multimillion-dollar tax dispute. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab is being investigated over allegations he bullied civil servants, which he denies.

            The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, alleged Wednesday that Sunak was “too weak” to tackle bad behavior.

            U.K. voters haven't yet had their say on Sunak, who was chosen as party leader by the 357 Conservative members of Parliament. The government doesn't have to call a national election until late 2024, so Sunak may have time on his side.

            Or, he may not. The Conservatives are trailing 20 or more points behind Labour in opinion polls, and poor results in May's local elections could spur calls for another change of leader.

            Some Conservatives hanker for the return of Johnson, whose final words to Parliament as prime minister — “Hasta la vista, baby” — hinted at a comeback.

            Some analysts say it may be too late for any Conservative leader to avoid defeat. An Ipsos poll released this week, considered accurate to within 4 percentage points, found 66% of respondents wanted a change of governing party. Only 10% thought the Conservatives had done a good job.

            Steven Fielding, emeritus professor of politics at the University of Nottingham, likened the mood to the final years of Prime Minister John Major’s government, wiped away by Tony Blair's Labour election landslide in 1997 that ended 18 years of Conservative rule.

            “People are just waiting for them to go,” Fielding said. “And the longer they are there, the more irritated (voters) are with them.”

            He said Sunak “is trying his best. But people aren’t listening.”

            The plan permits the U.S. to deploy troops and military equipment to nine Philippine military bases, New York Times reported. This marks the first time in 30 years that the U.S. has had such a large military presence in the Southeast Asian nation.

            The decision is perceived by analysts as a move to counter China’s military expansion in the region.

            On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who is visiting Manila, said the U.S. and the Philippines are committed to strengthening their mutual capacities to resist armed attack, CNN reported.
“That’s just part of our efforts to modernize our alliance. And these efforts are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea,” CNN quoted him as saying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798163,Israeli AG: Netanyahu cannot be involved in legal overhaul,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's attorney general has told Benjamin Netanyahu that he must not be involved in an overhaul to the country's judicial system proposed by his government because it would amount to a conflict of interest over the prime minister's corruption trial, according to a letter made public Thursday. 

            Netanyahu's new far-right government has made changing the legal system a centerpiece of its legislative agenda and despite mounting public criticism, has charged ahead with steps to weaken the Supreme Court and grant politicians less judicial oversight in their policymaking.

            Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara's office also released her legal opinion concerning the proposed changes, and said they would deal “a serious blow to the system of checks and balances” in Israel's government, and would give the executive and legislature “broad and effectively unlimited authority.""











            Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving influential media moguls and wealthy associates. He denies wrongdoing. 

            “You must avoid as part of your role as prime minister involvement in initiatives related to the legal system,” Baharav-Miara wrote to Netanyahu in the letter, which was sent Wednesday. She said that meant Netanyahu could also not direct others to advance the plan.

            The letter included an opinion by Baharav-Miara’s deputy, saying the overhaul would “benefit the prime minister in terms of the administration of his trial.” It said the changes would allow the governing coalition to more easily advance legislation that could assist Netanyahu.

            The heads of the parties in Netanyahu's government said they “reject outright” the attorney general's stance, saying it was an attempt to thwart the legal changes.

            Amir Fuchs, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, said Baharav-Miara’s position won't affect the plan’s progress. He said the attorney general's position is binding, meaning Netanyahu won't be able to deal with the legal changes, and neither will any of his political appointees on his behalf. But ministers in his government should be able to, he said.

            The judicial overhaul was launched by the country’s justice minister, a close confidante of Netanyahu’s, and the Israeli leader has touted it as the right step for the country. 

            Asked about moves to alter the judiciary by a leader on trial in an interview with CNN this week, Netanyahu said “none of the reforms that we’re talking about…have anything to do with my trial.”

            Baharav-Miara's stance is only likely to deepen a rift in Israel over the power of the judiciary, which has roiled the country since the government took power later last year.

            The plan would allow a simple majority of the country's 120-seat parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions that deem laws unconstitutional. It would grant the government more power over the appointment of judges. And it would allow government ministers to ignore the advice of legal counselors and make the position less independent.

            Critics say the plan upends Israel's system of checks and balances and strips minorities of the ultimate protector of their rights, the Supreme Court. They say it grants politicians too much power and would be destructive to Israel's democratic fundamentals. The plan has faced widespread opposition, from top legal officials to economists and the country's robust tech sector to tens of thousands of ordinary Israelis who have come out to protest the move.

            The government says the plan is critical to streamlining governance and correcting an imbalance of power between the country's executive and judicial branches, which they say has made the courts too powerful.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's attorney general has told Benjamin Netanyahu that he must not be involved in an overhaul to the country's judicial system proposed by his government because it would amount to a conflict of interest over the prime minister's corruption trial, according to a letter made public Thursday.Netanyahu's new far-right government has made changing the legal system a centerpiece of its legislative agenda and despite mounting public criticism, has charged ahead with steps to weaken the Supreme Court and grant politicians less judicial oversight in their policymaking.Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara's office also released her legal opinion concerning the proposed changes, and said they would deal “a serious blow to the system of checks and balances” in Israel's government, and would give the executive and legislature “broad and effectively unlimited authority.""Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving influential media moguls and wealthy associates. He denies wrongdoing.“You must avoid as part of your role as prime minister involvement in initiatives related to the legal system,” Baharav-Miara wrote to Netanyahu in the letter, which was sent Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798164,India's Adani scraps $2.5B share sale after fraud claims,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian conglomerate Adani Enterprises called off its $2.5 billion share offering after it lost tens of billions of dollars in market value due to fraud claims by a U.S.-based short-selling firm.

            
                Billionaire Gautam Adani 's company said Thursday it will review its plans for raising capital after it canceled the share sale late Wednesday, citing “market volatility.”

            Adani stocks sank after Hindenburg Research, which has a track record of sending stock prices of its targets tumbling, accused the group of “brazen” stock market manipulation and accounting fraud, among other financial abuses.











            The share offering had drawn nearly 51 million bids, exceeding the 45.5 million offered to the public. It was seen as a crucial test of investor confidence in Adani, whose net worth had shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared.

            Adani made a vast fortune mining coal as energy-hungry India grew swiftly after its economy was liberalized in the 1990s. Adani companies operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. 

            By the time trading closed Thursday, Adani Enterprises was down by another 27% in a single day, following Wednesday's 30% drop. Stocks in six of Adani’s other listed companies sank between 5% and 10%.

            Overall, shares in Adani Enterprises have tumbled 54.5% since the Hindenburg report was published last week.

            In a video address Thursday, Adani said the decision to scrap the share offering was made “to insulate the investors from potential losses.”

            “For me, the interest of my investors is paramount and everything else is secondary,” he said.

            Adani Enterprises said in a statement that it would withdraw the transaction and return the money to its investors. The decision would not “have any impact on our existing operations and future plans,” it said, adding that the group’s balance sheet was “very healthy” with strong cashflows and secure assets.

            Hindenburg said it was betting against the group, accusing it of “pulling the largest con in corporate history.” It said it judged the seven key Adani listed companies to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”

            Most of the allegations involved concerns about the group’s debt levels, activities of top executives, use of offshore shell companies to artificially boost share prices and past investigations into fraud. It listed 88 questions for the group to answer.

            Adani Group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations, and called its report a “calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.” On Sunday, it issued a 413-page report that rejected its questions, saying none were “based on independent or journalistic fact finding.”

            Adani’s response included documents and data tables. It said the group has made all necessary regulatory disclosures and abided by local laws.

            India's parliament was adjourned Thursday for the first half of the day when the chair of the upper house rejected a request by opposition lawmakers to debate the allegations made by Hindenburg.

            India's federal government and its finance ministry have not commented on the Adani stock rout so far.

            Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the main opposition Congress party, told reporters opposition parties were demanding a discussion of public sector investments “in companies losing market value, endangering the hard-earned savings” of millions of Indians. The opposition parties were pushing for an investigation into the Adani Group by a parliamentary or a Supreme Court-appointed panel.

            The stock losses on Wednesday cost Adani his title as the richest man in Asia and in India. He slid from being the world’s third richest man to the 13th as his fortune plummeted to $72 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798165,Austria expels 4 Russian diplomats based in Vienna,"VIENNA (AP) — Austria's government said Thursday that it has ordered four Russian diplomats based in Vienna, including two at Moscow's mission to U.N. agencies in the city, to leave the country.

            The Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement that two diplomats at the Russian Embassy had “engaged in acts incompatible with their diplomatic status” and two at the permanent mission to the United Nations in Vienna “committed acts incompatible with the Headquarters Agreement.” It didn't elaborate.

            The diplomats were given a week to leave Austria.











            Western European nations and Russia have expelled each others' diplomats on several occasions since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started nearly a year ago.

            Austria, a European Union member that has a policy of military neutrality, was initially hesitant to take such action but expelled four Russian diplomats in April after pressure from the public and EU partners.

            An Austrian official with knowledge of the matter said that the diplomats currently being expelled are “higher ranking” than the ones who were sent back in April and had been involved in “technical intelligence gathering to the detriment of Austrian national security.”

            “Enough is enough,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

            Austria has given aid to Ukraine but not military equipment. President Alexander Van der Bellen was in Kyiv on Wednesday on a trip meant to underline Austria's solidarity.

            Vienna is home to U.N. agencies including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

            The Russian Foreign Ministry said it would respond in kind to the diplomats’ expulsion, according to state news agency Tass.

            Russia’s ambassador to Austria, Dmitry Lyubinsky, said in televised remarks that he and Mikhail Ulyanov, the ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, separately visited the Austrian Foreign Ministry late Wednesday to hear about the decision. 

            “We voiced a resolute protest, rejected the unfounded allegations and warned about the inevitability of retaliatory measures,” he said.

            Lyubinsky added that Austrian authorities failed to make specific accusations beyond “unfounded claims and vague references to the opinion of special services.” He said the decision would affect Austria's position “as a neutral international platform for negotiations.”VIENNA (AP) — Austria's government said Thursday that it has ordered four Russian diplomats based in Vienna, including two at Moscow's mission to U.N. agencies in the city, to leave the country.The Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement that two diplomats at the Russian Embassy had “engaged in acts incompatible with their diplomatic status” and two at the permanent mission to the United Nations in Vienna “committed acts incompatible with the Headquarters Agreement.” It didn't elaborate.The diplomats were given a week to leave Austria.Western European nations and Russia have expelled each others' diplomats on several occasions since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started nearly a year ago.Austria, a European Union member that has a policy of military neutrality, was initially hesitant to take such action but expelled four Russian diplomats in April after pressure from the public and EU partners.An Austrian official with knowledge of the matter said that the diplomats currently being expelled are “higher ranking” than the ones who were sent back in April and had been involved in “technical intelligence gathering to the detriment of Austrian national security.”“Enough is enough,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Austria has given aid to Ukraine but not military equipment.

The uptick in daily infections, with a doubling of cases compared to the previous week, was possibly the result of the reduced availability of medical care during the holidays, but nevertheless, the CECC said it still wanted to observe trends for a few days.Earlier in the week, Taiwan announced minor changes to be implemented from Feb. 7, including the end to requirements that arrivals from overseas take a rapid home COVID test before going outside, and that travelers from China were subjected to a saliva PCR test.",2023/2/2,7298,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798209,Humpback whales seen breaching off Taiwan's outlying island,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A family of humpback whales was seen breaching off the coast of Lanyu Island, also known as Orchid Island, on Wednesday afternoon (Feb. 1).Videos of the incident were shared to the Facebook Group “All Things About Lanyu” (蘭嶼大小事) by local resident Chou Chang-yuan (周長源), who was at Yeyin Village. He wrote, “For many years, dolphins and humpback whales have not visited waters around Lanyu. It is fortunate that this year, they are clearly visible by eye.”According to elders of the local Indigenous Tao people, when whales visit Lanyu, they bring with them many flying fish, Chou added. Fishing for flying fish is one of the most significant parts of Tao culture, and the flying fish season starts every year in February and ends in October.A tourist surnamed Lee (李), who traveled to Lanyu with his family, told Liberty Times that he saw the sight of whales breaching while touring a traditional Tao underground house. He said the whales were less than 20 meters away from shore.In response to the incident, the Ocean Conservation Administration wrote that this was the first time in two years that humpback whales have been sighted near Taiwan. In March 2021, a mother-calf pair was seen near Ludao, also known as Green Island.The administration urged those who encounter whales or dolphins to keep at a distance and refrain from disturbing them. Sightings can also be reported at the ocean conservation website, iOcean, for research purposes.",2023/2/2,1505,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798225,"Russia hits civilian targets anew, EU officials visit Kyiv","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian missiles hit residential areas in an eastern Ukrainian city Thursday for the second time in 24 hours, while top European Union officials held talks with the government in Kyiv as the war with Russia approaches its one-year milestone.

            The latest strikes in Kramatorsk came as rescue crews searched for survivors in the rubble of an apartment building hit late Wednesday by a Russian missile that killed at least three people and wounded 21 others. At least one more victim was thought to be under the debris, Ukraine’s presidential office said.

            “Kramatorsk again shattered by explosions — the Russians made two more rocket strikes,” regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post.











            He said at least five civilians were wounded in the latest strikes, which hit residential buildings as well as a children’s clinic and a school in the heart of the city. Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko urged residents to stay in shelters.

            Kramatorsk is a major hub for the Ukrainian military in the east.

            No further details of Thursday’s attack were immediately available.

            Russia has frequently struck apartment buildings during the war, causing civilian casualties, although the Kremlin has denied targeting residential structures.

            Russian shelling across Ukraine over the previous 24 hours killed at least eight civilians and wounded 29 others, the presidential office said. Along with the victims in Kramatorsk, the toll included four who died when a Russian mortar shell hit a basement where they were sheltering in the northeastern Chernihiv region.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of what officials described as a summit on Friday. The last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 — a few months before the war started on Feb. 24, 2022.

            Von der Leyen praised wartime Ukraine’s “brilliant application” for European Union membership, though Brussels officials note that Ukraine joining the 27-nation bloc is still a long way off.

            Ahead of possible membership, Von der Leyen said, the Commission is proposing that Kyiv “join key European programs — this will give Ukraine benefits close to those of EU membership in many areas.”

            EU assistance for Ukraine, she said, has reached 50 billion euros ($55 billion) since the start of Russia’s war.

            She said the EU plans to adopt a 10th package of sanctions again Russia before Feb. 24. Von der Leyen also announced that the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression in Ukraine would be set up in The Hague to coordinate the collection of evidence of war crimes.

            Von der Leyen, on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion, added that she was “comforted” by Ukraine’s anti-corruption drive. Stamping out endemic corruption is a key condition for joining the EU.

            Zelenskyy on Wednesday took aim at corrupt officials for the second time in the space of a week. Several high-ranking officials were dismissed.

            Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform in a country long gripped by graft. 

            The latest corruption allegations came as Western allies are channeling billions of dollars to help Kyiv fight Moscow’s forces and as the Ukrainian government is introducing reforms so it can potentially join the EU.

            Ukraine's government is keen to get more Western military aid, on top of the tanks pledged last week, as the warring sides are expected to launch new offensives once winter ends. Kyiv is now asking for fighter jets.

            Kyiv expects Russia to “attempt something” on the Feb. 24 anniversary, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told France’s BFM television. He stressed his government’s urgency on getting weapons without delay.

            “We are telling our partners that we too need to be ready as fast as possible,” he said in an interview late Wednesday.

            U.S. President Joe Biden has ruled out providing F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday during a trip to the Philippines that the focus of American aid is to increase Ukraine’s military capabilities by sending artillery, armor and air defense, and training Ukrainian troops.

            The U.S. is “focused on providing Ukraine the capability that it needs to be effective in its upcoming anticipated counteroffensive in the spring,” Austin said.

            “And so we’re doing everything we can to get them the capabilities that they need right now to be effective on the battlefield,” he said.

            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that strategy would backfire, by prompting Moscow to ensure that potential Russian targets were out of range.

            “The longer range the weapons supplied to the Kyiv regime, the farther we would need to push them away from the territories that are part of our country,” Lavrov said in an interview with Russian state media.

            He said Moscow would like to see the war end, but noted that the length of the conflict was less important than its desired outcome: to protect Russian territory and “people who want to remain part of the Russian culture,” reaffirming Moscow’s declared goal to defend Russian speakers in Ukraine.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin drew on national pride at a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in the World War II battle of Stalingrad as he sought to stiffen support at home for the fight in Ukraine, where the Kremlin’s forces have suffered some embarrassing setbacks in recent months.

            “The strength of the defenders of Stalingrad is the most important moral beacon for Russian soldiers,” he said in Volgograd, as Stalingrad was renamed in 1961. “All that defines Russia and makes us strong and confident in ourselves, the rightness of our cause and our victory.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798226,"Israel, Gaza militants exchange fire amid soaring tensions","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel struck targets in the Gaza Strip early Thursday hours after Palestinian militants fired a rocket at Israel, the military said, the latest in an uptick of violence in the region.

            Israeli aircraft struck a rocket production workshop in the Gaza Strip as well as a storage site used by a rocket production line. Late Wednesday, Israeli air defenses intercepted a rocket from Gaza, the army said. 

            There were no reports of casualties from the rocket or the airstrikes and later Thursday the violence appeared to have subsided.











            Also Thursday, Israeli media reported a 75-year-old man wounded in a Palestinian attack last year died from wounds sustained from the violence.

            The exchange further raised tensions during a particularly bloody period in the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which in recent days has seen a deadly military raid in the West Bank and and a fatal Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue. 

            Last week, Gaza militants and Israel broke months of cross-border calm by exchanging rockets and airstrikes after Israel killed 10 Palestinians, most of them militants, in a military operation in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin.

            The latest friction point appeared to be over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel on security charges. Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist and a senior member of the most right-wing government in Israel's history, has pledged even tougher treatment of the prisoners in recent days.

            Ben-Gvir said rockets from Gaza won’t stop him from implementing punitive policies against the prisoners. He called for an urgent Security Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue. 

            In Palestinian society, prisoners are generally revered as heroes, with virtually every Palestinian family having had members jailed by Israel on security charges over the course of the decades-long conflict. Several thousand are locked up at any given time, with charges ranging from stone-throwing to deadly attacks on Israelis.

            Israeli-Palestinian violence has spiked in recent days as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited with a call for calm. 

            Last week's army raid in the Jenin camp was followed by the shooting attack near the Jerusalem synagogue on Friday that killed seven and another Jerusalem shooting in which a 13-year-old Palestinian wounded two Israelis.

            Since then, Israel has approved a series of punitive steps against the Palestinians.

            The raids were sparked by a spate of Palestinian shooting attacks last spring. On Thursday, the death toll from those attacks rose to 20 after the 75-year-old man died following an extended stay in hospital. A total of 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks last year.

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem last year, making 2022 the deadliest year in those territories since 2004 according to a leading Israeli rights group.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel struck targets in the Gaza Strip early Thursday hours after Palestinian militants fired a rocket at Israel, the military said, the latest in an uptick of violence in the region.Israeli aircraft struck a rocket production workshop in the Gaza Strip as well as a storage site used by a rocket production line.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798227,Militant who killed 101 at Pakistan mosque wore uniform,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide bomber who killed 101 people this week at a mosque in northwestern Pakistan had disguised himself in police uniform and did not raise suspicion among the guards, the provincial police chief said Thursday.

            The bomber arrived pushing a motorcycle at the mosque, located inside a high-security police and government compound in the city of Peshawar, said the police chief, Moazzam Jah Ansari. 

            The bomber wore a police uniform and the guards at the site assumed he was a police officer — their colleague — and did not search him, Ansari added. 











            Police have identified the bomber, the police chief also said, and are close to arresting suspects who helped him carry out Monday's bombing, one of the deadliest ever in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 

            “We will avenge the martyrdom of each and every policeman,” Ansari told a news conference on Thursday, without providing more details. He pledged that all those responsible for the attack, including the mastermind and facilitators, will be arrested and punished under the law. 

            Pakistan’s defense and interior ministers in speeches to Parliament this week blamed the Pakistani Taliban, who maintain sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan, for orchestrating the bombing. The Pakistani Taliban, known by their acronym TTP, are a separate group but allied with the Afghan Taliban.

            Ansari said that most of the casualties — the explosion also left 225 wounded — were not caused by the detonation of the bomber's explosives but by the collapse of the roof of the 50-year-old Peshawar mosque. The force of the blast caused the roof, which was supported by outside walls but no pillars, to cave in. 

            Police also released footage, from police CCTV cameras, showing the suspected bomber, in police uniform, approaching the police compound pushing a motorcycle, giving the impression it had broken down. 

            “I admit that it was a security lapse and I take responsibility for it,” Ansari said. He did not offer to resign his post.

            On Wednesday, dozens of police officers in a rare move joined a peace march organized by the members of civil society groups in Peshawar, demanding better protection for police. 

            Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan accused the Pakistani Taliban and in speeches to Parliament, said the TTP planned the attack from neighboring Afghanistan. 

            Pakistan has demanded the Afghan Taliban to take action against the TTP. Initially a TTP commander claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing but hours later the group's chief spokesman distanced the TTP from the carnage, saying attacking mosques was not its policy. 

            Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s Taliban-appointed foreign minister urged Pakistani authorities to look domestically for the reasons behind violence in their country instead of blaming Afghanistan. 

            Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch appeared to dismiss the Afghan Taliban criticism. 

            “We take the loss of innocent lives very seriously and would expect our neighbors to do the same,” Baloch told a news conference Thursday. “Pakistan expects sincere cooperation"" from Afghanistan, he said.

            Pakistan, which is mostly Sunni Muslim, has seen a surge in militant attacks since November, when the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire with government forces. The violence has increased since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021.

            Late Thursday, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif's government reached out to his predecessor and now opposition leader, Imran Khan, inviting him and other opposition politician to a conference next Tuesday to discuss how to respond to the surge in militancy across the country. 

            There was no immediate response from Khan, who was ousted in a no-conference vote in Parliament in April last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798228,"European Central Bank hikes rates, vows 'we are not done'","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank chugged ahead with another outsized interest rate hike Thursday and vowed more will follow, underlining its drive to subdue inflation even as the economy slows and the U.S. Federal Reserve eases its pace of increases.

            The Frankfurt-based bank raised its key benchmarks by half a percentage point and said it intends to make a similar move in March. Policymakers are moving aggressively to choke off price spikes that have slowed from record highs but are still hurting households in the 20 countries that use the euro currency. 

            The bank, which also hiked by a half-point in December, “will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference. 











            “Now you will say, ‘Well, yes, but what about after March? Does that mean that you have reached the pinnacle or the peak?' she later added. “No, no, no, no. We know that we have ground to cover. We know that we are not done.""

            The Bank of England also went big Thursday with a half-point hike, but the Fed pulled back a day earlier, slowing to a quarter-point hike as central banks around the world reassess their approach to tackling price spikes that have started to slow.

            The ECB sent a “relatively determined message” with the “unusual” preannouncement of the March increase, said Nick Bennenbroek, international economist at Wells Fargo Economics. He expects the March hike would be followed by a quarter-point bump in May that would mark the peak for ECB rates. 

            Central banks can hold back economic growth if they go too far. With the ECB moving quickly, Lagarde acknowledged that “economic activity has slowed markedly"" since the middle of last year and it's expected to stay weak as demand slows worldwide and Russia's war in Ukraine raises uncertainty.

            The eurozone’s economy grew just 0.1% in the last three months of 2022.

            But Lagarde was optimistic overall, pointing to easing supply chain backups and Europe's natural gas supply becoming more secure after Russia cut off most flows to the continent.

            “The economy has proved more resilient than expected and should recover over the coming quarters,"" she said. 

            The ECB’s bigger moves compared to the Fed partly reflect a later start in rate hikes — it began in July, four months after the U.S. central bank made its first increase — and from lower levels. That means more ground to make up.

            ECB officials may have sought to underline their resolve after “many market participants did not entirely believe the bank’s determined stance,” said Michael Holstein, chief economist at DZ Bank. 

            Some market rates indicated traders were betting the ECB would reverse course later this year and next because of slumping growth. The bank appeared to warn against that by saying it would keep rates “restrictive over time” to contain inflation.

            Higher interest rates makes it more expensive for consumers to borrow for purchases like homes and cars and for companies to fund expansions. That is designed to cool demand for goods that push up consumer prices, which increased 8.5% in the eurozone last month from a year earlier. 

            While still high, the annual rate has dropped three months in a row after reaching a record of 10.6% in October.

            
                High energy prices tied to the war in Ukraine have driven up utility bills for households and businesses, which have passed on those extra costs to shoppers and diners. That’s been the major driver of European inflation, which is well above the ECB’s target of 2% considered best for the economy.

            Workers across continental Europe and in the United Kingdom have been holding strikes and protests to demand that their pay keep pace with the soaring cost of living.

            European governments have passed billions in relief to shield people from high natural gas prices, which have fallen from records last summer as Europe found suppliers outside Russia and warmer-than-expected winter weather curbed fears of shortages and rationing. But prices are still three times higher than when Russia massed troops on the border with Ukraine.

            “It is important to now start rolling these measures back promptly in line with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner,"" Lagarde said.

            While interest rate hikes are the usual cure for inflation, they also mean people are facing sharply higher mortgage rates to buy homes and banks that are becoming more restrictive with loans.

            ECB officials say decisive action now will prevent inflation from becoming ingrained in wages, prices and people’s expectations and force more drastic action later. Bank officials say economic growth should recover more strongly later in the year, expecting a 0.5% increase in output — still less than 3.5% in 2022.

            The ECB’s benchmark for lending now stands at 3%, and the rate on deposits left overnight by commercial banks is 2.5%.FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank chugged ahead with another outsized interest rate hike Thursday and vowed more will follow, underlining its drive to subdue inflation even as the economy slows and the U.S. Federal Reserve eases its pace of increases.The Frankfurt-based bank raised its key benchmarks by half a percentage point and said it intends to make a similar move in March. Policymakers are moving aggressively to choke off price spikes that have slowed from record highs but are still hurting households in the 20 countries that use the euro currency.The bank, which also hiked by a half-point in December, “will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference.“Now you will say, ‘Well, yes, but what about after March? Does that mean that you have reached the pinnacle or the peak?' she later added. “No, no, no, no. We know that we have ground to cover. We know that we are not done.""The Bank of England also went big Thursday with a half-point hike, but the Fed pulled back a day earlier, slowing to a quarter-point hike as central banks around the world reassess their approach to tackling price spikes that have started to slow.The ECB sent a “relatively determined message” with the “unusual” preannouncement of the March increase, said Nick Bennenbroek, international economist at Wells Fargo Economics. He expects the March hike would be followed by a quarter-point bump in May that would mark the peak for ECB rates.Central banks can hold back economic growth if they go too far. With the ECB moving quickly, Lagarde acknowledged that “economic activity has slowed markedly"" since the middle of last year and it's expected to stay weak as demand slows worldwide and Russia's war in Ukraine raises uncertainty.The eurozone’s economy grew just 0.1% in the last three months of 2022.But Lagarde was optimistic overall, pointing to easing supply chain backups and Europe's natural gas supply becoming more secure after Russia cut off most flows to the continent.“The economy has proved more resilient than expected and should recover over the coming quarters,"" she said.The ECB’s bigger moves compared to the Fed partly reflect a later start in rate hikes — it began in July, four months after the U.S. central bank made its first increase — and from lower levels. That means more ground to make up.ECB officials may have sought to underline their resolve after “many market participants did not entirely believe the bank’s determined stance,” said Michael Holstein, chief economist at DZ Bank.Some market rates indicated traders were betting the ECB would reverse course later this year and next because of slumping growth. The bank appeared to warn against that by saying it would keep rates “restrictive over time” to contain inflation.Higher interest rates makes it more expensive for consumers to borrow for purchases like homes and cars and for companies to fund expansions. That is designed to cool demand for goods that push up consumer prices, which increased 8.5% in the eurozone last month from a year earlier.While still high, the annual rate has dropped three months in a row after reaching a record of 10.6% in October.High energy prices tied to the war in Ukraine have driven up utility bills for households and businesses, which have passed on those extra costs to shoppers and diners. That’s been the major driver of European inflation, which is well above the ECB’s target of 2% considered best for the economy.Workers across continental Europe and in the United Kingdom have been holding strikes and protests to demand that their pay keep pace with the soaring cost of living.European governments have passed billions in relief to shield people from high natural gas prices, which have fallen from records last summer as Europe found suppliers outside Russia and warmer-than-expected winter weather curbed fears of shortages and rationing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798256,High-level Kyiv visit aims to deepen EU-Ukraine ties,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Senior members of the European Union’s executive branch traveled to Ukraine on Thursday looking to boost relations with the war-torn country and pave the way for it to one day join the bloc, but concerns over corruption and democratic deficiencies remain.

            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen led a team of 15 policy commissioners who were to spend the day discussing Ukraine’s financial, business and energy needs, and how to bring the former Soviet state’s legislation into line with EU standards.

            The highly symbolic visit is the first EU political mission of its kind to a country at war. Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs meetings of the bloc’s heads of state and government, will hold a summit in Kyiv on Friday with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.











            “Ukraine’s destiny is in Europe,” Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who didn't make the trip, told EU lawmakers in Brussels, noting that the country’s application to join was submitted last June. “The commission will support Ukraine throughout the whole accession process.”

            “Despite the continuing ruthless attacks of the aggressor, we are seeing a major momentum of reforms in Ukraine,” Hahn said. But he noted that “the EU accession path is a marathon, not a sprint” and that the EU's 27 member countries must agree unanimously for Ukraine to join one day.

            It’s not clear exactly how the reforms can move at an accelerated pace almost one year into the war and with an economy being drained by defense spending and which relies on injections of foreign financial assistance, much of it from the United States and Europe.

            Visibly things are moving. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy’s government continued its recent crackdown on alleged corruption with the dismissal of more high-ranking officials. But an EU advisory mission set up in Kyiv in 2014 said then that it would take at least a decade to make a dent in the problem.

            In a new report this week, the anti-corruption group Transparency International praised Ukraine for the steady progress it has made in battling the scourge in recent years, although it ranks the country a low 116 out of the 180 countries listed for perceived corruption.

            “However, Russia’s war of aggression has disrupted some of the reform processes and exacerbated corruption risks. Reconstruction and recovery efforts can be drastically undermined by wrongdoers pocketing funds, both during the war and after,” the report said.

            Briefing reporters before he left on the commission trip to Kyiv, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell noted that Ukrainian politicians sometimes say to him: “forget about conditions, I am at war, why are you telling me reforms?”

            But Borrell said that “this is a merits-based process, and no one can jump over it. So we have to cooperate better and to try and be optimistic, and at the same time realistic.”

            EU member countries are divided over whether Ukraine should be allowed in. France and Germany, notably, believe that the bloc should be reformed and its decision-making processes streamlined before it allows in any new members.

            They’ve championed a new grouping, the European Political Community, whose inaugural meeting in Prague last year was attended by representatives from more than 40 countries. Another summit is scheduled in Moldova in June.

            During the visit, the EU announced that it’s ramping up its military training mission for Ukraine, from an initial target of pushing 15,000 troops through the schooling to up to 30,000 troops. One focus is to train the crews of tanks that Western countries have offered Ukraine, Borrell said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798299,Florida city highlights conflicts over local gerrymandering,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Not far from the postcard images of Jacksonville -- the white sand beaches, the riverfront fountain, the upscale shopping district — is another side of the city.

            Here, neighborhood roads are pitted with potholes and sometimes unpaved. Weeds swallow abandoned cars in empty lots. Grocery stores are sparse.

            The people who live in this other Jacksonville are mostly Black, and many of them lay blame for their neighborhoods’ lack of services on the city’s politics. They point to a lack of representation resulting in part from the way the districts have been drawn for the city council, the decision-making body for Jacksonville’s 950,000 residents.











            “It’s about diluting Black representation, Black power and change that needs to happen in the Black community,” said Moné Holder, a city resident who holds a leadership role at Florida Rising, a local voting rights group that focuses on communities of color. “Others may tell a different story as to why it is, but we see it in the lack of resources that go into those communities.”

            A group of Jacksonville residents and local civil rights organizations sued the city last year, alleging that the council’s redistricting maps packed Black communities into four of the 19 council districts, five of which are at-large.

            A U.S. district court judge last fall ruled in their favor and ordered the maps redrawn. Advocates said the city returned with more of the same, and in December the same court ordered that a map proposed by the advocates be used for Jacksonville’s elections this spring.

            “There’s just naturally an incentive to keep things the same, and that’s what you saw in the Jacksonville process,” said Nick Warren, staff attorney with the ACLU of Florida.

            The council argued in its court filings that the advocates’ latest plan would be the third council map in less than a year and would “cause voter confusion and undermine voter confidence.” The court rejected the appeal in early January, so voters will be casting ballots in new council districts for the city’s March elections.

            The fight over how Jacksonville’s districts are drawn reflects an aspect of redistricting that often remains in the shadows. Redistricting for congressional and state legislative boundaries captures wide attention after new census numbers are released every 10 years, as the two major political parties seek mapmaking advantages that will help them retain or regain power at the federal or state level — a process known as gerrymandering.

            No less fierce are the battles over the way voting lines are drawn in local governments, for city councils, county commissions and even school boards.

            Conflicts over local redistricting erupted into public view late last year when a leaked audiotape revealed how Latino members of the Los Angeles City Council were plotting to gerrymander council districts in a way that would boost political power for their community at the expense of traditionally Black ones.

            The exchange was punctuated with racist and graphic language and has widened racial fissures within the city, led the state Department of Justice to announce an investigation and prompted a legislative effort to remove the council’s redistricting power.

            “Self-interest should not be the deciding factor,” said the bill’s sponsor, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo. “It should be the Voting Rights Act, the California Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.”

            When the city was going through the redistricting process, Los Angeles City Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson recalled bringing up topics important to his constituents related to what he termed the “One Black district” but said he was ignored.

            “Now I understand that that was on purpose,” he said.

            A U.S. Supreme Court ruling a decade ago gutting a section of the federal Voting Rights Act gave state and local governments tremendous freedom to change voting procedures and to redraw political boundaries, even if redistricting was done in a way that diluted the voting power of minority communities. Previously, some states and local governments were required to get approval from the Justice Department before making significant voting-related changes.

            The gerrymandering for local government bodies receives far less attention than congressional or state legislative gerrymandering, in part because few local groups have the money and expertise to bring lawsuits against what they perceive as unfair maps.

            Jacksonville is an exception. Local branches of the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union teamed up with community civil rights groups to challenge the maps the City Council approved in March 2022.

            Some community activists trace the city’s redistricting problems to a 1968 consolidation with Duval County, which allowed the city to grow but also changed its racial dynamics. At the time, it was hoped that a mix of predominantly Black council districts and at-large council positions would help boost Black representation.

            Yet in the more than half-century since the merger, just six Black residents have served in the at-large positions, which are elected on a citywide basis, and just two of those were Democrats, according to research by Marcella Washington, a retired Florida State College at Jacksonville political science professor who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit.

            Black residents made up at least 40% of Jacksonville’s total population at the time of the consolidation, and today they account for a little over 30%.

            While seven members of today's Jacksonville council are Black, Washington said they don’t always vote in the interest of the Black community. As one example, she cited contentious votes over whether to remove Confederate monuments across the city. Other residents noted additional concerns in predominantly Black areas of Jacksonville they feel the council does not prioritize — city properties that are overgrown, problems with water and sewer service, inadequate services for homeless people.

            Councilman Rory Diamond was the lone vote against the council’s original map, saying it was designed to protect incumbents. But he also is critical of the redrawn map to be used in the upcoming elections because he believes it could have the unintended consequence of “destroying African-American representation on the City Council.” Other council members declined to comment, citing the litigation.

            Local activists say forcing Black residents into a handful of council districts has led to a sense in those communities that their voice doesn’t matter. That has made it difficult to get them engaged politically, said Rosemary McCoy, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and CEO of the Harriet Tubman Freedom Fighters, a nonprofit that registers new voters.

            “We understand that when you pack a group of people together, then these people don’t have a say. Their vote happens to be wasted,” McCoy said. “I ask people to sign petitions to put things on the ballot ... and many times they’re telling us, ‘My vote don’t matter. My vote don’t count. Why should I vote? Nothing’s going to change’”

            Ben Frazier, another plaintiff in the case and CEO of the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville, which focuses on injustice, said he would like the court fight in Jacksonville to inspire other groups around the country to challenge local redistricting maps when they appear to be drawn unfairly.

            “I’m hopeful that there will be other cities and other states who look at Jacksonville and say Jacksonville moved against them, and maybe we should, too,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798300,Shell profit doubles to record as war drives up energy costs,"LONDON (AP) — Global energy giant Shell said Thursday that its annual profits doubled to a record high last year as oil and natural gas prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

            London-based Shell Plc posted adjusted earnings of $39.9 billion for 2022 in its financial results for the final three months of the year. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, which exclude one-time items and fluctuations in the value of inventories, rose by 50%, to $9.8 billion, from the same period a year earlier. 

            Shell is the latest oil company to report bumper profits, which risks reigniting public anger that the fossil fuel industry do more to offset high energy bills for households and small businesses as well as cut climate-changing carbon emissions. U.S.-based Exxon Mobil also posted record annual profits days earlier, while U.K. rival BP and France’s TotalEnergies reported huge quarterly profits last year. 











            The results demonstrate Shell's “capacity to deliver vital energy to our customers in a volatile world,"" new CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement. 

            It's the first earnings report presented by Sawan since he took over as chief executive at the start of the year, replacing Ben van Beurden, who stepped down after nine years. Sawan also has reorganized the company’s core business units.

            Sawan, who has worked for Shell for 25 years, was previously director of its integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions business. His appointment was seen as a part of Shell’s strategy to take what it calls a leading role in the energy transition despite criticism that it’s been slow to cut emissions. 

            Shell also is raising its dividend payout by 15% and buying back $4 billion worth of shares — moves that underline the tension between energy company shareholders seen as reaping big profits and consumers weighed down by higher costs for heating their homes and filling up their cars. 

            The results were “truly stunning” and “will do nothing to quieten demands for further windfall taxes to redistribute some of the bounty Shell has enjoyed this year thanks to the Ukraine-inspired disruption to global energy markets,” said Russ Mould, investment director at financial services company AJ Bell. 

            Russia's war in Ukraine sent global energy prices surging, with natural gas prices in Europe hitting record levels last summer and oil hovering at $120 per barrel. They have since come down, but natural gas prices are still three times what they were before Russia massed troops on the Ukrainian border.

            To ease the pain on households and consumers, the European Union and individual countries like Britain and Italy have imposed windfall taxes on energy companies, and U.S. President Joe Biden has raised the idea of a war profit tax. 

            Shell expected to pay an extra $2.3 billion in taxes to cover the EU and U.K. windfall levies for 2022. The company said it paid out $26 billion to shareholders last year in dividends and share buybacks.

            “For the millions of people globally who are struggling with the high cost of energy or the impacts of the climate crisis, Shell reaping in record profits will rightly feel incredibly unfair,” said Alice Harrison of Global Witness, a nonprofit that advocates for environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility. 

            Global Witness filed a complaint Wednesday with U.S. regulators accusing the company of greenwashing. The group asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Shell broke securities laws and misled investors about the extent of its renewable energy investments.

            Global Witness says its analysis shows that 1.5% of Shell’s capital spending went to wind and solar power generation, compared with the 12% that the company claimed in its 2021 annual report.

            Greenpeace activists have occupied a vessel in the North Sea transporting a Shell oil production platform to protest the environmental damage by fossil fuel companies. Four activists raised a banner that said “Stop Drilling, Start Paying,” according to photos posted online by Greenpeace this week.

            Also Thursday, Norway unveiled plans for extra military and civilian aid for Ukraine financed by oil and gas revenue. The aid package will make Norway, which has fended off accusations it has profited from the war, one of Kyiv's biggest donors, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said.LONDON (AP) — Global energy giant Shell said Thursday that its annual profits doubled to a record high last year as oil and natural gas prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.London-based Shell Plc posted adjusted earnings of $39.9 billion for 2022 in its financial results for the final three months of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798301,Turkey slams West for security warnings 'harming' tourism,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey on Thursday slammed a group of Western countries that temporarily closed down their consulates in Istanbul over security concerns, accusing them of waging “psychological warfare” and attempting to wreck Turkey’s tourism industry.

            Germany, the Netherlands and Britain were among countries that shut down their consulates in the city of around 16 million people this week. The German Embassy cited the risk of possible retaliatory attacks following Quran-burning incidents in some European countries. The United States and other countries issued travel warnings urging citizens to exercise vigilance.

            Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the consulate closures and travel warnings were part of an alleged Western plot to prevent a rebound in Turkey’s tourism sector following the coronavirus pandemic.











            “On a day when we declared our aim of (attracting) 60 million tourists, at a time when 51.5 million tourists arrived and we obtained $46 billion in tourism revenue, they were on the verge of starting a new psychological warfare (against) Turkey,” said Soylu, who is known for his anti-Western rhetoric.

            Turkey’s Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of nine countries -- the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Britain, Germany, Belgium, France and Italy -- and formally protested the security warnings and consulate closures, officials said. 

            The envoys were told that Turkey provides security to all diplomatic missions “on the basis of international conventions” and that their actions served what the ministry said was ""terrorist organizations' sneaky agendas.”

            The interior minister said Turkey had conducted as many as 60 operations against the Islamic State group so far this year and detained 95 people. Last year, close to 2,000 IS suspects were detained in more than 1,000 operations against the group, he said.

            Earlier this week, the Interior Ministry said Turkish authorities had detained a number of suspects following a warning from a “friendly country” but hadn't found any weapons, ammunition or sign of a planned act of violence.

            In November, a bombing on Istanbul's bustling Istiklal Avenue, located in the heart of the city and near a number of foreign consulates, killed six people and wounded several others. Turkish authorities blamed the attack on Kurdish militants. 

            Last weekend, Turkey's Foreign Ministry issued a travel warning for European countries due to anti-Turkish demonstrations and what it described as Islamophobia. The warning followed demonstrations the week before outside the Turkish Embassy in Sweden, where an anti-Islam activist burned the Quran and pro-Kurdish groups protested against Turkey. 

            In a related development, Norway revoked a group's permission to stage a protest in Oslo on Friday that would have involved an attack on the Quran, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters. Police in Oslo confirmed that the protest was canceled on grounds that security could not be ensured “in a satisfactory manner” at the event.

            Earlier, Turkey summoned Norway's ambassador and told the envoy that the planned action would constitute a “hate crime” that should not be allowed.

            A group called Stop Islamization of Norway had planned to burn the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy. The group’s leader, Lars Thorsen, told VG newspaper that he planned to carry out his protest “in the context of Turkey's intolerance of Western values of freedom.” 

            Recent demonstrations in Europe where activists desecrated Islam's holy book have infuriated Muslims in Turkey and elsewhere. 

            Jewish organizations in Denmark, Sweden and Norway issued a statement expressing concern about what they called the manifestation of “Islamophobic hate” in the Nordic region.

            “Once again, racists and extremists are allowed to abuse democracy and freedom of speech in order to normalize hate against one of the religious minorities by burning the Quran,” they said.

When police received a report and arrived on the scene, they found her upside-down between ditch covers, legs in the air, with no sign of life.The family told police the woman left home at 11 a.m. without informing them of where she was going. The location where she was found was 200 meters from her home.The woman kept a spring onion patch and habitually diverted water from the irrigation canal to the ditch, despite her family warning this was dangerous. With her family’s agreement, the woman was not sent to the hospital for resuscitation.According to the police’s preliminary investigation, there were no signs of a struggle where the woman was found, and surveillance camera footage showed no outside interference in the incident.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798323,Cult East German novelist now published in English,"The story is set in 1960, about a year before the construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1963. But even before the concrete barrier was erected, the border between the East and the West was already restricted, in an attempt to stop the ""brain drain"" from the socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR).""Siblings"" by Brigitte Reimann is a cult classic of GDR literature that has now been translated into English, 50 years after the author's death from cancer at the age of 39 in 1973.The novel follows Elisabeth, a young painter, and her brother Uli, as he reveals that he is about to leave for the West.Their older brother Konrad has already defected years ago, but Elisabeth's disappointment is stronger in Uli's case, since the two are very close. So she tries to convince her sibling to stay.For Uli, there is no future in oppressive East Germany. The young engineer has apparently been blacklisted by the state for trivial reasons.As an outspoken artist, Elisabeth has also faced difficulties with authorities, but she demonstrates through the story of her clash with her local party secretary that such matters can be sorted out with enough determination.Brigitte Reimann's own brother had also left the GDR in 1960, and the author started writing ""Siblings"" shortly afterwards.Like her novel's character Elisabeth, Reimann lived on the grounds of an industrial plant — in the author's case, in the new town of Hoyerswerda. Many artists and writers did this, following a state program called the Bitterfelder Weg, which encouraged them to engage first-hand with the working class instead of remaining secluded among a cultural elite.Through her diaries, it is known that Reimann believed passionately in socialism, and Elisabeth's arguments reflect her own.Now that we know how the GDR turned into a totalitarian state, the views of the author, then in her 20s, appear politically naive. But as translator Lucy Jones points out, at the time, Germany was facing the aftermath of the Second World War and the Nazis' legacy, and Reimann was driven by ""a wish to be part of creating a state that is absolutely the opposite of fascism.""When discussing the book, the translator hopes to avoid the usual Western cliches about the GDR. ""The fact is that things were a lot messier than what any kind of films have conveyed so far,"" she told DW.Indeed, despite her idealism, Reimann was also critical of many aspects of the new state's structures — which also comes through in Elisabeth's reflections.Reimann fictionalized her ""deeply personal conflict, but at the same time the conflict of an entire generation"" as they dealt with the division of these two Germanys, Nele Holdack told DW. The senior editor of modern classics at the publisher Aufbau Verlag is overseeing a new German-language edition of the book, which will be published on February 14. Holdack feels the author was ""very courageous to tackle this topic in such a state of limbo.""The novel clearly exposes the doubts of the young generation, to a point that it's even surprising from today's perspective that ""Siblings"" managed to find its way past GDR censors.The German publishers at Aufbau Verlag recently found out more about the backstory behind Reimann's novel, after having realized it had not been properly documented when they started preparing material to mark the 50th anniversary of Reimann's death on February 20.By pure coincidence, the original manuscript of ""Die Geschwister"" was found last year in what is described by the publisher as a ""Harry Potter closet under the staircase"" in Reimann's former apartment in Hoyerswerda. This document now serves as the basis for the new German edition.As Reimann mentioned in a 1962 diary entry ahead of the original German publication of ""Siblings,"" different scenes were to be deleted — from Elisabeth's heated discussion with an agent of the Stasi, the GDR's notorious state security service, to references to her sexually liberated lifestyle — but the author ""boxed her way"" into convincing her publishers to keep them in the first print edition that came out a year later.To get the book approved at the time, the publishers then found strategies to downplay the system-critical scenes of the book. They stated in their assessment of the work that Elisabeth's arguments were so persuasive that the reader can hope that Uli ""will find the right path.""To obtain the Ministry of Culture's permission to publish, an external report written by someone who did not belong to the literary scene was also required. The first external report, too negative, was never submitted by the publishers to the authorities. They rather commissioned a second one, that came to the conclusion that ""by touching on real problems,"" the story ""could stimulate more significant discussions,"" compared to the ""harm that could be done through a simplified presentation of  [the GDR's] problems.""Censorship increased following the 11th plenum of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1965, and Reinmann became, like many other artists, politically disillusioned, but she kept fighting for writers' freedom of expression. ""She really believed that bureaucrats should have nothing to say about how writers should be able to express themselves,"" says Jones. ""She had this very vocal, angry presence at these meetings where she stood up for freedom of speech.""As a free-spoken writer who pursued her artistic ambitions and led a sexually liberated lifestyle, Reimann still embodies today's feminist values.""She was such a vibrant woman,"" says editor Holdack, and ""was convinced that she had the right to a free, self-determined, happy life and was not at all willing to make compromises. She really bravely stood up for her own convictions and was able to assert herself very well in a hard-fought literary field, which in the GDR was also dominated by men.""Another aspect Holdback finds topical in ""Siblings"" is that in times of political uncertainty, we all have the responsibility to determine our ideals and what we are prepared to give up to follow them.Reimann still manages to unite people with a certain kind of feeling, as Lucy Jones realized while attending a recent book launch.The event to mark the publication of Carolin Würfel's ""Three Women Dreamed of Socialism,"" a non-fiction work which explores Reimann's friendship with fellow East German female writers, Christa Wolf and Maxie Wander, was packed with people who enthusiastically recalled reading the late author's books in their youth, including Reimann's most famous novel, ""Franziska Linkerhand,"" an incomplete work that was nevertheless published posthumously in 1974 and became a bestseller.As translator Jones points out, citizens of the former GDR ""literally don't have the country anymore in which they grew up in."" Without being nostalgic about a totalitarian state, she says, we can still acknowledge that these people have lost their country. And now ""the books have become the country where they feel at home.""Edited by: Louisa Schaefer",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798324,Vienna: Court finds 4 guilty over role in 2020 terror attack,"A court in Vienna late on Wednesday found four of six defendants guilty of their role in a deadly terror attack in the Austrian capital.The attacker, who was a convicted supporter of the ""Islamic State"" (IS) extremist group, killed four people and wounded 23 others before he was shot dead by police.Two men were given life sentences for being accessories to murder, while the other two were given sentences of 19 and 20 years.The final two were cleared of charges related to the murders but found guilty of being members of a terrorist organization and handed two-year partially suspended sentences.While the six accused men were not directly involved in the November 2020 mass shooting, prosecutors argued that they helped the perpetrator acquire weapons and ammunition.The six men, aged between 22 and 32, were accused by prosecutors of helping the gunman with preparations and planning, as well as putting him in contact with weapons dealers.All six faced charges of aiding and abetting murder, while four of the defendants were also charged with spreading extremist IS propaganda.Defense teams for the six alleged accomplices said they were unaware of the attacker's plans.In the evening of November 2, 2020, the 20-year-old gunman opened fire in a busy area of central Vienna where bars and cafes are located. He was armed with an assault rifle and a pistol and was wearing a fake explosives belt.The gunman, who was an Austrian citizen with parents from North Macedonia, had been convicted in 2019 of traveling to Syria and trying to join IS.He was sentenced to 22 months in prison but was paroled eight months into his sentence.It was Austria's first deadly Islamist attack and sparked heavy criticism of the Austrian government and the country's intelligence services for how they monitored extremists.In the aftermath, Austria adopted a new anti-terror law, sparking a wave of criticism from rights groups over its sweeping surveillance powers.rs,es/sms (Reuters, dpa, AP)",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798325,Is Pakistan's economic collapse imminent?,"Pakistan last week suffered a nationwide power outage following a breakdown in its national grid, which left millions of people without electricity. This power failure is an apt representation of the state of the country's faltering economy, which, according to many economic experts, is on the verge of collapse.""Does Pakistan have a future?"" a shopkeeper asked. ""I don't know what is happening in this country. We can't afford a proper meal, yet our politicians seem totally unconcerned about our plight,"" he added.Long queues of cars can be seen in Pakistan's major cities, including its economic hub Karachi, outside gas stations. There is a shortage of fuel, and whatever gas is available is so costly that ordinary citizens can't afford it.There are all kinds of other shortages right now in Pakistan. There is no gas to cook a meal in households or to run small factories, and power outages are so frequent that they have crippled the economy.""The recent power outage paralyzed our lives. We were unable to do our daily chores. It felt like were living in the stone age,"" Mrs. Waseem, a housewife, told DW in Karachi.On January 26, the Pakistani rupee fell 9.6% against the dollar, which is the biggest one-day drop in over two decades. The dollar crisis is so severe that hundreds of foreign containers carrying food and medical supplies have been stranded on ports for weeks as authorities do not have the money to make payments.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government is now facing a difficult task to convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to renew its loan for the country to avoid a default.""I think we will get the IMF tranche soon because the government has raised fuel prices, imposed new taxes, and allowed market to decide dollar rates,"" Salman Shah, Pakistan's former finance minister, told DW.""The IMF loan will help improve the balance of payment. At the same time, the trance will unleash a storm of inflation that might spike to up to 40-50%. People living below the poverty line, which are around 30 to 40 % of the population, will suffer the most,"" Shah added.The former finance minister painted a gloomy picture for local businesses. ""The cost of doing business will be very high. It might be less damaging for exporters as they receive payments in dollars, but it will badly affect domestic producers, industrial raw materials and food items,"" Shah said, adding that it will still be better than a default.""A default would wipe out everything. Although there are similarities between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Pakistan will only go down the Sri Lankan economic crisis path should it not get the IMF tranche,"" he underlined.Pakistan's economy is facing an existential threat, but instead of paying attention to tackling the crisis, the Islamic Republic's politicians are embroiled in a tug-of-war over who would govern the country.Pakistan has been facing a deep political and constitutional crisis since the ouster of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in April last year. Khan, who was removed from power in a no-confidence vote in parliament, accused the US of orchestrating what he calls the ""regime change"" in Pakistan, and has taken a confrontational course with the country's incumbent government and powerful military generals.The former cricket start-turned-politician has been demanding early elections to resolve the political crisis, but many analysts are of the view that Pakistan needs to fix its economy first.""The country's economic situation is a big mess, and we have run out of money. Holding general elections is a costly affair, and I think Pakistan can't afford it right now,"" Zia Rehman, an investigative journalist and political analyst, told DW.""The ideal way forward is that all stake holders, including politicians and the army top brass, sit together and agree on a national consensus government, whose main job should be to fix economy,"" Rehman said.Some political observers in Pakistan are of the view that the biggest hindrance to a national dialogue is former premier Khan, whom critics accuse of being ""inflexible.""""Khan treats politics as sports, where the sole objective of a sportsman is to defeat the opponent at any cost. Politics don't work like this. Politicians have to engage with everyone, even with their opponents,"" Ghazi Salahuddin, a senior journalist, told DW.The recent suicide blast at a Peshawar mosque claimed by a splinter group of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) organization demonstrates why Pakistan's economic crisis is also a huge security risk for the region.""Pakistan does not have funds to deal with the security challenge. This poses a great risk to the country's stability,"" analyst Rehman said.Experts have often compared Pakistan's economic outlook to that of Sri Lanka's. Last year, massive antigovernment protests erupted across Sri Lanka against the shortage of fuel and price hike. The protesters stormed the parliament and other government buildings, forcing former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country.Pakistani citizens also feel increasingly disillusioned by their ruling elite and could take to the streets.A new United Nations report states that economic privileges accorded to Pakistan's elite groups, including the corporate sector, feudal landlords, the political class and the country's military, add up to an estimated $17.4 billion (€16 billion), or roughly 6% of its economy.But unlike Sri Lanka, Pakistan's geopolitical situation, with its proximity with Afghanistan, China, India and Iran, and the presence of countless Islamist militant groups, poses a far greater security risk to the region.""It is a risk no one in the region can afford,"" a security official told DW on condition on anonymity.The international community, knowing the risks of an economic collapse for a nuclear-armed nation, might come to Pakistan's rescue once again, but that would not ease the burden on common citizens. Any such respite for the ruling elite would thus prove to be a temporary solution to Pakistan's structural problems.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/2,100,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798337,EU assembly lifts immunity of 2 lawmakers linked to scandal,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s parliament on Thursday removed the protective immunity of two lawmakers linked to one of the bloc’s biggest-ever corruption scandals, paving the way for them to be questioned by Belgian investigators.

            In a show of hands, the assembly voted overwhelmingly to lift the parliamentary immunity of Belgian lawmaker Marc Tarabella and Italian Andrea Cozzolino. Both men previously said, through their lawyers, that they are willing to cooperate with the Belgian authorities.

            Live television images showed that Tarabella voted in favor of having his own immunity lifted.











            The two have denied any links to the scandal, in which Qatari and Moroccan officials are suspected of offering bribes to influence decisions at the European Parliament. Qatar and Morocco have also vehemently denied involvement, but the assembly has suspended work on all Qatar-related files.

            According to the report prepared to allow Taraballa’s immunity to be lifted, a Belgian investigation shows that he “may have been involved in acts of corruption connected with interference by one or more foreign states aimed at influencing the debates and decisions taken in the European Parliament.”

            It said that “testimony against him suggests that such payments were made to him on several occasions, amounting to a total of between"" 120,000 and 140,000 euros ($132,00 and $154,000).

            The Cozzolino report said that the Italian EU lawmaker “is suspected of having, from 2019 onwards, participated in an agreement with other persons to cooperate in protecting the interests of foreign states in the European Parliament.”

            This was apparently done, at least in part, “by impeding the adoption of parliamentary resolutions that might damage the interests of those states, in exchange for sums of money,” the report said.

            Tarabella and Cozzolino are from the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) — the second-biggest political group in the assembly and which has been hardest hit by the corruption allegations.

            The scandal came to light in early December after authorities launched a series of raids across Brussels, and in Italy, seizing hundreds of thousands of euros.

            Four people were charged with corruption, money laundering and membership in a criminal organization. They are S&D lawmaker Eva Kaili, who was an assembly vice president until the charges came to light; her partner and parliamentary assistant Francesco Giorgi; former S&D lawmaker Pier Antonio Panzeri, and the head of a charity group, Niccolo Figa-Talamanca.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798339,Pope urges Congo youth to reject corruption and they respond,"KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Pope Francis led Congo’s young people in a rousing denunciation of political corruption on Thursday, turning an otherwise scripted meeting with church catechists into a rally that shook the capital’s sports stadium.

            Francis was repeatedly interrupted as some of the 65,000 people in Kinshasa’s Martyrs’ Stadium took up his call to say “No” to corruption and turned it into a demand for Congo's president to not run for a second term in elections later this year.

            The Argentine pope often uses his foreign trips to denounce corruption, particularly in meeting with young people in hopes that future generations will resist the temptation to make dishonest deals for personal gain. The issue is particularly dear to Francis, who wrote a book on the issue and likes to say that corruption is far worse than sin.











            He continued that tradition on Thursday in Kinshasa, denouncing the “cancer of corruption” as he called for Congolese to create an honest future for themselves and their families. 

            “If someone offers you an envelope with a bribe, or promises you favors and lots of money, do not fall into the trap. Do not be deceived! Do not be sucked into the swamp of evil!” Francis said to cheers.

            Transparency International ranks Congo 166th out of 180 on its corruption perception index, finding a direct correlation between political corruption and the high level of insecurity in the country. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi says his administration is committed to fighting corruption, has denied any wrongdoing and has blamed foreign powers for the decades of violence in the east by rebels and armed militia groups.

            Taking up Francis' call, the audience broke into a chant in the Lingala language directed at the country’s president, thundering that his mandate was over. 

            The pope clearly seemed to enjoy the enthusiasm, even if he needed his interpreter to explain hat the crowd was chanting. 

            More than two-thirds of Congo’s population of around 100 million is under age 25, and the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have said the country’s youth were particularly vulnerable to abuses amid the fighting in the east of the country which has forced more than 5 million to flee their homes.

            Some in the stadium on Thursday said the lack of jobs in Congo fueled the conflict since there are few other options for young people to earn money legitimately.

            “We have the impression that our leaders do absolutely nothing to improve the living conditions of the population and that these leaders minimize the capacity of the youth to improve things,” said Kavira Shukuru, 26. 

            “And this situation is among the causes of the instability and insecurity that our country is experiencing. An unemployed youth is easily influenced and can easily join an armed group to earn a living or be influenced by a politician with bad intentions,” she said.

            Tshisekedi, who is up for reelection at the end of the year, took office just over four years ago, starting what many had hoped would be a new era after the 18-year tenure of his predecessor. However, critics say Tshisekedi’s government hasn't done enough to improve living conditions in Congo, where many remain desperately poor despite the country’s vast mineral riches. 

            A top presidential adviser resigned in September amid a scandal over a mining deal. Opponents also have accused the president of giving bonuses to legislators and aides. 

            Emery Kalo, 27, said the government was doing what it could but that Congo's young people needed more opportunities to find work and receive adequate training and education.

            “It is because of the lack of employment that many young people indulge in delinquency and other depravities,” Kalo said. Dreaming of the future, Kalo said he would like to see a Congo where the government guarantees security, justice, work and health care. 

            “I would like to see the Congo embody its role in the middle of Africa, taking advantage of our resources by transforming them here locally,” Kalo said.

            Later Thursday, Francis met with Congo's priests and nuns at the capital's Notre Dame Cathedral and repeated his appeal to avoid the temptations of corruption, vice and material comfort. 

            “It is scandalous when this happens in the life of a priest or sister, for they should instead be models of sobriety and inner freedom,” he said, urging religious figures to live honest, Christian lives — including honoring their vows of celibacy.

            Outside the cathedral, advocates for victims of clergy sexual abuse staged a small protest, holding up signs urging Francis to use his trip to meet with survivors. Signs also urged him to apply the church law that punishes bishops who cover up abuse.

            Benjamin Kitobo, a 55-year-old Congolese survivor who now lives in the United States, called for accountability to stop abuse in the church.

            “If he does not help the Africans, that will continue in the dark for many years,” he said.

Do not be sucked into the swamp of evil!” Francis said to cheers.Transparency International ranks Congo 166th out of 180 on its corruption perception index, finding a direct correlation between political corruption and the high level of insecurity in the country. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi says his administration is committed to fighting corruption, has denied any wrongdoing and has blamed foreign powers for the decades of violence in the east by rebels and armed militia groups.Taking up Francis' call, the audience broke into a chant in the Lingala language directed at the country’s president, thundering that his mandate was over.The pope clearly seemed to enjoy the enthusiasm, even if he needed his interpreter to explain hat the crowd was chanting.More than two-thirds of Congo’s population of around 100 million is under age 25, and the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have said the country’s youth were particularly vulnerable to abuses amid the fighting in the east of the country which has forced more than 5 million to flee their homes.Some in the stadium on Thursday said the lack of jobs in Congo fueled the conflict since there are few other options for young people to earn money legitimately.“We have the impression that our leaders do absolutely nothing to improve the living conditions of the population and that these leaders minimize the capacity of the youth to improve things,” said Kavira Shukuru, 26.“And this situation is among the causes of the instability and insecurity that our country is experiencing. An unemployed youth is easily influenced and can easily join an armed group to earn a living or be influenced by a politician with bad intentions,” she said.Tshisekedi, who is up for reelection at the end of the year, took office just over four years ago, starting what many had hoped would be a new era after the 18-year tenure of his predecessor. However, critics say Tshisekedi’s government hasn't done enough to improve living conditions in Congo, where many remain desperately poor despite the country’s vast mineral riches.A top presidential adviser resigned in September amid a scandal over a mining deal. Opponents also have accused the president of giving bonuses to legislators and aides.Emery Kalo, 27, said the government was doing what it could but that Congo's young people needed more opportunities to find work and receive adequate training and education.“It is because of the lack of employment that many young people indulge in delinquency and other depravities,” Kalo said. Dreaming of the future, Kalo said he would like to see a Congo where the government guarantees security, justice, work and health care.“I would like to see the Congo embody its role in the middle of Africa, taking advantage of our resources by transforming them here locally,” Kalo said.Later Thursday, Francis met with Congo's priests and nuns at the capital's Notre Dame Cathedral and repeated his appeal to avoid the temptations of corruption, vice and material comfort.“It is scandalous when this happens in the life of a priest or sister, for they should instead be models of sobriety and inner freedom,” he said, urging religious figures to live honest, Christian lives — including honoring their vows of celibacy.Outside the cathedral, advocates for victims of clergy sexual abuse staged a small protest, holding up signs urging Francis to use his trip to meet with survivors. Signs also urged him to apply the church law that punishes bishops who cover up abuse.Benjamin Kitobo, a 55-year-old Congolese survivor who now lives in the United States, called for accountability to stop abuse in the church.“If he does not help the Africans, that will continue in the dark for many years,” he said.___Yesica Fisch contributed. ___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798354,"Spain and Morocco renew ties with migration, business deals","RABAT, Morocco (AP) — The governments of Spain and Morocco signed deals Thursday on managing migration and boosting Spanish investment in Morocco, among 20 agreements reached at wide-ranging meetings aimed at turning the page on diplomatic tensions linked to the disputed Western Sahara.

            Morocco is an ally to Western powers in fighting extremism and important in aiding EU migration policies, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez applauded what he described as a trust-building step at the signing ceremony in Rabat.

            The documents inked Thursday included an 800-million-euro ($873-million) package to encourage investment by Spanish firms in Morocco, two memorandums on migration and several deals for education and job training, among other agreements. Details were not immediately released.











            The meeting, which involved 11 Spanish ministers and 13 from the Moroccan government, also included a repeated commitment to eventually opening customs offices on the border crossings at Spain's North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, which Morocco doesn’t officially recognize as European territories. No date or timetable was given.

            This would be a boost to the local economies on both sides of the border. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the land crossings were porous to flows of contraband goods, and now the goal is for goods to move on trucks and with duties duly paid.

            The frontiers are also often sites of tragedy for Africans who try on occasion to storm the fences in hopes of continuing on to continental Europe. The border policing methods of both Spain and Morocco fell under intense scrutiny after the death of at least 23 African men, many reportedly refugees from Sudan, when they stormed a border fence at Melilla last year.

            Morocco has received hundreds of millions of euros from the EU in recent years to curb irregular migration that, for Spain, peaked in 2018 with 64,000 arrivals. European officials have credited Morocco with helping lower that to 31,000 last year. Of that number for 2022, almost 29,000 arrived on the Spanish mainland or its Canary Islands, mostly on small boats unfit for open waters. Thousands more have perished or vanished at sea. Those migrants included young Moroccans.

            Moroccans make up the single largest foreign community in Spain, with 800,000 residents; Spain is the largest foreign investor in Morocco, making economic cooperation a top priority for the Moroccan government. 

            The Spanish government's visit is seen as an effort to get something tangible in return for diplomatic efforts to mend ties with Morocco after a flareup in tensions over the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony annexed by Morocco in 1975.

            Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the “renewed dynamism of our relations.”

            He also thanked Spain for its support of its proposal for Western Sahara.

            Spain incurred Morocco's wrath in 2021 by allowing a Western Sahara independence fighter to seek treatment in a Spanish hospital. Rabat eased border controls on Ceuta, and thousands of people crossed over into the small city. Sanchez then took the controversial decision to throw Spain's backing behind Morocco’s vision for the future of the territory — more autonomy but remaining firmly under Moroccan control — to smooth over tensions.

            That angered Algeria, a major natural gas supplier to Spain and backer of the Polisario Front movement that has fought for Western Saharan independence. Politicians from across Spain’s spectrum considered Sánchez to have betrayed the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara for very little in return.

            Sánchez insisted Thursday on the importance of improved paths of communications between governments with the intention of avoiding “unilateral actions, and never leaving out any topic regardless of its complexity.”

            “We are establishing the basis for the type of relations between Spain and Morocco for the present and the future ... based on mutual trust,” Sánchez said.

            Miguel Hernando de Larramendi, professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies for the University of Castilla-La Mancha, believes that Spain’s government tilted toward Morocco in the Western Sahara question because it was convinced that “its interest in fighting extremism and irregular migration hinge on having good relations with Morocco.”

            In exchange, Madrid has edged toward strengthening its exclaves surrounded by Moroccan territory — if customs offices are finally established on the land border as agreed in principle.

            “We are in the ‘honeymoon’ moment of this rapprochement, but we will have to see the real results of the summit,” Hernando de Larramendi said. “The opening of the customs could be a good thermometer to gauge their relations because it carries with it a type of implicit recognition (by Morocco) of Ceuta and Melilla.”

            One person was notably absent from the Spanish visitors' agenda in Morocco: King Mohammed VI.

            That earned Sánchez scorn back home from opposition parties, who said the Socialist leader had been snubbed.

            The Moroccan monarch and Sánchez spoke by telephone on Wednesday about a “new era"" between their countries. Sánchez paid a visit early on Thursday to the gravesite of the king's grandfather, Mohammed V.

            
                Sánchez met with the king last year to put an end to the diplomatic crisis. They have now agreed to meet again soon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798355,All-Star festivities showcase next generation of NHL stars,"FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — New Jersey Devils players watch from the bench often and marvel at some of the things Jack Hughes can do on the ice.

            “Every game, at least a couple times, I’ll be like, ‘Oh my God, that guy’s amazing,'” forward Michael McLeod said. “He just gets it done every night.”

            The same goes in Buffalo, where Rasmus Dahlin described Sabres teammate Tage Thompson's development as “a ticking time bomb.” And in Dallas, where coach Peter DeBoer lay awake dreaming of coaching Jason Robertson with the Stars.











            While being an All-Star is old hat for the NHL's old guard of Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin and even unquestioned best player in the world Connor McDavid, the festivities this weekend in South Florida are a showcase for the league's next generation of stars, led by Hughes and Robertson now that Thompson is out with injury and replaced by Dahlin. Hughes is an All-Star for the second consecutive season and Robertson for the first time, and their emergence could upend the way the standings — and leaderboards — look for years to come.

            “Once you establish yourself as an NHL player, the next step is how you figure out how to try to win,” said Hall of Famer, two-time MVP and six-time Stanley Cup champion Mark Messier. “It’s been fascinating to me to see these players going through that process of becoming not only NHL players but bona fide superstars, but more importantly how they’re trying to figure out how to win in this league.”

            With Thompson, Robertson and Hughes all in the top 10 in goals and points, it's no coincidence each player's respective team is in the playoff race at the break. So are the surprising Seattle Kraken, the only team without an All-Star after rookie Matty Beniers was injured, but they'll need him more down the stretch to make it in their second season of existence.

            The Devils are on pace to play playoff hockey for the first time since 2018 and just the second in 11 years thanks in large part to Hughes, who trails only McDavid, Boston's David Pastrnak, Colorado's Mikko Rantanen and Thompson in the goal-scoring race. Mike Rupp, who won the Cup with New Jersey in 2003, expected Hughes to produce at a 100-point pace but did not anticipate his scoring to become so meaningful this season.

            “He’s scoring in big moments,” said Rupp, an NHL Network analyst who will see Hughes up close this weekend in Sunrise. “It’s the way he’s doing it. He’s carrying his team at certain times. He’s pushing his team along, Jack and Tage, (too). And I think that is the incredible part is they’re not just great talents: They’re great talents, and they seem like they’ve got nerves of steel.”

            Thompson's nerves and playmaking ability could be on display in the playoffs if Buffalo can finish strong and knock either Crosby's Pittsburgh Penguins or Ovechkin's Washington Capitals out of a wild-card spot. The Sabres have by far the league's longest playoff drought at 11 seasons, and if they snap it, Thompson will be a big part of it, even before starting a $51 million, seven-year contract he was rewarded with last summer.

            Messier credited Thompson for getting stronger in the offseason, augmenting the hands that made the now-25-year-old a 38-goal scorer in 2021-22 and putting him on track for more than 50 this season. Norris Trophy-winning defenseman P.K. Subban, who experienced Thompson's growth firsthand from playing against him several times the past five years before retiring and joining Messier as an ESPN analyst, sees him as a taller version of Hughes with the same level of skill.

            “What separates him from a lot of players in the league, and is going to separate him from a lot of players in the league going forward, is his ability at that size to do everything at top speed (with) his range, his skill with the puck, his skating ability,” Subban said. “He has all the tools to be a dominant player in this league for a long time.”

            So does Dahlin, who probably should have been an All-Star in the first place. The Swede who was the top draft pick in 2018 a year before Hughes went first ranks second among defensemen in goals and points this season.

            Like Thompson, Robertson got a lucrative extension before opening night. The 23-year-old from California, who is Filipino American and hopes to be a role model for players of Asian descent, has a big personality that matches his play and could soon be one of the faces of the league.

            Coming off a breakout 41-goal season, Robertson has put on a show this season with 66 points in 51 games.

            “You kind get used to it, and you almost have to sit and think about it after about how special it is what you’re witnessing,” DeBoer said. “It's unbelievable. He’s making it look easy.”

            And, along with Hughes and Thompson, he's making it easier for the NHL not to lean on Crosby and Ovechkin, both of whom broke in more than 15 years ago.

            ""Obviously they're all-time greats, but it was kind of just them,” Rupp said. “It was a couple guys that had to really carry the league. (Now) there’s a ton of guys carrying it, so I think that puts the league in a very healthy spot with superstars.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798356,"High court offers bonuses, debt relief to lure police hires","WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court police officers last fall staffed a table at Washington's armory, where runners picked up their numbers and T-shirts for the Army 10-Miler road race. The officers were promoting an entirely different kind of competition, seeking to recruit new officers in a tight employment market.

            High court personnel also are showing up on college campuses and military bases to try to fill some of the many vacancies on a police force that's charged with protecting the nine justices and the majestic marble building.

            The struggle to find new officers is similar to staffing shortages facing police departments across the country. But it comes as the court copes with a rise in threats against the justices, including last year's arrest of an armed man outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house, following the leak of the draft abortion opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.











            The court won’t say how many jobs are open on a force with an authorized strength of 189 officers, although job postings say there are “many vacancies” for new and experienced officers. It would not make available either its marshal or its police chief for this story, and court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said the court does not talk about security issues. 

            But one visible manifestation of the diminished size of the force is that, as the court has reopened in recent months from its coronavirus pandemic-induced closure, security officers with the U.S. Marshals Service have taken over some of the tasks previously handled by the police, including screening visitors when they enter the building.

            It once was common to see justices around town without any police presence, shopping at local markets, attending cultural events or eating at Washington restaurants. But as security concerns have grown, even before the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the opinion leak last May, the justices have acquired a relatively constant guard of officers dressed in suits when they travel to or from work or around town. At the court, police in uniform stand watch at various spots inside and outside the building.

            Police departments generally are dealing with a drop in applications, an increase in retirements and more difficulty in keeping existing officers. Policing experts say there were signs of these issues before the pandemic, but the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020 sent morale spiraling in many departments.

            “The George Floyd murder had a profound impact on policing, and for some it was deciding this isn’t the profession they wanted to be in, or officers deciding to leave the profession,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “If you look at the Tyre Nichols case, there will be ramifications for who wants to be a police officer in America after everything that’s happened in Memphis.”

            The Supreme Court is offering a $5,000 recruitment bonus and another $5,000 within 18 months to some officers who transfer from another department. Congress recently authorized the court to grant student loan forgiveness, matching a perk that long has been available for officers with the U.S. Capitol Police. New hires with no previous law enforcement experience are paid a starting annual salary of $73,852.

            Officers get four weeks of vacation after three years on the force and are eligible for retirement after 25 years of service, or at age 50 with 20 years of experience.

            It's unclear whether those benefits will be enough in the nation's capital, where there are many separate police forces, including for museums, mass transit, parks, the postal service, the Capitol, Amtrak and several colleges.

            That doesn't include the capital's main force, the Metropolitan Police Department, which is engaged in its own struggle to lure new officers in what Wexler described as an especially competitive market. The Washington force advertised at bus stops and on local television in Philadelphia in the fall.

            Nationally, the shortages have led to unprecedented incentives to be a police officer, like a $30,000 signing bonus for experienced officers to join Seattle’s police department and a $7,500 bonus to entice officers in Portland, Oregon, to stay. 

            The number of police officers nationwide dropped by about 5,000 from the start of 2020 to the start of 2022. New recruitment has somewhat bounced back, according to a survey of about 180 departments done by the Police Executive Research Forum, though not to pre-pandemic levels.

            In some places, entrance standards are changing to allow things like visible tattoos.

            But not at the Supreme Court, according to job postings. No visible body markings are allowed on the head and neck above the uniform collar or on fingers and hands and fingers below the wrist bone.

            Associated Press writer Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court police officers last fall staffed a table at Washington's armory, where runners picked up their numbers and T-shirts for the Army 10-Miler road race. The officers were promoting an entirely different kind of competition, seeking to recruit new officers in a tight employment market.High court personnel also are showing up on college campuses and military bases to try to fill some of the many vacancies on a police force that's charged with protecting the nine justices and the majestic marble building.The struggle to find new officers is similar to staffing shortages facing police departments across the country. But it comes as the court copes with a rise in threats against the justices, including last year's arrest of an armed man outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house, following the leak of the draft abortion opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.The court won’t say how many jobs are open on a force with an authorized strength of 189 officers, although job postings say there are “many vacancies” for new and experienced officers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798357,Bill Clinton back at White House to push paid family leave,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three decades after Bill Clinton signed the nation’s family and medical leave law, he was back at the White House on Thursday to hold forth on what it’s meant to the country, unspooling his trademark blend of storytelling and wonkiness.

            The 42nd president, now more than two decades out of office, seemed a little rusty at first, fumbling through the papers on the lectern to find his remarks. But then he found his stride and was soon dropping names, citing statistics and spinning yarns about the families whose lives have been affected by the law. 

            “We need more stories,” he declared. “Not process. Stories.”











            Clinton spoke just days before Sunday's 30th anniversary of his landmark Family and Medical Leave Act legislation and made the case for Congress to get behind President Joe Biden's push to go further and get paid leave etched into federal law. 

            The bill Clinton signed guaranteed many American workers up to 12 unpaid weeks off to recover from major illness or childbirth or to take care of sick family members, one of the biggest legislative achievements of his eight years in office. But Clinton, who signed the law just two weeks into his presidency, said it was past time to go further and give U.S. workers paid leave to bond with a new child or care for their loved ones.

            “There are still a lot of problems that cannot be solved without some form of paid leave,” Clinton said.

            Clinton paid tribute to former Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who pushed for the legislation for years. He paraphrased the German sociologist Max Weber, who called “politics the strong and slow boring of hardboards” as he expressed awe for lawmakers who pushed through the legislation, many of whom attended Thursday's event.

            “After all these years, I still have more people mention the family leave act to me than any other specific thing I did"" as president, Clinton said.

            Biden championed but failed to win support for paid leave for workers in 2021. On Thursday, he signed a memorandum that calls on heads of federal agencies to support access to unpaid family and medical leave for federal workers in their first year on the job. Workers aren't entitled to unpaid leave under the law until they've been employed for a year. 

            The president is also directing the Office of Personnel Management to provide recommendations on developing policies so workers can get paid and unpaid leave to seek safety or recover from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. Such situations are not covered by the family leave law.

            Early in 2021, Biden proposed vastly expanding the family leave law to give workers up to 12 weeks of paid parental, family and personal illness leave and to ensure workers get three days of bereavement leave per year as part of a massive $3.5 trillion social spending plan.

            His plan called for providing workers up to $4,000 a month, with a minimum of two-thirds of average weekly wages replaced. The White House estimated the program would cost more than $225 billion over a decade.

            Paid family leave didn't make it into the slimmed-down climate and health care legislation that Biden signed into law in August.

            Biden on Thursday said he wasn’t giving up on winning paid leave.

            “No American should ever have to choose between a paycheck and taking care of a family member or taking care of themselves,” said Biden, who noted that the United States was one of the only industrialized nations not to provide some form of paid leave to workers.

            Clinton, who was enthusiastically greeted by veteran lawmakers and White House staff, recalled stories of the enormous impact the family leave act has had on Americans. 

            He said that on a flight soon after leaving office in 2001, he was approached by a flight attendant who told him she was ambivalent about his time in office, but she wanted him to know the law was crucial for her family when both of her parents faced end-of-life illnesses at the same time. She said she couldn't have been there for her parents at the end of their lives if not for the job protections provided by the legislation, he recalled.

            “I just wanted to tell you, I’ve heard all these politicians give speeches about family values,” Clinton said the woman told him. He added, ""She said, 'I know ... how your parents' die is an important family value.' It was breathtaking.""

            A group of Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday announced they were reintroducing legislation to establish paid family leave and other updates to the law. 

            But passing legislation to establish paid leave program will be an uphill climb for Biden with Republicans now in control of the House. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who has been pushing for updating the federal law, said that she's engaged Republican lawmakers on the issue.

            “We are going to find what common ground exists in both the House and Senate and see if there’s some measure of paid leave that can be done with the Republican House,” she said. “I’m optimistic that there’s something we can do together. I just don’t know what it is yet.” 

            The current federal leave law doesn't apply to a huge swath of the U.S. work force.

            About 44% of workers are not eligible for FMLA-supported leave because they work for small employers exempt from the law, do not work enough hours or have not worked for their employer long enough to be eligible or both, according to the National Partnership for Women & Families, a group advocating for updating the law. Nearly 15 million workers used FMLA in 2022, according to the group.WASHINGTON (AP) — Three decades after Bill Clinton signed the nation’s family and medical leave law, he was back at the White House on Thursday to hold forth on what it’s meant to the country, unspooling his trademark blend of storytelling and wonkiness.The 42nd president, now more than two decades out of office, seemed a little rusty at first, fumbling through the papers on the lectern to find his remarks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798359,Norway PM says oil profits to fund more aid to Ukraine,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre of Norway said Thursday that the oil-rich Scandinavian country will become one of the world’s top donors to Ukraine when his two-party center-left government presents another planned military and civilian aid package.

            Norway’s profits from oil will finance the additional aid, and there will be a temporary increase in the use of oil money, Gahr Støre told the Norwegian parliament. He did not reveal how large the contribution will be, but he said the government would make it soon.

            “We are in a situation where we have room for action due to extraordinary income from the petroleum sector,” said the prime minister, who leads Norway’s Labor Party. He said the aid would be arranged in a way that has very little impact on the level of activity in the Norwegian economy. 











            Norway is one of Europe’s largest fossil-fuel exporters, and the conflict in Ukraine has boosted its gas revenues. However, Norway has fended off accusations that it's profiting from the war in Ukraine. Last year, the country gave Ukraine more 10 billion kroner ($1 billion) in civilian and military aid.

            “We are now stepping up this aid. We will contribute even more to the repair and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure,” Gahr Støre said.

            After Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, a frantic search by European countries for alternatives to Russian energy dramatically increased the demand — and price — for Norway’s oil and gas. 

            Gahr Støre stressed the increased aid to Ukraine “should not, I repeat should not, be about bringing more oil money into the Norwegian economy.”

            “The war will very likely last for a long time, and there is a risk that the human suffering will get even worse,” he said, noting several times that Russia's war in Ukraine is about to enter its second year.

            Lawmakers from the 10 parties in the 169-seat Stortinget plan to meet Monday to discuss aid to Ukraine. Rigmor Aasrud of Gahr Støre's Labor Party said she hoped a large majority would back the government's plan. Norway's governing coalition also includes the Center Party.

            The freeze has been blamed for at least 10 traffic deaths on slick roads this week in Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. And even as Texas finally began thawing Thursday, a new Artic front from Canada was headed toward the northern U.S. and threatening New England with potentially the coldest weather in decades. Wind chills could dive below minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius). 

            In Austin, city officials compared the damage from fallen trees and iced-over power lines to tornadoes as they came under mounting criticism for slow repairs and shifting timelines to restore power. 











            “We had hoped to make more progress today,“ said Jackie Sargent, general manager of Austin Energy. ”And that simply has not happened.""

            Across Texas more than 280,000 customers were without power Thursday night, down from 430,000 earlier in the day, according to PowerOutage.us. The failures were most widespread in Austin, where impatience was rising among 150,000 customers nearly two days after the electricity first went out, which for many also means no heat. Power failures have affected about 30% of customers in the city of nearly a million at any given time since Wednesday.

            By Thursday night, Austin officials backtracked on early estimates that power would be fully restored by Friday evening, saying the extent of the damage was worse than originally calculated and that they could no longer predict when all the lights may come back on. 

            Allison Rizzolo, who lost power in Austin, told KEYE-TV that she wished there were more clarity from the city on what to do or expect.

            “I get that there’s a fine line between preparedness and panic, but I wish they’d been more aggressive in their communications,” Rizzolo said.

            For many Texans, it was the second time in three years that a February freeze — temperatures were in the 30s Thursday with wind chills below freezing — caused prolonged outages and uncertainty over when the lights would come back on.

            Unlike the 2021 blackouts in Texas, when hundreds of people died after the state’s grid was pushed to the brink of total failure because of a lack of generation, the outages in Austin this time were largely the result of frozen equipment and ice-burdened trees and limbs falling on power lines. But the differences were little comfort to Austin residents and businesses that also lost power for days two years ago. 

            Among those still without power Thursday was the Central Texas Food Bank, according to Travis County Judge Andy Brown, the county's top elected official.

            “They have 21 counties to serve. They've been down for at least three days now. There's a lot of need that they have,” Brown said. 

            School systems in the Dallas and Austin area, plus many in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee, closed Thursday as snow, sleet and freezing rain continued to push through. In Austin, schools will not open until next week at the earliest. 

            Hundreds more flights were canceled again in Texas, although not as many as in previous days. 

            Airport crews battled ice to keep runways open. By Thursday morning, airlines had canceled more than 500 flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport — more than a quarter of all flights scheduled for the day. Still, that was down from about 1,300 cancellations on Wednesday and more than 1,000 on Tuesday, according to FlightAware.com.

            Dozens more flights were canceled at Dallas Love Field and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

            Another wave of frigid weather in the U.S. is on the horizon, with an Arctic cold front expected to move from Canada into the northern Plains and Upper Midwest and sweep into the Northeast by Friday. 

            In a briefing Thursday with the federal Weather Prediction Center, New Englanders were warned that wind chills — the combined effect of wind and cold air on exposed skin — in the minus 50s “could be the coldest felt in decades.”

            The strong winds and cold air will create wind chills “rarely seen in northern and eastern Maine,” according to an advisory from the National Weather Service office in Caribou, Maine.

            Jay Broccolo, director of weather operations at an observatory on New Hampshire’s Mount Washington — which for decades held the world record for the fastest wind gust — said Thursday that wind speeds could top 100 mph (160 kph).

            “We take safety really seriously in the higher summits,"" Broccolo said, “and this weekend’s forecast is looking pretty gnarly, even for our standards.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798404,6N: Revamped England drops Tuilagi and Scotland drops Price,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Manu Tuilagi was dropped as new coach Steve Borthwick overhauled England with eight changes for the Six Nations opener against Scotland this weekend.

            Despite his frequent injury-enforced absences, Tuilagi was always picked when available. But he was not even in the reserves on Thursday.

            Joe Marchant was preferred at outside center after injuries ruled out Henry Slade, Dan Kelly and Elliot Daly in the buildup to the game at Twickenham on Saturday.











            Marchant, who started four games in the 2022 Six Nations, earned his last cap on the mid-year tour of Australia.

            There were new faces everywhere after 2022 ended with a home loss to South Africa and coach Eddie Jones being dismissed. 

            London Irish winger Ollie Hassell-Collins will make his England debut, and Sale flanker Ben Curry has his first cap since June 2021 and a win against the United States.

            Curry made up a new back row with Lewis Ludlam and No. 8 Alex Dombrandt, appearing for the first time in a year. Maro Itoje's second-row partner was Ollie Chessum, who came to the fore on the June tour of Australia after a debut off the bench in the Six Nations.

            In the reserves, Harlequins hooker Jack Walker could make his England debut, Dan Cole could earn a first cap since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final, and back Anthony Watson could make a first England appearance since March 2021.

            Scotland dropped scrumhalf Ali Price and promoted Ben White.

            Price has been the leading 9 for Scotland coach Gregor Townsend, and started all four tests in the autumn. But his form for Glasgow has been off, while White has excelled for London Irish. Glasgow's George Horne was the reserve scrumhalf.

            Price was one of four British and Irish Lions not to make the starting side on Thursday, beside prop Zander Fagerson, flanker Hamish Watson and center Chris Harris, who was in the reserves.

            Fagerson started training only last week after a hamstring injury in December and was available but Townsend said on Thursday this test was too early for him. He was replaced by WP Nel, who reached 50 caps in November.

            The absence of Watson — concussed against New Zealand in November and back in action only last weekend — and Rory Darge has been compensated by the selection of Luke Crosbie, who has been Edinburgh's player of the month twice this season. Crosbie, who has been in Scotland squads since 2019, will receive his third cap.

            Harris and injured wing Darcy Graham have made way for Huw Jones and Kyle Steyn. Jones was in midfield with his Glasgow clubmate Sione Tuipulotu, and has four tries in four matches against England. Steyn was chosen ahead of Blair Kinghorn and Sean Maitland.

            Fullback Stuart Hogg was picked despite not having played since late December because of a heel injury.

            ___

            Lineups:

            England: Freddie Steward, Max Malins, Joe Marchant, Owen Farrell (captain), Ollie Hassell-Collins, Marcus Smith, Jack van Poortvliet; Alex Dombrandt, Ben Curry, Lewis Ludlam, Ollie Chessum, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Ellis Genge. Reserves: Jack Walker, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Nick Isiekwe, Ben Earl, Ben Youngs, Ollie Lawrence, Anthony Watson.

            Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Kyle Steyn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Duhan van der Merwe, Finn Russell, Ben White; Matt Fagerson, Luke Crosbie, Jamie Ritchie (captain), Grant Gilchrist, Richie Gray, WP Nel, George Turner, Pierre Schoeman.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798405,Bulgaria’s president calls nation's 5th election in 2 years,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria’s president dissolved the National Assembly on Thursday and called early parliamentary elections for April 2 in hopes of resolving the country's a bid to settle the European Union and NATO member’s prolonged political impasse and biting economic woes.

            President Rumen Radevon also appointed a caretaker government ahead of the snap vote, which will be Bulgaria's fifth in two years. 

            Radev reappointed Galab Donev, a 55-year-old independent politician, to remain at the helm of the interim Cabinet until the next parliament elects the members of a regular government. 











            The move comes after the three largest political groups in the deeply fragmented National Assembly failed to find common ground for a viable coalition government after the last early election, held in October. 

            The center-right GERB party of former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov won 67 seats, the most of any party but well short of a majority in the 240-seat parliament. Other parties refused to form an alliance with GERB due to corruption allegations and the party's alleged failure to implement reforms when it held power. 

            The liberal We Continue the Change party and the Socialists did not find enough support to lead a government.

            Bulgaria is a member of the European Union and NATO. The continuing political crisis is expected to put a brake on the country's plans to join the euro zone at the end of 2023 and to become a member of Europe's passport=free travel zone, the Schengen Area.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798406,Syria slams chemical watchdog report on 2018 attack,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria on Thursday dismissed the global chemical weapons watchdog's statement, which said that investigators had found “reasonable grounds to believe” the Syrian air force dropped two cylinders of chlorine gas in 2018 on then-rebel-held town of Douma.

            The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons produced a detailed report following a fact-finding mission that investigated the April 7, 2018 attack. Medical workers and activists said at the time more than 40 people were killed in the attack. OPCW inspectors headed to the site of the attack days later.

            The United States, Britain and France blamed Syrian government forces and launched airstrikes. Syria and key ally Russia deny any chemical attack.











            Douma was the final target of the Syrian government’s sweeping campaign to reclaim control of the eastern Ghouta suburbs of the capital, Damascus, from the rebels, who gave up the town days after the alleged chemical attack.

            Syria's permanent representative to OPCW, Ambassador Milad Atieh, told reporters that the OPCW has been biased towards “Western positions.""

            “The OPCW’s report relied mostly on information obtained from countries hostile to Syria and some other media and social networking sites run by terrorist organizations,” he said. “The report contained false accusations aimed at increasing pressure and escalating Western positions hostile to Syria.”

            Atieh claimed the report's methodology had “serious irregularities and defects” and false accusations that impacted its credibility, though he did not give any examples or offer evidence to support his statement.

            In an attempt to ensure accountability for crimes in Syria, the United Nations has established a commission entitled “International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism.” It is mandated to preserve and analyze evidence of crimes and prepare files for trials in “national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over these crimes, in accordance with international law.”

            Atieh however accused the United States and Western countries of political interference with the U.N. commission. 

            The OPCW’s director general, Fernando Arias, briefed the organization’s member states on the report at a meeting Thursday.

            “The report and its facts are now in your hands, and it will be up to member states of the organization, and to the international community as a whole to take any further action,” he told them, according to a tweet by the organization.

            U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in a joint statement with his British, French, and German counterparts last week commended the OPCW report and called on key Syrian ally Russia to “stop shielding Syria from accountability for its use of chemical weapons.” 

            “Syria must fully declare and destroy its chemical weapons program and allow the deployment of OPCW staff to its country to verify it has done so,” the statement read. 

            The ongoing conflict that started in Syria more than a decade ago has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced half the country’s prewar population of 23 million.

            Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 under severe international pressure after a deadly chemical attack on a Damascus suburb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798407,British Gas sorry its agents broke into customers' homes,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government said Thursday it was responding to “deeply shocking” revelations that debt-collectors working for British Gas broke into customers' homes to install prepay gas meters that left vulnerable people at risk of having their heating cut off.

            British Gas' parent company, Centrica PLC, said it had halted the “unacceptable” practice. The country's energy regulator launched an investigation.

            The Times of London reported that debt collectors obtained court warrants to enter the homes of people who had fallen behind on their energy bills. They installed meters that make customers pay upfront for their gas supply — if they don’t, they are cut off. The practice allows firms to get around rules that limit the circumstances in which they can cut off supplies to customers who are in debt.











            The newspaper said an undercover reporter working for debt collection agency Arvato Financial Solutions accompanied agents to enter homes and “force fit” the meters. The newspaper said the customers included a single father with three young children whose door was forced open by a locksmith and a mother with a 4-week-old baby.

            The Times said that in the first 11 months of 2022, energy firms applied for 345,000 warrants to force entry into U.K. homes.

            Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman, Max Blain, called the report “deeply shocking and concerning.”

            ""Vulnerable families should not be treated so poorly,” he said. Energy Minister Graham Stuart summoned British Gas representatives for a meeting on Thursday, the government said. 

            Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, said it was investigating what it called “extremely serious allegations.”

            Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea said that “protecting vulnerable customers is an absolute priority, and we have clear processes and policies to ensure we manage customer debt carefully and safely.”

            “The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity,” he said.

            Arvato Financial Solutions said it “acts compliantly at all times in accordance with the regulatory requirements in the areas in which we are operationally active.”

            “We treat customers with whom we come into contact with respect and assess their individual needs at the time of our visit,” the company said in a statement. “If there has been any verbal or any other type of misconduct by individual employees, we deeply regret it.”

            Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said that the report showed the need for “a formal inquiry into the prepayment meters scandal and the role of the courts in enabling this practice.”

            Domestic energy bills in Britain skyrocketed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, and resulting Western sanctions on Moscow sent global oil and gas prices soaring. Wholesale gas prices have since fallen back, but critics say energy firms aren’t passing the benefit on to customers.

            
                Shell reported Thursday that its annual profits doubled to a record high of $39.9 billion last year.

            The U.K. government has given households at least 400 pounds ($500) off their energy bills for six months, but the support is due to be scaled back in April.LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government said Thursday it was responding to “deeply shocking” revelations that debt-collectors working for British Gas broke into customers' homes to install prepay gas meters that left vulnerable people at risk of having their heating cut off.British Gas' parent company, Centrica PLC, said it had halted the “unacceptable” practice.

Energy Minister Graham Stuart summoned British Gas representatives for a meeting on Thursday, the government said.Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, said it was investigating what it called “extremely serious allegations.”Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea said that “protecting vulnerable customers is an absolute priority, and we have clear processes and policies to ensure we manage customer debt carefully and safely.”“The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity,” he said.Arvato Financial Solutions said it “acts compliantly at all times in accordance with the regulatory requirements in the areas in which we are operationally active.”“We treat customers with whom we come into contact with respect and assess their individual needs at the time of our visit,” the company said in a statement. “If there has been any verbal or any other type of misconduct by individual employees, we deeply regret it.”Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said that the report showed the need for “a formal inquiry into the prepayment meters scandal and the role of the courts in enabling this practice.”Domestic energy bills in Britain skyrocketed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, and resulting Western sanctions on Moscow sent global oil and gas prices soaring. Wholesale gas prices have since fallen back, but critics say energy firms aren’t passing the benefit on to customers.Shell reported Thursday that its annual profits doubled to a record high of $39.9 billion last year.The U.K. government has given households at least 400 pounds ($500) off their energy bills for six months, but the support is due to be scaled back in April.",2023/2/2,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798424,Liechtenstein returns NT$330 million to Taiwan in latest Lafayette scandal development,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) on Thursday (Feb. 2) announced that Liechtenstein has transferred NT$330 million (US$11.11 million) to Taiwan, which it seized from the family of the late arms dealer Andrew Wang (汪傳浦), who had been involved in the Lafayette scandal.The money was transferred to an account opened by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for confiscation. This marks the first batch of funds recovered by the Taiwan government following a series of corruption scandals that shocked Taiwan in the 1990s.Wang had been accused of accepting NT$14.46 billion in kickbacks in the Lafayette scandal, which was deposited in several countries. According to the MOJ, Wang and his family became wanted after fleeing Taiwan, though charges against Wang were dropped after his death in the U.K. in 2015.In 2021, a court ruling made in Switzerland, where most of Wang’s kickbacks were deposited, declared that nearly NT$7.4 billion of funds from the Wang family’s frozen accounts will be returned to Taiwan. Other funds that are still in the Wang family's Switzerland accounts, amounting to nearly NT$20 billion, would be unfrozen as their connection to the Lafayette case had not been proven.The Lafayette scandal is the biggest corruption scandal involving the Taiwan military since its establishment. Aside from enormous amounts of kickbacks, the case also involved over a dozen deaths that remain unsolved to this day.",2023/2/2,1693,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798457,"After Tyre Nichols funeral, Biden faces pressure on policing","WASHINGTON (AP) — When Vice President Kamala Harris was called to the pulpit at the funeral for Tyre Nichols, she said the White House would settle for nothing less than ambitious federal legislation to crack down on police brutality.“We should not delay. And we will not be denied,"" Harris said to applause in Memphis, Tennessee. ""It is non-negotiable.”Back in Washington, however, progress appears difficult, if not unlikely. Bipartisan efforts to reach an agreement on policing legislation stalled more than a year ago, and President Joe Biden ended up instead signing an executive order named for George Floyd, whose murder at the hands of Minneapolis police set off nationwide protests nearly three years ago.Now, with a new killing in the headlines, Biden and Harris will meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday to explore whether it's possible to get legislation back on track.“I am working to make sure that we have a clear plan,” said Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who chairs the caucus.The White House is facing fresh pressure to advance the issue, and even some political allies are frustrated with what they view as excess caution from Biden.“I think the president is missing the opportunity to be a historic president when it comes to the social issues that continue to plague our country,"" said Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. “That’s what we need.”Bowman described Biden as “a champion of the status quo in many ways,” and he said Biden needs to be “a champion of a new vision for America.”The solution, Bowman said, is not “thoughts and prayers, come to the State of the Union after your kid gets killed,"" a reference to Nichols' mother and stepfather being invited to attend next week's speech.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday that “we understand there’s a lot more work to do."" She blamed Republicans for blocking progress in Congress.“The way that we’re going to deal with this issue is to have federal legislation,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""That’s how we’re going to move forward.”Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he was in touch with the White House last Friday, when video of Nichols' beating became public, about whether the situation could be a catalyst to “get things moving again.”His organization, the nation's largest police union, had participated in previous attempts to reach a bipartisan deal, and Pasco said that “we welcome any constructive effort to help us do our jobs better.” The union's president, Patrick Yoes, has already condemned Nichols' killing and said that “our entire country needs to see justice done — swiftly and surely.""However, Pasco said, “we’re kind of in a wait-and-see mode right now,"" with Republicans recently regaining control of the House, making legislative progress much harder.“You’ve got to look at the political realities here,” he said.The issue involves critical political questions for the White House. Biden has carefully balanced his approach, embracing calls for overhauling how police do their jobs while also emphasizing his longtime support for law enforcement and rejecting proposals to cut funding. He was elected with strong support from Black voters, and he's preparing a reelection campaign that could launch in the near future.As a former prosecutor and the first person of color to serve as vice president, Harris has faced particular scrutiny for her approach to police issues. While attending the funeral on Wednesday, she condemned Nichols' death, saying that “this violent act was not in pursuit of public safety.”“When we talk about public safety, let us understand what it means in its truest form,"" Harris said in her short speech. ""Tyre Nichols should have been safe.”Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said he was encouraged that Harris attended the funeral.“This is what people expect, that you’ll be there for them at a time of need,"" he said.Now, Morial said, “we need a substantive response, not a political response where they say, ‘Let’s just pass something.’”Last year's executive order was the product of negotiations among civil rights leaders and law enforcement organizations, and it mostly focuses on federal agencies by requiring them to review and revise policies on the use of force.The administration is also encouraging local departments to participate in a database to track police misconduct.But deeper modifications, such as making it easier to sue officers for misconduct allegations, have remained elusive.“We haven’t gotten even a fraction of the changes that are necessary,"" said Rashad Robinson, president of the activist group Color of Change. ""We haven’t gotten the kind of structural change to policing that is required.”Robinson said he was encouraged by the swift arrests of the Memphis police officers responsible for beating Nichols. However, he said that shouldn't be the end of the matter.“Are those in power willing to do something to make sure it doesn’t happen again?"" he said. ""Or do they want to make sure only individuals are punished?”",2023/2/2,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798460,Taiwan's Tsai welcomes retired US admiral for China talks,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday welcomed the former head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, who had warned the island could face an invasion from China this decade, as the mainland ramps up pressure on the self-governing island.Retired Adm. Phil Davidson, along with a group including colleagues from the U.S. think tank the National Bureau of Asian Research, arrived Monday in the capital Taipei following a string of delegate visits to Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, since tensions with the mainland spiked in August with the visit of then-U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi.“I’m here to listen and learn from our hosts; thus far, I’ve done both,” he said. “I'm looking forward to continuing our discussions with President Tsai today and hearing her perspectives on the security environment and her outlook on U.S.-Taiwan relations.”China’s People’s Liberation Army has stepped up its pressure on Taiwan in the past few years, sending navy vessels and fighter planes near the island.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that 20 Chinese aircraft crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait — a long-time unofficial buffer zone between the sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949. It sent 14 other planes in nearby airspace.A day later, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said 17 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line Wednesday, with a total of 23 planes sent to fly around the island.“Faced with the expansion of authoritarianism, Taiwan must strengthen our ability to defend ourselves,” she said, pointing to the upcoming extension of mandatory military service that she had just announced in December.Tsai thanked Davidson on Thursday for his contributions to the “safety of the Taiwan Straits.”Davidson, while still serving as the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, had warned that China's claims over Taiwan were a rising and tangible threat.“Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before then, and I think the threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” he told the Senate Armed Forces Committee in 2021.He clarified this remark while in Japan just before his visit to Taiwan, saying that the scenario would not necessarily be an all-out war.“In my mind, that can be many lesser things than an all-out invasion. One of those would be the threats to outer islands, and I think it’s a grave security concern of Taiwan’s,” he told the Japan Times.___AP senior video producer Johnson Lai contributed to this report.",2023/2/2,655,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798463,What’s new for Medicare in 2023?,"A new year means changes to Medicare, including updated premiums and deductibles and sometimes big policy moves. In 2023, there’s a little of everything: Some costs have gone down, others have increased, and there are some notable tweaks to how Medicare works.

            Understanding what’s new can help you get the most from your Medicare benefits. Here are some key 2023 updates, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

            PART B COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN











            Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers needs like doctor visits and durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs and walkers . Everyone pays a Part B monthly premium , even people with Medicare Advantage plans.

            In 2023, the Part B standard premium is $164.90 per month, down from $170.10 per month in 2022. If you have a higher income, you may pay more . The Part B deductible dropped to $226 in 2023, down from $233 in 2022.

            PART A COSTS HAVE GONE UP

            Medicare Part A is hospital insurance that covers inpatient stays in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Most people don’t pay a premium for Part A , but for those who do, those premiums increased to $506 per month, up from $499 in 2022. And the deductible for a hospital stay is $1,600 in 2023 for each benefit period, up from $1,556 in 2022.

            Copays for inpatient stays in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are also up. These are costs per benefit period: 

            — $400 per day for days 61 to 90 in a hospital (up from $389).

            — $800 per “lifetime reserve day” after day 90 in a hospital, up to a limit of 60 days in your lifetime (up from $778).

            — $200 per day for days 21 to 100 in a skilled nursing facility (up from $194.50).

            INSULIN COSTS ARE CAPPED

            New this year, insulin costs are limited to $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries, and there is no deductible. Although the change went into effect Jan. 1, plans have a deadline of March to put this system in place. If you pay more than $35 a month for insulin in January and/or February, ask your plan about reimbursement for the overage.

            Starting in July, insulin used with a traditional pump covered by Medicare will also be capped at $35 for a month’s supply.

            MEDICARE START DATES HAVE SHIFTED

            It used to be that for certain Medicare sign-up times, your coverage started two to three months later, which could cause gaps in health care. Starting this year, those dates have changed.

            If you sign up for Medicare the month of your 65th birthday or during the three months after, your coverage now starts the month after you sign up . Similarly, if you sign up for Medicare during the general enrollment period from Jan. 1 to March 31 each year, your coverage starts the next month. (It used to start July 1.)

            SHINGLES VACCINES ARE COVERED

            All adult vaccines covered under Medicare Part D and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are now covered in full. This includes the shingles vaccine and the tetanus-diphtheria-whooping cough vaccine. Previously, these vaccines may have been subject to deductibles and cost sharing.

            MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN RATINGS ARE LOWER

            Each year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gives every Medicare Advantage plan a star rating ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being excellent. Overall, the average star rating for Medicare Advantage plans, weighted by enrollment, is 4.15 in 2023, down from 4.37 in 2022 . This change doesn’t mean quality has dropped.

            In fact, last year’s plan ratings were unusually high because of a pandemic policy that applied a natural disaster exception to all Medicare Advantage plans — instead of just the ones in areas affected by something like a hurricane or flood. As a result, plan ratings in 2022 were higher than usual, and this year’s correction likely represents a truer rating of plans.

            PEOPLE WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE CAN GET MORE DRUG COVERAGE

            Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease used to lose their benefits 36 months after a kidney transplant, unless they were otherwise eligible for Medicare. But starting in October, they could apply for immunosuppressive drug coverage through a new benefit called Medicare Part B Immunosuppressive Drug , or Part B-ID, which started Jan. 1.

            The premium for this benefit is $97.10 per month in 2023. This benefit covers only continuous immunosuppressive drugs, and these beneficiaries cannot have other health coverage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798465,Israeli police: American arrested for vandalizing church,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police on Thursday arrested an American tourist after he allegedly knocked down and broke a statue of Jesus in a church in Jerusalem's Old City.

            Images on social media showed the statue laying horizontally on the floor after apparently being pulled down from a stand at the church. The incident occurred in the Church of the Flagellation, which is located on the Via Dolorosa, the route believed to have been walked by Jesus to his crucifixion.

            Police said they made the arrest with the assistance of a church security guard. Video on social media showed a man sitting atop the alleged vandal who is heard saying “you can't have idols in Jerusalem, this is the holy city.”











            Police said the man's mental health was being assessed. The American Embassy declined to comment. 

            The incident came as tensions run high in Jerusalem and the region following a bloody week. An Israeli military raid in the West Bank killed 10 Palestinians, mostly militants but also a 61-year-old woman. A Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue in east Jerusalem killed seven people, including a 14-year-old.

            The unrest comes in the first weeks of Israel's new, far-right government, some of whose ultranationalist, religious members have used inflammatory, anti-Arab rhetoric.

            In a statement, the Custodia Terrae Sanctae, the Catholic Church's custodians of holy sites in the Holy Land, said “this hate crime joins a list of attacks all of which targeted the Christian community in Israel in the past month.” 

            “It is not a coincidence that the violent dialogue in Israeli society is translated also into these grave acts,” it said, calling on Israeli law enforcement to take action to halt such incidents. 

            Father Nikodemus Schnabel of the Dormition Abbey just outside the Old City linked the incident to the government's character. 

            “Welcome to the new Christian-hating Israel, encouraged and supported by the current government!” he tweeted.

            Police said they view damage to religious institutions as serious.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police on Thursday arrested an American tourist after he allegedly knocked down and broke a statue of Jesus in a church in Jerusalem's Old City.Images on social media showed the statue laying horizontally on the floor after apparently being pulled down from a stand at the church.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798466,Sony CFO to lead entertainment-electronic giant as president,"TOKYO (AP) — Sony appointed a veteran executive as its president Thursday to lead the Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate through changing times, and reported a decline in its profit in the last quarter.Hiroki Totoki, Sony's chief financial officer, will become its president and COO, Sony Corp. said in a statement.Kenichiro Yoshida remains chairman and chief executive, signaling continuity at the Tokyo-based maker of PlayStation game machines, Bravia TVs and Spider-Man movies.Also Thursday, Sony reported a 6% decline in net profit for the October-December quarter, at 326.8 billion yen ($2.5 billion). That was down from 346 billion yen a year earlier, as profitability in its financial services was countered by losses in its Pictures division. Quarterly sales grew 13% to 3 trillion yen ($23 billion).Yoshida proposed the executive change last year to strengthen Sony’s management across its diverse operations. It won unanimous board approval Thursday.Sony, for decades synonymous with Japan’s technological prowess, brought mobile entertainment to the world with the music-on-the-move Walkman more than four decades ago. In recent years it been faulted for struggling to coordinate its sprawling operations spanning financial services to video games and music to digital cameras and robot dogs.Totoki said he will try to live up to the challenge of leading the iconic company.“I would like to create a positive spiral that begins with Sony being chosen by customers, which then energizes our employees, enables us to attract more new talent, increases our corporate value, and ultimately enables us to give back to society,” he said.The games division has faced headwinds lately, but its new HBO series “The Last of Us,” for instance, is proving popular and is expected to boost sales in coming months.Sony is forecasting an 870 billion yen ($6.8 billion) profit on 11.5 trillion yen ($89 billion) sales for the fiscal year that ends in March. The latest projection is an improvement over last year's. But expected profit still falls short of the 882 billion yen Sony recorded in the previous fiscal year.___Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",2023/2/2,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798467,Global stocks rise after Fed sees inflation improving,"BEIJING (AP) — Global stock markets and Wall Street futures rose Thursday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is moving toward lower inflation but more interest rate hikes are planned.London and Frankfurt opened higher. Shanghai and Tokyo advanced. Oil prices rose.Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index rose after the Fed increased its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, smaller than previous hikes. Chair Jerome Powell said the “disinflationary process has started” but “ongoing increases” in rates will be needed.Traders hope central banks that raised rates repeatedly over the past year will scale back plans for more hikes as inflation eases. Some expect a U.S. cut before 2024, though Powell said he anticipates none this year.Markets put a “dovish interpretation” on Powell's comments despite his warning that it was too early to declare victory, said Venkateswaran Lavanya of Mizuho Bank in a report.The gap between market pricing and Fed plans ""appears to have widened,” Lavanya wrote. “This leaves room for a rude shock down the road.”In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.6% to 7,808.83. The DAX in Frankfurt gained 1.4% to 15,396.36 and the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1% at 7,148.88.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 future was up 0.4%. That for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1%.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 1% after Powell's news conference for its highest close in two months.“We can now say, I think for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started,” Powell said. He said his “base case” is that the Fed’s inflation target of 2% can be achieved “without a really significant downturn or really big increase in unemployment.”That appeared to encourage investors who worry central banks might be willing to push the global economy into recession to cool inflation that is near multi-decade highs.The Dow recovered from a loss to gain less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2%.On Thursday, the Shanghai Composite Index gained less than 0.1% to 3,285.67 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.2% to 27,402.05. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.5% to 21,958.36.The Kospi in Seoul was up 0.8% at 2,466.03 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 added 0.1% to 7,511.60.India's Sensex shed less than 0.1% to 59,664.17. New Zealand and Jakarta advanced while Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur declined.Wednesday's announcement raised the Fed's overnight lending rate to a 16-year high of 4.5% to 4.75%, up from close to zero early last year.Data on Wednesday gave a mixed picture of the U.S. job market, a factor in inflation expectations.Hiring is resilient despite repeated rate hikes. While that helps workers, it adds to worries that wage gains could add to upward pressure on prices.Private payrolls rose by 106,000 in January, according to ADP, a payroll processor. That was a smaller gain than the previous month and below forecasts.A separate U.S. government report indicated more strength. It said the number of job openings increased to 11 million in December, better than expected.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude rose 42 cents to $76.83 cents to $77.07 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $2.46 on Wednesday to $76.41. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, added 39 cents to $83.23 per barrel in London.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798468,"France seizes Iran assault rifles, missiles heading to Yemen","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — French naval forces in January seized thousands of assault rifles, machine guns and anti-tank missiles in the Gulf of Oman coming from Iran and heading to Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said Thursday.While Iran denied being involved, images of the weapons released by the U.S. military's Central Command showed them to be similar to others captured by American forces in other shipments tied to Tehran.The announcement comes as Iran faces increasing Western pressure over its shipment of drones to arm Russia during its war on Ukraine, as well as for its violent monthslong crackdown targeting protesters.Regional tensions also have heightened after a suspected Israeli drone attack on a military workshop in the central Iranian city of Isfahan on Saturday. Previous cycles of violence since the collapse of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers have seen the Islamic Republic launch retaliatory attacks at sea.The seizure occurred Jan. 15 in the Gulf of Oman, a body of water that stretches from the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, through to the Arabian Sea and onto the Indian Ocean. CENTCOM described the interdiction as happening “along routes historically used to traffic weapons unlawfully from Iran to Yemen.”A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who took the country's capital in late 2014 and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the country's internationally recognized government since March 2015.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the seizure, identifying the forces involved as elite French special forces. Two officials with knowledge of the interdiction, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly on the operation's details, similarly identified the French as carrying out the seizure.The French military did not respond to requests for comment about capturing the weapons. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani in an online message rejected the assessment Tehran supplied the weapons on the vessel and described the accusations as ""politically motivated.”While France maintains a naval base in Abu Dhabi, it typically takes a quieter approach in the region while maintaining a diplomatic presence in Iran.Iran has long denied arming the Houthis, though Western nations, U.N. experts and others have traced weaponry ranging from night-vision scopes, rifles and missiles back to Tehran. In November, the U.S. Navy said it found 70 tons of a missile fuel component hidden among bags of fertilizer aboard a ship bound to Yemen from Iran. Houthi ballistic missile fire has targeted Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the past.Images taken Wednesday by CENTCOM and analyzed by the AP, showed a variety of weapons on board an unidentified ship apparently docked at a port. The weapons appeared to include Chinese-made Type 56 rifles, Russian-made Molot AKS20Us and PKM-pattern machine guns. All have appeared in other seizures of weapons attributed to Iran.CENTCOM said the seizure included more than 3,000 rifles and 578,000 rounds of ammunition. The released images also showed 23 container-launched anti-tank missiles, which also have turned up in other shipments tied to Iran.The war in Yemen has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. However, Saudi-led airstrikes haven't been recorded in Yemen since the kingdom began a cease-fire at the end of March 2022, according to the Yemen Data Project.That cease-fire expired in October despite diplomatic efforts to renew it. That has led to fears the war could again escalate. More than 150,000 people have been killed in Yemen during the fighting, including over 14,500 civilians.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/2/2,244,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798469,Militant who killed 101 at Pakistan mosque wore uniform,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide bomber who killed 101 people at a decades-old mosque in northwest Pakistan this week had disguised himself in a police uniform and did not raise suspicion among guards, the provincial police chief said on Thursday.Moazzam Jah Ansari said the suicide bomber, who arrived with a motorcycle to the mosque on a police compound, had been identified. Police were close to arresting suspects in Monday's attack, one of the deadliest ever in Peshawar, the capital in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Ansari provided no further details about who was responsible, but Pakistan’s defense and interior ministers in speeches to Parliament this week blamed the Pakistani Taliban for orchestrating the bombing. They said the insurgents had sanctuaries in Afghanistan.“We will avenge the martyrdom of each and every policeman,"" Ansari told a news conference.Ansari said those who are responsible for the attack, including the mastermind and facilitators, will be arrested and punished under the law.The blast collapsed the roof of the 50-year-old mosque, killing 101 people, mostly policemen. Two hundred twenty-five people were injured. He said six or seven policemen were “martyred"" by the bombing but most casualties were caused when the sprawling roof, which was supported by outside walls but no pillars, caved in.Footage released by police shows the suspected bomber disguised as a policeman walking toward the compound with a motorcycle, giving the impression that the vehicle wasn't working.More than 300 worshippers were praying in the Sunni mosque, with more approaching, when the bomber set off his explosives vest. Ansari said the attacker was not searched because guards assumed that he was one of their colleagues.“Yes, I admit that it was a security lapse and I take responsibility for it,” Ansari said.He dismissed reports that the mosque had been hit by a drone, or planted explosives.“There is no truth in such speculations and claims,"" Ansari said. “It was a suicide bombing.""Ansari spoke a day after dozens of police officers in a rare move joined a peace march organized by the members of civil society groups in Peshawar, demanding protection for themselves.Hours after the bombing, Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan accused the Pakistani Taliban, known by the acronym TTP, of carrying out the attack. In their speeches to Parliament, they said militants operated from neighboring Afghan territory. Pakistan wants the Afghan Taliban to take action against the TTP group.Shortly after the bombing, a TTP commander claimed responsibility, but more than 10 hours after the attack the chief spokesman for the group distanced the TTP from the carnage, saying it was not its policy to attack mosques.On Wednesday, Afghanistan’s Taliban-appointed foreign minister, however, had asked Pakistani authorities to look for the reasons behind militant violence in their country instead of blaming Afghanistan. The comments from Amir Khan Muttaqi came after Pakistani officials said the attackers who orchestrated Monday’s suicide bombing were using Afghan soil to target civilians and security forces.Pakistan Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif visited a hospital in Peshawar after the bombing and vowed “stern action” against those behind the attack. Pakistan, which is mostly Sunni Muslim, has seen a surge in militant attacks since November when the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire with government forces.The violence has increased in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops pulled out of the country after 20 years of war.The TTP is separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban.___Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this story from Islamabad",2023/2/2,113,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798476,EU officials visit Kyiv as Russia strikes civilian target,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Top European Union officials arrived in Kyiv on Thursday for talks with the Ukrainian government as rescue crews dug through the rubble of an apartment building in eastern Ukraine that was struck by a Russian missile, killing at least three people and wounding 21 others.The scene of devastation in the eastern Donetsk provincial city of Kramatorsk, where emergency workers spent the night searching for survivors after the missile hit late Wednesday, served as a grim reminder of the war’s toll almost a year after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.At least one more victim was believed to be under the debris, Ukraine's presidential office said.Russia has frequently struck apartment buildings during the war, causing civilian casualties, although the Kremlin has denied targeting residential structures.Russian shelling across Ukraine over the previous 24 hours killed at least eight civilians and wounded 29 others, the presidential office said. Along with the victims in Kramatorsk, the toll included four who died when a Russian mortar shell hit a basement where they were sheltering in the northeastern Chernihiv region.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was due to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell before what officials described as a summit on Friday.Borrell tweeted that the visit aimed “to convey EU’s strongest message of support to all Ukrainians defending their country.”EU assistance for Ukraine, he said, has reached 50 billion euros ($55 billion) since the start of Russia’s war on Feb. 24.“Europe stood united with Ukraine from day one. And will still stand with you to win and rebuild,” Borrell tweeted.It was Von der Leyen’s fourth visit since the invasion. The last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 — a few months before the war started.Ukraine’s anti-corruption drive was expected to be on the agenda of the talks. Kyiv’s long path toward potential membership in the 27-nation bloc will be a key issue under discussion, with stamping out corruption a key condition for joining.Von der Leyen tweeted: “We are here together to show that the EU stands by Ukraine as firmly as ever. And to deepen further our support and cooperation.”Zelenskyy on Wednesday took aim at corrupt officials for the second time in the space of a week. Several high-ranking officials were dismissed.Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform in a country long gripped by graft.The latest corruption allegations came as Western allies are channeling billions of dollars to help Kyiv fight Moscow’s forces and as the Ukrainian government is introducing reforms so it can potentially join the EU one day.Ukraine's government is keen to get more Western military aid, on top of the tanks pledged last week, as the warring sides are expected to launch new offensives once winter ends. Kyiv is now asking for fighter jets.Kyiv expects Russia to “attempt something” on the Feb. 24 anniversary, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told France’s BFM television. He stressed his government’s urgency on getting weapons without delay.“We are telling our partners that we too need to be ready as fast as possible,” he said in an interview late Wednesday.U.S. President Joe Biden has ruled out providing F-16s to Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday during a trip to the Philippines that the focus of American aid is to increase Ukraine’s military capabilities by sending artillery, armor, air defense and providing training to Ukrainian troops.The U.S. is “focused on providing Ukraine the capability that it needs to be effective in its upcoming anticipated counteroffensive in the spring,” Austin said.“And so we’re doing everything we can to get them the capabilities that they need right now to be effective on the battlefield,” he said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that strategy would backfire, by prompting Moscow to ensure that potential Russian targets were out of range.“The longer range the weapons supplied to the Kyiv regime, the farther we would need to push them away from the territories that are part of our country,” Lavrov said in an interview with Russian state media.He said Moscow would like to see the war end, but noted that the length of the conflict was less important than its outcome: to protect Russian territory and “people who want to remain part of the Russian culture,” reaffirming Moscow’s declared goal to defend Russian speakers in Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/2/2,107,World

            “We’ll just hope for as quick a return as possible,” Braathen said in an online news conference, where he was reminded he missed the previous worlds in 2021 after knee surgery. 











            “It’s quite unbelievable that it would happen twice in a row,” he said. “It’s a part of life, man.”

            Braathen, whose mother is Brazilian, has been a standout personality on and off the snow this season.

            Skiing with his personal trademark painted fingernails, he has two wins in slalom and one in giant slalom, plus three more podium finishes including last week in a floodlit slalom at Schladming, Austria.

            His illness began during a break in Paris where he said he felt ""quite intense pain” from stomach cramps. It got worse on returning to his training base in Austria.

            “I’ve never had anything like it. I couldn’t move,” he said. “The smallest moves, changes of position in bed, and my entire body would scream.”

            Braathen had surgery on Tuesday and announced it on Thursday in an Instagram post that included a photograph from his hospital bed.

            “I’ve been through surgery and I’m blessed that it went successfully,” he wrote. “Hopefully I’ll be back in a couple of weeks.”

            At the worlds, the men’s giant slalom is on Feb. 17 and the slalom closes the two-week championships on Feb. 19.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798480,African countries lack 'immediate access' to cholera vaccine,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa’s public health agency says countries with deadly cholera outbreaks on the continent have no “immediate access” to vaccines amid a global supply shortage.

            The acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ahmed Ogwell, told journalists on Thursday that the agency is working with the World Health Organization and the vaccine alliance GAVI on ways to obtain more doses.

            The Africa CDC is also working with two local manufacturers to explore if their facilities can be repurposed to manufacture cholera vaccines, Ogwell said. He didn't say which ones.











            WHO and its partners recommended in October that countries temporarily switch to using a single dose of the cholera vaccine instead of two because of the supply shortage as outbreaks of the water-borne disease surge globally. They said one dose of vaccine has proven effective in stopping outbreaks “even though evidence on the exact duration of protection is limited” and appears to be lower in children.

            WHO noted that Haiti and Syria also are trying to contain large outbreaks. WHO and partner agencies manage a stockpile of cholera vaccines that are dispensed free to countries that need them.

            Malawi in southern Africa especially is struggling with a cholera outbreak. The country has recorded 3,577 new cases including 111 deaths in the past week, Ogwell said. They make up the bulk of the new cholera cases on the continent.

            Since the beginning of 2023, there have been 27,300 new cases of cholera including 687 deaths in five African countries, Ogwell said.

            The WHO has said climate change could make cholera epidemics more common, as the bacteria that causes the disease can reproduce more quickly in warmer water.NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa’s public health agency says countries with deadly cholera outbreaks on the continent have no “immediate access” to vaccines amid a global supply shortage.The acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ahmed Ogwell, told journalists on Thursday that the agency is working with the World Health Organization and the vaccine alliance GAVI on ways to obtain more doses.The Africa CDC is also working with two local manufacturers to explore if their facilities can be repurposed to manufacture cholera vaccines, Ogwell said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798493,Raphinha gets another chance for Barcelona with Dembélé out,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Last year, after a season without titles following the exit of Lionel Messi, Barcelona took the risky decision of selling off a part of its future earnings in exchange for quick cash it could turn into talented signings.

            The group of newcomers who arrived at Camp Nou included two players — Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha — tasked with bringing back the punch to an attack that was lackluster following the departure Messi.

            Lewandowski did not disappoint. The former Bayern Munich striker assumed the role of a team leader and has not stopped chewing up opposing defenses in the Spanish league.











            Raphinha, however, soon became a second option for Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez, who favored having Ousmane Dembélé as a right winger to accompany Lewandowski.

            But a door opened for the Brazil international last week when Dembélé injured a muscle in his left thigh just when he was enjoying his best campaign at Barcelona.

            Raphinha made the most of his opportunity on Wednesday when he scored the opening goal in a 2-1 win at Real Betis that strengthened Barcelona's lead in the standings. Lewandowski added a second to take his league-leading tally to 14 goals.

            His goal should help Raphinha keep his starting spot when Barcelona hosts a struggling Sevilla on Sunday.

            Barcelona leads the league over Real Madrid by eight points before the defending champions play Valencia in a game that was postponed for the Spanish Super Cup. Madrid will then visit Mallorca on Sunday.

            Using part of the money it generated from the sale of future television rights and other assets, Barcelona paid Leeds a reported 60 million euros ($65 million) for Raphinha and signed him to a contract through 2027. At his presentation in August, club president Joan Laporta could not help recalling the great Brazilians who have played for Barcelona, including Neymar, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Ronaldo.

            “The ‘jogo bonito’ ('beautiful game') is back,” Laporta declared.

            But Raphinha failed to produce the same havoc in defenses that Dembélé could with his speed and dribbling. Instead, he had trouble in one-on-one situations and was prone to losing possession.

            Considering the other attacking players Xavi has on his squad, including Spain internationals Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati, and the lasting financial drag attached to the money spent on Raphinha, his signing was beginning to look like a questionable expense.

            After his goal at Betis, Xavi underscored that Raphinha provides two critical things: his finishing touch and his help in defense by pressuring to recover the ball.

            “He was decisive,” Xavi said about Raphinha. “He works for the whole team. He is very important, like Robert. I am pleased.”

            That was goal No. 5 since Raphinha arrived. It helped Barcelona reach the impressive tally of 50 points at the season’s midway point.

            Barcelona has won the league four times after reaching 50 points or more after 19 matches. It only failed to lift the trophy in that situation in 2013-14.

            “We are going through a good moment,” Raphinha said. “The points are a result of our effort. We remain confident for the rest of the season.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798494,Blackmail trial of Lewandowski's former manager opens,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The former manager of soccer player Robert Lewandowski went on trial in Poland on Thursday for allegedly blackmailing the Barcelona striker and his wife.

            Cezary Kucharski, who is accused of trying to extort about $20 million from the couple, arrived at a Warsaw court for the start of the case. The judge ordered the proceedings to be held behind closed doors.

            Kucharski had publicly accused Lewandowski and his wife of tax irregularities in Germany. He is accused demanding money from them in return for silence.











            Lewandowski, who has won two FIFA best player awards, denied any wrongdoing and sued Kucharski — Lewandowski’s manager for almost 10 years, up to 2018.

            Kucharski, a former Poland national team soccer player, could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

            Kucharski was hospitalized last year in Spain and temporarily put into an induced coma.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798495,World Cup winner Raphael Varane retires from France team,"PARIS (AP) — France defender Raphaël Varane announced his retirement from the national team on Thursday, the second major player to leave Les Bleus following the World Cup final defeat to Argentina.

            The 29-year-old Varane made his debut 10 years ago and played 93 times. He was arguably the tournament's standout defender when France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia. 

            But he fell to the ground exhausted deep into extra time against Argentina in Qatar last December. France lost the final on penalty kicks after a 3-3 draw. 











            “Representing our magnificent country for a decade has been one of the greatest honors in my life. Every time I wore the blue jersey I felt an immense pride,"" Varane wrote on his Instagram page. ""The duty of giving everything, of playing with my heart and of winning every time I stepped onto the field. I've been thinking about this for a few months and I've decided it's the right time for me to take my international retirement.”

            Varane, who plays in the English Premier League for Manchester United, was five years old when France won its first World Cup in 1998.

            The sight of Zinedine Zidane scoring twice against Brazil, and France celebrating a 3-0 win, sparked his desire for the game.

            “As a child I remember watching France ’98, this team, these players who filled me with indescribable emotions. It was a dream to emulate our heroes and, 20 years later, I experienced one of the greatest moments of my life,” Varane added. “I will never forget this.”

            Last month, goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris quit the national team after a record 145 appearances.

            France coach Didier Deschamps must rebuild the team without two of his most consistent players heading toward next year's European Championship.

            Deschamps said Varane warned him this week. 

            ""He's an intelligent lad, who knows how to take the time to think, to weigh up the pros and cons before making a decision,” Deschamps said. ""Now that our paths are going separate ways, I would like to pay tribute to his honesty and his unrelenting commitment to the blue jersey. Raphaël played a central part on and off the field in the past decade.”

            Along with Lloris and forward Antoine Griezmann, he was the player the coach always relied on.

            Deschamps, a former midfielder who captained France when it won the 1998 World Cup, said he reluctantly accepted Varane's decision.

            “I experienced a little bit of a similar situation to his,” Deschamps said. “I understand his point of view and respect his decision, even though it might seem a bit of a pity given all that he's achieved with the national team.”

            An elegant ball-playing defender, Varane stood out with his slick passing and his excellent positional play. His great anticipation and turn of speed allowed him to make crucial interceptions look easy.

            A strong man-marker despite his slight build, Varane was also good in the air. One of his five goals for Les Bleus was a firm header in the quarterfinal win against Uruguay at the 2018 World Cup.

            Deschamps praised Varane as one of the finest players he's coached.

            “Obviously, I can't turn this page without feeling a certain emotion, given the connection we've built since 2012. Along with Lloris, he was in every single one of my (squad) lists, barring injury,” Deschamps said. “I remember how authoritative he was during our World Cup playoff against Ukraine in 2013. His performance was of the highest standard. One of many.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798496,6N: Ireland without Furlong and Wales lose Halfpenny,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — Tadhg Furlong failed to recover in time from injury so Finlay Bealham will prop up Ireland against Wales in the Six Nations in Cardiff this weekend.

            Furlong was coming back from an ankle issue when he hurt his calf in training last weekend. This will be the first Ireland game he's around for and not started in two years. Coach Andy Farrell hoped the tighthead will be ready for next week against France.

            Australia-born Bealham has only four starts in 27 caps, and will make his first Six Nations start at age 31 on Saturday.











            Farrell was impressed with Bealham's form since backing up in the autumn tests and returning to Connacht.

            “His performances since then have been top drawer,” Farrell said on Thursday. “The last game he played, he scored a hat trick. He's scrummaging very well, so he deserves a start.”

            The inclusion of Bealham and captain Jonathan Sexton are the only changes to the 15 which started the last test of 2022, the 13-10 home win over Australia.

            Sexton was a late withdrawal and replaced by Jack Crowley, who made his first test start. Ross Byrne, who replaced Crowley, kicked the late winning penalty.

            Byrne was picked ahead of Crowley on an experienced bench which included Cian Healy, Iain Henderson, Conor Murray and Bundee Aki. Aki returned from suspension to come off the bench against the Wallabies, but Farrell has retained Stuart McCloskey in the midfield after he started all three autumn tests.

            Wales had to make a change after Leigh Halfpenny had a back spasm on Thursday and was withdrawn.

            Liam Williams was parachuted into fullback from outside the team. Williams missed the autumn internationals because of a dislocated shoulder, and has not started for Wales since the June tour of South Africa.

            Halfpenny was due to win his 98th cap on Saturday and make a first Wales start for 19 months.

            ___

            Lineups:

            Wales: Liam Williams, Josh Adams, George North, Joe Hawkins, Rio Dyer, Dan Biggar, Tomos Williams; Taulupe Faletau, Justin Tipuric, Jac Morgan, Alun Wyn Jones. Adam Beard, Tomas Francis, Ken Owens (captain), Gareth Thomas. Reserves: Scott Baldwin, Rhys Carre, Dillon Lewis, Dafydd Jenkins, Tommy Reffell, Rhys Webb, Owen Williams, Alex Cuthbert.

            Ireland: Hugo Keenan, Mack Hansen, Garry Ringrose, Stuart McCloskey, James Lowe, Jonathan Sexton (captain), Jamison Gibson Park; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, Peter O'Mahony, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Finlay Bealham, Dan Sheehan, Andrew Porter.

            The massive losses are a rare setback for the coal mining tycoon from western India's Gujarat state and raise questions about what lies ahead. 

            Expansion has been at the heart of Adani’s success story. The son of a middle-class family in the Gujarat capital, Ahmedabad, he quit college to become a diamond trader in the country's financial capital, Mumbai. He returned home to join his brother in importing plastics before establishing Adani Enterprises in the 1980s, trading in everything from shoes to buckets.

            Adani shifted to investing in ports, construction and coal mining as India opened up its economy in the 1990s. A new middle class emerged and the ambitious businessman placed bets on providing energy to serve them.

            Adani’s first big project, Mundra Port, is now India’s largest commercial port and he is the country’s biggest private port operator. Within a decade, he also became India’s largest developer and operator of coal mines.

            Today, Adani companies also operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. He has his eyes set on becoming the world’s largest renewable energy player by 2030.

            Citing market volatility, late Wednesday his flagship Adani Enterprises scrapped a $2.5 billion share offering that, despite the bloodletting in the group's shares and a 28% plunge that day in its own share price, had been oversubscribed.

            In a video address Thursday, Adani said the share offering was canceled to “insulate investors from potential losses.”

            “For me, the interest of my investors is paramount and everything else is secondary,” he said.

            The share offering was seen as a test of investor confidence in the self-made industrialist, whose ascent has been celebrated as a symbol of India’s economic ambitions. The Adani Group said in a statement that canceling the offering would not “have any impact on our existing operations and future plans.” 

            The Adani Group said its balance sheet was “very healthy” and its history of servicing debt was “impeccable.” 

            Still, Brian Freitas, a New Zealand-based analyst with Periscope Analytics who has researched the Adani Group, said the collapse in share prices for India's second-largest conglomerate may hinder its future plans for expansion.

            “It’s going to be difficult for them to raise new money,"" he said.

            Adani shares are still losing value. Shares in Adani Enterprises tumbled 27% Thursday, while stock in six other Adani companies fell 5%-10%.

            The tycoon, who favors a plain white shirt and dark trousers over fancy dress and is said to be affable and quiet spoken, slid from being the world’s third richest man to the 13th as his fortune sank to $72 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Prior to the Hindenburg report, his net worth was about $120 billion.

            More vitally, the company is now without the funds it had hoped to raise in this week's offering. Companies often launch such share offerings to finance growth while reducing debt.

            “Thanks to the short-seller, Adani’s plans will get slowed down significantly,” said R.N. Bhaskar, a journalist who wrote a biography on Adani.

            Analysts say that rapid expansion has largely been fueled by borrowing. The group's debt stands at $30 billion, out of which $9 billion is from Indian banks, the group's chief financial officer said recently. 

            After the stock rout of the past week, lenders may deem his group high risk and toughen their criteria for borrowing, like demanding higher interest rates or more collateral, said Freitas.

            “Equity investors are going to be wary because the stock isn't doing well -- if they can't raise equity, they will have to go to the debt market,"" he added. “Given the situation, foreign lenders will think twice before lending any new money to Adani.” 

            Despite Adani's longstanding ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarati, and other powerful politicians, the government has so far remained silent on his recent troubles even as pressure from the political opposition for an investigation into Adani's situation grows.

            In recent years, Adani has pumped money into sectors like agriculture, defense and renewable energy -- all seen as high priorities for the Indian government.

            Like Adani's commitment to the port in Israel’s Haifa, many of the group's overseas infrastructure projects, in countries such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania, have served as an Indian counterweight to rival China's holdings.

            The Haifa deal was a coup for India, located close to another port managed by the Shanghai International Port Group.

            “India is working with great fervor with Israel on defense and technology, and Adani now has a port there. You think the Indian government can sniff at that?"" said Bhaskar. “The thing is, you can't wish away Adani -- because he is indispensable at this point.”

            He expects Adani to remain undaunted.

            “The more challenging a situation gets, the more defiant and creative he becomes to overcome it,"" Bhaskar said.NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian billionaire Gautam Adani grinned as he posed this week for photos with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu after acquiring one of the country's main ports, in Haifa.“I promise you that in the years to come, we will transform the skyline we see around us,” said Adani, his manner upbeat even as his business empire was losing billions. Investors have been dumping Adani shares for more than a week after U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research put out a report alleging his businesses have engaged in fraud and stock price manipulation. The Adani group has denied this.Before the debacle, Adani, 60, was Asia's richest man and the third wealthiest in the world, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798499,It's Wall Street's favorite year of the presidential cycle,"NEW YORK (AP) — You may be sick of politics, but Wall Street is just getting to its favorite part of the presidential calendar.

            The third year of the presidential cycle has historically been the best for the stock market. Going back to the start of 1945, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 15.9% during the last full year before an election, compared with an overall average of 9.2% for every year. 

            Most of that better-than-usual performance is packed into the first half of Year 3, according to data from CFRA Research. In the first three months of Year 3, for example, the S&P 500 has historically climbed an average of 6.9%, which is more than triple the 2.1% average for every first quarter over that span. 











            One line of thinking says Wall Street rises in anticipation of the White House passing economically popular measures in hopes of staying in office. The difference could also just be statistical luck. But it’s happened enough that professional investors pay at least some attention to it, even if not all the candidates running in 2024 are known yet.

            The last time a president was in Year 3, in 2019 under Donald Trump, the S&P 500 soared nearly 29%. 

            This year, there may be less appetite for big government programs that could stimulate the economy, because they could also potentially ignite inflationary pressures. 

            Averages also only tell part of the story. Across 23 completed four-year terms since 1925, the S&P 500 gain in Year 3 was the best seven times according to Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Group — better than random, but not by much.

            The last time a first-term Democratic president was in Year 3, as Joe Biden is now, was in 2011 under Barack Obama. That time, the S&P 500 ended the year virtually flat. Much of that was because of a steep tumble in the summer, triggered by worries about the European debt crisis and the downgrade of the U.S. debt rating by Standard & Poor’s. 

            “That was one of the few times where we really had nothing,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “Investors usually expect the president to try to ensure that he gets reelected by stimulating the economy.”NEW YORK (AP) — You may be sick of politics, but Wall Street is just getting to its favorite part of the presidential calendar.The third year of the presidential cycle has historically been the best for the stock market.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798500,João Cancelo gives Bayern new energy ahead of key games,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) — João Cancelo might have been the missing piece in Bayern Munich's puzzle.

            The Portuguese fullback, for so long a key player at Manchester City, looked a perfect fit on his Bayern debut, needing only 17 minutes to set up the opening goal in a 4-0 win over Mainz in the German Cup on Wednesday.

            The game gave an indication of Cancelo's greatest asset for Bayern — his versatility — and why the German champions could make his loan deal permanent for 70 million euros ($77 million).











            Cancelo played on the right of midfield, not the left back position he usually occupied for Pep Guardiola at City, and Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann played with a back three like his old Leipzig team did, not Bayern's usual back four. Nagelsmann explained the idea was to exert more pressure through the center of midfield against a defensive-minded opponent. It worked as Bayern picked up its first win of 2023 following three 1-1 draws in the Bundesliga.

            That doesn't mean Cancelo won't play his more familiar left back role, too. The formation switch Wednesday was more of a variation than a fundamental change in how Bayern plays. The absence of Lucas Hernández with a severe knee injury picked up during France's World Cup campaign left Bayern short of cover on the left and relying on the recently injury-prone Alphonso Davies.

            In the longer term, and especially if Bayern activates Cancelo's buy option, he might end up at right back, the position he generally plays for the Portuguese national team. Benjamin Pavard's performances there have been less than convincing at times this season and the French defender has been linked with a move to Barcelona at the end of the season. Noussair Mazraoui is a versatile fullback but he hasn't played since Morocco's history-making run to the World Cup semifinals. Bayern says he has inflamed tissue around his heart following a coronavirus infection.

            Bayern is just about on track to meet its aims for the season — top of the Bundesliga, still in the German Cup, a perfect six wins from six in the Champions League — but there's been a precarious look to the German champions at times this season. Bayern only leads the league by a one point and its opponent in the last 16 of the Champions League is Paris Saint-Germain, with the first leg on Feb. 14.

            Sunday's game against Wolfsburg could be a good test of how Bayern functions under pressure with Cancelo on board. Bayern may be unbeaten against Wolfsburg since 2015, but the team from northern Germany is a tenacious competitor with an eye on Europa League and potentially Champions League qualification — not to mention 12 goals from its first three Bundesliga games of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798544,Psychedelic churches in US pushing boundaries of religion,"HILDALE, Utah (AP) — The tea tasted bitter and earthy, but Lorenzo Gonzales drank it anyway. On that frigid night in remote Utah, he was hoping for a life-changing experience, which is how he found himself inside a tent with two dozen others waiting for the psychedelic brew known as ayahuasca to kick in. 

            Soon, the gentle sounds of a guitar were drowned out by people vomiting — a common downside of the drug. Some gagged; several threw up in buckets next to them. 

            Gonzales started howling, sobbing, laughing and repeatedly babbling “wah, wah” like a child. Facilitators from Hummingbird Church placed him face down on the grass, calming him momentarily before he started laughing and crawling on all fours. 











            “I seen these dark veins come up in this big red light, and then I seen this image of the devil,” Gonzales said later. He had quieted only when his wife, Flor, put her hand on his shoulder and prayed.

            His journey to this small town along the Arizona-Utah border is part of a growing global trend of people turning to ayahuasca in search of spiritual enlightenment and an experience they say brings them closer to God than traditional religious services. Many hope the psychedelic tea will heal physical and mental afflictions after conventional medications and therapy failed. Their problems include eating disorders, depression, substance use disorders and PTSD.

            The rising demand for ayahuasca has led to hundreds of churches like this one, which advocates say are protected from prosecution by a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In that case, a New Mexico branch of a Brazilian-based ayahuasca church won the right to use the drug as a sacrament — even though its active ingredient remains illegal under U.S. federal law. A subsequent lower court decision ruled Oregon branches of a different ayahuasca church could use it. 

            “In every major city in the United States, every weekend, there’s multiple ayahuasca ceremonies. It’s not just a twice-a-year thing,” said Sean McAllister, who represents an Arizona church in a lawsuit against the federal government after its ayahuasca from Peru was seized at the port of Los Angeles. 

            But with the growth of pro-psychedelics movements has come increased scrutiny. In addition to ayahuasca shipments from South America being seized, some churches stopped operating over fears of prosecution. There are also concerns these unregulated ceremonies might pose a danger for some participants and that the benefits of ayahuasca haven't been well studied.

            “Our knowledge is kind of limited,” said Anthony Back, a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “There is not as much information about safety as the regular other medical treatments that you might get if you went to a regular doctor in the United States.” 

            It was dark as the Hummingbird ceremony began on a Friday night in October, except for flickering candles and the orange glow of heaters. Psychedelic art hung from the walls; statues of the Virgin Mary and Mother Earth were positioned near a makeshift altar.

            A mix of military veterans, corporate executives, thrill seekers, ex-members of a polygamous Mormon sect and a man who supposedly struck it rich on a game show had converged for the $900 weekend. Many appeared apprehensive yet giddy to begin the first of three ceremonies.

            They sat silently, awaiting the arrival of Taita Pedro Davila, the Colombian shaman and traditional healer who oversaw the ceremony. 

            The brew contains an Amazon rainforest shrub with the active ingredient N, N-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, and a vine containing harmala alkaloids that prevent the drug from breaking down in the body.

            Those who drink ayahuasca report seeing shapes and colors and going on wild, sometimes terrifying journeys that can last hours. In this dreamlike state, some say they encounter dead relatives — one woman saw family members who had died in a car accident — as well as friends and spirits who talk to them.

            “When you were invited here, you were invited for a weekend of healing,” Davila told the group in Spanish through a translator, before people lined up for shot glass-sized-doses of the thick, dark tea in plastic cups.

            Davila, wearing a fedora, a boar-tooth necklace and beaded chest plate with a jaguar image, locked eyes with each participant, uttered a prayer over the cup, blew on it with a whistling sound and handed it over. After everyone drank and was settled on mattresses, Davila strolled through the tent as the drugs took hold, shaking a bundle of leaves and playing a mournful tune on the harmonica. 

            “Every process is an individual one and completely different for every one of us,” he said. “We are going to turn off our minds and open our hearts. If you feel like you are dying, die. This is going to allow you to be reborn.” 

            Gonzales and his wife, Flor, were among several ayahuasca newcomers. 

            They had driven from California, hoping for relief for Gonzales. He'd battled drug addiction for much of his 50 years, was suffering the effects of COVID-19 and had been diagnosed with early-stage dementia — likely a result of concussions over the years, one from a motorcycle crash and another from an industrial accident. He doesn’t drive due to memory loss, rarely sleeps and is prone to angry outbursts.

            “My poor body is dying and I don’t want it to die,” Gonzales said.

            Flor Gonzales, 48, had grown weary of doctors and the pills they prescribed. None of it worked and she feared losing Lorenzo. So the born-again Christian who favors natural medicine researched ayahuasca and figured it was worth trying. 

            “If he’s already sick and he’s been placed on all these medications that have side effects, what do we have to lose? … It might stop the progression of the illness,” she said. “It might help him … accept things more without the anger.”

            Maeleene Jessop was also an ayahuasca newcomer but was intimately familiar with Hildale, the Utah town where the ceremony was held. She's a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, a polygamist offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

            The ceremony was held in a tent on the grounds of a house owned by a former FLDS member in Hildale, where Jessop grew up, enduring sexual and physical abuse in the group’s stronghold. Jessop left the church after its leader, Warren Jeffs, was arrested for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. He is serving a life sentence in federal prison.

            The 35-year-old woman has struggled to adapt to life after the FLDS, which controlled almost everything from what she ate to what she wore. Since leaving, she has tried anti-depressants, therapy and other psychedelics like mushrooms to deal with depression and a range of physical ailments, including hearing and vision problems she blames on the abuse she suffered.

            “I felt like I needed something more, like I needed a stronger breakthrough. So this is the next step,” she said of ayahuasca. “Hopefully it’s the last step.” 

            She remains wary of organized religion, but felt like Hummingbird offered what she was looking for — a sense of community and freedom to connect “to a higher power, whether that’s us or the universe or God, whatever you want to call it.”

            More than three months after the ceremony, Jessop said she credits ayahuasca with easing her depression and improving her focus. She found some clarity about her life goals and plans to study communications to help her speak out about abuse.

            The roots of ayahuasca go back hundreds of years to use by Indigenous groups in the Amazon. In the past century, churches sprouted up in South America where ayahuasca is legal. Some Brazilian churches are a mix of Christian, African and Indigenous influences.

            The movement found a foothold in the United States in the 1980s and interest has intensified more recently as celebrities like NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Hollywood star Will Smith and Britain's Prince Harry talked about using it.

            Some people spend thousands of dollars taking ayahuasca at five-star retreats in the Amazon. In the U.S., the movement remains largely underground, promoted by social media and word of mouth. Some ceremonies occur at supporters’ homes, Airbnb rentals and remote areas to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. 

            Like many of these, Hummingbird won’t be mistaken for a traditional Western church.

            It has no written text and relies primarily on Davila’s prayers, chants and songs, in Spanish and the language of the Kamëntsá people, to guide participants. Davila follows traditions he learned from his grandfather in Colombia, spending several days preparing the ayahuasca. 

            Before serving the tea, Davila conducts cleansing rituals — like blowing tobacco snuff up some participant’s noses to heighten its effects. 

            Courtney Close, Hummingbird’s founder who credits ayahuasca with helping her overcome cocaine addiction and post-partum depression, believes the designation as a church helps show that participants are “doing this for religious reasons.” But when it comes to defining it as a religion, Close stresses much depends on individual participants’ experience. 

            “We just try to create a spiritual experience without any dogma and just let people experience God for themselves,” said the 42-year-old, who participated in about 200 ceremonies and had a vision to start the church at one of them.

            Since holding the church’s first ceremony in Joshua Tree five years ago, Close has seen Hummingbird’s numbers grow and its demographic change — mostly from young hipsters to older, working-class people desperate for mental health treatment. 

            The most jarring moments have been people talking openly about suicide and viewing ayahuasca as their only hope. She recalled a sex crimes investigator and combat veteran who was so depressed he couldn't speak without crying and told her: “If this doesn’t work, I’m killing myself.”

            Close said Davila offered the man ayahuasca then said to wrap him in a blanket on his side so he wouldn’t choke on his vomit. She hoped the psychedelic would provide him with a transformative, death-like experience while remaining physically safe. 

            “After the weekend, he looked like a different person where I was like, ‘Oh my God. Like, this guy is smiling and talking to people,’” she said. 

            But Close knows ayahuasca comes with risks, especially when inexperienced users focused on making money start hosting events.

            “That’s so dangerous,” she said, recounting instances of people at ceremonies being sexually assaulted, ripped off and sent home without follow-up support. 

            To improve safety, Hummingbird has brought doctors, nurses and CPR-trained staff to ceremonies, encouraged participants to stop taking certain medications before they arrive, and created an intake process that weeds out those with severe mental illnesses and some heart conditions. They implemented a no-touching policy during ceremonies and stopped offering other psychedelics. 

            But Close worries a U.S. government crackdown is coming, given the presumption the largely unregulated movement is “an epidemic of psychedelic churches that are creating a public health crisis.” 

            Back in California, Flor Gonzales is convinced the drug is behind Lorenzo’s improvement. 

            “The ayahuasca changed him in a lot of ways,” she said. “We’re more optimistic about the future.” 

            The father of four said he has stopped taking pills for depression, PTSD and insomnia. He still has moments of forgetfulness and doesn’t drive, but says he sleeps through the night and his screaming fits are a thing of the past. 

            “I feel healthier,” he said. “I feel like a dark force has been taken out of my soul.”

Many appeared apprehensive yet giddy to begin the first of three ceremonies.They sat silently, awaiting the arrival of Taita Pedro Davila, the Colombian shaman and traditional healer who oversaw the ceremony.The brew contains an Amazon rainforest shrub with the active ingredient N, N-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, and a vine containing harmala alkaloids that prevent the drug from breaking down in the body.Those who drink ayahuasca report seeing shapes and colors and going on wild, sometimes terrifying journeys that can last hours. In this dreamlike state, some say they encounter dead relatives — one woman saw family members who had died in a car accident — as well as friends and spirits who talk to them.“When you were invited here, you were invited for a weekend of healing,” Davila told the group in Spanish through a translator, before people lined up for shot glass-sized-doses of the thick, dark tea in plastic cups.Davila, wearing a fedora, a boar-tooth necklace and beaded chest plate with a jaguar image, locked eyes with each participant, uttered a prayer over the cup, blew on it with a whistling sound and handed it over. After everyone drank and was settled on mattresses, Davila strolled through the tent as the drugs took hold, shaking a bundle of leaves and playing a mournful tune on the harmonica.“Every process is an individual one and completely different for every one of us,” he said. “We are going to turn off our minds and open our hearts. If you feel like you are dying, die. This is going to allow you to be reborn.”Gonzales and his wife, Flor, were among several ayahuasca newcomers.They had driven from California, hoping for relief for Gonzales. He'd battled drug addiction for much of his 50 years, was suffering the effects of COVID-19 and had been diagnosed with early-stage dementia — likely a result of concussions over the years, one from a motorcycle crash and another from an industrial accident. He doesn’t drive due to memory loss, rarely sleeps and is prone to angry outbursts.“My poor body is dying and I don’t want it to die,” Gonzales said.Flor Gonzales, 48, had grown weary of doctors and the pills they prescribed. None of it worked and she feared losing Lorenzo. So the born-again Christian who favors natural medicine researched ayahuasca and figured it was worth trying.“If he’s already sick and he’s been placed on all these medications that have side effects, what do we have to lose? … It might stop the progression of the illness,” she said. “It might help him … accept things more without the anger.”Maeleene Jessop was also an ayahuasca newcomer but was intimately familiar with Hildale, the Utah town where the ceremony was held. She's a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, a polygamist offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.The ceremony was held in a tent on the grounds of a house owned by a former FLDS member in Hildale, where Jessop grew up, enduring sexual and physical abuse in the group’s stronghold. Jessop left the church after its leader, Warren Jeffs, was arrested for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. He is serving a life sentence in federal prison.The 35-year-old woman has struggled to adapt to life after the FLDS, which controlled almost everything from what she ate to what she wore. Since leaving, she has tried anti-depressants, therapy and other psychedelics like mushrooms to deal with depression and a range of physical ailments, including hearing and vision problems she blames on the abuse she suffered.“I felt like I needed something more, like I needed a stronger breakthrough. So this is the next step,” she said of ayahuasca. “Hopefully it’s the last step.”She remains wary of organized religion, but felt like Hummingbird offered what she was looking for — a sense of community and freedom to connect “to a higher power, whether that’s us or the universe or God, whatever you want to call it.”More than three months after the ceremony, Jessop said she credits ayahuasca with easing her depression and improving her focus. She found some clarity about her life goals and plans to study communications to help her speak out about abuse.The roots of ayahuasca go back hundreds of years to use by Indigenous groups in the Amazon. In the past century, churches sprouted up in South America where ayahuasca is legal. Some Brazilian churches are a mix of Christian, African and Indigenous influences.The movement found a foothold in the United States in the 1980s and interest has intensified more recently as celebrities like NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Hollywood star Will Smith and Britain's Prince Harry talked about using it.Some people spend thousands of dollars taking ayahuasca at five-star retreats in the Amazon. In the U.S., the movement remains largely underground, promoted by social media and word of mouth. Some ceremonies occur at supporters’ homes, Airbnb rentals and remote areas to avoid law enforcement scrutiny.Like many of these, Hummingbird won’t be mistaken for a traditional Western church.It has no written text and relies primarily on Davila’s prayers, chants and songs, in Spanish and the language of the Kamëntsá people, to guide participants. Davila follows traditions he learned from his grandfather in Colombia, spending several days preparing the ayahuasca.Before serving the tea, Davila conducts cleansing rituals — like blowing tobacco snuff up some participant’s noses to heighten its effects.Courtney Close, Hummingbird’s founder who credits ayahuasca with helping her overcome cocaine addiction and post-partum depression, believes the designation as a church helps show that participants are “doing this for religious reasons.” But when it comes to defining it as a religion, Close stresses much depends on individual participants’ experience.“We just try to create a spiritual experience without any dogma and just let people experience God for themselves,” said the 42-year-old, who participated in about 200 ceremonies and had a vision to start the church at one of them.Since holding the church’s first ceremony in Joshua Tree five years ago, Close has seen Hummingbird’s numbers grow and its demographic change — mostly from young hipsters to older, working-class people desperate for mental health treatment.The most jarring moments have been people talking openly about suicide and viewing ayahuasca as their only hope. She recalled a sex crimes investigator and combat veteran who was so depressed he couldn't speak without crying and told her: “If this doesn’t work, I’m killing myself.”Close said Davila offered the man ayahuasca then said to wrap him in a blanket on his side so he wouldn’t choke on his vomit. She hoped the psychedelic would provide him with a transformative, death-like experience while remaining physically safe.“After the weekend, he looked like a different person where I was like, ‘Oh my God. Like, this guy is smiling and talking to people,’” she said.But Close knows ayahuasca comes with risks, especially when inexperienced users focused on making money start hosting events.“That’s so dangerous,” she said, recounting instances of people at ceremonies being sexually assaulted, ripped off and sent home without follow-up support.To improve safety, Hummingbird has brought doctors, nurses and CPR-trained staff to ceremonies, encouraged participants to stop taking certain medications before they arrive, and created an intake process that weeds out those with severe mental illnesses and some heart conditions. They implemented a no-touching policy during ceremonies and stopped offering other psychedelics.But Close worries a U.S. government crackdown is coming, given the presumption the largely unregulated movement is “an epidemic of psychedelic churches that are creating a public health crisis.”Back in California, Flor Gonzales is convinced the drug is behind Lorenzo’s improvement.“The ayahuasca changed him in a lot of ways,” she said. “We’re more optimistic about the future.”The father of four said he has stopped taking pills for depression, PTSD and insomnia. He still has moments of forgetfulness and doesn’t drive, but says he sleeps through the night and his screaming fits are a thing of the past.“I feel healthier,” he said. “I feel like a dark force has been taken out of my soul.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798546,Why are people turning to psychedelics like ayahuasca?,"HILDALE, Utah (AP) — Ayahuasca is a psychedelic tea whose roots go back hundreds of years to ceremonial use by Indigenous groups in the Amazon region. 

            It's widely used in South America where it is legal in several countries, including Peru and Brazil. But in the United States, it remains illegal because the brew contains the psychedelic N, N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT. 

            Despite its illegal status, ayahuasca has become increasingly popular in the U.S., and interest has intensified as celebrities like NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Hollywood star Will Smith talked about attending ceremonies. Supporters have formed churches to hold their ceremonies, which are largely held underground in homes, at rented facilities or in remote locations like deserts.











            WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DRINK THE TEA?

            Those who drink ayahuasca report seeing shapes and colors and going on dream-like journeys that can last several hours. Some say they can encounter dead relatives as well as friends and an assortment of spirits who talk to them.

            Surveys of tea drinkers have reported that most experience a range of physical and mental effects after drinking ayahuasca. The most common physical reaction, according to a study in PLOS Global Health, was vomiting or nausea while other lesser side effects include abdominal pain and headaches. A majority of participants also reported seeing and hearing things, feeling alone or having nightmares — though almost all those reporting mental effects felt they were beneficial to their growth. According to the study, 2.3% of those surveyed reported needing medical attention after taking ayahuasca.

            WHY DO PEOPLE TAKE AYAHUASCA? 

            A growing number of people in the United States are turning to ayahuasca to address a range of mental ailments they say conventional medicine has failed to remedy. 

            Many turn to the ceremonies to help with eating disorders, depression, substance use disorders and post-traumatic stress. One study, using data from the Global Ayahuasca Project, reported that most people with depression felt it had “very much improved” or “completely resolved,” while most of those with anxiety reported that their symptoms were “very much improved” or “completely resolved.” 

            But medical experts caution that not enough research has been done in the United States to confirm these findings — though smaller studies have been done in Brazil and other countries. 

            “There aren’t really the same kinds of studies that have been done above ground in the United States that allow us to know how well does it really work, who does it really work the best for, what are the real side effects of it,” said Anthony Back, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. He is leading a study using psilocybin, a hallucinogen found in some mushrooms, to help doctors and nurses with symptoms of depression and burnout linked to their work during the pandemic. 

            “Our knowledge (of ayahuasca) is kind of limited,” he said. “There is not as much information about safety as the regular other medical treatments that you might get if you went to a regular doctor in the United States. It’s kind of in the early stages I would say — interesting, intriguing, promising.”

            WHERE IS THE MOVEMENT HEADED?

            Some supporters worry the popularity of ayahuasca could prompt a federal government crackdown. Some advocates have reported ayahuasca shipments from South America being seized and churches closing for fear of legal trouble. Others worry reports of sexual assaults at ceremonies, sickened participants or organizers ripping off people could prompt the federal government to act.

            Some groups have formed churches in the hopes of being protected from prosecution by a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Citing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a New Mexico church won the right to use ayahuasca as a sacrament. A subsequent lower court decision ruled Oregon branches of a different ayahuasca church could use it. 

            The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which declined to comment for this story, set up a system in 2009 for churches to be recognized as having an exception to the Controlled Substances Act. But Sean McAllister, who represents an Arizona church in a lawsuit against the federal government after its ayahuasca from Peru was seized at the Port of Los Angeles, said no churches have been approved. Most people in the movement, he said, view that option as “a complete waste of time.""

            “The government wants to keep a lid on this thing. They want to keep it as small as they can,” said McAllister, adding that the DEA would be skeptical of people claiming ayahuasca connects them to God.

            COULD DECRIMINALIZATION HELP?

            Some supporters hope moves to decriminalize ayahuasca and other psychedelics in several states will reduce the risk of prosecution. Decriminalization efforts have succeeded in Colorado and Oregon and a bill is pending in California. More than a dozen cities — mostly in California, Massachusetts and Washington — have passed resolutions that deemphasize the prosecution of various drugs including ayahuasca.

            “Part of what we are trying to do is get the word out and change the laws in the United States so this is 100% legal and you never have to worry about it,” Brian Cantalupi, a lead facilitator with the California-based Hummingbird Church, told participants at a recent ayahuasca ceremony. The church, which once largely operated underground, now holds ceremonies in the open.

            But it’s unclear if the new laws sanction ayahuasca ceremonies. Even if they did, participants could still face federal prosecution.

            “From the perspective of Colorado, it does seem under the new law that people can get together and share ayahuasca but the question is how much are they allowed to have. That is not clear,” said Mason Marks, the senior fellow of a psychedelics project at the Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School. “It doesn’t mean that it’s a free for all and people can do what they want. There are still a lot of restrictions.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798547,Iranian film director goes on hunger strike in prison,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian director who was arrested last summer, weeks before his latest film was released to widespread acclaim, has gone on hunger strike to protest his continued detention amid more than four months of anti-government protests.

            Jafar Panahi, whose films have thrilled critics and won numerous international prizes, issued a statement saying he would refuse food or medicine starting Wednesday “in protest against the extra-legal and inhumane behavior of the judicial and security apparatus.”

            He's among a number of Iranian artists, sports figures and other celebrities who have been detained after speaking out against Iran's theocracy. Such arrests have become increasingly frequent since nationwide protests broke out in September over the death of a young woman in police custody.











            Panahi, 62, was sentenced to six years in prison in 2011 on charges of producing anti-government propaganda, but the sentence was never carried out. Banned from both travel and filmmaking, he continued to make underground films that were released abroad to great acclaim.

            He was arrested in July when he went to the Tehran prosecutor's office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve the earlier sentence. 

            
                His latest film, “No Bears,” in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself while making a film along the Iran-Turkey border, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September, a week before the protests began. The New York Times and The Associated Press named it one of the top 10 films of the year, and film critic Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times called it 2022’s best movie.

            The protests erupted after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died while being held by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic dress code. The demonstrations rapidly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran's ruling clerics, a major challenge to their four-decade rule.

            On Wednesday, around 100 people took part in a protest in the western Iranian city of Abdanan, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported. It said five “rioters” suffered minor injuries when security forces intervened and that 10 people were arrested, without providing further details.

            Iran heavily restricts media access to demonstrations and periodically shuts down the internet, making it difficult to confirm specific incidents or gauge the scale of the ongoing demonstrations. 

            At least 527 protesters have been killed and more than 19,500 people have been detained since the demonstrations began, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the unrest. Iranian authorities have not released official figures on deaths or arrests.

            Taraneh Alidoosti, the 38-year-old star of Asghar Farhadi’s Oscar-winning 2016 film, “The Salesman,” was arrested in December after taking to social media to criticize the crackdown on protests.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798548,US filings for jobless aid lowest since April,"U.S. applications for jobless aid fell again last week to their lowest level since April, further evidence that the job market has withstood aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve as it attempts to cool the economy and bring down inflation.

            Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Jan. 28 fell by 3,000 last week to 183,000, from 186,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the third straight week claims were under 200,000 and the third straight weekly decline.

            Jobless claims generally serve as a proxy for layoffs, which have been relatively low since the pandemic wiped out millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.











            The four-week moving average of claims, which flattens out some of the week-to-week volatility, declined by 5,750 to 191,750.

            The Fed on Wednesday raised its main lending rate by 25 basis points, its eighth rate hike in less than a year. The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest Wednesday that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes.

            So far, the Fed’s aggressive policy has pushed inflation down, but has had less impact on a resilient U.S. job market.

            On Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, up from 10.44 million in November and the highest since July. For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.

            Last month’s job report told a similar story: U.S. employers added a solid 223,000 jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.5%, matching a 53-year low.

            The Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report for January on Friday, where analysts expect the U.S. economy to have added another 185,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in more than two years.

            Within the monthly jobs data, there is some evidence of slowing wage growth, another of the Fed’s goals. Average hourly pay growth in December eased to its slowest pace in 16 months, which could reduce pressure on employers to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs.

            Though the U.S. labor market remains robust, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, which is dealing with falling demand after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs recently.

            The Fed’s interest rate hikes have hit the real estate sector the hardest, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 11 straight months. That’s almost step-in-step with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.

            About 1.66 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Jan. 21, down 11,000 from the week before.U.S. applications for jobless aid fell again last week to their lowest level since April, further evidence that the job market has withstood aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve as it attempts to cool the economy and bring down inflation.Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Jan. 28 fell by 3,000 last week to 183,000, from 186,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest Wednesday that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes.So far, the Fed’s aggressive policy has pushed inflation down, but has had less impact on a resilient U.S. job market.On Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, up from 10.44 million in November and the highest since July. For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.Last month’s job report told a similar story: U.S. employers added a solid 223,000 jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.5%, matching a 53-year low.The Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report for January on Friday, where analysts expect the U.S. economy to have added another 185,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in more than two years.Within the monthly jobs data, there is some evidence of slowing wage growth, another of the Fed’s goals. Average hourly pay growth in December eased to its slowest pace in 16 months, which could reduce pressure on employers to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs.Though the U.S. labor market remains robust, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, which is dealing with falling demand after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs recently.The Fed’s interest rate hikes have hit the real estate sector the hardest, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 11 straight months. That’s almost step-in-step with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.About 1.66 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Jan. 21, down 11,000 from the week before.",2023/2/2,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798549,"Serbia could become 'pariah' over Kosovo, president warns","BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s populist president warned during a chaotic parliamentary session on Thursday that the Balkan nation could become a European “pariah” state if it rejects a Western plan for normalizing relations with Kosovo.

            President Aleksandar Vucic faced a hostile reception from the right-wing opposition, which urged parliament to reject the plan and accused him of betraying Serbia.

            The plan hasn’t been made public formally, but Vucic said it stipulates that Serbia wouldn’t object to Kosovo’s inclusion in international organizations, including the United Nations, though it wouldn’t have to formally recognize its statehood.











            “I haven’t signed anything. I said we will continue with the talks,” Vucic said. “People need to understand … Would we become a European pariah? Yes, we would.”

            The session included pushing and shoving, and shouting matches between Vucic’s ruling party and opposition lawmakers. They chanted “Treason, treason” and “We won’t give up Kosovo,” and demanded Vucic's resignation.

            Vucic responded by shouting at the protesting lawmakers that they are “thieves and traitors.”

            The sovereignty of Kosovo, a former province of Serbia that declared independence in 2008, isn't recognized by the Serbian government.

            The dispute between Serbia and Kosovo has been a source of tension in the Balkans since the war in 1998-99 that ended when a NATO bombing campaign forced Serbia to pull out of the former Serbian province. The United States and the European Union recently have stepped up efforts to solve the problem, fearing instability as Russia's war rages in Ukraine. 

            In Kosovo on Thursday, Prime Minister Albin Kurti set conditions for the formation of an association of Serb-majority municipalities, which is supported by both the U.S. and the EU. Kurti said the association can only be formed as part of an overall agreement on normalization of relations, which Serbia has rejected in the past.

            Kosovo authorities fear that a community of Serb-dominated municipalities — first agreed at EU-led talks in 2013 — would eventually undermine the country’s statehood with the help of Belgrade. Kurti instead urged Belgrade to dismantle any Serbia-backed institutions among the Kosovo Serb community, who overwhelmingly reject Kosovo independence.

            Vucic said that Western envoys told him last month that Serbia's accession process into the EU would be halted and economic investment stopped if Belgrade decides to reject the latest Western bid to reach a solution.

            As Vucic spoke in parliament, right-wing lawmakers held up banners accusing the Serbian president of treason over Kosovo, which many in Serbia consider the cradle of national identity. 

            The hard-line pro-Russia opposition lawmakers in parliament described the Western plan for Kosovo as an “ultimatum."" They said it would mean Serbia would have to recognize Kosovo's independence as a condition of eventually joining the European Union.

            “We don't see a single reason why we should accept this Western ultimatum,” said Bosko Obradovic of the far-right Dveri party, urging the assembly to vote to reject it. 

            Serbia has relied on support from Russia and China in its rejection of Kosovo’s independence. This is one of the reasons why Belgrade hasn't imposed any sanctions on Moscow over the war in Ukraine. 

            Vucic said it is of “vital interest” for Serbia to continue with the accession process into the EU, but reiterated that the country wouldn't join NATO. Rejection of Western efforts would result in “complete isolation,” he warned. ""You cannot function alone.” 

            Decades-long, simmering tensions between Serbia and Kosovo occasionally explode into violence, particularly in the north of the country that borders Serbia and which is populated mostly by ethnic Serbs. 

            The war in 1998-99 erupted when separatist ethnic Albanians launched a rebellion against Serbia's rule, and Belgrade responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people died, mostly ethnic Albanians.

            That could favor Andretti Global, for which Michael Andretti is partnering with General Motors' Cadillac brand. The American alliance has been lobbying the FIA to join F1 but face opposition from current teams worried that an 11th team would dilute their income.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798568,AC Milan looks to stem terrible run in derby against Inter,"MILAN (AP) — The dispiriting jeers turned to encouraging cheers, even though the result was still bad for AC Milan.

            The fans' quick change in attitude wasn't exactly a surprise, however, with a derby against Inter Milan next on the Serie A schedule.

            Milan has had a terrible start to the year, dropping from second-place and five points behind leader Napoli to fifth place and 15 behind. Inter, conversely, has risen to second place — albeit 13 points behind Napoli.











            Milan's last match ended up being a disastrous 5-2 loss to 16th-place Sassuolo, sparking the boos from the crowd. The defending champions have now conceded 12 goals in their past three matches, and they were also eliminated from the Italian Cup and lost to Inter in the Italian Super Cup.

            The heartening display from the fans at the end of the match on Sunday was followed by a supportive visit from the team's executives on Wednesday. Milan president Paolo Scaroni and director Paolo Maldini — a former Milan great — went to the training ground with other club directors.

            They watched a practice session and then had lunch with the players.

            “We have great confidence in you,” Scaroni reportedly told the players. “We feel such a strong bond with you that we want to be on the field with you.”

            The Sassuolo match was Milan’s worst home result since a 6-1 loss to Juventus in 1997. It was also the first time Milan has conceded four goals in back-to-back Serie A matches.

            “We’ve hit a rough patch both mentally and tactically so I’ll have to work even more on the mindset of my players to understand what they need to get over this difficult period and also try to understand the tactical issues in order to find the right remedy,” Milan coach Stefano Pioli said.

            The same Milan players who were drawing compliments from around Europe for their style of play and spirit last season now look lost and simply without answers.

            “We have to make the most of the fact we have a big game coming up, because big games are certainly very hard but the higher the mountain to climb, the higher the reward,” Pioli said. “We need this sort of mindset.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798569,"Interim WI coach Coley stays positive, has Lara to help","New interim West Indies coach Andre Coley feels there are enough recent positives to draw on despite the team's humbling first-round exit at last year's Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.

            That was followed by a 2-0 test series loss against Australia that included a 419-run drubbing in the second test.

            Before those setbacks, West Indies won at home against England and Bangladesh and Coley is focused more on that ahead of a two-test series in Zimbabwe starting on Saturday.











            “Australia is now in the past,” Coley said in Bulawayo. “As a team, there have been many positive results over the past 18 months and we want to focus on achieving much of the same in the year to come. 

            ""We are looking forward to playing a brand of cricket that will position us to achieve this outcome.”

            West Indies will be expected to deliver a series win in Zimbabwe, with the hosts gearing up for their first test in 18 months.

            While West Indies wants to win again, Zimbabwe has achieved its first objective of just playing test cricket again after that long gap. Getting matches and series is a regular challenge for the southern Africans.

            Zimbabwe has enjoyed some sort of recent revival, though, following the return of former captain Dave Houghton to take up the role of head coach again. Houghton's presence has led to a more positive outlook for Zimbabwe, which won a T20 series and drew a one-day series against Ireland last month and has managed to attract former England batter Gary Ballance back to his country of birth.

            Ballance made his international debut for Zimbabwe against Ireland and is set to make his test debut against West Indies having switched allegiance from England back to Zimbabwe, where he was a youth international before moving to Britain.

            “Gary Ballance is an experienced cricketer,” Zimbabwe director of cricket and former captain Hamilton Masakadza told The Associated Press. “His inclusion in the side is invaluable. He has gelled very seamlessly in the side. He is sort of the right player we needed in the side. We look forward to him doing big things for Zimbabwe.”

            Ballance will need to offset the absence of key Zimbabwe batters for the series. Captain Sean Williams is out with injury and Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl have been granted permission to play in T20 competitions overseas.

            Coley's first foray in charge of West Indies appears set to rely on some old heads, such as 34-year-old fast bowler Shannon Gabriel, who didn't play when West Indies lost heavily against Australia but has been recalled, and fellow quick Kemar Roach, who is also 34. At 26, Alzarri Joseph is the youngster in that pace trio.

            They will find Bulawayo's traditionally low-bouncing and slow pitch a challenge but Gabriel and Roach have 130 tests of experience to call on if they are reunited in the bowling attack for the first test, as is expected. 

            The West Indies squad also has one of cricket's greatest players to help after Brian Lara was hired to be a performance mentor for the team, starting with the series in Zimbabwe.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798570,UK to probe whether 1998 Omagh bomb could have been stopped,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government said Thursday it will hold a public inquiry into whether the deadliest bombing in Northern Ireland’s decades of violence could have been prevented.

            Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced a judge-led independent probe of the 1998 car bombing in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and wounded hundreds more. An Irish Republican Army dissident group, the Real IRA, claimed responsibility.

            A court in 2021 ordered the government to investigate in response to a legal challenge by Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden was killed by the 225-kilogram (500-pound) bomb. Gallagher alleges that intelligence failings allowed a “preventable atrocity” to occur in the busy market town.











            Heaton-Harris said the inquiry ""will focus specifically on the four grounds which the court held as giving rise to plausible arguments that the bombing could have been prevented,” including whether security services had advance intelligence of the bomb and whether they could have disrupted the plot. 

            The inquiry is likely to take two years — and potentially much longer. The inquirers will have the power to order evidence to be handed over and to compel witnesses to testify under oath.

            Heaton-Harris said he hoped the decision to conduct an independent inquiry “gives some comfort to those families who have long campaigned for this outcome.”

            Gallagher said the inquiry would let bereaved families ""hopefully get the answers that we need and we can move on.”

            “If we don’t have this process, for the rest of our lives we’re going to be wondering ‘what if,’"" he said.

            The 2021 court ruling said a new investigation should be held in the Republic of Ireland, where most of the suspected bombers were based. The Irish government said it would “consider what further action is required on our part” after the British announcement.

            The attack on Aug. 15, 1998 came months after the Good Friday peace accord largely ended three decades of conflict known as “the Troubles.” Major Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups gave up violence and disarmed, but small splinter groups continued to mount attacks.

            No one has been convicted in the Omagh attack, but four members of the Real IRA were found responsible in a civil case in 2009.LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government said Thursday it will hold a public inquiry into whether the deadliest bombing in Northern Ireland’s decades of violence could have been prevented.Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced a judge-led independent probe of the 1998 car bombing in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and wounded hundreds more.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798571,Airbnb's Joe Gebbia donates $25 million to The Ocean Cleanup,"Entrepreneur Joe Gebbia donated $25 million to The Ocean Cleanup Thursday to support the nonprofit’s efforts to remove plastic from the world’s oceans and rivers.

            Experts in the field welcome both the donation and the attention to the issue of ocean sustainability, pointing out that it receives the least funding of all the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. According to the World Economic Forum, about $175 billion a year is needed to protect the oceans, but between 2015 and 2019 less than $10 billion total was invested in the cause.

            Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb and Samara and chairman of Airbnb.org, said he was proud to partner with the nonprofit, which declared his donation the largest in its history.











            “The Ocean Cleanup has created systems and technology that actually work at scale,” Gebbia said in a statement to The Associated Press. “In order for them to deploy across our oceans and rivers, they now need to scale their funding. It is my hope that this donation can inspire others to act.”

            The Ocean Cleanup works to remove the existing plastic floating in the ocean, especially in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, as well as reducing the amount of plastic flowing into the oceans. The nonprofit has removed roughly 440,000 pounds of plastic from the Garbage Patch, which consists of an estimated 220 million pounds of plastic located between Hawaii and California.

            “Joe’s continued support of The Ocean Cleanup’s mission has a direct impact on our operations all over the world,” Boyan Slat, The Ocean Cleanup’s founder and CEO, said in a statement. “Thanks, in part, to his generous assistance, we are able to scale up our work in oceans and rivers, helping us reach our goal of ridding the world’s oceans of plastic.”

            Daniela Fernandez, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Sustainable Ocean Alliance, which helps young leaders connect to work on solving issues threatening oceans’ health, said many donors do not realize that supporting programs battling climate change does not necessarily support the welfare of the oceans. She said Gebbia’s donation is a sign of change.

            “I do think that we are seeing philanthropists pay more attention,” said Fernandez, whose group is co-sponsoring Our Ocean Youth Leadership Summit in Panama later this month to discuss cleanup and other possible solutions to the oceans’ issues. “I think it’s really exciting to see this large support take place.”

            Fernandez said it is important to encourage and empower young people because they may have important new ideas.

            “They’re frustrated,” she said. “But now you’re seeing this area of entrepreneurship where people are saying, ‘Not only do I want to be angry and write a letter or sign a petition, I actually want to roll up my sleeves and build a mangrove forest in my backyard or put together a coral reef planting campaign for my community.’ We’re seeing so many ideas.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798572,"Kim Petras talks religion, trans community ahead of Grammys","LOS ANGELES (AP) — For Kim Petras, 2022 was a big year: The German singer-songwriter received her first Grammy nomination, made her acting debut with the HBO series “Los Espookys” and released a single with acclaimed pop music producer Max Martin.

            Inspired by the irreverent attitude of her Grammy-nominated duet, “Unholy,” which she and Sam Smith are set to perform at this weekend’s awards show, Petras decided to dive deeper into the waters of religious language and themes as she worked with Martin to write “If Jesus Was a Rockstar.”

            “I just never got a chance to even know about spirituality or be accepted by God. So, to me, it’s like mythology. To me, it’s like a fairy tale or any other story,” she said during a recent interview with The Associated Press.











            Petras, who is transgender, understands her subversive engagement with religion as a way of processing trauma.

            “I just, since a young age, had to be like, ‘I’m going to hell.’ That was my growing up experience,” she said. “Had I had the chance to be a part of a religion, I maybe would have. And maybe I would have lived more the way that people who protest my concerts want me to live.”

            Although she has been making music for more than a decade, Petras’ rise to fame did not happen overnight. And while she is grateful for her success, she recognizes that this level of celebrity makes her and her music more vulnerable to criticism.

            “Now it’s more serious. It’s more like, wow, people are really watching and there’s really, truly a lot of eyes on there that may not be my fans, who may not be so kind to me,” she said. “But I feel like, since I’ve steadily been building, I’m able to handle it.”

            Before her career took off, Petras released her music as an independent artist under her own label. She credits recording artists like Robyn and Charli XCX, who also released music independently, for inspiring the creation of BunHead Records, a nod to the '90s Japanese manga series “Sailor Moon.”

            In addition to celebrating a host of career milestones in 2022, Petras also marked a personal one: turning 30. But the pop star said her philosophy on age is very much in line with the late music legend Prince, who famously did not celebrate birthdays.

            “Age does not matter to me,” she said. “I’m never going to stop fully clubbing and loving gay clubs and going to them. That’s just who I am.”

            In keeping with who she is, her new single, “brrr,” which is expected to be on her debut full-length album, is replete with lustful lyrics and heavy electronics. But Petras hopes to do more with her music than provide a catchy beat for clubgoers to dance to.

            “It’s a scary time for transgender kids and people and I think there are just a lot of things that really need to get figured out,” she said. “I’m scared for the trans community and I just hope I can be a person that makes them forget about those troubles and just makes them have fun for a little bit.”LOS ANGELES (AP) — For Kim Petras, 2022 was a big year: The German singer-songwriter received her first Grammy nomination, made her acting debut with the HBO series “Los Espookys” and released a single with acclaimed pop music producer Max Martin.Inspired by the irreverent attitude of her Grammy-nominated duet, “Unholy,” which she and Sam Smith are set to perform at this weekend’s awards show, Petras decided to dive deeper into the waters of religious language and themes as she worked with Martin to write “If Jesus Was a Rockstar.”“I just never got a chance to even know about spirituality or be accepted by God.

            “In our politics and in our lives, we too often see each other as opponents and not competitors. We see each other as enemies, not neighbors,"" Biden said. ""And as tough as these times have been, if we look closer, we see the strength, the determination that has long defined America.”

            The breakfast was held at the Capitol's visitor center, and the auditorium's 450 seats were packed with members of Congress, government officials and others. 











            Every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has spoken at the breakfast, which in past years has been attended by thousands. For decades, the event was overseen by the International Foundation, a Christian organization that has drawn increasing scrutiny over the years.

            Now the event is run by the National Prayer Breakfast Foundation, a new group led by former members of Congress. The International Foundation held its own event at a nearby hotel, where Biden's speech was being watched remotely. 

            “Welcome to all 1,300,"" Biden said, a reference to the size of the crowd at the other breakfast. It was his only acknowledgement during the public program to changes behind the scenes.

            The event is designed to bring people together across partisan lines, and Biden sat next to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The two are beginning a showdown over whether to raise the country's debt limit to avoid default.

            “We had a good meeting yesterday,” Biden said of McCarthy, saying they would work to “treat each other with respect.”

            Also present was Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for Arizona governor who lost her race in November but has refused to acknowledge her defeat. Biden has denounced election denial as a threat to American democracy.

            Quoting Scripture, Biden said it was important to ""love thy neighbor as thyself.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798574,NY man pleads guilty to threatening Rep. Greene of Georgia,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — A New York man has pleaded guilty to making threatening phone calls to Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, federal prosecutors announced.

            Joseph Morelli, 51, admitted to threatening to harm Greene in several March 2022 calls to her Washington, D.C., office, the U.S. attorney's office in Syracuse said in a news release Wednesday.

            In one voicemail message, according to prosecutors, Morelli said, “I’m gonna hurt you. Physically, I’m gonna harm you.” In another, prosecutors said, he threatened to “pay someone 500 bucks to take a baseball bat and crack your skull.” In a third call, Morelli said he would “make sure that, even if they lock me up, someone’s gonna get you ’cause I’ll pay them to,” prosecutors said.











            Morelli, of Endicott, New York, was indicted in April 2022 on three counts of transmitting interstate threatening communications. Endicott is a village located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the city of Binghamton. 

            Morelli pleaded guilty on Wednesday and faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 when he is sentenced on June 1, prosecutors said.

            A message seeking comment was left with Morelli's attorney at the federal public defender’s office.

            Greene, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, has been criticized for embracing conspiracy theories and suggesting that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be executed for treason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798587,Stone Age rock paintings discovered in France,"As the French regional newspaper La Provence reported on Wednesday, the paintings were discovered on a cliff in the Mercantour National Park in the French Maritime Alps, only about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the ""Vallee des Merveilles,"" or the ""Valley of Wonders,"" which is known for its some 40,000 Stone Age rock engravings.The newly discovered paintings, which are estimated to be 4,000 years old, depict warriors, combat operations and funerals.The President of the Mediterranean Alps Institute of Prehistory and Archaeology Prehistory, Claude Salicis, is enthusiastic about the find.As he reported to the newspaper Nice-Matin, until this new find, only two paintings of this type had been identified in the entire district. ""Here we have 120 at once. That means that this site is one of the most important in all of Provence,"" he said.According to Salicis, the Stone Age painters ground up the local sedimentary rock, mixed it with colored pigments and applied their motifs with their fingers.Marcel and Loic Pietri, father and son, discovered the paintings while climbing. The cliff that overlooks the hamlet of La Roche has been used for hiking and climbing for a number of years, but they were the first to notice the works.The two explorers are deeply rooted in their home region and know the area around Valdeblore near the Italian border very well.Lime was removed from the rock face several times in the past. Certainly some prehistoric works were destroyed.Salicis suspects that the cliff was a sacred place for the Celto-Ligurian warriors of the Neolithic Age.Unlike the famous Lascaux cave paintings in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, the newly discovered works have been exposed to wind and weather for thousands of years. Nevertheless, the scenes are clearly recognizable.Traces of humans and ""archaic human species,"" as they are called, go back up to a million years in the French Mediterranean region.This article was originally written in German.",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798588,Ewa Pajor's dedication sums up Wolfsburg's recipe for success,"There's no room for half-hearted attitudes at a club like Wolfsburg. Mentality trumps everything and it's a big reason they've dominated German football since 2013.And in a team full of relentless, driven beasts, it says something that Ewa Pajor stands above the rest when it comes to her approach to football.""I rarely see a player who gives as much as Ewa in every single training session,"" Wolfsburg coach Tommy Stroot told DW in a press conference this week. ""The bar is already high for us, so for anyone to exceed that, is unbelievable.""Ewa Pajor's goals this season have propelled Wolfsburg to lofty heights. In a year where Bayern Munich and Eintracht Frankfurt threatened to topple their Bundesliga title monopoly, they've simply raised their game, and ten wins from 10 sees them command a five-point buffer at the top.For Pajor, it's simply the Wolfsburg way.""Our motto is 'always hungry'. Wolfsburg always want to win and I love this mentality. We want to win every title every year,"" she tells DW. ""Here you have to give everything in every department. In training, in games ... it doesn't matter who we play.""On Saturday, Wolfsburg host Freiburg to restart the season after the winter break and Pajor will be looking to add to her league-topping eight goals this campaign.Pajor's dedication to Wolfsburg started almost immediately when she arrived as a slight 18-year-old from Poland in 2015. She took time to settle, but she quickly bought into the club's ethos.Surrounded by established world-class talent, such as Pernille Harder and Caroline Graham Hansen, Pajor elevated her game to match her teammates. She exploded in the 2018-19 season, finishing top scorer with 24 goals in just 19 league matches.""When I arrived here I met some really strong personalities, such as Alexandra Popp, Anna Blässe, Nilla Fischer. I learned from them,"" she says. ""And now I want to pass on that knowledge.""Eight years later, she is now one of Wolfsburg's longest-serving players and she's thriving off her responsibility as a role model for the team, on and off the pitch.With 108 goals in 152 games, she's currently joint-fourth in Wolfsburg's all-time list of top scorers, and the top scorer in both the Bundesliga and Champions League this season, too. A further 51 goals in 70 international appearances for Poland show she firmly belongs in the conversation about the world's best strikers.While her natural instinct in front of goal is Pajor's deadliest weapon, the 26-year-old's talents extend far beyond her goalscoring ability.She boasts it all, so much so that Stroot described her as the ""perfect overall package."" She presses opposition ferociously, her pace is lethal on the counter attack and her dribbling from deep creates openings for teammates. Even her modest height hasn't stopped her being a handful in the air. The mere mention that she's a complete player, however, is enough to get her animated.""No, no, no, there are still so many things I can still improve,"" she insists. ""I think in every year, every training session, every game, you can always do everything even better. My philosophy is that I still have to improve. I still have to be more precise, more … everything.""We have to give 100%, always. If [newly promoted] Meppen comes here then no one can think we can play 50%. No, it's always 100%. That's how it is.""For the past decade, this mentality, as well as financial muscle from backers Volkswagen, has kept Wolfsburg at the top of German football with 16 trophies in 10 years.And as women's football in Germany attracts more invesment and interest, new competition has emerged in the shape of Bayern and Eintracht. Instead of a 'big one,' the next few years promise the development of a 'big three.'Neither team has managed to keep pace with Wolfsburg this season, but Pajor has welcomed with the league's progression.""The Bundesliga is still developing and there is room for improvement,"" she says.""We can be stronger as an entire league and that's what we aim for. There is still a lot of potential left in the Bundesliga but we can be the best league in the world. I think we already are but we still want to improve.""Yet despite Wolfsburg's domestic dominance, there is still something missing from Pajor's trophy haul, and that's the Champions League. She's been through three missed opportunities, losing to Lyon each time in the 2016, 2018 and 2020 finals.""They all hurt. But afterwards you have the experience. And our goal is to be there in Eindhoven and win the final [this year],"" she says. ""We'll focus on ourselves, work hard, and take that step towards our goal.""At the moment, Pajor isn't a household name outside Germany, however with injuries behind her the next year or two should see her profile rise alongside the likes of Sam Kerr and Ada Hegerberg. Success in the Champions League would certainly help, too.And despite big clubs in England and Spain, backed by financial power, aiming to take control of the competition, Pajor doesn't seem interested in finding success and recognition elsewhere.""From the very start I felt at home at Wolfsburg. This is the best place for me, it's the best team in the world. And I'm excited about our new goals. I'm so proud to be able to play here,"" she says.It's a sentiment reciprocated by her coach. ""Ewa simply has an incredible attitude and brings it every day. We're extremely happy to have her.""Pajor's obsessive fixation on improvement and success is the perfect fit for Wolfsburg. And if the club is to rise back to the top of European football, and stave off the emerging Bundesliga threats, Pajor will be the one leading the way.",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798589,Two European lawmakers lose immunity in graft probe,"The European Parliament on Thursday lifted the immunity of two lawmakers who will now face questioning by Belgian authorities in a graft probe linked to Qatar and Morocco.They, and four people already in custody, are suspected of involvement in a bribery scheme that allegedly saw the two countries trying to influence decisions by the European legislature by means of money funneled through nongovernmental organizations.The two MEPS, Marc Tarabella from Belgium and Andrea Cozzolino from Italy, have both declared their innocence, and Qatar and Morocco have also denied any wrongdoing.Tarabella even himself voted in favor of having his immunity lifted, telling reporters later that ""I remind you that I'm innocent in this affair"" and that he looked forward to ""justice running its course.""The affair has cast a bad light on an institution that itself has often pointed to cases of corruption in other quarters.According to the report by the parliamentary committee in charge of the affair, Tarabella is suspected of accepting large amounts of money for taking particular points of view in the parliament in favor of a third country over the past two years.Cozzolino is under suspicion of having made a deal with others in 2019 to oppose parliamentary decisions that could harm the interests of certain nations. He, too, is believed to have accepted money in return for the positions he professed.The investigation is looking at suspected cases of bribery, money laundering and criminal organization that involve European Parliament lawmakers, ex-lawmakers and parliamentary aides, among others.Several addresses, including Tarabella's, were raided by police in December, with €1.5 million ($1.6 million) in cash discovered under suspicious circumstances.Police ended up detaining and charging four people, including Greek MEP Eva Kaili, one of the legislature's 14 vice presidents. She has since been removed from that position.The other three are Kaili's boyfriend, former parliamentary aide Francesco Giorgi, former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri and Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the head of an NGO that shared an address with an NGO founded by Panzeri. All three are Italian.Panzeri has struck a plea bargain with prosecutors under which he is to hand over evidence of bribes made and the individuals involved in return for a lighter sentence.Kaili has insisted on her innocence, while Giorgi reportedly has partly confessed.tj/sms (dpa, AFP)",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798590,India: How Goa succeeded in eliminating rabies,"Rabies is a zoonotic disease which has no known cure, and the highest case fatality rate of any infectious disease.The majority of cases in humans occur after being bitten by a rabid dog. Worldwide, the disease kills around 59,000 people every year, with over one third of those deaths in India.In October 2021, India launched a new national action plan to end rabies deaths by 2030, in line with a global goal announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018.The plan emphasizes a ""one health"" approach to disease control in which animal, environmental and human health are considered in tandem — meaning that the control of rabies in dog populations is essential for the successful elimination of the disease in humans. 
Rabies experts agree that vaccinating 70% of dogs in a community would result in herd immunity, which would prevent the disease from circulating.Although the science is clear, there has been widespread skepticism that countries with high numbers of street dogs — such as India — would be able to achieve a 70% vaccination rate. The campaign in Goa is the first to prove that state-level disease elimination is possible.The project, led by the NGO Mission Rabies, began in 2014 and has since received backing from the state government, as well as global recognition for its success.Mission Rabies was initially founded as an initiative of the United Kingdom-based non-profit Worldwide Veterinary Service, and aims to reduce human deaths from dog-transmitted rabies.Dr. Murugan Appupillai, the Director of Education at Mission Rabies, attributes the success in Goa in part to the receptiveness of the state government to the campaign.""Collaboration with the government is very important to move forward in India,"" he said.He believes that Goa's success proves that country-wide elimination of the disease in humans is possible, with consistent support and funding from the government.""If the political will is there, we could take a very short time to eliminate it,"" Appupillai added.The NGO's approach consists of remote teams of dog vaccinators, who systematically work their way through towns and villages vaccinating dogs.This involves catching street dogs in large nets, before vaccinating them and marking them in non-toxic green paint, and then releasing them again.Their progress is recorded in a smartphone app, which collects data on dog sightings, geographical areas covered by the team, and the details of the vaccinated dogs.According to a study in the science journal Nature, a 70% dog vaccination coverage rate was achieved for the first time in 2017 using this method, with 97,277 dogs out of an estimated total population of 137,353 dogs vaccinated.The study also noted that the project was ""very cost effective"", not only saving the state government money on healthcare-associated costs, but also reducing economic loss from death: an estimated 2,249 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were averted during the program period, at $526 (€478) per DALY.As well as vaccinating dogs, the methodology emphasizes ramping up disease awareness in society, such as running education programs in schools across Goa.Children are taught how to avoid dog bites, as well as what to do if bitten. Currently, many rabies deaths occur due to incorrect post-bite treatment.The WHO recommends that the wound site is thoroughly washed and that the victim is vaccinated within 24 hours, in order to prevent the virus from taking hold. Around 30%-60% of all rabies victims in India are children under 15.Education is also important in order to ensure the success of vaccination efforts however, said Dr. Appupillai.""Awareness creation is very, very important to move forward, especially in diseases like rabies, because it involves human support in a big way,"" he said, explaining that the participation of locals is often vital in helping remote vaccinator teams to find community dogs and vaccinate pets.A greater awareness of the dangers of the disease can also help to push for increased political action, said Dr. Appupillai — something which he believes has been lacking at national level to date, due to the disease affecting predominantly poor, rural communities. 
""Unless there is a public pressure, the government doesn't work in India"", he said.That is something that is gradually changing across the country however, with huge pressure on the government to take action against rabies in states such as Kerala, where a series of high-profile cases in children recently led to widespread outrage.The state government now plans to partner with Mission Rabies to replicate the Goa program.Dr. Appupillai is confident that the same methodology can be successfully applied in other states, with the goal of eventually achieving country-wide elimination of human rabies.""Definitely it will be successful. We have done it already, and we made it successful,"" he said.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/2/2,,

            Shares of the drugmaker slid Thursday after Merck released an earnings forecast that fell well short of projections by industry analysts.

            In the final quarter of 2022, Keytruda sales grew 19% to $5.45 billion. Overall revenue climbed 2% to $13.83 billion.











            Sales of the company’s COVID-19 treatment, Lagevrio, slipped 13% to $825 million. Merck said a strong dollar hurt international sales, which included growth in Japan and the United Kingdom.

            Overall, Merck’s net income fell 20% to $3 billion compared to the final quarter of 2021, as research and development costs also jumped.

            Adjusted earnings totaled $1.62 per share.

            Analysts expected earnings of $1.53 per share on $13.66 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to FactSet.

            Keytruda again led Merck in full-year revenue last year by bringing in nearly $21 billion. Lagevrio, which U.S. regulators approved in late 2021, recorded $5.7 billion in sales. Most of that came in the year's first two quarters.

            The company expects sales for the COVID-19 treatment to tumble to around $1 billion in 2023. 

            Merck leaders have cited the evolving pandemic and the amount of inventory still in the marketplace as factors behind the drop.

            Merck expects adjusted earnings to range between $6.80 and $6.95 per share in 2023 on revenue of $57.2 billion to $58.7 billion.

            Analysts forecast earnings of $7.33 per share on $57.94 billion in sales, according to FactSet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798592,"Harry Kane has records in sight, but trophies elude him","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Harry Kane will become Tottenham’s all-time leading scorer with a goal against Manchester City on Sunday.

            The striker’s wait for a major trophy, however, will go on.

            Kane is set to surpass the late Jimmy Greaves’ club record of 266 goals, which has stood for 53 years. He is also tied with Wayne Rooney with 53 goals for England's national team and has a chance to eclipse that record total before the season ends.











            Alan Shearer’s benchmark of 260 Premier League goals remains the long-term target, with Kane currently at 199.

            While those statistics confirm Kane's status as one of the finest forwards in soccer history, at 29 years old his career is in danger of being left unfulfilled in terms of trophies.

            It could have all been so different if Pep Guardiola got his way in 2021 when Kane was the City manager’s leading transfer target. Had that move gone through, Kane might already have ended his wait for silverware — and be much closer to Shearer’s record.

            Instead, it is Erling Haaland now knocking in the goals for City and on course to break Premier League scoring records this season.

            The Norway international has thrived from the service of Kevin De Bruyne, scoring 25 league goals already — two more than last season’s co-Golden Boot winners, Mo Salah and Son Heung-Min, managed in the entire campaign. In total, Haaland has 31 goals in only 26 appearances for City.

            While Kane cannot match that daunting strike rate, he has been as consistent as ever, with 16 goals in the league and 18 overall in a Tottenham team that is nine points below City and uncertain of qualifying for the Champions League next season.

            Some believe that Kane would have been more suited to Guardiola’s tactics than Haaland because of his ability to drop deep and link the midfield with the attack.

            City’s system has become more direct with Haaland up front and, at times, more predictable as a result.

            Even with the numbers being produced by the 22-year-old Haaland, the reigning champions trail Arsenal by five points at the top of the standings, having played a game more. It could be eight points by time City kicks off at Tottenham, with Arsenal playing Everton on Saturday.

            Kane is focused on putting himself in a position to win the biggest team prizes, rather than just individual honors. And that may well have to be at a club other than Tottenham.

            His name did not feature highly during the January transfer window, but it could be a different story at the end of the season when he will have one year left on his contract. Manchester United is looking for a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo and has long-been linked with Kane.

            That move is one of the few realistic options if Kane does leave Tottenham, given the Premier League’s greater spending power in comparison to Europe’s other big leagues.

            Tottenham’s reported price of about $123 million for Kane would also be an obstacle to all but the richest clubs.

            Kane’s age is another factor. He will be 30 by the start of next season.

            And while recent years have proved there is a market for forwards in their 30s, Kane’s price tag could be prohibitive. At the same age, Sadio Mane joined Bayern Munich from Liverpool for $43 million last year. And Barcelona signed Robert Lewandowski from Bayern for $52 million when he was about to turn 34.

            Kane has suggested in the past that he would rather stay in England and the Premier League might be the best chance of Tottenham demanding maximum money, even if it means selling to a direct rival.

            Chelsea and Newcastle are the other teams likely to try to strengthen their attack at the end of the season.

            If he did go overseas, Paris Saint-Germain may need to replace Kylian Mbappe if Real Madrid renews its interest in the France striker. Alternatively, Madrid might see Kane as competition for Karim Benzema, who is 35.

            As one of the few players capable of enhancing just about any team in the world, a case could be made for Kane at the majority of Europe’s leading clubs. For now, Tottenham still has the benefit of his rare goal-scoring talents and is hoping he can lead the team to a top-four finish.

            Guardiola, meanwhile, will hope Kane doesn’t inflict another blow to City’s title ambitions on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798593,Italian mob suspect held in France after 16 years on the run,"PARIS (AP) — Police in southeastern France have arrested a convicted murderer linked to Italy’s most powerful organized crime group, the ‘ndrangheta, who was on the run for 16 years, Interpol and Italian police said on Thursday.

            Italy's ANSA news agency reported that the 63-year-old had been working for the past three years as a pizza-maker in Saint Etienne, where he had lived since 2014.

            An Interpol statement said French police, with help from Italian colleagues, arrested Edgardo Greco in Saint-Etienne. He was wanted for two murders in 2006 and accused of attempted murder in another case. Italian authorities said the two people killed in 2006 were brothers who were beaten to death with a metal bar in a fish shop in Calabria.











            Interpol, the international police organization based in Lyon, France, said the killings were “part of a ‘mafia war’ ... that marked the early 1990s” in Italy.

            Investigations by Italian prosecutors in Catanzaro and police in Cosenza — both in southern Italy — led to the arrest, the Interpol statement said.

            “No matter how hard fugitives try to slip into a quiet life abroad, they cannot evade justice forever,” Interpol chief Jurgen Stock was quoted as saying in the statement.

            The ‘ndrangheta, based in the ‘toe’ of the Italian peninsula, is one of the world’s most powerful cocaine traffickers and is seen as the largest threat among organized crime syndicates. In recent years, ’ndrangheta mobsters have been arrested around Europe and even in Brazil.PARIS (AP) — Police in southeastern France have arrested a convicted murderer linked to Italy’s most powerful organized crime group, the ‘ndrangheta, who was on the run for 16 years, Interpol and Italian police said on Thursday.Italy's ANSA news agency reported that the 63-year-old had been working for the past three years as a pizza-maker in Saint Etienne, where he had lived since 2014.An Interpol statement said French police, with help from Italian colleagues, arrested Edgardo Greco in Saint-Etienne.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798594,"Hawaii whale dies with fishing nets, plastic bags in stomach","HONOLULU (AP) — A whale that washed ashore in Hawaii over the weekend likely died in part because it ate large volumes of fishing traps, fishing nets, plastic bags and other marine debris, scientists said Thursday, highlighting the threat to wildlife from the millions of tons of plastic that ends up in oceans every year.

            The body of the 56-foot (17-meter) long, 120,000-pound (54,431-kilogram) animal was first noticed on a reef off Kauai on Friday. High tide brought it ashore on Saturday.

            Kristi West, the director of the University of Hawaii's Health and Stranding Lab, said there were enough foreign objects in the opening of the whale's intestinal tract to block food.











            “The presence of undigested fish and squid lends further evidence of a blockage,” she said in a news release from the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.

            The whale's stomach contained six hagfish traps, seven types of fishing net, two types of plastic bags, a light protector, fishing line and a float from a net. Researchers also found squid beaks, fish skeleton and remains of other prey in the whale's stomach.

            It’s the first known case of a sperm whale in Hawaii waters ingesting discarded fishing gear, West said.

            The whale's stomach was so large West's team wasn't able to examine it completely. They suspect there was more material they weren't able to recover.

            Researchers found nothing wrong with other organs they examined. They collected samples to screen for disease and conduct other follow-up tests.

            Sperm whales travel across thousands of miles in the ocean so it’s not clear where the debris came from.

            Scientists say that more than 35 million tons (31.9 million metric tons) of plastic pollution is produced around Earth each year and about a quarter of that ends up around the water.

            Marine debris harms numerous species.

            Seabirds can ingest as much as 8% of their body weight in plastic. Endangered Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles can get caught in plastic nets and die. Sharks and other apex predators eat smaller fish that feed on microplastic, which can then endanger their own health.

            In addition to eating plastics, large whales are harmed when they become entangled in fishing gear or other ropes in the ocean. The drag from debris can force whales to use more energy to swim and make it harder for them to eat, causing starvation.

            On Tuesday, marine mammal responders freed a humpback whale that was caught in rope, a bundle of gear and two buoys off the Big Island.

            Sperm whales are an endangered species found in deep oceans across the world.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798596,Putin invokes Stalingrad battle as justifying Ukraine fight,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday marked the 80th anniversary of the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi German forces in the battle of Stalingrad, and invoked the long and grueling fight as justification for the conflict in Ukraine.

            Putin laid a wreath at the eternal flame of the memorial complex to the fallen Red Army soldiers in Volgograd, the current name of the city, which stretches along the western bank of the Volga River. The memorial is dominated by an 85-meter (279-foot) sculpture of a sword-wielding woman, Europe's tallest statue.

            Afterwards, he said: “Now, regrettably, we see that the ideology of Nazism, in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, once again poses direct threats to the security of our country. Again and again we are forced to repulse the aggression of the collective West.” 











            Putin and other Russian officials frequently characterize Ukraine as a hotbed of neo-Nazi beliefs, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is of Jewish descent.

            Referring to Germany's recent decision to supply advanced Leopard battle tanks, Putin warned that ""a modern war with Russia will be quite different for them.”

            “It’s incredible, but it’s a fact: they are threatening us again with German Leopard tanks with crosses painted on their armor,” Putin said.

            “And they are again gong to fight Russia on the territory of Ukraine with the hands of Hitler’s followers, the Banderites,"" he said, referring to WWII-era Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera who was widely considered to be a Nazi collaborator. 

            The battle of Stalingrad has deep resonance in Russia. 

            The five-month fighting between August 1942 and February 1943 is regarded as the bloodiest battle in history, with the death toll for soldiers and civilians reaching as high as 2 million. Most of the city was reduced to rubble before Nazi forces surrendered on Feb. 2, 1943.

            It was a major turning point in the European theater of WWII and the battle remains an immense source of pride in modern Russia, lauded as a demonstration of military might and moral seriousness.

            The city was renamed in 1961 as part of the Soviet Union’s rejection of dictator Joseph Stalin’s personality cult. Calls for the restoration of its old name haven’t received the Kremlin’s blessing.

            As Russian forces struggle to gain ground in Ukraine, lawmakers from the dominant United Russia party have been told to liken the Ukraine fight to Stalingrad, the newspaper Kommersant reported.

            Some Russians on Thursday made the connection explicit.

            ""The achievement of our fathers and grandfathers, showing unprecedented heroism, valor and self-sacrifice during the defense of Stalingrad, still inspires our courageous soldiers who carry out responsible combat missions on the fields of the special military operation and defend the sovereignty, independence and security of our country,” said Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill, using the official characterization of the conflict that began nearly a year ago.

            Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov, after laying flowers at the Unknown Soldier memorial outside the Kremlin, said he hoped Russian forces would prevail in Ukraine.

            “To do this, it is necessary to adopt the unique experience of the victorious Red Army, the Battle of Stalingrad, Oryol, Kursk,"" Zyuganov said.MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday marked the 80th anniversary of the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi German forces in the battle of Stalingrad, and invoked the long and grueling fight as justification for the conflict in Ukraine.Putin laid a wreath at the eternal flame of the memorial complex to the fallen Red Army soldiers in Volgograd, the current name of the city, which stretches along the western bank of the Volga River. The memorial is dominated by an 85-meter (279-foot) sculpture of a sword-wielding woman, Europe's tallest statue.Afterwards, he said: “Now, regrettably, we see that the ideology of Nazism, in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, once again poses direct threats to the security of our country. Again and again we are forced to repulse the aggression of the collective West.”Putin and other Russian officials frequently characterize Ukraine as a hotbed of neo-Nazi beliefs, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is of Jewish descent.Referring to Germany's recent decision to supply advanced Leopard battle tanks, Putin warned that ""a modern war with Russia will be quite different for them.”“It’s incredible, but it’s a fact: they are threatening us again with German Leopard tanks with crosses painted on their armor,” Putin said.“And they are again gong to fight Russia on the territory of Ukraine with the hands of Hitler’s followers, the Banderites,"" he said, referring to WWII-era Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera who was widely considered to be a Nazi collaborator.The battle of Stalingrad has deep resonance in Russia.The five-month fighting between August 1942 and February 1943 is regarded as the bloodiest battle in history, with the death toll for soldiers and civilians reaching as high as 2 million. Most of the city was reduced to rubble before Nazi forces surrendered on Feb. 2, 1943.It was a major turning point in the European theater of WWII and the battle remains an immense source of pride in modern Russia, lauded as a demonstration of military might and moral seriousness.The city was renamed in 1961 as part of the Soviet Union’s rejection of dictator Joseph Stalin’s personality cult. Calls for the restoration of its old name haven’t received the Kremlin’s blessing.As Russian forces struggle to gain ground in Ukraine, lawmakers from the dominant United Russia party have been told to liken the Ukraine fight to Stalingrad, the newspaper Kommersant reported.Some Russians on Thursday made the connection explicit.""The achievement of our fathers and grandfathers, showing unprecedented heroism, valor and self-sacrifice during the defense of Stalingrad, still inspires our courageous soldiers who carry out responsible combat missions on the fields of the special military operation and defend the sovereignty, independence and security of our country,” said Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill, using the official characterization of the conflict that began nearly a year ago.Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov, after laying flowers at the Unknown Soldier memorial outside the Kremlin, said he hoped Russian forces would prevail in Ukraine.“To do this, it is necessary to adopt the unique experience of the victorious Red Army, the Battle of Stalingrad, Oryol, Kursk,"" Zyuganov said.",2023/2/3,,World

            The arrests were made during raids on 16 properties in the two neighboring countries on Monday, prosecutors and police in the southern German states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg said.

            The suspects are aged between 25 and 41 and are Dutch, Moroccan, Afghan, Turkish and Romanian nationals resident in the Netherlands or Belgium, authorities said. German prosecutors are seeking their extradition. Investigators are still looking for another three suspected accomplices.











            The 52 explosions at cash machines in Germany, all but one of them in the two southern states, started in November 2021 and continued until Jan. 19. They took place mostly deep in the night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798598,John Heitinga confirmed as Ajax coach until season's end,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Ajax confirmed former Netherlands international John Heitinga as the coach on Thursday after Alfred Schreuder was fired last week.

            Heitinga, 39, is a product of the storied Ajax youth academy who went on to play for the Amsterdam club as a defender before moving on to Atletico Madrid, Everton, Fulham and Hertha Berlin. He has been coach of Young Ajax, the club's second team, since the start of this season.

            Heitinga will be the coach “at least"" for the rest of the season, Ajax said. Financial terms were not disclosed.











            He was the interim coach last weekend when Ajax ended its seven-game winless streak by beating Excelsior Rotterdam 4-1 to move to fourth in the Eredivisie, five points behind leader Feyenoord.

            “We have a lot of confidence in John's qualities and the vision he expressed” in talks with club leaders, Ajax director Edwin van der Sar said.

            Heitinga played 87 internationals for the Netherlands, including the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg, where he was sent off in extra time. The Dutch lost to Spain 1-0.

            Schreuder was fired just half a season after taking over the reins when Erik ten Hag left to join Manchester United.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798602,Eye drops recalled after US drug-resistant bacteria outbreak,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials said Thursday a company is recalling its over-the-counter eye drops that have been linked to an outbreak of drug-resistant infections. 

            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week sent a health alert to doctors, saying the outbreak included at least 55 people in 12 states. One died and at least five others had permanent vision loss.

            The infections, including some found in blood, urine and lungs, were linked to EzriCare Artificial Tears. Many said they had used the product, which is a lubricant used to treat irritation and dryness. 











            The eye drops are sold under the name EzriCare and is made in India by Global Pharma Healthcare. The Food and Drug Administration said the company recalled unexpired lots of EzriCare Artificial Tears and another product, Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears.

            The FDA recommended the recall based on manufacturing problems including lack of testing and proper controls on packaging. The agency also blocked import into the United States. 

            The infections were caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Investigators detected the outbreak strain in open EzriCare bottles. 

            EzriCare, the company that markets the eye drops in the U.S., said it has stopped distributing the eye drops. It also has a notice on its website urging consumers to stop using the product. 

            Infections were diagnosed in patients in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. A person in Washington died with a blood infection. 

            The outbreak is considered particularly worrisome because the bacteria driving it are resistant to standard antibiotics. 

            Investigators found the bacteria were not susceptible to any antibiotics routinely tested at public health laboratories. However, a newer antibiotic named cefiderocol did seem to work.

            How could eye drops cause infections in the blood or lungs? The eye connects to the nasal cavity through the tear ducts. Bacteria can move from the nasal cavity into the lungs. Also, bacteria in these parts of the body can seed infections at other sites such as in the blood or wounds, CDC officials said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798606,'Daily Show's' Roy Wood to headline White House press dinner,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Real and fake news will collide again at this year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

            Roy Wood Jr., who plays a reporter on “The Daily Show,” the long-running Comedy Central program that blends comedy and news, will headline the event on April 29. 

            Tamara Keith, president of the correspondents' association, said Thursday that Wood brings “a journalistic eye to his comedy.”











            ""He’s hilarious — but also makes sure his audiences are thinking as they laugh,” Keith said.

            The show’s former host Trevor Noah spoke at last year’s dinner, at which President Joe Biden poked fun at himself, former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party and the members of the press.

            “I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have,” Biden, a Democrat, quipped then to an audience of about 2,600, among them journalists, government officials and celebrities.WASHINGTON (AP) — Real and fake news will collide again at this year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner.Roy Wood Jr., who plays a reporter on “The Daily Show,” the long-running Comedy Central program that blends comedy and news, will headline the event on April 29.Tamara Keith, president of the correspondents' association, said Thursday that Wood brings “a journalistic eye to his comedy.”""He’s hilarious — but also makes sure his audiences are thinking as they laugh,” Keith said.The show’s former host Trevor Noah spoke at last year’s dinner, at which President Joe Biden poked fun at himself, former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party and the members of the press.“I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have,” Biden, a Democrat, quipped then to an audience of about 2,600, among them journalists, government officials and celebrities.",2023/2/2,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798610,Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate focuses on parade crash,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A conservative candidate in a pivotal race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is using video images of an SUV that drove through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing six people, in her first television ad of the race released Thursday.

            Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow gained national attention for presiding over the trial of Darrell Brooks, whom a jury convicted of six homicide counts. Dorow sentenced Brooks to life in prison with no chance of release and launched her candidacy for Supreme Court two weeks later.

            Dorow is one of four candidates, and one of two conservatives, in the race for an open state Supreme Court seat that will determine whether the court remains under conservative control or flips to liberals. Both sides see the race as crucial because of the court's role as the final word in battleground Wisconsin, where the Legislature is controlled by Republicans and the governor is a Democrat.











            Whoever wins the April 4 election will determine majority control for the next two years. That period includes the 2024 presidential election. The state Supreme Court ruled against former President Donald Trump in a lawsuit he brought after the 2020 election in which he tried to disqualify enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden's victory.

            A Feb. 21 primary will narrow the Supreme Court race to the top two vote-getters.

            The contours of the court race, which is nonpartisan in name only, are shaping up much like the midterm elections. Conservative candidates are rallying around criminal justice issues, experience and backing from law enforcement while liberals are focusing on abortion and talking about issues like redistricting.

            
                In her first ad released last week, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz promises to protect a woman's right to choose an abortion. 

            Dorow has been endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which only backs candidates “who have pledged to champion pro-life values and stand with Wisconsin Right to Life’s legislative strategy,” according to its website. Kelly is endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life and the state's two other largest anti-abortion groups, Wisconsin Family Action and Pro-Life Wisconsin.

            The state Supreme Court is expected to eventually decide a pending legal challenge to Wisconsin's 1849 law banning abortions, which went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.

            The other two candidates are former conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly and liberal Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell. Neither of them have released television ads with the primary less than three weeks away.

            None of the other three candidates immediately responded to emails seeking comment on the Dorow ad.

            Dorow's spot begins with a video of Brooks' red SUV driving into the path of a marching band during the Waukesha parade in November 2021. Her ad does not show the vehicle hitting people, but she does include video that shows the response as people run and police respond. 

            “Judge Jennifer Dorow ensured justice was served,” the narrator says over images of Dorow in the courtroom, Brooks starting at her and of him shirtless during a court hearing. Brooks was often disruptive during the trial, and Dorow's handling of his behavior during the nationally broadcast trial won her praise and her office was flooded with gifts and congratulatory emails.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798614,Charges against Man United player Greenwood dropped,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood will no longer face charges of attempted rape and assault, the Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday. 

            In a statement, the CPS said charges which also included controlling and coercive behaviour were discontinued. 

            Greenwood was formally charged in October following an investigation that began in January 2022.











            “In this case, a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case,"" the CPS said on Thursday, adding it has a “duty to keep cases under continuous review.”

            The 21-year-old Greenwood was arrested in January 2022 after images and videos were shared on social media.

            He was suspended by United and not permitted to train with the team. 

            United said Thursday after the court decision that it ""will now conduct its own process before determining next steps.” Greenwood is not expected to return to training until that process is concluded.

            Greater Manchester Police said it understood the reasoning for discontinuing proceedings but confirmed its “commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798620,Memorable LeBron James moments as he closes in on NBA record,"As LeBron James closes in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and is about to become the NBA's career scoring leader the journey has included several memorable moments.

            And there have been many. Many.

            Through 20 seasons and four NBA championships, the list of James' unforgettable nights is immeasurably long. But here are five that stand out.











            THE MASK

            The highest-scoring game of his career came on March 3, 2014, when James — playing with a mask to protect a facial fracture — toyed with the Charlotte Bobcats, scoring 61 points to set a Miami Heat record that still stands.

            
                He made 22 of 33 shots in a 124-107 win by the Heat. He made his first eight 3-pointers, the last of them officially listed as being from 29 feet but seemed to be deeper.

            Even the Bobcats were awed.

            “You take away his 61 points,” Charlotte’s Al Jefferson said, “and we still had a fighting chance there at the end.”

            THE LOOK

            Game 6 of the 2012 Eastern Conference finals did not start with Miami in great shape. The Heat were in Boston, trailing the series 3-2, one loss away from elimination and — after losing in the NBA Finals the year before, the first season of James’ tenure in Miami — quite probably needing to win to keep Miami from overhauling the roster.

            James missed his first shot.

            He made his next 12 shots.

            He finished with 45 points, 15 rebounds, five assists — and an intense look cameras caught him making during the game is still a meme today. Miami won 98-79, came home to beat the Celtics in Game 7 and went on to beat Oklahoma City for James’ first NBA title.

            “He was absolutely fearless tonight, and it was contagious,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

            THE STREAK

            On May 31, 2007, James and the Cavaliers went to Detroit for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, series tied 2-2 entering what would become a double-overtime thriller.

            Drew Gooden made a free throw with 2:49 left in regulation to draw Cleveland within 88-84. And that was the last point he, or any Cavs player not wearing No. 23, would score that night.

            
                James scored Cleveland’s final 25 points — and 29 of the Cavs’ last 30 — to lift his team to a 109-107 win and a 3-2 series lead. He even had the game-winner, a layup with 2.2 seconds remaining.

            He finished with 48 points; Cleveland closed out the series with a Game 6 win and sent James to the NBA Finals for the first time.

            “We threw everything we had at him,” said Detroit guard Chauncey Billups, now the Portland Trail Blazers coach. “We just couldn’t stop him.”

            THE PROMISE

            James had promised Cleveland a championship. And then he left in 2010 for Miami, a move that left Cavs fans jilted for years — especially when he won two titles there.

            But when he returned in 2014, all was forgiven. Two years later — June 19, 2016 — he finally delivered what Cleveland had waited generations for.

            
                He had 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, plus a chase-down block of Golden State’s Andre Iguodala to keep the game tied with just under 2 minutes to go. The Cavs went on the Warriors’ floor and dethroned the champions, winning 93-89 and capping a comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.

            It was the first major championship for the city of Cleveland since the Browns in 1964.

            THE FOURTH

            James’ fourth title came with almost no fans there. A handful of team employees and a very select group of invitees were the only ones inside the bubble at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida when the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Miami Heat in the 2020 NBA Finals.

            It capped a season delayed by the pandemic and one where the Lakers had to grieve the death of Kobe Bryant earlier that year.

            James once again had a triple-double in the title-clincher, this time 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. The Lakers won 106-93, taking the series 4-2.

            “Our organization wants their respect. Laker Nation wants their respect,” James said that night. “And I want my damn respect, too.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798624,Special Kosovo court upholds most convictions of 2 veterans,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Appeals judges at a European Union-backed court on Thursday upheld most of the convictions of two leaders of a Kosovo war veterans’ association who were found guilty last year of witness intimidation and obstructing justice.

            The appeals panel of the Hague-based Kosovo Specialist Chambers overturned one conviction of Hysni Gucati and Nasim Haradinaj but upheld four others. Their original sentences of four and a half years were reduced by three months.

            In the ruling Thursday, judges said that it is “fundamental to the fulfilment of the Specialist Chambers' mission that individuals who come to give evidence, often about traumatic or difficult experiences, may do so without fear.”











            Gucati, who was chairman of the Kosovo Liberation Army War Veterans Association, and Haradinaj, his deputy, were arrested in September 2020 for revealing case information, including the identities of hundreds of witnesses and potential witnesses.

            Acting Special Prosecutor Alex Whiting welcomed the ruling, which he said “reinforces the rule of law in Kosovo and sends a clear message to anyone involved in witness intimidation, retaliation against witnesses and obstruction of justice.”

            The special court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the actions of the KLA during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo.

            Prosecutors have indicted several people, including former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, on charges of murder, torture and persecution. All have denied the charges. The trial of Thaci and other defendants is scheduled to begin March 1.

            Witness intimidation has been a major problem in international prosecutions of crimes committed during Kosovo’s fight to break away from Serbia.

            Whiting said his office “takes these crimes extremely seriously and will continue to investigate and to prosecute anyone and everyone involved in every instance.”

            The Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Whiting's linked prosecutor’s office were established following a 2011 report by the Council of Europe. The human rights organization’s report included allegations that Kosovo Liberation Army fighters trafficked human organs taken from prisoners, slain Serbs and fellow ethnic Albanians.

            The court, established in The Hague in part as a response to fears for the safety of witnesses, is part of the Kosovo legal system.THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Appeals judges at a European Union-backed court on Thursday upheld most of the convictions of two leaders of a Kosovo war veterans’ association who were found guilty last year of witness intimidation and obstructing justice.The appeals panel of the Hague-based Kosovo Specialist Chambers overturned one conviction of Hysni Gucati and Nasim Haradinaj but upheld four others.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798626,Blood-flavored ice helps zoo animals beat Rio's heat,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Rio de Janeiro's brutal summer heat has reached 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) on some recent days, sending locals to cool off in the ocean. There weren't many options for residents of the city's zoo, however, until a team of experts started offering them exotic frozen treats. 

            The flavors of ice given to the zoo's carnivores aren't found at your average summer hotspot: Chicken, minced meat and bovine blood. But 14-year-old lion Simba and the 3-year-old black jaguar Poty lap it up. 

            “This is a part of our well-being program. We have lots of activities to include something different in their routine,” said Marina Moraes, a biologist at the zoo. 











            The ice brings cooling relief to the animals, which take their time eating it, and the feeding ritual is a novel sight for visitors. That was the case for an Argentine family that came to the zoo for the first time.

            “It's fantastic because there's this terrible heat and above all it's very humid. We sweat even though there's no sun; it's different from Argentina,” said lawyer Lorena López, who was with her husband and children. “I think it’s perfect for the animals to have their ice.”

            Many of the children seemed fascinated by the activity, and they expressed surprise when they found out the ingredients of the different flavors, which vary according to the species. 

            “For the primates, we offer fruit ice creams, which are sweet and more colorful,"" Moraes said. ""The herbivores can taste kale, pumpkin and carrot.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798627,"Indian Ocean species caught between local, EU interests","MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Indian Ocean countries wanting better safeguards for local marine life by updating fishing quotas and restricting harmful catch methods are facing resistance from the European Union, conservation groups say.

            Officials are gathering in Mombasa, Kenya on Friday for a meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission — a group of 30 countries who regulate and manage the ocean's tuna. India plans to propose to eliminate the use of high-tech devices to scoop vast amounts of marine life and Kenya wants a limit on the devices and more transparency on tuna fisheries. 

            But the EU, which uses the fishing methods other countries want to limit, appears set to oppose the plans.











            Bloom, a Paris-based nongovernmental organization focused on ocean conservation, said the EU should reconsider its stance and join calls by other countries in the region to protect marine life.

            “We urge the EU to abandon its past colonial stance on allocation of quotas,” said Bloom's scientific director, Frédéric Le Manach. “The EU cannot let history repeat itself.” 

            More than 100 environmental conservation groups have called for a halt to the large-scale depletion of stocks and damage to marine species caused by industrial methods which catch vast numbers of tuna.

            “Vacuuming millions of juvenile tuna ... is not okay,"" said Seychellois ecologist Nirmal Jivan Shah. ""What kind of society do we live in when the value of the ocean is reduced to a tuna can?” 

            The Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna is currently listed as “overfished,” according to the Global Tuna Alliance. 

            Last year the commission failed to agree on what to do about concerns raised by the EU on issues like rebuilding yellowfin tuna stocks and new measures to manage drift nets. The bloc said the failure to reach consensus was “a missed opportunity for the sustainable management of the Indian Ocean fisheries.”

            The EU is now proposing that countries adopt biodegradable drift nets. But Manach said the plan is a “joke” that won’t “change anything in the current disastrous situation.” 

            The Associated Press reached out to the bloc's IOTC delegation for comment.

            Talks between member-country officials in Mombasa are scheduled until Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798628,Biden's top economic aide leaving White House,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's top economic adviser, Brian Deese, is leaving his post.

            Biden said Thursday in a statement that Deese would step down as director of the White House National Economic Council. That position had him coordinating policy across the government and negotiating with Congress on coronavirus aid, the budget, infrastructure, the tax code, clean energy incentives, investments in computer chip plants and other measures that the president counts as key victories.

            “Brian has a unique ability to translate complex policy challenges into concrete actions that improve the lives of American people,” Biden said. “He has helped steer my economic vision into reality, and managed the transition of our historic economic recovery to steady and stable growth.”











            It was the second major departure in recent weeks, as White House Chief of Staff R on Klain is also leaving and being succeeded by Jeff Zients, who previously led the administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Deese leaves with the economy having so far avoided a recession that many economists anticipated as the Federal Reserve has lowered inflation by slowing down the economy. Unemployment is at a low 3.5% and semiconductor companies are building new plants, while automakers are shifting toward greater production of electric vehicles.

That position had him coordinating policy across the government and negotiating with Congress on coronavirus aid, the budget, infrastructure, the tax code, clean energy incentives, investments in computer chip plants and other measures that the president counts as key victories.“Brian has a unique ability to translate complex policy challenges into concrete actions that improve the lives of American people,” Biden said. “He has helped steer my economic vision into reality, and managed the transition of our historic economic recovery to steady and stable growth.”It was the second major departure in recent weeks, as White House Chief of Staff R on Klain is also leaving and being succeeded by Jeff Zients, who previously led the administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Deese leaves with the economy having so far avoided a recession that many economists anticipated as the Federal Reserve has lowered inflation by slowing down the economy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798629,Netanyahu visits France amid spike in Mideast tensions,"PARIS (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with France’s president, business leaders and members of France’s Jewish community during a trip to Paris starting Thursday that has angered Palestinian supporters amid a new spasm of violence in the Mideast.

            The visit started with a dinner meeting at the Elysee Palace, where French President Emmanuel Macron's office said he planned to share France’s “solidarity with Israel in the face of terrorism,” but also stress “the need for everyone to avoid measures likely to feed the spiral of violence.” Macron also is offering to help revive long-stalled dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.

            Pro-Palestinian activists plan a protest in Paris on Saturday to decry Macron’s decision to host Netanyahu at such a volatile time in the Mideast conflict. The demonstrators say they will also protest prison conditions in Israel for Palestinian militants, including solitary confinement and limits on family visits.











            Upon departing for France, Netanyahu said Iran and its nuclear program would be “the main topic of our talk” when he meets with Macron.

            Macron has criticized Iran's lack of transparency over its nuclear activities and warned that its support for Russia’s war in Ukraine exposed Iran to further sanctions and growing isolation.

            Netanyahu's trip comes during one of the deadliest periods of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in years. An Israeli military raid last week killed 10 Palestinians, most of them militants but also a 61-year-old woman. A Palestinian shooting attack a day later outside an east Jerusalem synagogue killed seven people, including a 14-year-old.

            The fighting has spilled over into the Gaza Strip. Ahead of Netanyahu’s arrival in Paris, Israeli aircraft struck a rocket production workshop in the Gaza Strip early Thursday, the Israeli military said, hours after Palestinian militants fired a rocket toward Israel.

            Macron and Netanyahu spoke Sunday after the fatal Palestinian shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue.

            Netanyahu is the head of Israel's most right-wing government, which is buoyed by ultranationalist parties who have promised to take a hard line against the Palestinians and to ramp up settlement construction in the West Bank. His government is also undertaking major changes to Israel's judicial system, which has sparked widespread opposition.

            While in Paris, Netanyahu said he would meet with French business leaders interested in investing in Israel and representatives of the Jewish community before leaving Saturday night. 

            Earlier this week, the French government launched a plan aimed at better combating racism and antisemitism, including hate speech proliferating online, and raising awareness about the Holocaust.PARIS (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with France’s president, business leaders and members of France’s Jewish community during a trip to Paris starting Thursday that has angered Palestinian supporters amid a new spasm of violence in the Mideast.The visit started with a dinner meeting at the Elysee Palace, where French President Emmanuel Macron's office said he planned to share France’s “solidarity with Israel in the face of terrorism,” but also stress “the need for everyone to avoid measures likely to feed the spiral of violence.” Macron also is offering to help revive long-stalled dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.Pro-Palestinian activists plan a protest in Paris on Saturday to decry Macron’s decision to host Netanyahu at such a volatile time in the Mideast conflict.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798630,Military places restive areas of Myanmar under martial law,"BANGKOK (AP) — Martial law was declared in several areas of military-run Myanmar on Thursday, a day after authorities extended a state of emergency throughout the country wracked by violence that some U.N. experts have described as a civil war.

            State-run MRTV television broadcast an announcement by Aung Lin Dwe, secretary of the military’s State Administration Council, imposing martial law in 37 townships across eight of the country’s 14 regions and states. Eleven of the townships are in Sagaing region and seven in Chin state, areas in the northwest where fighting has been fiercest between the army and guerrillas belonging to pro-democracy People’s Defense Forces and their allies in ethnic minority militias.

            The army has been struggling to contain a nationwide insurrection by opponents of military rule who took up arms after peaceful protests against the army's Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power were suppressed with lethal force. The military has declared martial law before, most notably in early 2021 in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, after which violence escalated against protesters. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent watchdog group that tracks killings and arrests, at least 2,948 civilians have been killed since the army takeover.











            Aung Lin Dwe said in a statement that it was necessary to declare martial law to effectively carry out security and the rule of law. Martial law supersedes all other laws, giving the military total authority over a specified area, including administrative, judicial and law enforcement functions. The other areas where martial law was declared are in Magway, Bago and Tanintharyi regions, and Kayah, Kayin and Mon states.

            A spokesperson for the opposition’s underground National Unity Government, which acts as a shadow government opposed to army rule, told The Associated Press that he believes the military will increase killings and torture of people under the pretext of stabilizing the country.

            “We want to inform the soldiers and policemen who are protecting the junta not to continue fighting the unwinnable war, that the people are fighting them back,"" Nay Phone said.

            A separate statement from the military said all administrative and judicial work in the specified areas must be led by regional military commanders, who can initiate military tribunals for 23 offenses with punishments including the death penalty and indefinite imprisonment.

            While no appeals will be allowed, submissions for a revision of the punishment can be filed within 15 days. The offenses that can be heard by military tribunals include those under the Counter-Terrorism Law, sedition, treason, incitement, corruption, unlawful association, murder, rape, media law, publishing law, immigration and electronic transactions charges.

            On Wednesday, the military government announced it has extended the state of emergency it imposed when it seized power two years ago, a move that sets back plans for a general election that had been expected in August. It said it was necessary to extend the emergency for six months because the country remains in an abnormal situation and time is needed to prepare for a peaceful and stable election.

            A major reshuffle of the Cabinet and the military’s State Administration Council was also announced Wednesday.

            A report on the reshuffle in Thursday's Global New Light of Myanmar and other state-run newspapers said the Cabinet has been reorganized “for the emergence of a modern, developed, genuine and disciplined democratic nation and for the benefit of the nation and the entire ethnic people.” No specific reasons were given for any transfers or dismissals.

            The Cabinet, in theory the nation’s top administrative body, in practice has less power than the military-dominated State Administration Council. The Cabinet’s power is diminished further under the state of emergency, which allows the military to assume all government functions, and gives the military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, legislative, judicial and executive powers.

            The ministers of defense, home affairs, transport and communications, and planning and finance were appointed to serve concurrently as deputy prime ministers, joining Vice Senior Gen. Soe Win in that position.

            Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin, one of the few members of the leadership with an international profile, was moved from his job to the State Administration Council. The ministers of agriculture, livestock and irrigation, construction, hotels and tourism, and ethnic affairs were also replaced.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798631,Financial misdeeds allowed in Alex Murdaugh murder trial,"A judge has ruled that prosecutors can call witnesses to testify how Alex Murdaugh allegedly stole money as part of the double murder trial for the disbarred South Carolina attorney as long as they can show it is convincing evidence and linked to the killings.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, at their Colleton County home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.

            Judge Clifton Newman on Thursday heard from witnesses outside the presence of the jury to decide whether they can give evidence in the case. 











            First up was Jeanne Seckinger, who has worked her way up to office manager and chief financial officer in 24 years with the law firm founded more than a century ago by Murdaugh’s family. Seckinger testified that Murdaugh sometimes kept entire fees required by rules to be shared with the firm.

            “That would be stealing,” Seckinger said.

            Murdaugh also took money to be paid in lawsuit settlements to clients in wrongful death or accident cases, Seckinger said. Instead of depositing money with a company called Forge Consulting for safekeeping for the clients, Murdaugh created Murdaugh d/b/a Forge” to keep the money for himself, according to bank statements the law firm found in his office, Seckinger said.

            In all, the firm determined Murdaugh diverted more than $2.8 million this way. The law firm paid everyone back, Seckinger said,

            Under cross examination, Seckinger said the scheme had been going on since 2015 without being detected.

            Seckinger also testified that Murdaugh spoke to her about trying to have his fees and other payments diverted to his wife’s accounts because he was worried about a wrongful death lawsuit filed against him, his son and others over a 2019 fatal boat crash where Paul Murdaugh was charged with felony boating under the influence. A hearing in the case was postponed after the killings.

            Seckinger has yet to testify before the jury.

            Instead, jurors heard Thursday afternoon from an investigator about how he found Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone on the side of the road near her property with help from her family.

            A second investigator testified about unlocking the phone and, under cross-examination, said she was “observant” in looking for any evidence of blood but didn't find any as she searched for guns and ammunition in the home the day after the killing.

            Newman said he is inclined to allow the evidence of financial misdeeds because it can complete the story of why the crimes were committed with immediate context.

            Prosecutors said the evidence is key to their case. They said Murdaugh killed his wife and son because Murdaugh was confronted earlier in the day about $782,000 in fees that should be in his law firms account but could not be found.

            Murdaugh planned the killings to gain sympathy and buy time so he could find a way to cover up the missing money as he had numerous times before in the past decade or so, prosecutors said.

            “He was burning through cash like crazy and he was out of options,” prosecutor Creighton Waters argued Thursday. “He constantly had to achieve more more money to avoid the reckoning that was happening.”

            Murdaugh's lawyers said prosecutors are trying to smear Murdaugh with bad behavior not related to the killings to bolster their weak case.

            “They’ve got a whole lot more evidence about financial misconduct than they do about evidence of guilt in a murder case. And that’s what this is all about,” defense lawyer Jim Griffin said.

             The defense called it absurd and ridiculous to think that Murdaugh would believe having his family brutally killed would do anything but bring scrutiny into every nook and cranny of his life.

            And it did. 

            Along with the two murder charges, Murdaugh faces about 100 more counts with most of the charges coming before his murder indictment in July 2022. 

            The accusations range from money laundering, to stealing millions from clients and the family law firm andtax evasion. State agents said Murdaugh's tax returns show he made nearly $14 million as a lawyer over nine years, but also stole nearly $7 million from his law firm at the same time.

            Also testifying Thursday away from jurors was attorney Chris Wilson, who met Murdaugh in law school. He said they were best friends and worked with Murdaugh on several cases. In one of those cases, Murdaugh asked his friend to send his share of his fees to him directly instead of to the family firm.

            Wilson said it was different, but he trusted his friend. Wilson said he even loaned Murdaugh $182,000 because his friend couldn't come up with the $782,000 he had to pay back to his firm.

            Murdaugh's firm called Wilson on Sept. 3, 2021, and told them how Murduagh used his trust to steal money. Wilson said they met the next day and Murdaugh told him he was sorry, he had been addicted to drugs to 20 years and screwed up a lot of people's lives.

            “I was so mad. I had loved the guy for so long, and I probably still loved him a little bit. But I was so mad. I don’t remember how it ended. I just left,” Wilson said.

            Later that day, Murdaugh was shot on the side of a road, the bullet grazing his head. Prosecutors charged him with fraud, saying he arranged his own shooting hoping to be killed so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.

            ""When the hounds are at the door, when Hannibal is at the gates for Alex Murdaugh, violence happens,"" Waters said. “The same thing that happened on the side of the road happened on June 7.”A judge has ruled that prosecutors can call witnesses to testify how Alex Murdaugh allegedly stole money as part of the double murder trial for the disbarred South Carolina attorney as long as they can show it is convincing evidence and linked to the killings.Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, at their Colleton County home.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798632,2 rivals from factory floors facing off in race to lead UAW,"DETROIT (AP) — Two men who began their careers on factory floors are competing to lead the 373,000 members of the United Auto Workers, a union that helps set standards for wages across the nation's manufacturing sector.

            It will be the first-ever direct election of a UAW president in the union's 88-year history.

            The election pits the 57-year-old incumbent, Ray Curry, who started his career on the assembly line at a Freightliner truck plant in North Carolina, against Shawn Fain, 54, who began as an electrician at a Chrysler metal casting plant in Kokomo, Indiana.











            Curry and Fain were the top two finishers in a five-candidate race held in December for a four-year term as UAW president. Because neither man won more than 50% of the vote, they were placed in a runoff election, with ballot counting to start March 1. Separate runoff races are being held for two other UAW positions — a vice president and a regional director. 

            Until this year, the leaders of the UAW had always been chosen by delegates to a convention rather than by rank-and-file union members. But in the aftermath of a bribery-and-embezzlement scandal involving union officials, members voted to hold a direct election this time.

            Candidates who have positioned themselves in opposition to the established union leadership won six of 14 seats on the International Executive Board and could end up capturing as many as eight seats.

            Under Curry's leadership for the past 19 months, the UAW has taken a more aggressive stance in labor talks, having gone on strike against Volvo Trucks, John Deere, the University of California and CNHI, a maker of agricultural and construction equipment.

            In forthcoming contract negotiations, Curry and Fain have each said they would seek to restore traditional pensions, which, beginning in 2007, were replaced by a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan for new hires. Both also want cost-of-living and general pay raises and an end to differing tiers of wages and benefits for workers doing the same jobs, depending on their length of service.

            Here's where the candidates stand on some of the issues, edited for length and clarity:

            WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, OR WOULD YOU DO, TO CHANGE THE UNION AFTER THE SCANDAL?

            FAIN: Let's look at the reform of this union. The Curry slate didn’t want every member to have a right to vote in this election. They want to keep the same tired system where the International Executive Board controls the convention, and they control the election. We’ve been a one-party state for longer than I’ve been alive. A true reformist would want the membership to have a right to vote in the election. These guys still ascribe to the company-union philosophy (where company and union are business partners). The company continually violates our agreements. There’s no action taken to stop it. They are not reformers. 

            CURRY: I came off the assembly floor. I’ve had an opportunity to serve on a staff in a 12-state region in the South. I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience, having served as secretary-treasurer, leading reforms that started in 2019. I was the one who put in place the request for proposals with vendors for top-to-bottom reviews. We were responsive to the membership. We’ve offered training. We want to have the members fully engaged. All those pieces are transparent and will move us forward. We’re not just changing policies and rules. We’re also listening to their voice and going to give them a forum to have discussion with the leadership.

            WHAT DO YOU WANT IN CONTRACT TALKS WITH DETROIT AUTOMAKERS?

            CURRY: Members would like to maintain current provisions, but they want improvements. Those include wage increases. We’ve got to have buying power that’s greater than 2019 in 2023. We’re also looking at reinstatement of cost-of-living allowance. We got that in the truck, defense and aerospace sectors. Our members are really demanding it. In a number of other sectors, we have seen pension increases back for active and retired. We’d also like to talk about those who are post-2007 (hiring date) in the auto sector who do not have a pension. They’ve got traditional 401(k) and savings plans. When we talk about tiers, there’s levels of health insurance, levels of retirement, post-retirement benefits that we believe need to be level for all employees. 

            FAIN: Go back to bankruptcy. The government basically mandated “these were the cuts.” Those weren't to be forever. They were for companies to get back on their feet. The companies got back, and they’ve done amazing ever since. But our workers have been still going like this (motioning horizontally). When those two things don’t go hand-in-hand, there’s a problem, and the workers are fed up. Ending tiers is an issue everywhere in our union. People that have pensions. That don’t have post-retirement health care. It's taking care of retirees who have been neglected for the last 15 years. Our active workers. With the cost of living rising, we have to do better. Look at what ending pensions has done. We used to set the standard. 

            WILL THERE BE MORE STRIKES IF YOU'RE ELECTED?

            FAIN: That’s up to the companies. Our job is to fight for our members. It’s not to fight for the International Executive Board. It’s to prepare our members for whatever action we have to take to protect job security. Job security comes first. Would we strike? Yes, we would. But that’s going to be up to the companies if they don’t treat our workers fairly.

            CURRY: I see that happening when the members' demands aren’t being met. We’re going to be rational in our conversation. We will utilize all the meeting time up to whatever contractual deadline that we have. But when the members believe that the process isn't moving forward in their best interest, I will be supportive of authorizing strikes.

            STELLANTIS WANTS TO CLOSE THE BELVIDERE, ILLINOIS, PLANT. CAN IT BE SAVED?

            CURRY: I wasn’t involved early in the process because of not having the assignment and not being president at the time. But when the announcement came about, we immediately started having conversations with the corporation. We also started raising awareness nationally. I had a chance to talk to (Stellantis CEO) Carlos Tavares. I alerted (President Joe Biden) that we had a product in a U.S. state, and the future-generation product for 2023 was to be built in Mexico. We believe we’re making a good business case why Belvidere survives. We’re going to keep fighting. 

            FAIN: That's the problem with our leadership: They’re too reactive instead of being proactive in addressing these things up front. When you know that three years ago, and there’s product coming, the leadership should have taken action to secure that work, and they failed to do so. We have language in our contract that says the companies will not spin off, split off, sell or close or idle any plant. And there’s only a couple exceptions, which are an act of God, a severe economic downturn. That’s not the case. A strike is not the only option.DETROIT (AP) — Two men who began their careers on factory floors are competing to lead the 373,000 members of the United Auto Workers, a union that helps set standards for wages across the nation's manufacturing sector.It will be the first-ever direct election of a UAW president in the union's 88-year history.The election pits the 57-year-old incumbent, Ray Curry, who started his career on the assembly line at a Freightliner truck plant in North Carolina, against Shawn Fain, 54, who began as an electrician at a Chrysler metal casting plant in Kokomo, Indiana.Curry and Fain were the top two finishers in a five-candidate race held in December for a four-year term as UAW president. Because neither man won more than 50% of the vote, they were placed in a runoff election, with ballot counting to start March 1. Separate runoff races are being held for two other UAW positions — a vice president and a regional director.Until this year, the leaders of the UAW had always been chosen by delegates to a convention rather than by rank-and-file union members. But in the aftermath of a bribery-and-embezzlement scandal involving union officials, members voted to hold a direct election this time.Candidates who have positioned themselves in opposition to the established union leadership won six of 14 seats on the International Executive Board and could end up capturing as many as eight seats.Under Curry's leadership for the past 19 months, the UAW has taken a more aggressive stance in labor talks, having gone on strike against Volvo Trucks, John Deere, the University of California and CNHI, a maker of agricultural and construction equipment.In forthcoming contract negotiations, Curry and Fain have each said they would seek to restore traditional pensions, which, beginning in 2007, were replaced by a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan for new hires. Both also want cost-of-living and general pay raises and an end to differing tiers of wages and benefits for workers doing the same jobs, depending on their length of service.Here's where the candidates stand on some of the issues, edited for length and clarity:WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, OR WOULD YOU DO, TO CHANGE THE UNION AFTER THE SCANDAL?FAIN: Let's look at the reform of this union. The Curry slate didn’t want every member to have a right to vote in this election. They want to keep the same tired system where the International Executive Board controls the convention, and they control the election. We’ve been a one-party state for longer than I’ve been alive. A true reformist would want the membership to have a right to vote in the election. These guys still ascribe to the company-union philosophy (where company and union are business partners). The company continually violates our agreements. There’s no action taken to stop it. They are not reformers.CURRY: I came off the assembly floor. I’ve had an opportunity to serve on a staff in a 12-state region in the South. I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience, having served as secretary-treasurer, leading reforms that started in 2019. I was the one who put in place the request for proposals with vendors for top-to-bottom reviews. We were responsive to the membership. We’ve offered training. We want to have the members fully engaged. All those pieces are transparent and will move us forward. We’re not just changing policies and rules. We’re also listening to their voice and going to give them a forum to have discussion with the leadership.WHAT DO YOU WANT IN CONTRACT TALKS WITH DETROIT AUTOMAKERS?CURRY: Members would like to maintain current provisions, but they want improvements. Those include wage increases. We’ve got to have buying power that’s greater than 2019 in 2023. We’re also looking at reinstatement of cost-of-living allowance. We got that in the truck, defense and aerospace sectors. Our members are really demanding it. In a number of other sectors, we have seen pension increases back for active and retired. We’d also like to talk about those who are post-2007 (hiring date) in the auto sector who do not have a pension. They’ve got traditional 401(k) and savings plans. When we talk about tiers, there’s levels of health insurance, levels of retirement, post-retirement benefits that we believe need to be level for all employees.FAIN: Go back to bankruptcy. The government basically mandated “these were the cuts.” Those weren't to be forever. They were for companies to get back on their feet. The companies got back, and they’ve done amazing ever since. But our workers have been still going like this (motioning horizontally). When those two things don’t go hand-in-hand, there’s a problem, and the workers are fed up. Ending tiers is an issue everywhere in our union. People that have pensions. That don’t have post-retirement health care. It's taking care of retirees who have been neglected for the last 15 years. Our active workers. With the cost of living rising, we have to do better. Look at what ending pensions has done. We used to set the standard.WILL THERE BE MORE STRIKES IF YOU'RE ELECTED?FAIN: That’s up to the companies. Our job is to fight for our members. It’s not to fight for the International Executive Board. It’s to prepare our members for whatever action we have to take to protect job security. Job security comes first. Would we strike? Yes, we would. But that’s going to be up to the companies if they don’t treat our workers fairly.CURRY: I see that happening when the members' demands aren’t being met. We’re going to be rational in our conversation. We will utilize all the meeting time up to whatever contractual deadline that we have. But when the members believe that the process isn't moving forward in their best interest, I will be supportive of authorizing strikes.STELLANTIS WANTS TO CLOSE THE BELVIDERE, ILLINOIS, PLANT.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798633,"Bryan Adams, crafting albums amid Grammy Award nomination","NEW YORK (AP) — Bryan Adams may have nabbed his first Grammy nomination in over two decades, but he won't be at the ceremony. He's got a gig that night. 

            The Canadian rock star had committed to a concert in Las Vegas on Sunday and he didn't want to disappoint his fans or his crew by cancelling.

            “Work is work. I mean, I’ve got 40 people in my tour, so I want to make sure I keep them in hot food and shoes, you know?” he said earlier this week. 











            Working hard is a theme for Adams, who last year released four albums — his 15th studio effort, “So Happy It Hurts,” the cast album for “Pretty Woman: The Musical” and “Classic” and “Classic Pt. II,” which saw him re-record songs from his catalog and handle most of the instruments.

            
                On Sunday, he's up in the category of best rock performance for “So Happy It Hurts,” the title track, which includes the lyric “I’m so happy it hurts/I’m so glad, it’s outrageous.” His last nomination came in 1998 with the song “I Finally Found Someone.” 

            “I’m absolutely gobsmacked to be nominated, especially after such a long time. But, I mean, I’m really appreciative. I don’t think I’m going to win it, but I’m happy to be nominated,” he said. 

            To win, Adams must beat Beck and his cover of Neil Young’s “Old Man”; “Patient Number 9” by Ozzy Osbourne featuring Jeff Beck; The Black Keys' “Wild Child;” Brandi Carlile's “Broken Horses”; Idles' “Crawl!” and Turnstile's “Holiday.” Adams suspects “Patient Number 9” will win to honor Jeff Beck, who died earlier this year.

            If Adams does win, the trophy will join the Grammy he won in 1992 for best song written for a motion picture for “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,” which was used on the “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” soundtrack.

            This is a remarkably rich period for the 63-year-old singer-songwriter. He says ideas were coming all the time as he crafted “So Happy It Hurts” and he recorded more songs than usual. Faced with the pandemic, he ended up playing most of the instruments by himself. 

            “I’m not a particularly good drummer, but I sure love giving it every everything I have to try and make it great,” he says, laughing. 

            The album is filled with gratitude and mature love, with optimistic titles like “You Lift Me Up,” “I've Been Looking for You” and “Let's Do This.” On the song “These Are the Moments That Make Up My Life,” he sings “I like to make the kids breakfast/I like the family way/I like the sound of their laughter/While I plan out my day.”

            “I think one of the things as a songwriter which we should actually tap into is our truth,"" he says. ""If you can start writing songs that really are about your truth and being able to really open up in a way that you can relate it to your life without giving too much away, I think people will connect with it.”

            He also dug up his old amps, guitars and equipment and began re-recording all his hits, like “Summer of '69,"" “Run to You” and “Everything I Do (I Do It for You).” He did it after Universal Music Group refused to return his original masters and drew inspiration from Taylor Swift, who has begun re-recording her catalog, too.

            “It brought back a lot of memories. It brought back memories of, first of all, where I was, who I was recording with, the amount of work that went into making those records and sort of the appreciation generally of what I was doing back then,” he said. 

            “There’s sort of minor alterations to things, but generally I stay true to the original recordings because I felt that’s what people would recognize,"" he added. ""Unless it was a live recording, it needed to have the same structure and emotion.”

            This year will find Adams in familiar territory — working. After a spring tour of Asia, he hits 26 cities across the U.S. this summer, kicking off in Baltimore in June with stops in New York City, Boston, Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco and more. Joan Jett is opening.

            He also plans a “Classic Pt. III” and has recorded three of his early albums live at the Royal Albert Hall in London that he hopes to release — “Cuts Like a Knife,” “Into the Fire” and “Waking Up the Neighbors.” 

            “It’s super exciting,” he says, and then has to go. After all, he has a gig on late night TV to prepare for.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798644,"At Nichols' funeral, Black America's grief on public display","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The sound of the djembe drums started as a low tremble and grew more distinct as the musicians drew closer to the hundreds gathered inside the Memphis church.

            “We love you, Tyre,” the drummers chanted, referring to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man whose beating by five police officers led to his death and this funeral on the first day of Black History Month.

            By the time the procession reached Nichols’ black casket draped in a large white bouquet, the congregation in the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church was on its feet shouting the chant in unison. Some raised clenched fists. Others let out screams of grief. Many grabbed tissues to dab at tears. All of it streamed live on television.











            The funeral on Wednesday had all the hallmarks of what’s known as a homegoing service in Black American communities: comforting gospel hymns, remembrances from loved ones and a stirring eulogy from a clergyman.

            But in addition to offering an outlet for the private mourning of Nichols’ family and friends, this ritual was also public and political. It was a venue to air the shared grief of Black Americans — and to once again call for leaders to address an epidemic of police violence so that this time might be different.

            “As we celebrate Tyre’s life and comfort this family, we serve notice to this nation that the rerun of this episode that makes Black lives hashtags has been canceled and will not be renewed for another season,” said the Rev. J. Lawrence Turner, senior pastor of the church. 

            “We have come and we shall overcome,” he said.

            Such funeral services are one part heartfelt tribute and one part civil rights rally — a symbolic tax Black Americans have paid time and again from Emmett Till and George Floyd to those killed in mass shootings by white supremacists in Charleston and Buffalo.

            “Grieving has many forms — the form that it’s taken for African Americans, historically and even today, is that the grieving process for us is not silent,” said W. Franklyn Richardson, chairman of The Conference of National Black Churches, a public policy and social justice organization that represents predominantly Black Christian denominations.

            “Part of the way you get healed is to do something about what has happened to your loved one unfairly,” he said. “You have the opportunity, while you have the attention, to try to participate in getting justice.”

            Not all victims’ families welcome the attention. Some will put limits on the number of journalists and cameras allowed into the funeral, or ask that media be prohibited from the service altogether.

            But the public is rarely shut out, and funerals for Black victims of brutality and racist violence typically draw people who did not personally know the victim — from the community where the violence occurred and from across the U.S.

            Shirley Anderson, a lifelong resident of Memphis, said she had been grieving over Nichols since his death on Jan. 10, three days after a traffic stop by a now-disbanded police unit. Video released of the stop shows Black officers holding Nichols down and repeatedly punching him, kicking him and striking him with batons as he screamed for his mother. Five officers have been charged with murder.

            The thought that her three grandsons could meet the same demise brought Anderson to Wednesday’s service.

            “Lord, have mercy! I don’t want nothing to happen to them that’s happened to Tyre and so many before Tyre,” Anderson, 58, said after the funeral ended.

            Some have argued that the collective grief in Nichols' death is compounded by the fact that his attackers were themselves Black. Others have countered that the attackers’ identity is more evidence that systems of policing continually produce racist outcomes, no matter who wears the badge.

            During Wednesday's service, Nichols’ family shared details that almost anyone would want remembered about their loved one. As a kid, Nichols was easy to care for, as long as he had a big bowl of cereal and the TV fixed on cartoons, his older sister Keyana Dixon shared. 

            He loved photography. He was an avid skateboarder. He was father to a 4-year-old son.

            During a eulogy, the Rev. Al Sharpton sought to assure Nichols’ mother and stepfather that their loss won't be in vain.

            “I believe that babies unborn will know about Tyre Nichols because we won’t let his memory die,” said Sharpton who, in just the last decade, has delivered remarks on such occasion dozens of times. 

            “We’re going to change this country because we refuse to keep living under the threat of the cops and the robbers.”

            Elected officials typically attend these funerals to send a signal to the community that their cries for justice aren’t being ignored. But Vice President Kamala Harris’ presence Wednesday was also personal. Harris, who is the nation’s first Black vice president and the first of South Asian descent, spoke of the fears of Black parents for their children. 

            “Mothers around the world, when their babies are born, pray to God, when they hold that child, that that body and that life will be safe for the rest of his life,” Harris said. “When we look at this situation, this is a family that lost their son and their brother, through an act of violence, at the hands and the feet of people who have been charged with keeping them safe.”

            Among the most prominent examples of using such a funeral to call for justice was that of Emmett Till, a Black 14-year-old whose lynching in Mississippi in 1955 catalyzed the U.S. civil rights movement.

            His mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, demanded that Emmett’s decomposing remains be taken back home to Chicago and placed in an open casket at a funeral attended by tens of thousands. Till-Mobley’s mission to spread Emmett’s story, as only a heartbroken mother could, galvanized calls for justice and eventually helped spur passage of landmark federal civil rights and voting rights legislation.

            That example and others speak to the complexity of Black grief, said civil rights leader the Rev. William Barber II. It’s not just the loss of the loved one, but that they were taken by violence that Black people have worked for decades to eradicate, only to face it again, he said.

            “The grieving is so multifaceted,” said Barber, who is president of the Repairers of the Breach, a faith-based social justice nonprofit, and founding director of the Center for Public Theology & Public Policy at Yale Divinity School.

            While a smattering of law enforcement reforms has been enacted, countless proposed measures meant to address structural racism in policing have shriveled due to partisan gridlock.

            “I’m tired of the tears,” Barber said. “When will America decide that death from bad public officials and public policy is no longer acceptable?”

            That Black Americans nevertheless continue to bear their pain publicly is a testament to the community’s understanding of what’s at stake if it doesn’t grieve in this way, said Richardson, of The Conference of National Black Churches.

            “There’s no alternative,” he said. “There are no guarantees when you fight against injustice. But we have to expose it.”

            Anderson, the Memphis-based grandmother, said she struggles to not let grief overtake her.

            “It’s so hard, when you’ve got so many killings of people who look just like me,” she said. “I hope peace comes from this, but most of all police reform. Keep your hands up off my children!”

It’s not just the loss of the loved one, but that they were taken by violence that Black people have worked for decades to eradicate, only to face it again, he said.“The grieving is so multifaceted,” said Barber, who is president of the Repairers of the Breach, a faith-based social justice nonprofit, and founding director of the Center for Public Theology & Public Policy at Yale Divinity School.While a smattering of law enforcement reforms has been enacted, countless proposed measures meant to address structural racism in policing have shriveled due to partisan gridlock.“I’m tired of the tears,” Barber said. “When will America decide that death from bad public officials and public policy is no longer acceptable?”That Black Americans nevertheless continue to bear their pain publicly is a testament to the community’s understanding of what’s at stake if it doesn’t grieve in this way, said Richardson, of The Conference of National Black Churches.“There’s no alternative,” he said. “There are no guarantees when you fight against injustice. But we have to expose it.”Anderson, the Memphis-based grandmother, said she struggles to not let grief overtake her.“It’s so hard, when you’ve got so many killings of people who look just like me,” she said. “I hope peace comes from this, but most of all police reform. Keep your hands up off my children!”___Aaron Morrison is a New York City-based member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798648,"Finland, Sweden confirm commitment to joint NATO accession","The prime ministers of Finland and Sweden said on Thursday that they remain committed to joining the NATO alliance at the same time, despite comments from Turkey that it may approve Finnish accession without Sweden.""I don't like this atmosphere, position where Sweden is presented as a sort of trouble child in the classroom. I don't think this is the case,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in response to Turkey's continued opposition to Sweden joining the alliance.""Sweden also ticks all the boxes that are needed to become a member of NATO,"" she added during a visit to Stockholm.The two Nordic nations applied to join NATO in May 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, following years of neutrality during the Cold War. But Turkey has blocked the accession with various demands regarding Kurdish opposition figures residing in Sweden.Ankara has demanded that Sweden extradite individuals that it claims are members of the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) — a group categorized as terrorist by both Turkey and the EU.Sweden and Finland signed a memorandum with Turkey that laid out their path to NATO membership but Ankara has repeatedly criticized Stockholm for its perceived lack of cooperation.The situation deteriorated on Wednesday when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded to the burning of the Quran in Stockholm by a far-right activist.""Sweden, don't even bother! As long as you allow my holy book, the Quran, to be burned and torn, and you do so together with your security forces, we will not say 'yes' to your entry into NATO,"" Erdogan said.Erdogan has already hinted that Turkey could approve Finland's membership without approving that of Sweden. An agreement must be unanimous among all NATO countries for another to join. So far, Hungary and Turkey are the only ones yet to give their approval.Thursday's comments from Prime Minister Marin come after Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto appeared to suggest that Finland was considering joining NATO ahead of Sweden.At the same time, a slight majority of Finns appeared to be in favor of joining NATO even without Sweden, according to a poll reported by AFP.However, the joint news conference has confirmed Finland's commitment to the trilateral agreement.""We embarked on this journey together and we do the journey towards membership together,"" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Thursday.ab/jcg (Reuters, EFE, dpa, AFP)",2023/2/2,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798650,War in Ukraine: A stress test for US-German relations,"If it feels like Groundhog Day, it's not just because the American holiday is this week. The labored decision by Western allies to send Ukraine their main battle tanks is just the most recent iteration of a pattern of support that kicked off with Russia's invasion almost one year ago.What starts as a hard no, whether to heavy weaponry, advanced air defense, or top-tier armored vehicles, slowly softens to a yes, but only after weeks of negotiations, technical excuses, and efforts among allies to show unity even as those that want to move faster put pressure on more reluctant partners.For the United States and Germany, the alliance's largest members particularly in terms of economic might, industrial capacity, and purchasing power, the question of how and how much to help Ukraine defend itself has colored the bilateral relationship in new ways. And that is also just one part of a much more complex, global picture.After the bullying years of President Donald Trump, his successor Joe Biden has taken a catch-more-flies-with-honey approach to European allies. Rather than a ""strategy of blame,"" he and his administration have shown patience and frequently praised Germany for its contributions.That is also an effort to give Germany the diplomatic ""cover"" it needs to make uncomfortable policy decisions, Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, senior expert with the German Marshall Fund's Berlin office, told DW.Most recently, Biden publicly complimented Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his ""steadfast commitment"" to Ukraine and credited Germany for having ""stepped up.""Behind closed doors, however, Kleine-Brockhoff said, the debate over the recent issue of battle tank deliveries took on a different tone.""The German chancellor put pressure on the Americans and said, 'I will not before you do.'"" Kleine-Brockhoff explained. ""That has caused some irritation on the Washington side,"" especially because the US has refrained from pushing Germany.Although Biden denied that pressure from Scholz forced him to change his mind on sending US Abrams tanks, the weeks-long exchange was a reminder of the German need for its bigger ally to show its hand before it feels it can reveal its own.Policymakers in Washington have now realized ""how much the Germans actually want to be following, not leading,"" Kleine-Brockhoff said.For Scholz's critics, that seems to contradict his blustery address to the Bundestag, the German parliament, just days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February. In it, he declared a ""Zeitenwende"" — a historic turning point — that demanded a significant boost in military spending and a more robust security policy.""It took a war for the Germans to shift course"" on long-simmering ""irritants"" in the US-German relationship, Kleine-Brockhoff said.For the Americans, those were Germany's resistance to higher military spending — that had been falling short of the NATO agreement of 2% of GDP — and its Nord Stream gas projects with Russia. Germany, for its part, was irked by the idea that an ally would threaten sanctions to deter from that energy deal.Those issues have since fallen by the wayside, as has Germany's  domestic debate about its participation in NATO ""nuclear sharing,"" a policy that puts US nuclear weapons on German soil and requires German aircraft to carry them.Biden's impulse to put American interests first, such as with the subsidy-rich Inflation Reduction Act, and his vision of a coalition of democracies standing up to autocracies, make for a complex balancing act that plays out in the US-German relationship.Whereas Germany views Ukraine as a matter of regional security, for the US the war there is one piece in a convoluted game of geopolitical chess. A weaker Russia could be a boon to US interests elsewhere — a view that Germany simply doesn't share.""With a few exceptions, [Germany] doesn't even have the mental or intellectual firepower to think in those terms,"" James Davis, the Director of the Institute for Political Science at the University of St. Gallen, told DW. ""Nobody is trained to do that.""The US needs Germany to share more of the burden of defending Europe so it can commit more resources to contest China in the Pacific. Meanwhile, Germany needs to know it can count on US support in Europe.""Would you place your bets with the US right now? It's a fair question,"" Davis said.Coming out of the damage of the Trump years, US allies like Germany face bipartisan interest in the Pacific and the expectation they will have to get tougher on China. An unpredictable Republican party controls Congress, which threatens a cataclysmic debt default in the US and serves as a sober reminder that the clock on the Biden White House is ticking.It's striking, Davis said, that despite major changes to the US-German relationship since the post-9/11 years, Germany's reluctance to lead on foreign policy issues remains much the same.German governments were critical of US militarism in Iraq, torture and abuse of captured fighters, and a mass spying campaign — of which the German government at the time was a target — which the political scientist said led them to want to keep away from the US and do little on the world stage.The transatlantic relationship is now much warmer, but that hesitation remains.""There's still this frustration, this kind of tension in the trans-Atlantic relationship,"" Davis said, ""but this time it's because the Germans say, 'only with you.'""The center-left Social Democrats, who lead Germany's ruling three-party coalition, have often advocated a cooperative approach with Russia, the biggest country in Europe and a major trading partner until the invasion. Many SPD lawmakers have changed their stance as a result of Russian aggression, but the party's critics remain skeptical.Political ambivalence gets some backing from voters in eastern Germany, the erstwhile communist GDR that was a client state of the Soviet Union, who feel culturally closer to Russia than those in Germany's western parts, and have little appetite for confrontation with Moscow.Former West Germany may be more pro-American, but the sentiment comes with the Cold War-era expectation of the US taking the lead.""You've had quite a long time to grow into the new role,"" Davis said, rejecting the validity of the German ""refrain"" of its Nazi past and subsequent aversion to military power. ""It reminds me of 30-year-olds who don't want to move out of their parents' houses,"" he added.Edited by Rina Goldenberg",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798651,NJ councilwoman found shot to death outside of her home,"SAYREVILLE, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey borough councilwoman was found shot to death in an SUV outside of her home in a quiet townhouse complex, where police Thursday searched the area without making an arrest. 

            Sayreville Councilwoman Eunice Dwumfour, 30, was found around 7:20 p.m. Wednesday, according to the Middlesex County prosecutor’s office. She had been shot multiple times and died at the scene.

            Dwumfour, a Republican, was elected to her first three-year term in 2021, when she ousted a Democratic incumbent. Colleagues recalled her as a soft-spoken devout Christian who could maintain her composure in contentious situations. 











            “She was a 30-year-old woman. To have this happen in such a tragic way, I mean, our hearts are just broken and everybody wants an answer,” said Karen Bailey Bebert, the local GOP chairwoman who served as her campaign manager. “So we’re waiting with bated breath.”

            Authorities have not said whether they believe the motive for the killing might be personal, political or a random act.

            In a 2021 campaign interview, Dwumfour described herself as a proud graduate of Newark public schools who earned a degree in women’s studies at William Patterson University while working part-time as an EMT.

            She said she moved to Parlin, a section of Sayreville, after graduating “because of the tremendous public safety work the community does.” That interest fueled her run for council, where she served as a liaison to the police department now helping to investigate her death.

            “She just wanted to make a better community for all our children,” said Bebert.

            Dwumfour, who had a school-age child, announced at a fall council meeting that she had recently gotten married, Bebert said. She was active in her church in Newark, and several people affiliated with the church had ties to the same Sayreville address. 

            She married a fellow member of Champions Royal Assembly in ceremonies celebrated in August in New Jersey and in November in Abuja, Nigeria, where the church is based, according to announcements and photos the couple posted on social media. 

            Dwumfour worked in information technology, according to her LinkedIn page, where she posted last month that she was looking for a new opportunity. Her resume also said that she worked for six years with a religious nonprofit group called the Fire Congress Fellowship Inc., which was also based at her Sayreville address. 

            Both she and Christian Onuoha, who was elected to the borough council with Dwumfour in 2021 and became its president last month, are listed as officers of the group. Onuoha, who also shares the address, declined to discuss Dwumfour in a phone call with The Associated Press on Thursday. 

            A next-door neighbor, Chyann Brown, said she was arriving home Wednesday evening just as police were “flying in the complex.” 

            “When I came to park my car, there were shell cases everywhere. ... I (saw) the car was still rolling down the street,” she said of Dwumfour's vehicle.

            Brown said they had spoken over the past year, but she did not realize Dwumfour was involved in local politics.

            “She’s a very nice woman. She’s always well-dressed,” she said. “I can’t believe she would be involved in such a tragic incident.” 

            Sayreville police searched the wooded area between the complex and the Garden State Parkway, which abutted the neighborhood. There was at least one police dog combing the area, and officials also used a backhoe to lift heavy grates off drainage areas to search as well.

            Several high-ranking state leaders, including Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, issued statements expressing their grief over her death. John Wisniewski, a former Democratic state Assembly member from Sayreville, had spoken to her at a few council meetings.

            “Almost always her comments were about God, divine providence. She was a woman of faith,” Wisniewski said.

            Bebert described Dwumfour as an outgoing person who “always had that beautiful smile on her face that you see in her picture.”

            Sayreville, a borough of roughly 45,000 people, is about 30 miles (about 48.2 kilometers) south of Manhattan. At the scene Thursday, another car in the parking lot had damage apparently sustained when Dwumfour’s car struck it.

            Bebert, who described Sayreville as a peaceful community, hopes to organize a vigil to celebrate what she called “a life cut too short by such a heinous criminal act.”

            “She was so young,” she said. “It's just rippling through the town.”

(AP) — Award-winning actor and bestselling author Bob Odenkirk was feted Thursday as 2023 Man of the Year by Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which included a roast during which he donned a pink dress over his clothes.

            Odenkirk, best known as shady lawyer Saul Goodman on “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul,” received his Pudding Pot award at the celebratory roast ahead of a preview of Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 174th production, “COSMIC RELIEF!""

            “I’m thrilled and surprised and I’m knocked out by what’s happening today,” Odenkirk said following the roast. “It’s been fun meeting all these students. It’s a crazy honor.”











            Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which dates to 1844 and calls itself the third-oldest theater group in the world, has handed out a Man of the Year Award since 1967. Last year’s recipient was Jason Bateman, and previous honorees include Bob Hope, Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery.

            The awards are given out to people who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment. 

            During the 20-minute roast, Odenkirk was asked to don a pink dress over his clothes.

            “It fits. It’s nice. It makes me look sharp,"" he said. “And I like the little bears.”

            The student presenters also referenced many of his past roles, including going back to his early years writing for Saturday Night Live. They also repeatedly poked fun at his thinning hair.

            “I’ve tried everything. Supplements. Plugs. Devil worship,"" he quipped during a sketch in which he read cue cards held up by students on stage.

            He also read a comedically disjointed acceptance speech.

            “As I’ve stated repeatedly throughout this speech, comedy and acting go hand in hand like a pendulum swinging up and down like a clock that’s broken but appears to work,” he said.

            At the end of the event, he was asked to press his hands into a tray of butter — ala The Hollywood Walk of Fame — as part of new ad campaign “Butter Call Saul."" Odenkirk complied and was handed his pudding pot.

            During a news conference after the event, Odenkirk said he was looking forward to more comedic roles in the future.

            “I love doing sketch comedy so much,"" he said.

            Actress Jennifer Coolidge has been named Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 2023 Woman of the Year. She will be honored at a separate event on Saturday.

            Odenkirk reprised his “Breaking Bad” role of Saul Goodman, aka Jimmy McGill, in “Better Call Saul,” which earned him three Critics Choice TV awards and multiple Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG Award nominations.

            He is also the star and executive producer of “Lucky Hank,” adapted from the novel “Straight Man” by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo, which is scheduled to premier on AMC and AMC+ on March 19.

            Other acting credits include “Nobody,” “Mr. Show with Bob and David” and “Girlfriend’s Day.” 

            He received two Emmy Awards for his comedic writing for “Saturday Night Live” in 1989 and for “The Ben Stiller Show” in 1993. 

            In 2013 Odenkirk co-wrote The New York Times bestseller “Hollywood Said No!,” a collection of unproduced screenplays, and his third book released in March 2022, a memoir entitled “Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama,” went to No. 2 on The New York Times bestseller list.CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798654,"US ambassador's views on Hungary 'irrelevant,' minister says","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The Hungarian foreign minister accused the United States ambassador to Budapest on Thursday of trying to interfere in Hungary’s internal affairs, amid a growing diplomatic rift between the U.S. and the Central European country. 

            At a news conference in Budapest, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto lashed out at comments in Politico this week in which Ambassador David Pressman referred to Hungary’s approach to the war in neighboring Ukraine as pushing “policies endorsed by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”

            Szijjarto said it is “completely irrelevant what (Pressman) or any other ambassador thinks about the domestic political process in Hungary, because it has nothing to do with him.”











            ""It is not his place to interfere in Hungary’s internal affairs,” Szijjarto said. 

            Pressman, an appointee of the Biden administration who earlier served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations for Special Political Affairs, has faced significant headwinds since taking office in Hungary in August last year. 

            Local media loyal to the right-wing government of populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban have accused the diplomat of meddling in Hungary's judiciary, and of pushing American colonialism.

            Since taking office, Pressman has been vocal about a growing wave of anti-American sentiment in Hungary, and on the reluctance of Orban's government to join the European Union in imposing sanctions on Moscow for its war in Ukraine. Writing on Twitter in January, Pressman asked, “How does protecting Russian oligarchs from sanctions serve Hungary and Hungarians?” 

            Yet Hungary's government, which had an amicable relationship with the U.S. administration under former President Donald Trump, has insisted that sanctions are hurting European countries more than Russia, and declared that only negotiations between Moscow and Washington — and not the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine — can bring an end to the war. 

            On Thursday, Szijjarto said Pressman would “have a very difficult job in terms of working effectively to improve cooperation” between Hungary and the U.S. if he criticized Budapest's policies.

            “That era is over. Hungary is a sovereign country,” Szijjarto said. “No one from outside can tell us how to live.” 

            Responding to Szijjarto’s comments in a tweet Thursday, Pressman wrote, “Respectfully, we do not consider Russia’s attempt to unilaterally redraw the borders of Europe as just a ‘domestic political development in Hungary.’”BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The Hungarian foreign minister accused the United States ambassador to Budapest on Thursday of trying to interfere in Hungary’s internal affairs, amid a growing diplomatic rift between the U.S. and the Central European country.At a news conference in Budapest, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto lashed out at comments in Politico this week in which Ambassador David Pressman referred to Hungary’s approach to the war in neighboring Ukraine as pushing “policies endorsed by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”Szijjarto said it is “completely irrelevant what (Pressman) or any other ambassador thinks about the domestic political process in Hungary, because it has nothing to do with him.”""It is not his place to interfere in Hungary’s internal affairs,” Szijjarto said.Pressman, an appointee of the Biden administration who earlier served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations for Special Political Affairs, has faced significant headwinds since taking office in Hungary in August last year.Local media loyal to the right-wing government of populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban have accused the diplomat of meddling in Hungary's judiciary, and of pushing American colonialism.Since taking office, Pressman has been vocal about a growing wave of anti-American sentiment in Hungary, and on the reluctance of Orban's government to join the European Union in imposing sanctions on Moscow for its war in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798655,"Nordic PMs: Keep calm, we still plan to join NATO together","STOCKHOLM (AP) — In a strong show of unity, the prime ministers of Finland and Sweden on Thursday called for calm amid tensions with Turkey over their applications to become NATO members and reaffirmed their intent to have the two countries join the military alliance at the same time. 

            A series of recent demonstrations in Sweden, including a Quran-burning, has infuriated the Turkish government, which already had held off approving the Nordic nations’ NATO membership while pressing them to crack down on exiled members of Kurdish groups it considers terrorist organizations.

            “I think it’s very important that we send today a clear message: Finland and Sweden applied together, and it’s in everybody’s interest that we will join together in NATO,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said. “And both countries are filling all the boxes when it comes to NATO membership.”











            Marin and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson discussed their pending NATO bid during a joint news conference in Stockholm on Thursday. “We embarked on this journey together and we do the journey toward membership together,” Kristersson said.

            While pledging continued solidarity, Marin refused to speculate on “how many years Finland should wait” but said she did not like Sweden being described “as a sort of troubled child in the classroom.”

            “I don’t think this is the case. Sweden also ticks all the boxes” when it comes to NATO membership,” she said. “Sweden isn’t a troublemaker.”

            Last month, a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm, while an effigy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was hung outside city hall in the Swedish capital during a separate protest. 

            Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey won’t allow Sweden to join NATO as long as the country permits protests desecrating Islam’s holy book to take place. The Turkish leader suggested several days earlier that his country might ratify Finland’s application before taking any action on Sweden’s. 

            NATO requires unanimous approval from its existing members to admit new ones. Turkey and Hungary are the only allies that haven't formally endorsed Sweden and Finland's accession. 

            “Events and activities in Sweden during the last past weeks have complicated the close and respectful dialogue with Turkey,"" Kristersson said at the news conference with Marin. ""Individual manifestations carried out by small groups or even of individuals have consequences for how Sweden is perceived abroad.” 

            In Finland, where no anti-Turkish or anti-Islam demonstrations have taken place recently, violating religious peace is a criminal offense, and desecrating a book held sacred by a religious community would likely violate the law. As a result, police wouldn’t allow a protest that involved burning the Quran.

            Marin explained that burning any religious book or any objects in public was forbidden under Finnish law. 

            A poll published Thursday in Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat asked respondents if they thought Finland should join NATO even if took Sweden longer or if the country should wait for their joint accession. Some 53% said Finland’s membership shouldn’t be tied to the timetable for Sweden.

            Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO in May, abandoning decades of military nonalignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.STOCKHOLM (AP) — In a strong show of unity, the prime ministers of Finland and Sweden on Thursday called for calm amid tensions with Turkey over their applications to become NATO members and reaffirmed their intent to have the two countries join the military alliance at the same time.A series of recent demonstrations in Sweden, including a Quran-burning, has infuriated the Turkish government, which already had held off approving the Nordic nations’ NATO membership while pressing them to crack down on exiled members of Kurdish groups it considers terrorist organizations.“I think it’s very important that we send today a clear message: Finland and Sweden applied together, and it’s in everybody’s interest that we will join together in NATO,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said. “And both countries are filling all the boxes when it comes to NATO membership.”Marin and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson discussed their pending NATO bid during a joint news conference in Stockholm on Thursday. “We embarked on this journey together and we do the journey toward membership together,” Kristersson said.While pledging continued solidarity, Marin refused to speculate on “how many years Finland should wait” but said she did not like Sweden being described “as a sort of troubled child in the classroom.”“I don’t think this is the case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798657,"Exuberant Springsteen, E St. Band launch 1st tour in 6 years","TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — It's been six years since Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band embarked on a major tour.

            Judging by the first show Wednesday night in Tampa, Florida, you'd never know it. The Boss and his band served notice they are back.

            At just under three hours, it wasn't quite one of the marathon performances the 73-year-old Springsteen is best known for. But kicking off with “No Surrender” and finishing with a solo acoustic “I'll See You In My Dreams,” Springsteen was in fine voice, and his big band matched his energy.











            There were 19 musicians on the Amalie Arena stage at various points during the show, including the core of Springsteen's wife, singer Patti Scialfa, bandana-wearing guitarist Stevie Van Zandt, fellow guitarist Nils Lofgren, drummer Max Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent and keyboardist Roy Bittan.

            Missing of course was the original “Big Man,” sax player Clarence Clemons, who died in 2011. But his nephew Jake Clemons didn't miss a beat and ripped off some gorgeous solos throughout the night. He was backed by a brass section that rounded out the big sound.

            The 28 songs included favorites like “Born To Run,” “Glory Days,"" “Rosalita,” “Promised Land” and “Backstreets.” Yet six songs came from Springsteen's 2020 album “Letter To You,” and left unplayed at least for this performance was the classic “Thunder Road.”

            There was only one song from “The River,” which his 2017 tour played in its entirety. That was the exuberant “Out In The Street.” And the closing acoustic song “Dreams” was a staple of his “Springsteen On Broadway” performances.

            Springsteen's devoted fans ate it all up, with 20,000 people in the arena standing for almost the entire show. For them, a performance by the Boss is a kind of religious experience that simply must be sought out.

            “This is a ray of light. This is something we've been waiting for,” said Billy Himmelrich, who came over from Delray Beach. 

            His wife, Shelly, took it a step further: “I listen to his music all the time. In a way, he's my spiritual leader.”

            Springsteen didn't have a whole lot to say to his fans, ripping instead through song after song with little banter. But he did acknowledge his age — and theirs, too.

            “At 15, it's all tomorrows. And at 73, it's a whole lot of yesterdays,” Springsteen said. “That's why you've got to make the most of right now.”

            And Springsteen delivered. His energy was as high as ever, venturing into the crowd and even conducting the brass section at one point. He shredded numerous guitar solos, and almost every song seemed epic, like a couple of dozen encores strung together.

            It's clear he and the band just want to play. Fifty years after his first two albums were released — and before “Born To Run” made him a superstar — Springsteen may not jump as high, but when he raises his arms, everyone else must as well.

            Springsteen doesn't have to “Prove It All Night,” but that's what he does. He's sold around 140 million albums, won 20 Grammys, an Oscar and a Tony award. Few artists can match those accomplishments.

            And now it's on to the rest of the 31-date U.S. tour, which ends with a homecoming April 14 in New Jersey. From there, it's off to Europe, starting with an April 28 show in Barcelona, Spain.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798658,Looking for love online? New study shows mixed experiences,"NEW YORK (AP) — Whether looking for love or a casual encounter, 3 in 10 U.S. adults say they have used a dating site or app — with mixed experiences, according to a Pew Research Center study out Thursday. For the under-35 set, more than half have tried it.

            The overall number, which amounts to 30%, is unchanged since 2019, the last time the center took a broad look at online dating. In 2015, 15% of U.S. adults said they had used a dating site or app, said lead researcher Colleen McClain.

            “When we talk to users who have been on the sites more recently, we see that there is really a mix of emotions,” she said. “Everything from burnout to elation.”











            Among the study's key takeaways for McClain: 1 in 10 adults who have a partner said they met their current significant other on a dating site or app. The number rises to 1 in 5 for those under 30.

            Asked about their reasons for using the platforms, 44% of current or recent users had finding a long-term partner top of mind, with 40% responding that they wanted to date casually. Twenty-four percent were in search of casual sex and 22% were hunting for new friends.

            Using dating sites and apps is most popular among adults under 30, Pew reported, with 53% saying they have done it. That compares with 37% of those ages 30 to 49; 20% of those 50 to 64; and 13% of those 65 and older.

            Atlanta firefighter Andy Giron, 33, is among the pleasantly surprised. He said he had always considered digital dating “a little weird” until recently.

            Giron had just gotten out of a long-term relationship in 2019 when he decided to give Tinder a try for some casual dating. That didn't work out after a couple of times but he hit gold on Hinge a short time later. 

            “My wife was my first date on Hinge,” he said. “She was so easy to talk to and we had a lot in common. There was an immediate connection when we first met in person.""

            The two married six months later, soon after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. They now have a year-old daughter. Giron was inspired to turn to online dating by his sister, who found her spouse the same way.

            “I always thought you should meet someone the regular way, in person, but this is the way the world is now,” Giron said.

            Across age groups, 51% of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults have used a dating site or app. 

            Men are more likely than women to report positive experiences in digital dating, 57% vs. 48%, and LGB users are more likely than straight users to say the same, 61% vs. 53%. White or Black adults who have used one of the platforms are more likely than Hispanic users to say their experiences have been negative.

            The number of men who have used dating sites or apps in the past year and said having casual sex was a major reason was 18 percentage points greater than female users who said the same.

            The Pew research is based on a survey of about 6,000 U.S. adults taken from July 5-17 last year.

            Online daters’ experiences were mixed, with 53% saying they have been at least somewhat positive. Fourteen percent said they have been very positive, and 48% said their experiences have included at least one of four unwanted behaviors explored in the study.

            Thirty-eight percent of those reporting negative experiences said they received unsolicited sexual messages or images, and 30% cited unwanted continued contact. Twenty-four percent said they were called an offensive name, and 6% said they were physically threatened. 

            Female users were more likely to report such experiences, especially those under 50.

            Like Giron, 22-year-old Liv Loughlin, a tech company marketing associate in San Jose, California, had just ended a long-term relationship when she first tried digital dating last September.

            “I wanted to jump into it, especially to meet people because I was new to the area,” she said. “My first date on a dating app was on Hinge and it was crazy. He was immediately very, very touchy and there were all these sexual overtones to everything he said. ... I ended up bailing.”

            But Loughlin didn't give up. She turned to Bumble and is now happily in a relationship with a man she met there.

            “I figured I had hit rock bottom and it couldn't go anywhere but up,” she said.

            Safety is a large concern for some digital daters. There have been demands over the years for more protections, such as required background checks, in light of reported stalking, and sexual assaults and other violence. Few sites require such checks of every user.

            “We see that Americans are divided on this,” McClain said. “Forty-eight percent say that dating sites are a safe way to meet people. A very similar share, 49%, say that they’re not safe.”

            A majority overall said dating sites and apps should require people to undergo background checks.

            Stacy Overcamp, 58, an unemployed marketing specialist, knows the dangers firsthand. She's been dating online since about 1998, with several contacts leading to relationships over the years.

            “I’ve never had a problem meeting men online. I’ve had a problem meeting quality men online,"" said Overcamp, in suburban San Francisco. One long-term relationship ended in stalking, harassment and a restraining order, she said. Other men she dated turned out to be broke, drug users or liars. But she remains active as her priorities have shifted to marriage. 

            Overcamp estimates 30 or 40 contacts a month.

            “It would take me five years to talk with and connect with that many men if I weren't online,” she said. 

            Pew studied eight sites and apps. Tinder was the most commonly used, with 46% of digital dating users saying they had tried it. That amounts to 14% of all U.S. adults. About 10% of U.S. adults said they had used Match or Bumble. Six percent said they had tried OkCupid, eharmony and Hinge.

            Grindr and HER were far more popular among lesbian, gay or bisexual online dating users than straight users. Some 34% of LGB users said they had tried Grindr and 10% said they had tried HER.

He was immediately very, very touchy and there were all these sexual overtones to everything he said. ... I ended up bailing.”But Loughlin didn't give up. She turned to Bumble and is now happily in a relationship with a man she met there.“I figured I had hit rock bottom and it couldn't go anywhere but up,” she said.Safety is a large concern for some digital daters. There have been demands over the years for more protections, such as required background checks, in light of reported stalking, and sexual assaults and other violence. Few sites require such checks of every user.“We see that Americans are divided on this,” McClain said. “Forty-eight percent say that dating sites are a safe way to meet people. A very similar share, 49%, say that they’re not safe.”A majority overall said dating sites and apps should require people to undergo background checks.Stacy Overcamp, 58, an unemployed marketing specialist, knows the dangers firsthand. She's been dating online since about 1998, with several contacts leading to relationships over the years.“I’ve never had a problem meeting men online. I’ve had a problem meeting quality men online,"" said Overcamp, in suburban San Francisco. One long-term relationship ended in stalking, harassment and a restraining order, she said. Other men she dated turned out to be broke, drug users or liars. But she remains active as her priorities have shifted to marriage.Overcamp estimates 30 or 40 contacts a month.“It would take me five years to talk with and connect with that many men if I weren't online,” she said.Pew studied eight sites and apps. Tinder was the most commonly used, with 46% of digital dating users saying they had tried it. That amounts to 14% of all U.S. adults. About 10% of U.S. adults said they had used Match or Bumble. Six percent said they had tried OkCupid, eharmony and Hinge.Grindr and HER were far more popular among lesbian, gay or bisexual online dating users than straight users. Some 34% of LGB users said they had tried Grindr and 10% said they had tried HER.___Find Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie",2023/2/3,,World

            S&H Global, whose parent company is South Korean garment manufacturer Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd., said in a statement that strikes and social unrest have led to numerous delays in shipments, order cancelations and other problems. As a result, the company said its clients have opted to use other more reliable suppliers and factories elsewhere in the Caribbean and Central America.

            The announcement comes as poverty and hunger deepens across Haiti amid a spike in gang violence.











            S&H Global is the anchor tenant at a major U.S.-backed industrial park in Caracol in northern Haiti. The park opened in 2012 and is believed to be Haiti’s largest private employer.

            At the time, S&H Global announced it was investing more than $70 million to create some 20,000 jobs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798660,Average long-term mortgage rate falls a fourth straight week,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate declined for the fourth week in a row, a sign of relative stability that could potentially open the door for some prospective homebuyers to get back in the market.

            Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate fell to 6.09% from 6.13% last week. That's the lowest level since September. The average rate a year ago was 3.55%.

            The average long-term rate reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in late October and early November as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and tame inflation.











            At its first meeting of 2023 Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark lending rate 0.25 percentage points, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. 

            While acknowledging that some measures of inflation have eased, Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest Wednesday that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes this year.

            Though those rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

            The big rise in mortgage rates during the past year has throttled the housing market, with sales of existing homes falling for 11 straight months to the lowest level in more than a decade. Higher rates can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices.

            The National Association of Realtors reported earlier this month that existing U.S. home sales totaled 5.03 million last year, a 17.8% decline from 2021. That is the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since 2008, during the housing crisis of the late 2000s. 

            Though home prices have retreated as demand has declined, they are still more than 10% higher than a year ago. 

            The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, fell this week to 5.14% from 5.17% last week. It was 2.77% one year ago.The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate declined for the fourth week in a row, a sign of relative stability that could potentially open the door for some prospective homebuyers to get back in the market.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate fell to 6.09% from 6.13% last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798662,Iowa voids Illini students' tickets when it discovers prank,"It would have been a great college prank, but the Iowa athletic department crushed it.

            The Illinois student spirit group “Orange Krush” had its order for 200 tickets to the men's basketball game at Carver-Hawkeye Arena on Saturday canceled Wednesday after Iowa discovered the person who made the purchase falsely claimed the tickets were for a Boys and Girls Club in Champaign.

            Iowa issued a refund for $5,400 and donated the 200 tickets to the Boys and Girls Club of Cedar Rapids.











            
                Iowa athletics tweeted that when it contacted the Champaign Boys and Girls Club about the order, it was obvious the club did not buy the tickets.

            “When contacting the individual who made the original ticket order,"" the statement said, “they admitted to falsely ordering tickets under the non-profit organization.”

            That person was Kilton Rauman, an Illinois senior and vice president of Illini Pride, the umbrella organization for Orange Krush.

            Rauman said Thursday the group routinely uses an assumed identity to buy tickets for its annual road trip to an opponent arena. The reason, he said, is that he would expect an order from a group that cheers for the visitor and heckles the home team would be rejected.

            For last year's trip to Purdue, he said, he successfully bought 50 tickets for a group of “Boy Scouts.” He said he also has bought tickets for a “family reunion.”

            “In the past we've been turned away for ordering under Orange Krush, which is completely understandable,” Rauman said. “I don't think our athletic department would want to sell to a group of 200 kids from the Paint Crew at Purdue.”

            Rauman said he called Iowa in September to order discounted group tickets for “a Boys and Girls Club.” The purchase went through in October and the tickets arrived at the mailing address for the Illinois athletic department, where Illinois Pride has its headquarters.

            “I was shocked that it worked,” he said.

            Well, it worked until Wednesday. That's when Iowa notified Rauman the ticket barcodes would not scan and that a refund had been issued. Iowa declined to comment beyond its statement.

            In retrospect, Rauman said, the Champaign mailing address attached to a large ticket order should have made Iowa suspicious before this week. Because of the late notice, he said, Orange Krush lost $6,000 having to cancel charter busses.

            “Obviously, it did not pan out how we were hoping,” Rauman said. “There was no malice behind it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798664,"Serrano eyes undisputed title, growth for women's boxing","NEW YORK (AP) — Amanda Serrano decided four years ago to only fight at her most comfortable weight.

            There would be certain exceptions, of course. Her match last year against Katie Taylor that made women’s boxing history meant moving up two weight classes, as would a rematch later this year.

            Otherwise, the fighter who spent a career bouncing between divisions, who once fought for a 115-pound title just four months after winning one at 140, would only fight at the featherweight limit of 126.











            Seems an easy enough decision. In a sport that’s about hurting or getting hurt, all fighters want to go in feeling their strongest. 

            A female boxer didn’t always have that luxury.

            “So, I was going all over because of the opportunities,” Serrano said.

            Sometimes, those weren't even in boxing. Serrano, like two-time Olympic boxing gold medalist Claressa Shields, also competed in mixed martial arts in an effort to boost profiles and paychecks.

            Nearing the end of her career and now backed by Jake Paul's MVP Promotions, the 34-year-old Serrano (43-2-1, 30 KOs) can call more of her own shots. She finally stuck around long enough in one division to pick up three 126-pound titles and can become the undisputed champion if she beats Erika Cruz on Saturday at Madison Square Garden.

            “Even as an amateur, I won the Golden Gloves at 125, so I was always a featherweight fighter,” Serrano said. “But as a female boxer, you have to go where the opportunities are.”

            They came in places such as Sweden and Argentina earlier in her career. Now the Brooklyn resident is back where Taylor edged her last April by split decision in the first women’s boxing match to headline at MSG.

            “Amanda is a seven-division world champion because it was hard to make those fights,"" said promoter Eddie Hearn, saying female boxers would think, “'Oh, the other champion like two divisions up will fight me, let’s jump up and fight her. Let’s go down and fight the other one.' Now it’s like, the names are big enough to create big fights.”

            The fights like the one between Taylor and Serrano, which matched two of the best and garnered multiple fight of the year honors, too often fall apart or happen way too late in men’s boxing. Its success could help create chances for younger female fighters that weren’t available during much of Serrano’s career. 

            “It’s definitely a steppingstone,” Serrano said. “We needed to break that barrier so people can see, for networks, for promoters, for arenas to see that we can sell. We can do all of these things that the men do.""

            Women’s boxing got another big boost later in the year with two marquee matches on the same card in London, where Shields beat Savannah Marshall and Alycia Baumgardner edged fellow American Mikaela Mayer at a sold-out O2 Arena in Britain’s first all-female card.

            Headlining the biggest venues was obviously a huge step for women's boxing. But Hearn looks at smaller, faraway places to envision the sport growing to where Serrano hopes.

            Taylor had to pretend she was a boy so she could get into gyms, because girls weren't allowed to box in Ireland. It's a different scene where Hearn's 10-year-old daughter boxes.

            “Now when I go down to the gym to see her or pick her up, there’s a dozen young girls in there,” he said. “Well, there never used to be a dozen young girls. You wouldn’t see one. You’d never see a female, a young female in a boxing gym, up until five years ago, and before that hardly any clubs had any female fighters.""

            The card Saturday is filled with women, with Baumgardner (13-1, 7 KOs) facing Elhem Mekhaled in a bid to become the undisputed 130-pound champion. After three straight bouts in Britain, the Detroit product finally gets to fight again on home soil.

            Should Serrano win, the plan is a trip to Ireland for a rematch with Taylor on the lightweight champ’s turf. Hearn said both made a million dollars for the first bout and would do even better for the second — a far cry from when he said some women didn't get paid at all for their initial pro fights. 

            “That’s money to set them up for life really and that’s something, if you talk to young female fighters, you say, ‘These girls are out there making over a million bucks a fight, so don’t tell me there’s not a future in women’s boxing,’"" Hearn said. 

            Serrano said the Taylor rematch is the only fight that will get her out of a preferred division she had to leave so many times earlier in a career that is nearing a close, saying she doesn’t plan to fight past 36.

            Chasing titles in multiple divisions for fame and fortune will always be part of boxing. Serrano hopes doing it out of necessity won’t be required as much for the women who follow her. 

            “We have girls that are coming up into the sport and they want to leave their name in the sport, so I think it’s coming along,” she said. “We have great champions calling out other champions, so I think we got it in us.""NEW YORK (AP) — Amanda Serrano decided four years ago to only fight at her most comfortable weight.There would be certain exceptions, of course.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798665,'Dances With Wolves' actor remains jailed in sex abuse case,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A former “Dances With Wolves” actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous girls and leading a cult must remain held without bail until his next court hearing, a judge ordered Thursday morning.

            Nathan Chasing Horse, 46, faces charges of sex trafficking, sexual assault against a child younger than 16, and child abuse. He has been in custody since his arrest Tuesday afternoon near the North Las Vegas home that he shares with his five wives.

            He appeared briefly in court Thursday for the first time since he was taken into custody but did not speak before North Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Belinda Harris scheduled a bail hearing for Monday. Chasing Horse has not been formally charged.











            A different judge is expected to address Chasing Horse's custody status Monday and could set bail after hearing from lawyers and investigators, as well as victims and the defendant's relatives if they choose to speak.

            Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney Jessica Walsh told Harris that she expected Las Vegas police detectives, FBI special agents and victims to speak at the hearing.

            Gesturing Thursday to the first row in the courtroom gallery where Chasing Horse's family members were seated, public defender Michael Wilfong said the defendant has a “great deal of support."" His relatives declined to comment as they left the courthouse, as did Wilfong.

            Known for his role as young Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in the Oscar-winning Kevin Costner film, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies.

            He is believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle whose followers believed he could communicate with higher powers, according to an arrest warrant released Wednesday. Police said he abused his position, physically and sexually assaulted Indigenous girls and took underage wives over two decades.

            Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.

            A 50-page search warrant obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press said Chasing Horse trained his wives to use firearms, instructing them to “shoot it out” with police officers if they tried to “break their family apart.” If that failed, he told his wives to take “suicide pills.”

            SWAT officers and detectives took Chasing Horse into custody and cleared the family's home without incident.

            Detectives who searched the property and Chasing Horse's vehicles found firearms, 41 pounds (18.5 kilograms) of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms, and a memory card with multiple videos of sexual assaults, according to Chasing Horse's arrest report released Wednesday.

            Additional charges could be filed related to the videos, the report said.

            Las Vegas police said in the search warrant that investigators have identified at least six sexual assault victims, including one who was 13 when she says she was abused. Police also traced sexual allegations against Chasing Horse to the early 2000s in Canada and in multiple states, including South Dakota, Montana and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade.

            One of Chasing Horse’s wives was offered to him as a “gift” when she was 15, according to police, while another became a wife after turning 16. He also is accused of recording sexual assaults and arranging sex between victims and other men who paid him.

            His arrest comes nearly a decade after he was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, amid allegations of human trafficking.

            Fort Peck tribal leaders voted 7-0 to ban Chasing Horse in 2015 from stepping foot again on the reservation, citing the alleged trafficking and accusations of drug dealing, spiritual abuse and intimidation of tribal members, Indian Country Today reported.

            Angeline Cheek, an activist and community organizer who has lived on the Fort Peck Reservation most of her life, said she clearly remembers the tensions that arose inside the tribal council chambers when Chasing Horse was banished.

            “Some of Nathan's supporters told the members that something bad was going to happen to them,” Cheek told the AP. “They made threats to our elders sitting in the council chambers.”

            Cheek said she remembered Chasing Horse visiting the reservation frequently when she was growing up, especially during her high school years in the early 2000s when she would see him talking with her classmates.

            Cheek, now 34, said she hopes Chasing Horse's arrest will inspire more Indigenous girls and women to report crimes and push lawmakers and elected officials across the U.S. to prioritize addressing violence against Native people.

            But she said she also hopes the cultural significance of medicine men doesn't get lost in the news of the crimes. 

            “There are good medicine men and medicine women among our people who are not trying to commercialize the sacred ways of our ancestors,"" Cheek said. “They're supposed to heal people, not harm.""NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A former “Dances With Wolves” actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous girls and leading a cult must remain held without bail until his next court hearing, a judge ordered Thursday morning.Nathan Chasing Horse, 46, faces charges of sex trafficking, sexual assault against a child younger than 16, and child abuse. He has been in custody since his arrest Tuesday afternoon near the North Las Vegas home that he shares with his five wives.He appeared briefly in court Thursday for the first time since he was taken into custody but did not speak before North Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Belinda Harris scheduled a bail hearing for Monday. Chasing Horse has not been formally charged.A different judge is expected to address Chasing Horse's custody status Monday and could set bail after hearing from lawyers and investigators, as well as victims and the defendant's relatives if they choose to speak.Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney Jessica Walsh told Harris that she expected Las Vegas police detectives, FBI special agents and victims to speak at the hearing.Gesturing Thursday to the first row in the courtroom gallery where Chasing Horse's family members were seated, public defender Michael Wilfong said the defendant has a “great deal of support."" His relatives declined to comment as they left the courthouse, as did Wilfong.Known for his role as young Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in the Oscar-winning Kevin Costner film, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies.He is believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle whose followers believed he could communicate with higher powers, according to an arrest warrant released Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798666,Sharp-shooter Balogun catching the eye at Reims this season,"PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé's twice-missed penalty for Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night didn't change the result of that game, but it did allow Folarin Balogun to move past him in the league's scoring charts.

            While Mbappé is a renowned name in soccer circles and well beyond, the 21-year-old Balogun is just starting to make a name for himself in France through his performances with modest Reims.

            His hat trick in a 4-2 win against Lorient on Wednesday took him to 14 league goals this season, one more than Mbappé. 











            Last weekend, Balogun impressed throughout a 1-1 draw at PSG, netting the equalizer deep into stoppage time after an expertly-timed run and ruthless finish. 

            Before that game, Balogun was given a pep talk by France great Thierry Henry, who was at Parc des Princes in his role as a commentator for the match broadcaster. 

            So after his 96th-minute equalizer, Balogun stood with one hand on his hip and one arm on the corner flag, to imitate one of Henry's famed scoring celebrations.

            “Spoke to Titi (Thierry) before the game! Only right I show my respect,"" Balogun posted on Twitter, along with a photo of Henry's goal celebration.

            There's something else linking them: Arsenal.

            Balogun is on loan from the London-based team where Henry earned his reputation as one of the Premier League's greatest players. Henry was the Premier League's top scorer four times and is Arsenal's all-time leading marksman with 228 goals in all competitions.

            Henry had left by the time Balogun joined Arsenal's academy at the age of 8. Balogun signed as a professional in 2019. But despite signing a new contract in 2021, opportunities were limited and he played only 10 games overall, scoring twice in the Europa League, before joining Reims on loan last August.

            It has taken the New-York born Englishman just a few months to become the key player at Reims and the team's unbeaten 13-game run is in large part thanks to him.

            After rescuing a point against PSG, he hauled his team back from 2-0 down at home to Lorient. His first goal was a crisply-struck penalty down the middle, the second a neat right-foot volley from close range and the third a goal that Henry would have been proud of.

            As the ball drifted over the defense, Balogun timed his run perfectly to meet it on the left of the penalty area before hitting a first-time, left-foot volley into the right corner without breaking stride.

            “It's magnificent, he surprises me every day. The pass was perfect but he was able to meet it with the inside of his foot and find the opposite corner,"" Reims coach Will Still said. “Hats off to him, for that was his first hat trick. It shows the striker he is, but also shows the personality he has.”

            Balogun has a long way to go before getting close to the level of Henry or Mbappé — who in December became only the second player to score a hat trick in a World Cup final. 

            Mbappé's 196 goals for PSG include nine hat tricks and one quadruple for PSG. Last month he became the first PSG player to score five in one game. He needs only five more to break Edinson Cavani's PSG record of 200 goals.

            But Mbappé will not add to his tally this weekend against Toulouse, after picking up a left-thigh injury on Wednesday against Montpellier. He is expected to be sidelined for three weeks.

            Balogun, meanwhile, will have his sights on more goals when Reims travels to play 19th-place Auxerre on Sunday.

            Auxerre has conceded 46 goals in 21 matches for the second-highest tally in the league and the Burgundy-based side has lost its past seven games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798667,Police now say no evidence of planned big Hollywood shooting,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police on Thursday said there isn't any evidence that a mass shooting was planned by a man who stockpiled guns and ammunition in his Hollywood high-rise apartment.

            Braxton Johnson was taken into custody Tuesday after he allegedly made violent threats to security staff at the apartment building and people outside, police said.

            Police searched Johnson's apartment on the 18th floor and found two assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines, all of which are illegal in California, as well as three semiautomatic pistols, a sniper rifle, a shotgun and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.











            Several rifles were pointed from windows toward a nearby park, the LAPD had said. Police didn't identify the park, but online maps show a dog park next to the apartment complex. 

            At a news conference Wednesday, police Lt. Leonid Tsap had said there was a “high chance"" that officers, along with building security staff and witnesses who grabbed Johnson, had “prevented a mass shooting.""

            But police backtracked in a statement Thursday.

            “At this point of the investigation, there are no indications that any persons were threatened with a firearm nor have we identified any intent by Johnson to plan a mass shooting incident,"" the statement said. “We are working with our federal partners to exhaust all investigative leads and believe there is no threat to the public.""

            Police also said they had talked to Johnson's family “to provide any support services needed."" 

            Johnson, 25, pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of possession of an assault weapon, one count of criminal threats and one count of solicitation of murder. He was jailed on $500,000 bail, but a judge on Thursday raised his bail to more than $1 million.

            Details about the threats authorities said he made Tuesday have not been released.

            The apartment's management company referred media inquiries to police.

            The cache of guns and their setup in the high-rise apartment were reminiscent of a 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, where the gunman fired 1,057 bullets from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. He killed 58 people below the hotel who were enjoying an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. Authorities later attributed the deaths of two more people, both of whom had been badly wounded, to the concert shooting.

            Officers answered a report of a possible mental health situation Tuesday morning and went to the building on Gordon Street at Sunset Boulevard, an LAPD statement said.

            Johnson, who was living alone, was unarmed when he was taken into custody but the weapons seized had ""the ability to inflict a lot of damage to a lot of people,” Tsap said.

            Johnson had recently moved into the apartment. He already was under investigation in a state on the East Coast for a violent crime, police said. They did not immediately share other details.

            There had been speculation that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador would remain a power behind the scenes in his now-dominant Morena party.

            At 12:45 a.m. on Thursday, deputies with the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office were called to a home in Magnolia about a disturbance in progress with possibly two trespassers, including one armed with a gun, said Steve Squier, a sheriff’s office spokesman.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798670,Germany's interior minister makes risky run for state office,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s interior minister said Thursday that she plans to run for governor of her home state this fall but remain the country’s top security official in the meantime, a politically risky course that opponents assailed even before the announcement.

            Nancy Faeser has been interior minister since Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition took office in 2021. She leads the local branch of Scholz's center-left Social Democrats in the central state of Hesse, which will elect a new state legislature in October.

            “I’m the first woman to head the Interior Ministry, and I would like to be the first female governor of Hesse,” Faeser told news magazine Der Spiegel.











            Faeser's potential candidacy had long been rumored as, in recent days, had her plan to keep running Germany's security apparatus while running.

            That prompted Germany's main opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, to urge her to leave the Cabinet if she ran — arguing that the country's security isn't a part-time job at a time of heightened threats.

            Faeser told Der Spiegel that she “took on responsibility for a very difficult office in very difficult times.” She added that “this responsibility requires me to carry out my tasks just as clearly and seriously as before.”

            She said that she has already been opposition leader in Hesse, and if she isn't elected as governor “I will continue to do justice to my responsibility as federal interior minister.”

            Asked about the issue Thursday evening at a town hall event in Marburg, a city in Hesse, Scholz responded that Faeser is “very, very conscientious” and “will do everything every day for the job she has.”

            Faeser's prospects are uncertain in Hesse, which includes Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt. It was once a Social Democratic stronghold but has been led since 1999 by the center-right CDU — currently in a coalition with the environmentalist Greens, one of the junior partners in Scholz's national government.

            Faeser faces a tough race against both center-right incumbent Boris Rhein and his Green deputy, Tarek Al-Wazir.

            She dismissed comparisons with a disastrous 2012 run by then-Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen to be governor of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. The center-right Roettgen, who faced criticism for not committing himself to stay in state politics whatever the outcome, was fired by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel after a heavy defeat.BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s interior minister said Thursday that she plans to run for governor of her home state this fall but remain the country’s top security official in the meantime, a politically risky course that opponents assailed even before the announcement.Nancy Faeser has been interior minister since Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition took office in 2021. She leads the local branch of Scholz's center-left Social Democrats in the central state of Hesse, which will elect a new state legislature in October.“I’m the first woman to head the Interior Ministry, and I would like to be the first female governor of Hesse,” Faeser told news magazine Der Spiegel.Faeser's potential candidacy had long been rumored as, in recent days, had her plan to keep running Germany's security apparatus while running.That prompted Germany's main opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, to urge her to leave the Cabinet if she ran — arguing that the country's security isn't a part-time job at a time of heightened threats.Faeser told Der Spiegel that she “took on responsibility for a very difficult office in very difficult times.” She added that “this responsibility requires me to carry out my tasks just as clearly and seriously as before.”She said that she has already been opposition leader in Hesse, and if she isn't elected as governor “I will continue to do justice to my responsibility as federal interior minister.”Asked about the issue Thursday evening at a town hall event in Marburg, a city in Hesse, Scholz responded that Faeser is “very, very conscientious” and “will do everything every day for the job she has.”Faeser's prospects are uncertain in Hesse, which includes Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt. It was once a Social Democratic stronghold but has been led since 1999 by the center-right CDU — currently in a coalition with the environmentalist Greens, one of the junior partners in Scholz's national government.Faeser faces a tough race against both center-right incumbent Boris Rhein and his Green deputy, Tarek Al-Wazir.She dismissed comparisons with a disastrous 2012 run by then-Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen to be governor of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798685,Oklahoma AG apologizes for cabinet secretary's indictment,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma’s new attorney general has apologized to one of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s former cabinet secretaries for his criminal indictment in 2020 by a previous attorney general, saying he believes the secretary “committed no wrongdoing.”

            Attorney General Gentner Drummond sent the letter Wednesday to David Ostrowe, Stitt's former secretary of digital transformation and technology. In it, he wrote that former Attorney General Mike Hunter failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety and should have disqualified himself from involvement in the investigation.

            “I sincerely apologize to you on behalf of the State of Oklahoma,” Drummond wrote. “Further, I have instructed my office to convert the dismissal of this matter into a dismissal with prejudice.”











            A dismissal with prejudice means a permanent dismissal of a case that will not be refiled against the defendant on the same grounds.

            Ostrowe's attorney, Matthew Felty, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Ostrowe was indicted by the state's multicounty grand jury in late 2020, accused of threatening to withhold state appropriations to the Oklahoma Tax Commission if they did not waive interest and tax penalties levied against a company owned by a former state senator. Ostrowe denied wrongdoing and alleged the charge was filed by Hunter to settle a political score.

            Hunter dropped the charge against Ostrowe when he resigned in 2021.

            Ostrowe is currently suing Hunter and the Oklahoma Tax Commission in district court, alleging he was maliciously indicted. That case is pending.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798687,Batting champ Arraez beats Marlins in salary arbitration,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — AL batting champion Luis Arraez won his arbitration case Thursday and will get a $6.1 million salary from the Miami Marlins, who acquired the All-Star infielder from the Minnesota Twins last month.

            Miami argued for $5 million during a hearing Wednesday before John Stout, Mark Burstein and Scott Buchheit. Arraez received a raise from $2.2 million.

            Marlins pitcher Jesús Luzardo went to a hearing Thursday and asked for a raise from $715,000 to $2.45 million, while Miami proposed $2.1 million. The case was heard by Stout, Melinda Gordon and Richard Bloch, who were expected to issue their decision Friday.











            Arraez hit .316 with eight homers, 49 RBIs and a .795 OPS last year for Minnesota, starting 61 games at first base, 34 at designated hitter and 31 at second. The 25-year-old was traded on Jan. 20 for starting pitcher Pablo López and a pair of prospects: infielder Jose Salas and outfielder Byron Chourio.

            Arraez is eligible for free agency after the 2026 season.

            Luzardo, a 25-year-old left-hander, was 4-7 with a 3.32 ERA in 18 starts last year, striking out 120 and walking 35 in 100 1/3 innings. He is 13-18 with a 3.59 ERA in 45 starts and 16 relief appearances over four big league seasons.

            Luzardo also is eligible for free agency after the 2026 season.

            Seattle defeated Diego Castillo in the first salary arbitration decision this year on Wednesday, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000. 

            A decision is being held for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe, whose case was argued Monday.

            Twenty-two players remain scheduled for hearings, to take place through Feb. 17. Among them, utilityman Dylan Moore and the Seattle Mariners have a pending three-year contract worth $8,875,000.

            Mbappé sustained the injury in the first half of PSG's game at Montpellier on Wednesday and limped off the field. TV cameras also showed him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.

            PSG said in a statement Thursday that tests revealed a tear in his left thigh.











            The injury comes at a bad time for PSG as it enters a hectic period this month. PSG plays away at bitter rival Marseille in the French Cup and in the league, either side of the home game against Bayern on Feb. 14. It also has a league game at fourth-place Monaco.

            Mbappé faces a race to be fit in time for the league game at second-place Marseille on Feb. 26. The return leg against Bayern is on March 8.

            His injury also raises questions about his recent workload. Mbappé played and scored for PSG just 10 days after playing in the World Cup final for France on Dec. 18 — where he became only the second player to score a hat trick in the final.

            PSG coach Christophe Galtier selected him to face Strasbourg on Dec. 28 and away to Lens on Jan. 1. The decision was taken in full agreement with Mbappé, who wanted to play in both games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798689,Chiefs banked on rookie returns to reach Super Bowl again,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Andy Reid remembers talking to the Kansas City Chiefs at some point last year, back when veterans were getting to know rookies and the season still seemed so far off, and he brought up the San Francisco 49ers under Bill Walsh.

            It was 1981 and the 49ers had drafted a quartet of defensive backs that they expected to contribute right away.

            They did so much more.











            Ronnie Lott went on to start all 16 games, beginning a Hall of Fame career and becoming one of the finest safeties to play the game. Eric Wright and Carlton Williams, who both went on to play in Pro Bowls, started alongside Lott every week, and Lynn Thomas appeared in 15 games. 

            Together, that group carefully selected by Walsh helped the 49ers win their first conference championship before beating the Bengals for their first Super Bowl title.

            “It seems like a long time ago that I mentioned that to our guys,” Reid said this week.

            The reason for bringing it up? Chiefs general manager Brett Veach also drafted four defensive backs last year. And much like the 49ers, the Chiefs banked on their rookie quartet to get back to the Super Bowl after a one-year absence.

            “I mean, here we sit,” Reid said with a smile.

            First-round pick Trent McDuffie, who dealt with a hamstring injury sustained in their opener, emerged as a lockdown cornerback. Jaylen Watson had a 99-yard pick-6 that helped the Chiefs beat the Chargers early in the season, and has since picked off two more passes in the playoffs. 

            Josh Williams also intercepted Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow in the AFC title game, catching the deep throw in the closing minutes after rookie safety Bryan Cook had batted it into the air.

            The pressure on the four last Sunday night went soaring on the game's fourth play, when one of the few veterans in the secondary — L'Jarius Sneed — was sidelined by a concussion. Yet they were undaunted.

            “Obviously there was concern,” Reid said, when asked about his rookies playing so much so soon, “but there was an optimism that it can be done. Then the kids, just their work ethic — they showed us this in training camp. They showed it all the way through the season. If they got beat, they came back and fought back.”

            Indeed, all of them took regular-season lumps. But you wouldn't know it by the playoffs. 

            Did they exceed even Veach's expectations?

            “I think so,” he replied. “Maybe it was a necessity because we had a lot of turnover. Again, every time we approach an offseason, whether it be a free-agent signing or draft pick, we have full confidence in our staff's ability to bring talented players in and our coaches to get the most out them. I think you saw early on — you guys were at the OTAs the training camps — I think it was pretty clear early on that this would be a special group.”

            It hasn't just been the four defensive backs, either. It's been an entire rookie class outperforming expectations.

            Defensive end George Karlaftis had six regular-season sacks, then another of Burrow in the AFC title game. Skyy Moore played a crucial role against the Bengals after three wide receivers were lost to injuries, and his punt return helped set up the winning field goal. Leo Chenal has appeared in every game at linebacker. And seventh-round pick Isiah Pacheco not only assumed the role of lead running back but has become a bona fide star.

            The returns on the Chiefs' rookie investments are even more impressive given the fact that Kansas City, like other teams that make deep playoff runs each year, are usually picking after just about everyone else.

            “I don't know if you've ever heard of a guy named Brett Veach,” Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said, “but he has brought in some amazing talent when he put this team together. We're the best team in the AFC because of what he's been able to do, on top of what these coaches have been able to do in terms of teaching these guys how to make plays.”

            It's been a long time since Reid was teaching them a little bit of history, too. But the parallels between that bunch of 49ers in the early 1980s and this group of Chiefs in the early 2020s just might go all the way to a Super Bowl title.

            Lott and those young 49ers hoisted the Lombardi Trophy. The Chiefs have a chance to do the same.

            “I was optimistic,” Reid said, “but you don't know how that journey's going to go. But they've sure done a nice job.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798690,Israel FM: Fully normalized ties with Sudan later this year,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel expects to fully normalize ties with Sudan sometime later this year, Israel's foreign minister said Thursday, after returning from a lightning diplomatic mission to the Sudanese capital. 

            Eli Cohen spoke to reporters after a one-day trip to Khartoum that included high-level meetings with military leaders, including Sudan's ruling general, Abdel-Fattah Burhan, who led a coup that overturned the country's transitional government in 2021. 

            “The agreement is expected to be signed this year and it will be the fourth"" such accord, Cohen said, referring to the U.S.-brokered normalization deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco in 2020. 











            The announcement could help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deflect attention from a recent burst of violence with Palestinians and widespread public anger over his plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system — which critics say will badly damage Israel’s democratic system of checks and balances. 

            For Sudan’s ruling generals, a breakthrough with Israel could help convince foreign countries, including the United States and the UAE, to inject financial aid into the struggling economy. Sudan remains mired in a political stalemate between a popular pro-democracy movement and the country's powerful armed forces. 

            Earlier in the day, Sudan’s Foreign Ministry said it would move forward to normalize full diplomatic ties with Israel. Sudan first signed a normalization agreement with Israel, joining Morocco, Bahrain, and the UAE in 2020 as part of the U.S.-brokered “Abraham Accords” to establish full diplomatic ties. 

            However, the process stalled amid widespread popular opposition in Sudan. The military coup in October 2021 then deposed Sudan’s government, upending the African country’s fragile democratic transition.

            Cohen said that he presented a draft peace treaty to the Sudanese “that is expected to be signed after the transfer of authority to the civilian government that will be formed as part of the transition underway in the country.”

            In its statement, the Sudanese ministry added that the talks aimed to strengthen cooperation in various sectors, including security and military. It also spoke of a need to achieve ″stability between Israel and the Palestinian people″ in light of a recent surge in violence.

            A Sudanese military official close to the discussions said Thursday’s talks also aimed to ease Israel’s concerns that a future civilian government in Khartoum could reverse the course of normalization. He said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, that Israel and the U.S. “want to ensure that the deal would proceed” even after the military steps aside from politics.

            In December, Sudan’s top generals and some political forces signed a broad pledge to remove the military from power and install a civilian government. But talks to reach a final and more inclusive peace agreement on the transition are still underway and the generals have yet to accede their powe

            Three Sudanese military officials told The Associated Press earlier in the day that full normalization of ties would not be achieved anytime soon. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks with reporters. 

            The country's second-in-command, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads a powerful paramilitary known as the Rapid Support Forces, claimed that he had no knowledge of the visit and did not meet with the Israeli delegation in a bulletin carried by the state news agency. 

            Also earlier on Thursday, Netanyahu indicated a breakthrough was in the works. “We are continuing to expand the circle of peace,” he said before flying to France, noting that Chad, which borders Sudan, opened a new embassy in Israel earlier in the day. 

            ""We will continue to expand and deepen the circle of peace with additional countries, both near and far,” added Netanyahu, who returned to office in December. During his previous 12-year term as premier, his government made it a priority to forge ties with formerly hostile countries in Africa and the Arab world. 

            Although Sudan does not have the influence or wealth of Gulf Arab countries, a deal with the African country — even as it is mired in a deep political and economic crisis — would be deeply significant for Israel.

            Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Jack Jeffery in Cairo contributed to this report.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel expects to fully normalize ties with Sudan sometime later this year, Israel's foreign minister said Thursday, after returning from a lightning diplomatic mission to the Sudanese capital.Eli Cohen spoke to reporters after a one-day trip to Khartoum that included high-level meetings with military leaders, including Sudan's ruling general, Abdel-Fattah Burhan, who led a coup that overturned the country's transitional government in 2021.“The agreement is expected to be signed this year and it will be the fourth"" such accord, Cohen said, referring to the U.S.-brokered normalization deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco in 2020.The announcement could help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deflect attention from a recent burst of violence with Palestinians and widespread public anger over his plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system — which critics say will badly damage Israel’s democratic system of checks and balances.For Sudan’s ruling generals, a breakthrough with Israel could help convince foreign countries, including the United States and the UAE, to inject financial aid into the struggling economy. Sudan remains mired in a political stalemate between a popular pro-democracy movement and the country's powerful armed forces.Earlier in the day, Sudan’s Foreign Ministry said it would move forward to normalize full diplomatic ties with Israel. Sudan first signed a normalization agreement with Israel, joining Morocco, Bahrain, and the UAE in 2020 as part of the U.S.-brokered “Abraham Accords” to establish full diplomatic ties.However, the process stalled amid widespread popular opposition in Sudan. The military coup in October 2021 then deposed Sudan’s government, upending the African country’s fragile democratic transition.Cohen said that he presented a draft peace treaty to the Sudanese “that is expected to be signed after the transfer of authority to the civilian government that will be formed as part of the transition underway in the country.”In its statement, the Sudanese ministry added that the talks aimed to strengthen cooperation in various sectors, including security and military. It also spoke of a need to achieve ″stability between Israel and the Palestinian people″ in light of a recent surge in violence.A Sudanese military official close to the discussions said Thursday’s talks also aimed to ease Israel’s concerns that a future civilian government in Khartoum could reverse the course of normalization. He said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, that Israel and the U.S. “want to ensure that the deal would proceed” even after the military steps aside from politics.In December, Sudan’s top generals and some political forces signed a broad pledge to remove the military from power and install a civilian government. But talks to reach a final and more inclusive peace agreement on the transition are still underway and the generals have yet to accede their poweThree Sudanese military officials told The Associated Press earlier in the day that full normalization of ties would not be achieved anytime soon. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks with reporters.The country's second-in-command, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads a powerful paramilitary known as the Rapid Support Forces, claimed that he had no knowledge of the visit and did not meet with the Israeli delegation in a bulletin carried by the state news agency.Also earlier on Thursday, Netanyahu indicated a breakthrough was in the works. “We are continuing to expand the circle of peace,” he said before flying to France, noting that Chad, which borders Sudan, opened a new embassy in Israel earlier in the day.""We will continue to expand and deepen the circle of peace with additional countries, both near and far,” added Netanyahu, who returned to office in December. During his previous 12-year term as premier, his government made it a priority to forge ties with formerly hostile countries in Africa and the Arab world.Although Sudan does not have the influence or wealth of Gulf Arab countries, a deal with the African country — even as it is mired in a deep political and economic crisis — would be deeply significant for Israel.Sudan was once one of Israel's fiercest critics in the Arab world and in 1993, the U.S. designated it a state sponsor of terrorism. The Trump administration removed Sudan from that list in 2020, a move meant to help the country revive its battered economy and end its pariah status, and an incentive to normalize relations with Israel.Cohen spoke about the upcoming agreement as a “peace treaty"" because of the two nations' long-standing animosity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798692,ECB hikes interest rates again in anti-inflation bid,"The European Central Bank on Thursday announced a large half-point interest rate hike to combat inflation and said it intended to do the same in March.The rise takes the rate it pays on bank deposits to 2.5%, in line with what it said in December and with market expectations. It brings the bank's three main rates to a range of between 2.5 and 3.25%.The move, the fifth hike in a row, comes as inflation reached 8.5% in the 20 countries using the euro in January — still a high rate, but down from the double figures seen late last year.The ECB announcement came shortly after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the 10th time in a row to 4.0% — their highest level since 2008 — from 3.5%.Both European banks made their announcements a day after the US Federal Reserve said it would implement just a quarter-point rise, while saying that further increases would be necessary.Raising interest rates can dampen inflation by making loans more expensive and thus slowing demand. However, higher interest rates can also negatively impact economic growth.ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference. that the bank would ""stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term target.""""We know that we have ground to cover; we know that we are not done,"" she said.The bank said that ""keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.""tj/jcg (AFP, dpa, Reuters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798693,Spanish and Moroccan leaders meet to repair ties,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was in Rabat on Thursday to hold high-level talks with the Moroccan government as the two try to patch up a spat over the fate of Western Sahara.Sanchez, who was joined by several ministers, met with his Moroccan counterpart Aziz Akhannouch for the first ""high-level meeting"" since 2015.The visit comes following a breakdown in relations between the two after Spain allowed the leader of a pro-independence group from Western Sahara to receive hospital treatment in the city of Logrono in 2021.But Madrid's subsequent support for Morocco's claims over the contested region has led to criticism from Sanchez's left-wing coalition partner that it has caved to pressure from Rabat.The Spanish ministers arrived in Rabat on Wednesday to take part in an economic forum. Sanchez said that ""the better relations are between Morocco and Spain, the better it is for Spain, the better it is for Morocco, the better it is for Europe and for the citizens of both countries.""Bilateral talks began in earnest on Thursday with business development and cooperation on immigration and terrorism high on the agenda.The two Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla — tucked into Morocco's North African coast — as well as Spain's Canary Islands, have often been sites of attempts by irregular migrants to cross into Europe.Morocco has been able to use its location on the border with the EU to leverage economic benefits from the bloc in exchange for policing the frontiers.Spain is also the largest foreign investor in the North African country, making Thursday's talks of great significance to Rabat.The two neighbors clashed in 2021 over the hospitalization of Brahim Ghali, head of the Polisario Front, for treatment of COVID-19.The Polisario Front has been seeking independence for Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was occupied by Morocco in 1975.In what has been considered a response by Morocco, border authorities turned a blind eye weeks later when more than 10,000 migrants attempted to cross the border into Ceuta.In March last year, Sanchez was hosted by King Mohammed after Madrid announced a ""new stage"" in relations and gave its support for Rabat's plan for limited autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty.But this move has been slammed by members of the left-wing Podemos party which governs in coalition with Sanchez's social democratic party (PSOE).Spanish Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz, from the Podemos party, refused to join her colleagues on the trip following the criticisms of Sanchez's ""unilateral"" u-turn on Western Sahara.ab/jcg (AP, AFP)",2023/2/2,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798694,Big battle takes center stage in No. 1 Purdue-No. 21 Indiana,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Zach Edey arrived on Purdue's campus three years ago as an intriguing, inexperienced prospect. Today, college basketball's biggest player also is its most immovable force.

            At 7-foot-4, 305 pounds and armed with a standing reach of 9 feet, 9 inches, Purdue's starting center towers over essentially everyone and overpowers defenders daring to get between him and the basket.

            Unlike other recent college big men, he's not just another curiosity. The Toronto native, dubbed “Big Maple” by his proud mother, Julia, is a legitimately dominant athlete.











            Roughly five years into his basketball journey, the former youth hockey and baseball star has emerged as a polished passer, rugged rim protector and double-double machine. His evolution has been so complete even the nation's best coaches struggle to solve Purdue's befuddling offensive riddle with Edey as the center of attention.

            “He's bigger than any player I've ever coached against,"" Tom Izzo said after Edey had a career-high 38 points and 13 rebounds against Michigan State last Sunday. “When at the end of the day you can stop anywhere this side of the equator and throw the ball in the air and this monster is going to go get it, it makes it a little easier (for Purdue).""

            On Saturday, though, Edey faces his toughest challenge yet when No. 1 Purdue (22-1, 11-1 Big Ten) visits No. 21 Indiana and Trayce Jackson-Davis.

            
                The league's top big men are playing the best basketball of their careers as Purdue tries to protect the nation's top ranking in what will be the 216th meeting.

            Edey has averaged 22.3 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocks. during Purdue's current nine-game winning streak. This season, he's shooting 61.7% from the field, has the longest active streak of consecutive double-digit games in Division I (39) and has 18 double-doubles.

            
                Jackson-Davis' recent numbers are actually better. Over the past six games, with five wins, he has played like the preseason favorite for Big Ten player of the year — averaging 24.2 points, 14.5 rebounds and 3.7 blocks. He now holds the school's career record for blocks (236), is fourth all-time in rebounds (1,010) and needs 41 points to become the first Indiana player to record 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.

            In this matchup, though, the 6-foot-9, 245-pound Jackson-Davis stands seven inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Edey and it was a problem last season when Edey played fewer minutes and was less influential on the court.

            Jackson-Davis got into foul trouble in the first matchup and wound up playing 12 minutes. His two-game totals were 19 points and seven rebounds in 43 minutes. The Hoosiers (15-7, 6-5) will need more out of him Saturday if they hope to close the gap in the Big Ten standings.

            “As you know, last year Trayce didn’t even get a chance to play him,” Indiana coach Mike Woodson said Thursday. ‘I don’t want to get caught up in the Trayce-Edey thing. They’re both great players. They’re playing well for both teams, we’ve just got to see where it leads us.""

            How comparable are Edey and Jackson-Davis?

            They shared last week's Big Ten player of the week honor. They're the only Power Five players averaging 19.0 points, 10.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks. Both made the 20-player cut for the John R. Wooden Award list and the 15-player cut for Naismith Defensive Player of the Year. Woodson believes both are bound for the NBA, where he coached for a quarter-century.

            Still, there is one major difference.

            While Edey developed into an elite player, Jackson-Davis came to Bloomington as the state's 2019 Mr. Basketball Award winner and amid expectations he would put the school's prestigious program back on the national map.

            Winning the most anticipated rivalry game in years and outperforming a foe many consider the frontrunner for national player of the year would help Jackson-Davis cement his legacy.

            “It’s the biggest game in the state of Indiana,” Woodson said. “The rivalry is just what it is, man. The games have been pretty competitive. I know last year both games were very, very competitive. I can’t help but think Saturday is going to be a competitive game, as well.”

            But it's the inside battle — Edey vs. Jackson-Davis — everyone will be watching and the battle that could dictate who wins Round 1.

            “You have a decision to make when you play us, and sometimes we don't know what the decision is going to be. But when you have Zach Edey, you really, deep down, don't know how they're going to do things,"" Purdue coach Matt Painter said. ""It's good to be 7-4 when you're double-teamed and you can be patient and just see over people (to pass).”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798696,Busy college football recruiting period called 'total chaos',"The first Wednesday of February used to be the biggest day on the calendar for college football recruiting. Now it is an afterthought.

            The December signing period, which is now when nearly all major prospects finalize their plans, is still relatively new but is causing enough headaches for busy coaches that many are trying to think of an alternative. 

            “It’s become the primary signing period for football,” American Athletic Conference Commissioner Mike Aresco said. “February is seemingly now when they plug holes. It’s a secondary thing.”











            Indeed, over 95% of the nation’s top 250 high school senior prospects had signed with schools before Wednesday, according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports. That continues a trend that began as soon as the early signing period arrived in December 2017.

            The difference now is that the transfer portal has made December busier than ever. The early signing period for this class began Dec. 21, a little over two weeks after the portal window opened and just as bowl games were starting.

            Before the College Football Playoff championship game, Georgia’s Kirby Smart and TCU’s Sonny Dykes both called for changes to the crowded college football calendar. Smart noted the arrival of a 12-team playoff in 2024 will only make things busier.

            “I think with the playoff system coming up, it’s going to be really interesting to see what happens: Are you going to be playing games while you’re trying to sign guys in the early signing period in December?” Smart said. “It’s gotten more competitive than ever.”

            Southeastern Conference Commissioner Greg Sankey, who was critical of the early signing period when it first took effect, has said it should be moved to clear up that December schedule.

            Todd Berry, the executive director of the American Football Coaches Association, said a “high majority” of coaches have recommended moving it. Berry said coaches like having an early signing period but want it at a different time.

            “I think everyone right now knows this is ridiculous,” Berry said. “Where we’re at right now is total chaos. The whole college enterprise is in total chaos right now – and it gets worse every year.”

            The question is exactly where to move it. 

            Berry suggested having the early signing period shortly after the end of the regular season so that it doesn’t come at the same time teams are making bowl trips and signing transfers. The most recent portal window was open from Dec. 5 to Jan. 19.

            “This is in discussion phase, but (coaches) would maybe like to have one weekend to bring in high school players and then have the signing date just after that,” Berry said.

            Aresco said he hadn’t polled conference coaches on the issue yet but suggested having the early signing period after the playoff — or just eliminating it entirely.

            Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner Jim Phillips said he is inclined to keep the early signing period where it is because the other options don’t make any more sense. 

            Phillips noted there isn’t much support for having the signing period during the regular season. He also noted that having high school seniors and transfers finalize their decisions at the same time at least gives them a sense of what’s going on at each college they are considering.

            “It’s not a hard stance,” Phillips said. “We continue to talk with other leagues. I’m talking to other commissioners about it. I know coaches are doing the same in our league. But right now there doesn’t seem to be a better alternative.”

            High school coaches wouldn’t mind seeing changes.

            Dan Sabella of Don Bosco Prep at Ramsey, New Jersey, said he has mixed emotions about the signing period. He’d like to see it moved earlier so prospects could get their college selection process out of the way before their senior seasons. But he acknowledged that could cause some top seniors to skip their final prep seasons, a potential consequence Berry and Phillips also mentioned.

            Sabella also brought up one way in which the early signing period has made things tougher for prospects.

            “It’s helped the higher-profile players but has hurt the guys who aren’t being recruited as much or who have really good senior years,” said Sabella, whose program has New Jersey’s top prospects for 2023 (Texas A&M-bound offensive lineman Chase Bisontis) and 2024 (defensive lineman Jordan Thomas). “It’s really taken away a lot from the senior year.”

            Dana Zupke of Pinnacle High School in Phoenix agreed. Pinnacle has t wo of Arizona’s top three 2023 prospects in tight end Duce Robinson plus Southern California-bound offensive tackle Elijah Paige and quarterback Dylan Raiola, the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit in the 2024 class.

            “If you don’t show something by your junior year, it’s really hard to get a scholarship by your senior year, I think because of the early signing date and because recruiting has been accelerated more and more,” Zupke said.

            Coaches at the high school and college level both see drawbacks in having the early signing period in late December. The problem is finding a better solution.

The problem is finding a better solution.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/2/3,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798698,AP sources: Saban talks with Notre Dame's Rees about OC job,"Notre Dame offensive coordinator Tommy Rees has spoken with Alabama coach Nick Saban about filling a vacancy on the Crimson Tide's coaching staff and was scheduled to be in Tuscaloosa on Thursday, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.

            Both spoke on condition of anonymity because Saban and Alabama were not making details about their search for a replacement for offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien public. ESPN first reported the talks between Saban and Rees.

            O'Brien spent the last two seasons directing the Crimson's Tide offense and coaching quarterbacks. The former Houston Texans head coach left last month to join Patriots coach Bill Belichick in New England as offensive coordinator. O'Brien was a New England assistant before becoming Penn State head coach in 2012. 











            Rees, a former Notre Dame quarterback, has been an assistant at his alma mater since 2017 and offensive coordinator since 2020. He also spent a year with the San Diego Chargers in 2016 before returning to South Bend, Indiana, as quarterbacks coach.

            The 30-year-old Rees was wooed by Brian Kelly when he left Notre Dame for LSU and by Miami last year, but decided to stay and work for first-year Fighting Irish coach Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame finished 9-4 last season.

            Notre Dame's offense have been solid statistically under Rees, ranking 45th (last season), 43rd (2021) and 39th (2020) nationally in yards per play.

            Alabama will be breaking in a new starting quarterback next season after Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young declared for the NFL draft.
