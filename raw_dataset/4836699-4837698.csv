A police car and other vehicles were set alight.Police in riot gear eventually managed to calm the situation, shepherding the fans onto buses to take them to their hotels.Further clashes were avoided as the majority of Napoli “ultras” were stopped from coming into contact with the German fans. They did throw stones and bottles at the buses, however.“I’m monitoring what has happened on our streets. An unacceptable climate of guerrilla warfare,"" the mayor of Naples, Gaetano Manfredi, said on Twitter. “My thanks go to the police forces who acted to guarantee the safety of the citizens. I appeal to Neapolitans, be responsible.”There was no immediate information on arrests or injuries.Police had been on high alert in the Italian city — around 800 officers had been deployed — as more than 600 fans arrived from Germany despite Frankfurt forgoing its allocation of tickets for the round-of-16 match in protest. That number was boosted further by Atalanta ultras, who have a bitter rivalry with Napoli.The German club was objecting to a decision by local authorities in Naples banning any fans who are residents of Frankfurt from buying tickets, following unrest between supporters during the first leg in Germany.Napoli won that match 2-0 but local police made several arrests in the buildup amid altercations between fans.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

Staude, 25, of Norfolk, told police the child was born at home on Feb. 24, according to a police affidavit. She told authorities that she put him in a box and didn’t provide any care for two days before she and her father Rodney A. Staude, 64, put him in the bag.Rodney Staude also confessed and said he helped his daughter dispose of the bag in a ditch near Norwalk, according to the documents.Both the Staudes initially told police the baby died on the way to the hospital after it was born, authorities said. Megan Staude said she buried him in a cemetery in Cumming, Iowa, but authorities found no evidence of a fresh grave at the cemetery.Law enforcement officers received a tip from Megan Staude's co-workers on March 8, leading to the discovery of the body. On March 13, a witness showed authorities a text conversation with Megan Staude, in which the witness asked her, “Was the baby alive when you left him?” and she replied, “A little,” the complaint says.“It’s just a tragic set of circumstances on a number of levels,” Norwalk Police Chief Greg Staples told The Des Moines Register. “That baby didn’t have the choice to decide his own fate and now there’s people in jail because of it.”The results of an autopsy are pending and the investigation is ongoing.Rodney and Megan Staude are each being held in the Warren County jail on $1 million bond.Authorities told the Register they don't know who the child's father is.Iowa has a law that allows someone to leave an infant up to 3 months old at a hospital or health care facility without facing legal action.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836701,"Rodgers plans to play for Jets in 2023, awaits Packers' move","Aaron Rodgers said Wednesday he intends to play for the New York Jets in 2023 after 18 seasons in Green Bay and the four-time NFL MVP quarterback is waiting for the Packers to trade him.The 39-year-old Rodgers, speaking during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube and Sirius XM, said he believes the Packers want to move on and make 2020 first-round draft pick Jordan Love their starting quarterback.“At this point, as I sit here, I think since Friday I’ve made it clear that my intention was to play and my intention was to play for the New York Jets,” Rodgers said. “I haven’t been holding anything up at this point. It’s been compensation the Packers are trying to get for me, kind of digging their heels in.”Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy has acknowledged the team granted the Jets permission to talk to Rodgers, the face of the franchise since Hall of Famer Brett Favre was traded to the Jets in 2008. The Jets sent a contingent that reportedly included owner Woody Johnson, coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas to Rodgers’ home in Southern California last week.Rodgers expressed his appreciation for his 18 seasons in Green Bay but added that it's time for the Packers “to do the right thing.”“I have nothing but love in my heart for every Packer fan and everybody who works in the organization,” Rodgers said. “My life is better because of my time in Green Bay. But we’ve just got to look at the reality. They want to move on. They don’t want me to come back and that’s fine. They're ready to move on with Jordan. That’s awesome. Jordan's going to be a great player.”The Packers declined to comment on Rodgers' remarks, which follow days of speculation that his time in Green Bay might be done.Murphy spoke of Rodgers in the past tense while discussing the quarterback’s future with Green Bay TV station WBAY last week.“Very few players play for only one team,” Murphy told WBAY. ""Obviously Brett had a great career. Aaron had a great career here. Regardless of what happens, Aaron will be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He’ll be in our Hall of Fame. We’ll bring him back, retire his number. This is just one of the things that we go through as a team. We want to try to achieve something that’s good for both Aaron and us.”In a separate interview that aired Friday during a broadcast of the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association girls basketball championships on Green Bay TV station WCWF, Murphy said he would honor a trade request if Rodgers made one.“It’s trying to find what he wants and what we want, and hopefully we can find a win-win situation,"" Murphy said.Rodgers had said at the end of the 2022 season that he would need time to decide whether to return to the Packers, request a trade or retire. He said Wednesday he had discussions with Packers officials regarding his future shortly after the team wrapped up a 8-9 season that ended a string of three straight NFC North titles.“Everything that I was told in the week that I was in Green Bay was: ‘Take as long as you want and we want you to retire a Packer. If you want to come back and play, obviously the door is wide open,’” Rodgers said. “That was the information I was going on.""As he pondered his future, Rodgers spent multiple days last month on a isolation retreat in Oregon, where he said he stayed alone in a room in total darkness.Rodgers said he was 90% leaning toward retirement at the time of the retreat. When he was done with it, he said, he noticed a difference in the Packers' approach toward his future with the franchise.“Now when I came out of the darkness, something changed,” Rodgers said. “I’m not exactly sure what that was, but something changed. ... I realized there had been a little bit of a shift. I heard from multiple people that I trust around the league — players mostly –— that there was some shopping going on, that they were interested in actually moving me.”Rodgers said that made him realize the Packers probably didn't want him back.“It was clear to me at that point, that although the Packers were going to say the right thing publicly, that they were ready to move on,” he said. “I don’t know what changed that or what moved that — if they just said, ‘Hey, we need to make a decision here because he hasn’t made a decision here yet.’ Again, there’s no victims here. I’m not sitting here as a victim.""The Jets’ interest in Rodgers has been apparent as they seek to end the NFL’s longest active playoff drought. They lost their final six games while going 7-10 last season and haven’t reached the postseason since 2010.Their new offensive coordinator is Nathaniel Hackett, who earned raves from Rodgers while coordinating Green Bay’s offense from 2019-21.“There’s a lot of reasons why the Jets are attractive,” Rodgers said Wednesday. “But there’s one coach that has meant as much to me as any coach I’ve ever had. And he happens to be the coordinator there.”Saleh and Johnson both expressed their interest in adding a veteran quarterback to a roster that already features one of the league’s best defenses.If Rodgers ends up with the Jets, it would be a case of history repeating itself.The Packers sent a soon-to-be 39-year-old Favre to the Jets in 2008, a move that ushered in Rodgers’ arrival as Green Bay’s starting quarterback. Favre won three MVPs with Green Bay during his Hall of Fame career.Rodgers backed up Favre for three seasons after the Packers selected him out of California with the 24th overall pick in the 2005 draft. Love has backed up Rodgers for three seasons since the Packers traded up to take the former Utah State quarterback with the 26th overall pick.Rodgers’ future has been the subject of speculation ever since the Packers selected Love. Rodgers acknowledged the selection caught him by surprise. One year later, he skipped the Packers’ mandatory minicamp in a standoff with Packers management.But the two sides eventually patched things up.Rodgers signed a contract extension with the Packers last year after producing a second straight MVP season.When he was asked last June at the Packers’ mandatory minicamp whether he expected to finish his career in Green Bay, Rodgers replied, “Yes. Definitely.”Those plans apparently changed after a 2022 season in which he had his lowest passer rating as a starter (91.1) and threw 12 interceptions, his highest total since 2008. Now Rodgers believes his time in Green Bay is done.“Coming to this reality has been really bittersweet,” Rodgers said. “I was drafted by Green Bay. I … love that city, love that organization. Always going to have love for that organization. But the facts are right now they want to move on, and now so do I.”___AP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836702,Safety Jordan Poyer agrees to 2-year deal to stay with Bills,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Safety Jordan Poyer has elected to stay put by reaching a two-year agreement to re-sign with the Buffalo Bills on Wednesday after briefly testing free agency.Poyer’s return immediately solidifies Buffalo’s secondary, which stood to lose a key leader and contributor who spent much of the previous six seasons forming one of the NFL’s top safety tandems in playing alongside Micah Hyde.And it comes at a time with the Bills defense in transition following starting middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds’ expected departure in free agency, and with coordinator Leslie Frazier choosing to take next season off from coaching.The agreement represents a key free agency victory for the three-time defending AFC East champion Bills, who entered the signing period with a limited amount of salary cap space. Buffalo was projected to have about $20 million to work with after spending the past few days freeing up more than $40 million in space by restructuring the contracts of quarterback Josh Allen, edge rusher Von Miller, receiver Stefon Diggs and signing linebacker Matt Milano to a two-year contract extension.Poyer posted a note on his social media account in announcing his return by writing, “hey bud,” in a message directed to his close friend, Hyde.The 31-year-old Poyer has 10 years of NFL experience, and blossomed as a player upon joining the Bills in free agency in March 2017, after spending his previous three-plus seasons in Cleveland.He’s a two-time second-team All-Pro (2017 and 2021), and Poyer’s 22 interceptions since 2017 rank fifth in the NFL. He is also the league’s only player to be credited with 500 or more tackles, have 20 interceptions and 10 sacks over that span.In another move, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press that the Bills agreed to sign receiver Deonte Harty to a two-year contract that includes $5 million guaranteed and worth up to $13.5 million should he reach all the incentives. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the contract is not yet signed.Harty spent his first four seasons with New Orleans where he also doubled as a returner. An undrafted free agent out of Assumption University in Massachusetts, Harty had 64 catches for 793 yards in 40 career games. His best season came two years ago when he had 36 catches for 570 yards and three TDs.Buffalo also retained the rights to defensive back Dane Jackson, by issuing the restricted free agent a qualifying offer. The Bills hold the right to match any offer issued to Jackson by another team, and would receive a seventh-round draft pick as compensation if they decline to match.Poyer is coming off a season in which he showed his resilience and perseverance despite being unhappy with the team’s failure to extend the final year of his contract. He played through a variety of injuries, including finishing the season with torn knee cartilage.In October, Poyer agreed to make the 14-hour drive to play in Buffalo’s 24-20 win at Kansas City after he was prevented from flying because of the aftereffects of a collapsed lung.Despite missing four games to injury, Poyer still finished the season leading the Bills with four interceptions and was sixth with 63 tackles. He also served as a mainstay of a young and patchwork secondary that lost Hyde to a season-ending neck injury in September, and spent the first three months minus starting cornerback Tre’Davious White who was recovering from a torn knee ligament.The Bills defense was second in the NFL in fewest points allowed and sixth in fewest yards allowed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836703,Medication abortions are under fire: Here's how they work,"Medication abortions became the preferred method for ending pregnancy in the U.S. even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They usually involve taking two prescription medicines days apart — at home or in a clinic.In contrast, abortion procedures are an invasive medical technique that empties the womb. They are sometimes called surgical abortions, although they don’t involve surgery.In the United States, abortions by pills usually involve the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. As more states seek abortion limits, demand for the pills is expected to grow. But they have been targeted by abortion foes including Christian conservatives who filed suit in Texas seeking to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone. A hearing on the suit was held Wednesday.HOW DO ABORTION DRUGS WORK?Mifepristone is taken first, swallowed by mouth. The drug dilates the cervix and blocks the effects of the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy.Misoprostol, a drug also used to treat stomach ulcers, is taken 24 to 48 hours later. The pill is designed to dissolve when placed between the gums and teeth or in the vagina. It causes the uterus to cramp and contract, causing bleeding and expelling pregnancy tissue.While the two-drug combination is slightly more effective, misoprostol is sometimes used alone for abortions. That practice is more common in countries where mifepristone is banned, but U.S. clinics were preparing to switch to the single drug if the lawsuit prevails.HOW ARE ABORTION DRUGS ADMINISTERED?Abortion medication is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy.The pills may be taken in a doctor’s office or clinic, where patients sometimes have an ultrasound or lab tests beforehand. Some providers also offer the pills through telehealth visits and then send patients the medication by mail.Use of the pills has been increasing in recent years and they account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION ABORTION?Studies and real-use evidence show that when taken together, the pills are safe and up to 99% effective. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.Bleeding is normal. Very heavy bleeding — soaking more than two pads an hour for more than two hours — is uncommon but requires medical attention.Dr. Stephanie Rand, a New York ob-gyn and abortion specialist with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, says pregnancy tests should not be used right away to determine if a medication abortion was successful because the pregnancy hormone may linger in the body for several weeks. Bleeding, with blood clots that include lighter colored tissue, are signs of success, she said.Serious complications are very rare. The Food and Drug Administration says more than 3.7 million U.S. women have used mifepristone since it was approved more than 20 years ago. The agency has received 26 reports of deaths in women using the medication, including two involving ectopic pregnancies, which grow outside the womb.The medications are not recommended for certain patients, including those with suspected ectopic pregnancies or with implanted IUD birth control devices.HOW MUCH DOES MEDICATION ABORTION COST?Costs vary by location but are similar to abortion procedures and may total more than $500. Health insurance coverage varies, with some plans making the pills free or low cost and others not covering them at all.Mifepristone is sold under the brand name Mifeprex and misoprostol under the brand name Cytotec, but both pills are available as generics.WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL RULES AROUND ABORTION PILLS?The FDA approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancy in 2000, when used with misoprostol. At the time, it imposed several limits on how the drug could be prescribed and dispensed.In December, the agency dropped the biggest restriction: a requirement that patients pick up the medication in person. The FDA said a scientific review of the drug’s use — including during the COVID-19 pandemic — showed that women could safely receive the pills through the mail after an online consultation, without any increase in side effects or complications.The decision allowed mail delivery of the pills nationwide, a change long-sought by medical professional groups and abortion-rights supporters. Still, millions of women will have trouble accessing the pills due to a patchwork of state laws targeting abortion broadly and the pills specifically.About half of U.S. states are expected to ban or greatly restrict abortion.HOW LONG WILL LEGAL CONFLICTS PLAY OUT?Legal experts foresee years of court battles over access to the pills, as abortion-rights proponents bring test cases to challenge state restrictions.There are strong arguments and precedents on both sides, experts note, though little certainty about which side might prevail.The Biden administration’s Justice Department has already signaled plans to challenge state restrictions on medication abortion. And federal lawyers are likely to be joined by outside parties, including abortion rights groups like Planned Parenthood and even the companies that make the pills.The chief argument against pill restrictions is likely to be the longstanding principle that federal laws, including FDA decisions, preempts state laws. Indeed, few states have ever tried to fully ban an FDA-approved drug because of past rulings in the agency’s favor.Still, states with blanket abortion bans are likely to interpret them as barring abortion pills. Many of the laws don’t distinguish between abortion procedures and medication abortion.“In the short term, those states that ban abortion are going to assume that their bans also include medication abortion and that will be prohibited,” said Greer Donley, a professor specializing in reproductive health care at the University of Pittsburgh Law School.ARE THERE STATE LAWS RESTRICTING ABORTION PILLS?Even if blanket bans are successfully challenged, 15 states have limited access to abortion pills, including six that require an in-person physician visit. Those laws could withstand court challenges. States have long had authority over how physicians, pharmacists and other providers practice medicine.States also set the rules for telemedicine consultations used to prescribe medications. Generally that means health providers in states with restrictions on abortion pills could face penalties, such as fines or license suspension, for trying to send pills through the mail.Women have already been traveling across state lines to places where abortion pill access is easier. That trend is expected to increase.Meanwhile, some women will still get the medication via online pharmacies in Canada and overseas, often with telehealth consultations from foreign doctors. The practice is technically illegal but essentially unenforced, and advocates believe women will increasingly choose this method as more states move to ban abortions.“Anti-abortion states are going to do everything they can to restrict medication abortion, but practically speaking people have been and will continue to access it through the mail from international pharmacies,” Donley said.YEARS OF UNCERTAINTYDonley expects lawsuits based on various legal theories to play out for a few years before any clear decisions emerge.One key question is how the nation’s top court might rule if and when it takes up those court cases. While the Supreme Court has rejected a constitutional right to abortion, conservative justices have also generally deferred to FDA’s primacy over drug decisions.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836704,Arizona governor blasted for plans to defy execution order,"PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is being criticized by a victim’s sister and a powerful county prosecutor for her plans to defy a court order to execute a prisoner next month for his conviction in a 2002 killing. The newly elected Democratic governor vowed nearly two weeks ago that she wouldn’t carry out the Arizona Supreme Court’s order to execute Aaron Gunches on April 6, citing a review that she has ordered of death penalty protocols due to Arizona's history of mismanaging executions.Hobbs has said executions will not be carried out until Arizonans can be confident the state isn’t violating the law. She maintains that while the court authorized Gunches’ execution, its order doesn’t require the state to carry it out.Over the last several days, lawyers for Karen Price, whose brother Ted Price was the victim in Gunches’ case, and Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell have told the state’s highest court that Hobbs doesn’t have the legal authority to disregard the order.In a statement, Karen Price said the relief her family felt when the court scheduled Gunches’ execution was dashed by Hobbs’ announcement.“Not only has our family been victimized by inmate Gunches and the emotional aftermath of Ted’s murder, we are now being victimized by the governor’s failure to recognize and uphold our constitutional rights to justice and finality,” Price said.Nicholas Klingerman, an attorney representing Mitchell, said no constitutional violations have been found with the state’s execution protocols and that carrying out execution warrants isn’t optional for the governor.“Nothing in the Constitution or laws of Arizona or the warrant gives the governor discretion to ignore the warrant and grant what essentially constitutes a temporary reprieve from the death penalty,” Klingerman wrote.In a filing Wednesday, lawyers for Hobbs advised the court against taking up Price’s appeal, saying the corrections department lacks staff with expertise to carry out an execution and the state isn’t currently prepared to carry out an execution in a constitutionally sound manner.They said the state doesn’t have a contract right now for a pharmacist to compound the pentobarbital needed for an execution and that corrections officials are unable to find out the identity of the state’s prior compounding pharmacist, who primarily had contact with an official no longer with the department. They also said a top corrections leadership position that’s critical to planning executions remains unfilled.Corrections Director Ryan Thornell said in a court filing that he was unable to find enough documentation to understand key elements of the execution process and instead has had to piece it together through conversations with employees on what might have occurred in past executions.Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he believes Hobbs, as the state’s chief executive, has the power to put the brakes on executions if she is concerned whether they are going to be carried out humanely and in a constitutionally sound manner. He said he doesn’t believe the courts can force Hobbs to carry out the execution.“She has the power to make sure that that’s functioning properly,” said Dieter, whose group doesn’t take a position on the death penalty but is critical on how it’s carried out.Dale Baich, a former federal public defender who teaches death penalty law at Arizona State University, said Hobbs has “discretion for situations like this, where the governor has expressed legitimate concerns because of the problems with the (lethal injection) drugs, the qualifications of the executioners and staffing at the Department of Corrections necessary to carry out executions.”Mel McDonald, a former U.S. Attorney for Arizona who handled two death row cases as a prosecutor, predicted the state Supreme Court would take up the appeal filed by Price’s sister, saying the dispute presents the court with novel legal issues.“It raises a lot of questions,” McDonald said of the dispute. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they accept jurisdiction (of the case). Where it goes from there is anyone’s guess.”Arizona, which currently has 110 prisoners on death row, carried out three executions last year after a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining execution drugs.Since resuming executions, the state was criticized in May for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner’s body in and for denying the Arizona Republic newspaper’s request to witness the last three executions.Gunches was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to murder in the shooting death of Ted Price, his girlfriend’s ex-husband, near Mesa, Arizona.Gunches, who isn’t a lawyer, represented himself in November when he asked the Supreme Court to issue his execution warrant so, he said, that justice could be served and the victims could get closure. In Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s last month in office, his office asked the court for a warrant to execute Gunches.But Gunches then withdrew his request in early January, and newly elected Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes later asked for the execution warrant submitted during Brnovich’s tenure to be withdrawn.The state Supreme Court rejected Mayes’ request, saying it must grant an execution warrant if certain appellate proceedings have concluded — and that those requirements were met in Gunches’ case.In yet another reversal, Gunches said in a filing a week ago that he still wants to be executed and asked to be transferred to Texas, where he wrote “the law is still followed and inmates can still get their sentences carried out.”Arizona’s highest court has since denied Gunches’ request to transfer to Texas.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836705,Does 'Ted Lasso' end with season 3? What to ... believe,"“ Ted Lasso” returns Wednesday for its third season and while there are certainly questions about whether AFC Richmond will finally go all the way — or if Nate will receive his comeuppance — there's one big question: Is this actually the last season?The Emmy-winning Apple TV+ series, about an American coaching a soccer team in London, has long been described as a three-season series — but executive producer, writer and star Jason Sudeikis is noncommittal about what comes next.“I’m still in it,"" he said in a recent interview.“We’re still editing the last few episodes, so it’s really something that I haven’t had the time to sit with, despite the fact that there’s a lot of wonder and curiosity ... from the press or fans — and certainly it seems like people in show business are equally as interested,” he laughed. ""That answer will arrive probably when there’s enough space for the question to really land.""Brendan Hunt, who plays assistant coach Beard, (whose first name “has not been revealed,"" said the actor. ""We don’t know that he doesn’t have one, but he certainly appears to have no use for it.”) is also an executive producer and writer on the show.“We always saw it as this three-movement suite or a three-piece story,"" Hunt says, but admits the show's success has added more questions than answers to that original plan. “So the door is still open for — after this suite is finished — that maybe we’ll pick up with something else in this world.”When asked, if there's a character from the series whom Hunt would like to see explored further, Hunt deadpans, “Phoebe (Roy Kent's young niece) as she battles London’s drug-riddled crime underworld.”Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent, the Richmond player-turned-coach with a gruff exterior and a heart of gold, is a definite breakout. He played Hercules in the end credits of “Thor: Love and Thunder,” and is a creator and executive producer on “ Shrinking,” also on Apple TV+. He credits “Ted Lasso” for giving him creative opportunities of which he had only dreamed.“I’d worked for years and years and years and 12 people had seen all of it, you know, and then doing a show that loads of people watch is different. It really is different,"" Goldstein says. ""Without being cheesy, I learned an awful lot from working on ‘Ted Lasso,’ and I will take those lessons with me into anything else I do,” he said.Toheeb Jimoh had only been acting professionally for two years when he got cast as player Sam Obisanya.“I’m at a stage where, because of this show I’m able to stand on my own two feet as an artist now. I’ve kind of absorbed the Lasso way in the same way that all of the players have,” Jimoh says. ""Ted says, ‘It’s not about the wins or losses, it’s about making these players the best versions of themselves on and off the pitch.’ I really feel that’s the same lesson that ‘Ted Lasso’ has given us young actors on the show. It’s about making us to the best versions of ourselves on and off the screen, you know?”Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton, was already an accomplished stage performer prior to “Ted Lasso,” and already has other exciting jobs lined up including a role in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two.” But she still wonders if she'll ever be able to duplicate the “Ted Lasso” experience.“I don’t know about you guys here, but Brits are natural worriers. It makes me worried that I may not ever have that again because it is such a beautiful kind of symbiosis with all of us,"" she says.For now, Sudeikis seems more willing to address what the show has meant to him than what lies in store.“I see it through the eyes of my kids when we go somewhere and the way people come up to to myself and .. any of us, just how loving people are,"" he says, joking that he doubts the the cast of “Succession” gets quite the same reception. ""I’m sure they’re excited to see them because they’re all wickedly talented, but it’s a different vibe on that show and a different family, if you will. So, being surrounded by that type of kindness and have it reflected back to you — especially in front of kids or family — has been really, really moving.”",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836706,Wellesley College students call for admission of trans men,"A fierce debate at Wellesley College over who should be admitted to the women's school has intensified with students approving a referendum to allow the admission of transgender men and nonbinary people who do not identify and live as women.While Tuesday's vote is nonbinding and the administration has already said it has no plans to change its current admissions policy, the issue has roiled the campus just west of Boston.College president Paula Johnson, senior leadership and trustees acknowledged the vote in a statement and said, “the college will continue to engage all students, including transgender male and nonbinary students, in the important work of building an inclusive academic community where everyone feels they belong.”Wellesley's current policy allows for the admission of students who live and identify as women, and since 2017 the school has admitted transgender women.Johnson in a March 6 email to the campus community expressed support for the current policy, writing that it aligns with the college's long term mission of providing “an excellent liberal arts education to women who will make a difference in the world.""The school, with about 2,500 students that counts Madeleine Albright, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Diane Sawyer among its alums, will continue to be “a women’s college that admits cis, trans and nonbinary students — all who consistently identify as women,” she wrote, while promising to support the entire diversity of the campus community.But the email sparked a backlash, in part because nonbinary people do not strictly identify as male or female.The editorial board at the student newspaper, The Wellesley News, wrote on March 8 that “we disapprove of and entirely disagree with President Johnson’s email.""Hundreds of faculty, staff and alumni signed an open letter to Johnson and the trustees supporting the student referendum.“We find it frankly offensive to suggest that Wellesley’s long and valuable tradition of advocacy for women could be undermined by extending the most basic institutional courtesies and protections to trans and nonbinary students,"" the letter said.Sexual Health Educators, a peer sex education group that supports the presence of trans lives on campus, in a statement said it was “outraged"" by Johnson's email.Johnson's message “carries with it an implication that the administration believes students who do not align themselves with womanhood do not belong on this campus,"" the organization said.Co-editors-in-chief of the student newspaper, Andreea Sabau and and Micol J. Zhai, said in a separate statement Wednesday that the administration’s response to the referendum was inconsistent with the college's values.“We are disappointed at college administrators’ refusal to listen to student voices, especially in the face of mounting attacks against trans rights across the United States,” they said. “This decision stands in opposition to Wellesley’s founding values, which encourage students to ‘make a difference in the world.’ ”While the college did not release vote counts or percentages of the referendum, which also asked administrators to use nongendered language in its communications, such as using “students"" or “alumni"" instead of “women,"" Sabau and Zhai said the student support was overwhelming, with an exit poll showing more than 90% supported it.Johnson and Trustees Chair Debora de Hoyos were not available for comment, a school spokesperson said.Wellesley is not the first women's college to engage in a debate over transgender admissions, said Genny Beemyn, who uses they/them pronouns and is director of the Stonewall Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a resource group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.“This has definitely been an issue at other women's colleges,"" they said.Of 28 women's colleges Beemyn tracks in an online database, just three admit transgender men, including Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.The Wellesley administration is likely fighting a losing battle, Beemyn said.“I imagine the Wellesley students will continue to protest, and at some point the administration will change their policy,” they said.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836711,UK: Strike expands from doctors to include other workers,"Following the unveiling of the UK Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt's budget on Wednesday, teachers, London Tube drivers and civil servants in their hundreds of thousands joined striking doctors.Inflation has hit workers across all sectors, including white collar workers. UK university employees and journalists at the BBC also joined in the multisector walkout.The ASLEF (Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) and Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) trade unions in the capital London left the Underground system paralyzed. The 130,000 civil servants from various government departments along with the country's Border Force.Near No. 10 Downing Street, workers chanted outside Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office, ""What do we want?, 10 percent, when do we want it? Now!""Labor unions representing public sector workers have been at loggerheads with the government seeking pay increases they say are needed to allow for inflation. The government, meanwhile, says that they are unaffordable and will further fuel inflation.The world's sixth-largest economy has faced a turbulent few years amid the shocks government austerity, Brexit, COVID-19 and double-digit inflation amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In addition to salaries not keeping up with inflation, workers mention conditions, job security and pensions as top among their concerns.The British Medical Association said junior doctors had effectively taken a 26% pay cut since 2009.Hunt, whose formal title is Chancellor of the Exchequer, became minister last year in the wake of former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget that proved politically disastrous and leaned heavily on unfunded plans for tax cuts. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, himself a former chancellor, then kept Hunt in the role.Increasing industrial action across much of public sectorThe General Secretary of the civil servants' PCS trade union, Mark Serwotka, said that it was scandalous that some government workers were themselves forced to accept government benefits because of their low salaries.The cascade of ever-more-severe strikes had also reached a tipping point, he added.""I believe that for the first time in years, opinion polls show there's a lot of support for strikes,"" Serwotka told AFP.The two-day teachers' strike is expected to affect every school in the UK.More and more public sector workers have been downing tools more frequently in recent months in the UK, nurses went on strike for what their unions said was the first time in history earlier in the labor dispute.ar/msh (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836713,NBA suspends Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant 8 games over video showing him with gun in club; he could return Monday,NEW YORK (AP) — NBA suspends Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant 8 games over video showing him with gun in club; he could return Monday.,2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836714,NBA suspends Ja Morant 8 games for video showing gun in club,"MIAMI (AP) — Ja Morant will be back with the Memphis Grizzlies next week, after the NBA handed the All-Star guard an eight-game suspension without pay Wednesday and saying his displaying a firearm at a club in suburban Denver earlier this month was “conduct detrimental to the league.”Morant missed his sixth consecutive game when the Grizzlies played in Miami on Wednesday night. He will miss the next two games — at San Antonio on Friday and home against Golden State on Saturday — then be eligible to return on Monday when Memphis plays Dallas, though he is not expected to play that night.The games he already missed will count toward the suspension, and Morant will forfeit about $669,000 in salary.“Ja’s conduct was irresponsible, reckless and potentially very dangerous,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “It also has serious consequences given his enormous following and influence, particularly among young fans who look up to him.”Silver met with Morant in New York before announcing the league’s decision. Other league officials, as well as representatives from the National Basketball Players Association, were part of that meeting.Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said he doesn’t expect Morant to play Monday, saying the team is “going to be respectful of the time off he’s had.”“There will be a quick ramp-up period after that,” Jenkins said. “Obviously, he hasn’t been playing basketball for almost two weeks now.”The league’s investigation, which started almost immediately after the March 4 incident in which Morant livestreamed himself on Instagram, found that he was “holding a firearm in an intoxicated state” — but did not prove that the gun was owned by Morant “or was displayed by him beyond a brief period.”The league investigation also did not find that Morant had the gun with him on Memphis’ flight to Denver, or that he possessed the gun while in any NBA facility. Police in Colorado said last week that they looked into the circumstances surrounding the video and concluded that there was no reason to charge Morant with a crime.Morant spoke with ESPN for an interview that was to air later Wednesday night, and said the gun was not his.“He has expressed sincere contrition and remorse for his behavior,” Silver said. “Ja has also made it clear to me that he has learned from this incident and that he understands his obligations and responsibility to the Memphis Grizzlies and the broader NBA community extend well beyond his play on the court.”The Grizzlies played at Denver on March 3. At 5:19 a.m. the next day, Morant started a livestream from inside a strip club called Shotgun Willies in Glendale, Colorado. The video quickly went viral, and trouble escalated.The Grizzlies initially said Morant would miss at least two games. Hours later, Morant said in a statement distributed through the agency that represents him that he takes “full responsibility” for his actions and that he was going to “take some time away to get help.” ESPN reported that Morant sought counseling at a facility in Florida; Jenkins said Wednesday that ""the Florida piece is done for now.""“There’s going to be ongoing stuff over the next couple days that he’s going to be probably be working on,” Jenkins said.The two-game absence was followed by the team announcing last week that Morant would miss at least four more games, a stretch that concludes Wednesday.""Now we know the plan moving forward,"" Jenkins said.Morant, a two-time All-Star, is averaging 27.1 points and 8.2 assists per game this season for a Memphis team that entered Wednesday in the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference.This marked at least the second time in recent weeks that Morant was the subject of a league investigation. Morant’s actions were investigated after a Jan. 29 incident in Memphis that he said led to a friend of his being banned from home games for a year.That incident followed a game against the Indiana Pacers; citing unnamed sources, The Indianapolis Star and USA Today reported that multiple members of the Pacers saw a red dot pointed at them, and The Athletic reported that a Pacers security guard believed the laser was attached to a gun.The NBA confirmed that unnamed individuals were banned from the arena but said its investigation found no evidence that anyone was threatened with a weapon.Morant and a close friend also are involved in a civil lawsuit brought after an incident at Morant’s home last summer, in which a 17-year-old alleged that they assaulted him.“I don’t condone any type of violence,"" Morant said in the ESPN interview. ""But I take full responsibility for my actions. I made a bad mistake and I can see the image that I painted over myself with my recent mistakes. But in the future, I’m going to show everybody who Ja really is, what I’m about and change this narrative.”And when Morant returns, the team knows there will be questions, as well as likely some hostile comments coming in road arenas. The Grizzlies plan to prepare Morant for those moments as best they can.“We sit down and talk to him and we help guide him through this process,” Jenkins said. “That’s going to be our focal point, on the court, off the court. Support and accountability, that’s what we’re focused on, not just in this recent couple of weeks but moving forward. Obviously things are going to be different, but it’s going to be great to have him back with the team. The team’s going to be able to rally around him as he’s been rallying around a difficult situation. We’re going to take it one day at a time.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836716,Kansas coach Bill Self 'day to day' at March Madness,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bill Self's status for Kansas' opener in the NCAA Tournament was uncertain Wednesday, though assistant coach Norm Roberts said the Jayhawks remain hopeful he'll be on the bench when they play Howard on Thursday.Kansas' Hall of Fame coach was discharged from a Kansas City-area hospital Sunday, where he’d been recovering after a procedure to treat blocked arteries in his heart.Self attended practice Wednesday but did not participate in his team's media availability. Roberts said Self also was at practice Tuesday and has been at all of the team's meetings.“He’s doing well, he’s getting better all the time,” Roberts said. “We’re hopeful, and everything is day-to-day with him, but if you ask our guys, he got after them pretty good today so he was doing really well.”Roberts said Self missed the news conference so he could get some rest before the top-seeded and defending national champion Jayhawks begin play in the West Region.All-American Jalen Wilson said Self appeared to have good energy at practice.“He's looking great, feeling great,” Wilson said. ""We’re all excited. It’s great to have him back on the court with us, for him to be able to coach us and start off tomorrow with a bang.""Self went to the emergency room the night of March 8, shortly after watching the Jayhawks in a final shootaround ahead of their Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal. He was complaining of chest tightness and concerns with his balance.Dr. Mark Wiley, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Kansas Health System, said the 60-year-old Self underwent a standard heart catheterization and had two stents placed to help treat the blocked arteries.Roberts, coached the Jayhawks in the Big 12 Tournament. Roberts also served as acting coach earlier in the season, while Self was serving a school-imposed four-game suspension.Kansas beat West Virginia and Iowa State in the Big 12 tourney with Roberts again on the bench before getting blown out 76-56 by seventh-ranked Texas in Saturday night’s championship game.Self is 581-130 during two decades at Kansas, and 788-235 in 30 seasons as a head coach, which includes stops at Oral Roberts, Tulsa and Illinois. He led the Jayhawks to national titles in 2008 and last April.Not having Self on the bench for the Big 12 Tournament just didn't feel right to freshman and Kansas-born Gradey Dick. He's counting on Self coaching.“He’s our leader. For him to be back in the position that he’s always in is just huge for us,” Dick said. ""We go to him, and of course I go to him with anything that I need. Just seeing him in my corner just motivates me to be the best I can be.”Illinois coach Brad Underwood said he's not surprised Self is with the Jayhawks in Des Moines. Underwood has known Self more than 40 years. Self was his host on a recruiting trip to Oklahoma State; Underwood picked Kansas State. They coached against each other in the Big 12 when Underwood was an assistant at K-State and head coach at OSU.Their teams would meet in the second round Saturday if the Illini beat Arkansas and the Jayhawks advance.“I know how tough he is. I know what a competitor he is,"" Underwood said. “I also know how important it is for him to be here for his players and his coaches.“I don’t want to speak for Bill, you know, he may not be his 100% spry self. ... When Bill is on that sideline, he’s helping his team.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836722,US issues travel alert for Spring breakers in Mexico,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert Wednesday for Americans planning to spend Spring break in Mexico.The alert warns travelers to “exercise increased caution” especially after dark at Caribbean beach resorts like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, which have been plagued by drug gang violence in the past.“U.S. citizens should exercise increased caution in the downtown areas of popular spring break locations including Cancun, Playa Del Carmen, and Tulum, especially after dark,” according to the alert.The Sate Department also noted that U.S. citizens “have become seriously ill or died in Mexico after using synthetic drugs or adulterated prescription pills.”That warning followed reports that some pharmacies in Mexico freely offer sedatives and other drugs that can only be sold with prescriptions in the United States. The Mexican pills are often counterfeit and contain the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl.The alert also noted that “unregulated alcohol may be contaminated, and U.S. citizens have reported losing consciousness or becoming injured after consuming alcohol that was possibly tainted.”There have been a series of brazen acts of violence along the Caribbean coast, the crown jewel of Mexico’s tourism industry.In 2022, two Canadians were killed in Playa del Carmen, apparently because of debts between international drug and weapons trafficking gangs.In 2021, farther south in the laid-back destination of Tulum, two tourists — one a California travel blogger born in India and the other German — were caught in the apparent crossfire of rival drug dealers and killed.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836723,NY diocese facing flood of lawsuits files for bankruptcy,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The embattled Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany became the latest diocese in New York to seek bankruptcy protection Wednesday as it faces hundreds of lawsuits alleging sexual abuse.Bishop Edward Scharfenberger announced the Chapter 11 filing after months of negotiations between the upstate New York diocese and lawyers representing plaintiffs over a potential settlement.The Albany diocese, like others in the state, is dealing with a deluge of lawsuits dating to when New York temporarily suspended the statute of limitations to give victims of childhood abuse the ability to pursue even decades-old allegations against clergy members, teachers, Boy Scout leaders and others.“The decision to file was not arrived at easily and I know it may cause pain and suffering, but we, as a Church, can get through this and grow stronger together,” Scharfenberger said in a release.The bishop said that as cases brought under the state’s Child Victims Act were settled, “our limited self-insurance funds which have been paying those settlements, have been depleted.” He said the bankruptcy filing was the best way to ensure that all survivors with pending litigation receive some compensation.The action halts legal actions against the diocese and will allow it to develop a reorganization plan that will determine available assets, Scharfenberger said.Dioceses across the nation have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years. In New York, Albany is the fifth of eight dioceses to take the action, a list that includes those based in Buffalo, Rochester and Rockville Centre on Long Island.Some attorneys representing plaintiffs against the Albany diocese accused it of using bankruptcy as a legal tactic.“We urge everyone to see the Diocese’s strategy for what it is: chicanery designed to perpetuate a $600 million corporation’s pattern of decadence, deception, and denial,” said attorney Jeff Anderson in a statement.New York temporarily set aside its usual time limit on civil lawsuits for victims of childhood sexual abuse for a two-year period ending in August 2021. More than 9,000 lawsuits were filed against churches, hospitals, schools, camps, scout groups and other institutions",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836724,"Amid Man United bids, UEFA head hints at owners rule review","GENEVA (AP) — UEFA should rethink its rules that prevent clubs in related ownership from playing in the same competition such as the Champions League, its president Aleksander Čeferin said Wednesday.Čeferin, speaking in an interview with former Manchester United player Gary Neville, said UEFA was “not thinking about United only” in considering a review.United’s owners, the Glazer family, have invited offers to buy the storied club and a Qatari-funded bid and British industrialist Jim Ratcliffe have declared interest.A Qatari sovereign wealth fund already owns Champions League regular Paris Saint-Germain and Ratcliffe’s chemicals firm INEOS owns Nice, which regularly plays in UEFA’s lower-tier competitions.Both potential buyers could have problems with UEFA’s rule that bars clubs playing in the same competitions in any season if owners have “decisive influence” over them.Čeferin, who has held one international press conference since September, told Neville in a filmed interview released Wednesday that UEFA should move soon to rethink its rules.“It has to be quick because, you know, everything has to happen quickly in football,” the UEFA president said.A UEFA panel of club finance experts accepted in 2017 that the Red Bull ownership group had created enough separation between Leipzig and Salzburg to allow both to enter the next Champions League together.That ruling was met with some skepticism, however, and finding new flexibility in the rules that could ultimately benefit the Qatari bid for United would be another example of PSG seeming to get favorable decisions at UEFA.PSG has emerged from two UEFA financial monitoring investigations with less severe consequences than many expected, and club president Nasser al-Khelaifi escaped sanction in a disciplinary case last year. A referee was confronted after a game which had eliminated PSG from the Champions League.Al-Khelaifi is a close ally of Čeferin in soccer politics as a member of UEFA’s executive committee, as the chairman of the European Club Association that helped stop the breakaway Super League project in 2021, and as the head of one of UEFA’s most important commercial clients — Qatari broadcaster beIN Sports.UEFA warned last month of the integrity risks posed by “multi-club ownership” — potential collusion on the field and in the transfer market — in its annual review of the European soccer industry.Researchers for UEFA identified “more than 180 clubs worldwide” in a multi-club investment structure involving the careers of more than 6,500 players. They said that was a five-fold increase within a decade.“There is more and more interest for this multi-club ownership and we shouldn’t just say no (to) the investments, and for multi-club ownership,” Čeferin said. “But we have to see what kind of rules we set in that case, because the rules have to be strict.”Čeferin said any UEFA decision on relaxing the multi-club ownership rule would come to the executive committee he chairs. It includes Al-Khelaifi and UEFA treasurer David Gill, the former CEO at Man United who is still closely tied to the club.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

(AP) — Alabama star Brandon Miller was accompanied by an armed security guard to the NCAA Tournament on Wednesday because of threats directed his way, Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said.“If you guys saw some of what I’ve seen sent his way, I think you would understand why that’s the case,” Oats said of the extra protection that the school lined up for Miller. “I don’t want to get into all that. The entire situation, as you know, is just a heartbreaking situation on all accounts.”Miller name surfaced last month in court testimony involving the capital murder case of former Alabama player Darius Miles and another man, who are charged in the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Jamea Harris on Jan. 15.A police officer testified that Miles texted Miller asking him to bring Miles’ gun in the early morning hours of the shooting. Fellow freshman starter Jaden Bradley was also at the scene. Neither Miller nor Bradley has been accused of any crime, and the university has described Miller as a cooperating witness, not a suspect.The Crimson Tide (29-5) is a No. 1 seed in the tournament for the first time in school history. They play their opening game in the South Regional on Thursday, facing No. 16 seed Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in Birmingham — less than an hour's drive from the Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa.The guard, who wore a gun, badge and Alabama polo shirt, accompanied Miller to the interview area and later watched him take part in a light practice.The freshman, who was the Southeastern Conference player and newcomer of the year, declined to go into specifics about the extra security, implying it was nothing unusual.“I always travel with security to all the games,"" Miller said. “That's all I'm gonna say on that.”But Oats conceded it was hardly business as usual.“Some of the messages from people that can sit behind fake email addresses, but who knows whether they're real or not,"" Oats said. “But if you'd seen what I've seen, you would understand what's going on right now.”Oats added that he looks at all his players like his own children: “I put myself in his parents' shoes, and our administration has seen the stuff that've I've seen. It's appropriate. But it's nothing a college kid should have to go through.”After his name came light in the case, Miller received a harsh reception during a victory at South Carolina, where the crowd chanted “lock him up” and “guilty.""Miller has repeatedly declined to discuss details of the case, saying last week only that he's relied on the camaraderie of his teammates to cope with issues off the court.“I just lean on my teammates,” he said. “They're like family for me away from home.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836726,AP source: 49ers agree to 1-year deal with Clelin Ferrell,"The San Francisco 49ers agreed to a one-year contract with former Raiders first-round defensive lineman Clelin Ferrell in hopes of reviving his career.A person familiar with the deal said the sides agreed to the contract on Wednesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract has not been announced.ESPN first reported the signing.Ferrell was mostly a disappointment in four seasons with the Raiders after being drafted fourth overall out of Clemson in 2019. He had 10 sacks in 58 games and struggled to generate any pressure.After starting most of his first two seasons, Ferrell was a reserve the past two years and had his fifth-year option declined last year.Ferrell had 98 quarterback pressures in 58 games, according to Pro Football Focus. He has experience playing both inside and outside with versatility that the Niners covet.San Francisco needed reinforcements on the defensive line with key contributors Samson Ebukam and Charles Omenihu leaving in free agency.The Niners agreed earlier in the week to a four-year contract with defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, according to a second person familiar with the deal, and now are adding Ferrell.San Francisco has had a good history of getting the best out of pass rushers under defensive line coach Kris Kocurek, including another former Raiders draft pick, Arden Key, Kerry Hyder Jr., and Omenihu.They are hoping for similar results with Ferrell.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836727,DeSantis nabs presidential endorsement from GOP House member,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, an outspoken member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, preemptively endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president on Wednesday, pushing his fellow Republican House members to look beyond former President Donald Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination.The public showing of support appears to be DeSantis' first endorsement from a member of Congress and comes as the governor has been courting conservative lawmakers ahead of a formal announcement expected after the end of the state legislative session in May.Roy wrote in an email sent from his campaign that the party needs “a new generation of leadership” at the helm, and he argued that DeSantis has “proven his ability to win at the ballot box time and time again.” The comments were implicit knocks on the 76-year-old Trump, who lost his own reelection bid in 2020 and was blamed for an unexpectedly poor showing by Republican candidates in last year's midterms.“When other Republicans were faltering in key races, Governor DeSantis provided a positive vision for the future with prudent, conservative action. The result was crystal clear: Republicans enjoyed sweeping, historic performances statewide,” Roy wrote.Roy made clear that he will support the eventual Republican nominee even if it isn't DeSantis.“America has been built upon and defined by the sacrifices of one generation for the next,” Roy wrote. “When Republicans choose our 2024 presidential nominee — whom I intend to support against Joe Biden or any other Democrat candidate — I believe it’s time for a new generation of leadership. It’s time for younger, but proven, leadership to offer America eight solid years of transformational change.”His endorsement of DeSantis could open the door for other members of Congress to defy Trump by backing DeSantis as well. More than two dozen House members have already endorsed Trump's reelection bid, including the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.Roy also attended a weekend retreat hosted by DeSantis last month that included Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.Roy has clashed with the former president in the past and voted to certify the results of the 2020 election that Trump had falsely claimed was stolen from him through voter fraud.The congressman has held a House seat since 2019 and emerged as a boisterous member of the chamber’s Freedom Caucus. He was a key holdout against House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s leadership election earlier this year.The endorsement came the same day that MAGA, Inc., a Trump-supporting super PAC, filed an ethics complaint against DeSantis in Florida, accusing him of violating campaign finance and ethics rules with a shadow run for the White House. A DeSantis spokesperson dismissed the complaint as “frivolous and politically motivated.”",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836729,Judge: Miami Beach can end liquor sales in area at 2 a.m.,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Miami Beach officials can move forward with plans to end alcohol sales after 2 a.m. in certain parts of South Beach, an internationally famous tourist spot.A Miami-Dade circuit judge ruled against a challenge by Story nightclub on Tuesday to an ordinance passed last month by Miami Beach city commissioners, according to court records. The ordinance forces businesses with a capacity of more than 100 patrons in the South of Fifth neighborhood, located at the southernmost tip of Miami Beach, to stop selling alcohol at 2 a.m. instead of 5 a.m.“This is a residential neighborhood that should not have to endure 24-hour nightclubs,” Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said in a Twitter post. “Hopefully we can begin enforcement very soon.”Attorneys for Story nightclub, which has room for more than 1,000 guests, argued that the exception for bars and restaurants that hold fewer than 100 people was arbitrary.The judge rejected the nightclub's arguments and refused to temporarily block the ordinance while the business appeals.Miami Beach city officials have been trying to pass alcohol curfews for several years, especially during spring break. Most previous attempts to limit alcohol sales have been struck down by courts.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836730,Brighton soccer team owner enjoys win at Cheltenham Festival,"CHELTENHAM, England (AP) — The owner of English soccer club Brighton enjoyed a big win on Wednesday before his team even played its Premier League game against local rival Crystal Palace.Tony Bloom also owns racehorse Energumene, which secured back-to-back victories in the Queen Mother Champion Chase with a 10-length triumph in the marquee race of Day 2 at the prestigious Cheltenham Festival.It was a nice boost for Bloom before Brighton played Crystal Palace in the so-called M23 derby — named after the motorway that connects Brighton to south London. It is a rivalry that has built up in recent decades.“I will be there later on,” Bloom said ahead of the Brighton-Palace game, which finished 1-0 to Bloom's team.Bloom admitted to “having a few quid on” Energumene for the race at Cheltenham.“He ran a magnificent race and totally deserved to win,"" he said. ""We are so fortunate to have such an amazing horse.”Under jockey Paul Townend and setting off as the 6-5 favorite, Energumene — wearing the blue-and-white colors of Brighton — gave trainer Willie Mullins his record-extending 92nd victory at the festival.Energumene is the first back-to-back winner of the Day 2 feature race since Altior in 2018 and 2019.Camilla, the queen consort, was at the Cheltenham Festival on Wednesday despite rainy conditions.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836731,End of an era: Cowboys release 2-time rushing champ Elliott,"The Dallas Cowboys released running back Ezekiel Elliott on Wednesday, ending a seven-season run for a two-time rushing champion who never regained the form of his dominant early years.Elliott will be designated a post-June 1 cut, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team didn't reveal details of the decision. The move will save Dallas about $11 million under the salary cap this season.Owner and general manager Jerry Jones said the decision was mutual to let the 27-year-old Elliott pursue another team in free agency and give the Cowboys more financial flexibility in building a roster.“This is one of the toughest parts of operating a team,” said Jones, who issued similarly heartfelt statements after the salary cap-related releases of defensive end DeMarcus Ware and receiver Dez Bryant in the past decade.“Moments like this come, and extremely difficult decisions and choices are made. For the franchise. For me personally. For players, too,” Jones said. “We will always have a special place and love for Zeke.”While Elliott finished with 12 rushing touchdowns in a second consecutive playoff season for the Cowboys in 2022, his overall production never matched the value of a $90 million, six-year extension he signed to end a preseason-long holdout in 2019.As the quick start to Elliott’s career fizzled, 2019 fourth-round draft pick Tony Pollard emerged as the best playmaker for quarterback Dak Prescott in the Dallas offense. The Cowboys have placed the $10.1 million franchise tag on Pollard for 2023.Elliott has 8,262 career yards rushing, third on the Dallas list behind Pro Football Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith, the NFL's career leading rusher, and Tony Dorsett. Elliott also was third behind Smith and Dorsett with 68 career touchdowns rushing.Elliott was an instant star as the fourth overall pick out of Ohio State in 2016, leading the NFL with 1,631 yards as a rookie and helping the Cowboys to the top seed in the NFC alongside fellow first-year sensation Prescott, who edged his teammate for 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors.Elliott’s second season was interrupted by a six-game suspension over domestic violence allegations. Elliott fought the ban in federal court, but abandoned the two-month effort 10 games into the 2017 season.Despite the suspension, Elliott still led the league in yards rushing per game, then added a second rushing title in 2018 when he and Prescott won their first playoff game together, a wild-card victory over Seattle.Injuries robbed Elliott of the explosiveness that marked his first few seasons, although he rarely missed games over his final two years. He had career lows of 876 yards and a 3.8-yard average per carry last season.His final play for Dallas left plenty to be desired.With the Cowboys 76 yards from the end zone in the final seconds of a 19-12 divisional-round loss to San Francisco, they split offensive linemen wide and lined up Elliott at center. He was immediately knocked on his backside after the snap on a play that went nowhere.The Cowboys will choose to remember many of the plays before such an ignominious ending.“Zeke’s impact and influence is seared into the Cowboys franchise in a very special and indelible way,” Jones said. “He has been a consummate professional and leader that set a tone in our locker room, on the practice field and in the huddle. Zeke defined what a great teammate should be.”NOTES: The Cowboys restructured the contracts of DE DeMarcus Lawrence and T Tyron Smith. Combined with recent restructures for Prescott and RG Zack Martin, the Cowboys have cleared nearly $50 million in cap space. Smith's reworked deal ensures the return of the eight-time Pro Bowler when he could have been another player cut to clear cap space. ... RT Terence Steele received a second-round tender, giving the team the option to match offers for the restricted free agent. Steele is recovering from an ACL tear late in the season. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836732,Long March Madness run coming to a close for Jim Nantz,"Jim Nantz has seen his share of magical moments and sendoffs during a career that has spanned nearly 40 years. He could get one of his own as he prepares to call his final NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.Not only is the Final Four in Nantz’s adopted hometown of Houston, but with the University of Houston as one of the top seeds, Nantz could get to call his alma mater playing for a national title.The Cougars basketball program was a launching point for Nantz in what has been a successful career at CBS as the network’s preeminent voice of the NFL, golf and March Madness.“I wanted it to be a CBS year, but especially I wanted Houston to be my last dance for me and to exit college basketball stage right,” Nantz said. “It was truly through the basketball program — being the student public address announcer and while still a student later being entrusted to host the Guy Lewis television show, that was my entryway into television. I was just a kid living in the dorms. With a chance to possibly call my last basketball game with Houston playing for a championship, that would be amazing.”Nantz called a regular-season game between Houston and Memphis on March 5. He will also have Cougars’ first-round game on Thursday against Northern Kentucky. The top crew of Nantz, Bill Raftery, and Grant Hill will be in Birmingham, Alabama, for the first two rounds on Thursday and Saturday since top seeds Houston and Alabama have games there.Even though Nantz still has a deep affinity for the Cougars, you couldn’t tell by how he has called the games the past couple of years. Nantz called Houston’s Final Four run two years ago and has done at least one regular season game the past two years.“You could not tell, if you listened to that broadcast, that he had a vested interest whatsoever,” Raftery said of the recent Houston game, where Jamal Shead made the game-winning basket as time expired. “The love he has off the court doesn’t exhibit itself during the game. It is all about the 10 kids playing. I think it’s been that way since he started, and it will continue until he finishes in Houston.”Nantz and CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus agreed two years ago that this would be Nantz’s final tournament as the top announcer. Nantz started calling early-round games for CBS in 1986 and was the Final Four studio host for five years before taking over play-by-play duties from Brent Musburger in 1991.When Nantz signs off on April 3, he will have called 354 NCAA Tournament games, including 64 national semifinals and 32 championship contests.Nantz decided to step back from doing the tournament to devote more time to family. His 7-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter have spring break in March and, starting next year, he will have a six-week break between the Genesis Invitational in Los Angeles and The Masters for what will likely end up being his longest time off.With the NFL and golf, Nantz will still be on the road 38 out of 52 weekends. He plans on calling the NFL through at least 2033, which is the final year of CBS’ current contract with the league.As for Nantz’s final assignment, he has long said he hopes it will be the final round of the 100th edition of The Masters on April 13, 2036. It could also be Nantz’s 51st year he has been involved with the tournament.“I’ve loved it, and it has been so much fun. Something had to go, though. You’re never going to walk away from the NFL — it’s too big — and golf is deep in my heart,” Nantz said. “It’s been an amazing ride and a glorious part of my life.”Nantz still plans to attend future Final Fours, but as a fan. He got to experience part of that last month when he went to the Super Bowl. Since Fox had the broadcast, it marked the first time Nantz was at a Super Bowl where he wasn't working.“One of the great times of my life was sitting in the stands and getting to experience the excitement my children had watching the game, it brought me great joy,” he said, “I'm really looking forward to having that family time next year.”Nantz called 18 Final Fours with Billy Packer, who died earlier this year. Since 2015, he has been with Raftery and Hill.Raftery was Nantz’s analyst for his first NCAA Tournament game in 1986 when Duke faced Old Dominion in the second round in Greensboro, North Carolina. Hill led Duke to three Final Fours and two national titles, including the first one called by Nantz in 1991; he said he plans to try and enjoy this run as much as he did when he was a senior at Duke in 1994.“This month, it’s always special. It’s bittersweet because he’s our friend, our leader, our mortar, the guy I feel keeps this whole thing together,” Hill said. “He has done it so eloquently, masterfully and respectfully for so long it’s crazy. It’s still surreal that it’s coming to an end.”If Houston could make it to the national championship game, Nantz said it would rank up there as one of the top two moments of his career. His favorite remains the 1992 Masters when college roommate Fred Couples won the tournament.Despite what happens over the next three weeks, though, Nantz is not about to let the story be about him. He wants the focus to be on the tournament and the special moments that occur.“Every single one of these has its special preparation process when you advance or take a championship. We’re gonna have fun,” Nantz said. “All I can say is we’re not going to be maudlin. We’re gonna have a lot of fun.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836748,'What You Won't Do for Love' singer Bobby Caldwell dies,"Bobby Caldwell, a soulful R&B singer and songwriter who had a major hit in 1978 with “What You Won't Do for Love” and a voice and musical style adored by generations of his fellow artists, has died, his wife said Wednesday.Mary Caldwell told The Associated Press that he died in her arms at their home in Great Meadows, New Jersey, on Tuesday, after a long illness. He was 71.The smooth soul jam “What You Won't Do for Love” went to No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 6 on what was then called the Hot Selling Soul Singles chart. It became a long-term standard and career-defining hit for Caldwell, who also wrote the song.The song was covered by artists, including Boyz II Men and Michael Bolton, and was sampled by Tupac Shakur on his posthumously released song “Do For Love.”Other Caldwell songs were sampled by hip-hop artists including The Notorious B.I.G., Common, Lil Nas X and Chance the Rapper.Stories abound, many of them shared on social media after his death, of listeners being surprised to learn that Caldwell was white and not Black.Caldwell appeared only in silhouette on the self-titled debut solo album on which “What You Won't Do for Love” appears.“Caldwell was the closing chapter in a generation in which record execs wanted to hide faces on album covers so perhaps maybe their artist could have a chance,” Questlove said on Instagram.“Thank you for your voice and gift #BobbyCaldwell,” Questlove wrote.Chance the Rapper shared a screenshot on Instagram of a direct message exchange he had with Caldwell last year when he asked to use his music.“I'll be honored if you sample my song,” Caldwell wrote.“You are such an inspiration to me and many others,” Chance told him. He said in the post that he had never been thanked for sampling a song before and has “not felt broken like this at a stranger's passing in so long.”Born in New York and raised in Miami, Caldwell was the son of singers who hosted a musical variety TV show called “Suppertime.” A multi-instrumentalist, he began performing professionally at 17, and got his break playing guitar in Little Richard's band in the early 1970s. In the mid '70s, Caldwell played in various bar bands in Los Angeles before landing a solo record deal.Caldwell would never have a hit that came close in prominence to “What You Won't Do for Love,” but he released several respected albums, including 1980s “Cat in The Hat” — on which he appeared prominently on the cover wearing a fedora — and 1982's “Carry On,” on which he was his own producer and played all the instruments.His song “Open Your Eyes” from “Cat in The Hat” was covered by John Legend and sampled by Common on his Grammy-nominated 2000 single “The Light.”In the 1990s, Caldwell shifted to recording and performing American standards, including songs made popular by Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole, he loved in his youth.In addition to Mary, his wife of 19 years, Caldwell is survived by daughters Lauren and Tessa and stepdaughter Katie.___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836749,"Albania declares new national river park, backs airport plan","TIRANA, Albania (AP) — The Albanian government on Wednesday formally designated the Vjosa River and its tributaries a national park, starting with an investment of some $80 million (75 million euros) to stop wastewater being poured into the river.Authorities held a ceremony in a move aimed at preserving what they called one of the last wild rivers in Europe, which runs for 270 kilometers (170 miles) from the forest-covered slopes of Greece’s Pindus mountains to Albania’s Adriatic Sea coast.“Today we protect for ever Europe’s last wild river,” said Prime Minister Edi Rama. Albanian officials say the free-flowing Vjosa is largely untouched by development and human impediments in its course.Tourism and Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the national park would include more than 12,700 hectares (32,000 acres), including the 190 kilometer (120 mile) long Albanian section of the river, where more than 60,000 people live.The river and its surrounding areas are ecosystems of substantial biodiversity and home to over 1,100 species of animals. Two of the plant species and 13 of the animal species are assessed as globally threatened by International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN.The project will seek to address water and land pollution, waste management, and deforestation. Additionally, officials say, the National Park will create economic opportunities for local communities through responsible tourism, and help address depopulation.Kumbaro's ministry has signed an agreement with Patagonia, a California-based outdoor clothing company that supports environmental projects, to assist in the plan.“Standing on the banks of the Vjosa today, we are humbled to know that this exceptional river and its wildlife will be conserved forever,” said Patagonia’s CEO Ryan Gellert.Boris Erg, director of the IUCN's European regional office, applauded Tirana for the decision and offered to support its implementation. He also called on other regional governments to show similar ambition and help reach what he called the “vital goal” of protecting 30% of the planet by 2030.Albania's government has cancelled plans for eight hydropower stations on the Vjosa and its tributaries. Environmentalists say the dams would have caused serious damage to the river.Authorities now need to resolve what to do with a half-built hydropower station at Kalivac on the Vjosa.Environmentalists have also warned that a new, multimillion-euro international airport being built where the Vjosa River flows into the Adriatic near the city of Vlora would cause irreparable damage to the fragile ecosystems of protected lagoons that host flamingos, pelicans and millions of other migratory birds.Rama rejected the criticism, saying a “file as big as a mountain” has been prepared on the airport’s environmental impact, promising that the project “in no way is a threat to the ecosystem.” ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://twitter.com/lsemini",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836750,Son of Colorado mass shooting victim sues gun-maker Ruger,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The son of one of 10 people killed at a Colorado supermarket in 2021 is suing gun-maker Sturm, Ruger & Co. over how it marketed the firearm used in the massacre — following the litigation road map set by families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.The lawsuit — filed Tuesday in state court in Connecticut, where Sturm, Ruger & Co. is based in Fairfield — accuses the company of marketing its AR-556 pistol in a “reckless” and “immoral” way that promoted its killing capability. It seeks an undisclosed amount of damages.Nathaniel Getz, whose mother, Suzanne Fountain, was killed in the March 22, 2021, shooting at a King Soopers store in Boulder, filed the lawsuit — the first relative of the 10 victims to do so, said his lawyer, Andrew Garza.“We filed the lawsuit to both to seek justice for the family of the victim, but also to hold them accountable and to serve a preventative function as well, to protect future victims,” Garza said in phone interview Wednesday.“We believe they marketed it in a way that was meant to appeal to the militarization of young individuals, glorified lone shooters and, especially in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, we think they had a moral responsibility to do better,” he said.Getz and representatives of Sturm, Ruger & Co. did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Wednesday.The lawsuit comes only days before the two-year anniversary of the shooting as well as days before the two-year statute of limitations to file such a suit in Connecticut expires. Garza urged relatives of the other victims to join the litigation.The Colorado shooter, 23-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, is accused of opening fire outside and inside the store — killing customers, workers and a police officer who tried to stop the attack. Alissa, who has schizophrenia, has been ruled incompetent to stand trial. He is charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder.Investigators, who have not disclosed a possible motive, said Alissa passed a background check to legally buy a Ruger AR-556 pistol six days before the shooting.Lawsuits against gun-makers for the harm their products cause have generally been banned under a controversial 2005 federal law that shielded them from liability, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.The law, however, has exceptions. The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that gun-maker Remington could be sued under an exemption by Sandy Hook families over how it marketed its Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Remington's appeal of that ruling in 2019, and the company eventually settled with the families for $73 million.The case was closely watched by gun control advocates, gun rights supporters and manufacturers, because of its potential to provide a road map for victims of other shootings to sue firearm makers.Twenty first-graders and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012.The families of nine victims, as well as a survivor, sued Remington. alleging the company targeted at-risk males in advertising and product placement in violent video games. One of Remington’s ads featured the Bushmaster rifle against a plain backdrop and the phrase: “Consider Your Man Card Reissued.”The lawsuit against Sturm, Ruger & Co. claims the company's marketing materials included similar phrases such as “Anything else would be un-American.”The version of the Ruger AR-556 used in the Colorado shooting was technically a pistol, but resembled an AR-15-style rifle. Getz's lawsuit alleges the company made the pistol version to evade laws regulating rifles.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836751,Scientists create mice with cells from 2 males for 1st time,"For the first time, scientists have created baby mice from two males.This raises the distant possibility of using the same technique for people – although experts caution that very few mouse embryos developed into live mouse pups and no one knows whether it would work for humans.Still, “It’s a very clever strategy,"" said Diana Laird, a stem cell and reproductive expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. ""It’s an important step in both stem cell and reproductive biology.”Scientists described their work in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.First, they took skin cells from the tails of male mice and transformed them into “induced pluripotent stem cells,” which can develop into many different types of cells or tissues. Then, through a process that involved growing them and treating them with a drug, they converted male mouse stem cells into female cells and produced functional egg cells. Finally, they fertilized those eggs and implanted the embryos into female mice. About 1% of the embryos – 7 out of 630 – grew into live mouse pups.The pups appeared to grow normally and were able to become parents themselves in the usual way, research leader Katsuhiko Hayashi of Kyushu University and Osaka University in Japan told fellow scientists at the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing last week.In a commentary published alongside the Nature study, Laird and her colleague, Jonathan Bayerl, said the work “opens up new avenues in reproductive biology and fertility research"" for animals and people. Down the road, for example, it might be possible to reproduce endangered mammals from a single male.“And it might even provide a template for enabling more people,” such as male same-sex couples, “to have biological children, while circumventing the ethical and legal issues of donor eggs,” they wrote.But they raised several cautions. The most notable one? The technique is extremely inefficient. They said it's unclear why only a tiny fraction of the embryos placed into surrogate mice survived; the reasons could be technical or biological. They also stressed that it’s still too early to know if the protocol would work in human stem cells at all.Laird also said scientists need to be mindful of the mutations and errors that may be introduced in a culture dish before using stem cells to make eggs.The research is the latest to test new ways to create mouse embryos in the lab. Last summer, scientists in California and Israel created “synthetic” mouse embryos from stem cells without a dad’s sperm or a mom’s egg or womb. Those embryos mirrored natural mouse embryos up to 8 ½ days after fertilization, containing the same structures, including one like a beating heart. Scientists said the feat could eventually lay the foundation for creating synthetic human embryos for research in the future.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP) — The Patriots made their first big pickup of free agency Wednesday, adding free agent wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.Smith-Schuster confirmed the move in a post on Twitter saying he was “Excited for my next chapter in New England!”“I will give this organization everything I have, thank you for believing in me!” he wrote.A person with knowledge of the deal said it is for three years and could be worth as much as $33 million. They spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because it hasn't been announced.Smith-Schuster also expressed thanks to the Kansas City Chiefs, where he won a Super Bowl last season after spending his first five NFL seasons in Pittsburgh.“Thank you to Kansas City for the giving me the opportunity to come in and contribute to a Super Bowl, the most unforgettable experience of my life,” he wrote.Smith-Schuster's addition to the Patriots roster comes a day after they lost Jakobi Meyers after he agreed to a deal with the Las Vegas Raiders. Meyers, who received a three-year, $33 million deal from Las Vegas, was New England’s leading receiver each of the past three seasons.A Pro Bowler in 2018 with Pittsburgh, Smith-Schuster's injury limited him to just five games his final season there in 2021. He went to Kansas City looking for a fresh start and finished with 78 receptions for 933 yards and three touchdowns last season. All were second behind star tight end Travis Kelce.Smith-Schuster will now get another chance to be a top receiving option in New England, which has prioritized improving the offensive playmakers for quarterback Mac Jones. That process started earlier this offseason with the hiring of Bill O’Brien as offensive coordinator.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836754,"Mexican president floats fentanyl ban, faults US drug policy","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president called anti-drug policies in the U.S. a failure Wednesday and proposed a ban on using fentanyl in medicine — even though little of the drug crosses from hospitals into the illegal market.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has grappled in recent days with the issue of fentanyl, which has become a major security concern. López Obrador has denied that Mexico produces fentanyl, which causes about 70,000 U.S. overdose deaths per year.U.S. authorities estimate that most illegal fentanyl is produced in clandestine Mexican labs using Chinese precursor chemicals. Relatively little of the illegal market comes from diverting medicinal fentanyl used as anesthesia in surgeries and other procedures.But López Obrador said he would ask doctors and experts whether all use of fentanyl by doctors could be ended, as well, to reduce illicit use.“We are also going to ask that medical use be ended in the United States, as well,” López Obrador said.There have been only scattered and isolated reports of glass flasks of medicinal fentanyl making it to the illegal market. Most illegal fentanyl is pressed by Mexican cartels into counterfeit pills made to look like other medications like Xanax, oxycodone or Percocet.Many people who take those pills do not know they are taking fentanyl.On Tuesday, Mexico’s Defense Department said soldiers found over 1.83 million such counterfeit fentanyl pills at a stash house in the border city of Tijuana.The flood of illegal fentanyl has sparked calls in the United States to designate Mexican drug gangs as terrorist organizations, with some calls amid Republicans to use the U.S. military to crack down on the Mexican cartels.López Obrador has rejected calls to crack down on the cartels.“We are not going to be their servants,” he said of the United States. “We were elected by the people of Mexico to protect Mexicans.”“We have to help one another, but not submit to anything, much less failed strategies,” he said, adding the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration “has proved it can’t handle” the problem.Later Wednesday, Mexico's top diplomat claimed his country had seized the equivalent of about 6 billion fentanyl pills. That is almost certainly an exaggeration, given that much of the 6.5 tons of fentanyl the government has seized since late 2018 had already apparently been cut or diluted when it was found.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said those in the United States calling for tougher measures were “ungrateful, to say the least” for Mexico's efforts.Ebrard said Mexico would embark on a public education campaign in the United States to highlight Mexico's interdiction efforts. López Obrador said Mexico and the United States would also start a public outreach effort to educate people about the dangers of fentanyl.The Mexican president has blamed a lack of American family values for increasing fentanyl use. López Obrador has given no sign he understands that, because Mexican cartels disguise fentanyl as prescription medications, many Americans who take the pills do not know they are taking fentanyl.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836755,"James Gunn to direct 'Superman: Legacy,' aiming for 2025","James Gunn is directing a Superman film.“Superman: Legacy,” which Gunn also wrote, is also set for a July 11, 2025, he and his co-chair and fellow CEO of DC Studios Peter Safran announced Wednesday.The film, Gunn said, deals with the superhero's journey to make sense of both his aristocratic Kryptonian heritage and his small town, midwestern upbringing as Clark Kent.The legacy of Superman has been somewhat fraught recently. In October, Henry Cavill announced that he would be returning to the role starting with a cameo in “Black Adam."" Two months later, though, Cavill was back on social media with the news that he was out.“This news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,” Cavill wrote. “The changing of the guard is something that happens. I respect that. James and Peter have a universe to build.”Gunn and Safran were announced as the new DC leaders just a few days after “Black Adam” opened in October, replacing Walter Hamada, who had headed DC Films for four years. And Cavill as Superman was one of the casualties of the new guard.“It has been a long road to this point,” Gunn wrote on Twitter Wednesday. “I was offered Superman years ago - I initially said no because I didn’t have a way in that felt unique and fun and emotional that gave Superman the dignity he deserved. ... Then a bit less than a year ago I saw a way in.”Gunn also said the release date is the same as his late father's birthday.“He was my best friend,” Gunn wrote. “He didn’t understand me as a kid, but he supported my love of comics and my love of film and I wouldn’t be making this movie now without him.”Gunn has for several years been the rare director to bounce between both DC and Marvel films. He first came to DC after directing Marvel’s well-regarded “Guardians of the Galaxy” films. When the Walt Disney Co. temporarily dropped Gunn over old tweets that joked about rape and pedophilia, he jumped to DC and made the supervillain film “The Suicide Squad,” a kind of blockbuster do-over that followed David Ayer’s much-maligned “Suicide Squad.”He and the veteran producer Safran came aboard with several upcoming DC films already on their way to theaters, including “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” (March 17), “The Flash” (out June 16) and “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” (Dec. 25). And he still has “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" coming on May 5.“Superman: Legacy” will be the first film in the new iteration of the connected DC Universe, followed by Matt Reeves’ “The Batman Part II,” which is set for an Oct. 2025 launch.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836756,FBI raids home of ex-Maryland official as manhunt continues,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Two days after former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s ex-chief of staff failed to appear in court to stand trial on federal corruption charges, FBI agents raided his Florida home as the search continues for Roy McGrath.McGrath, 53, was declared a wanted fugitive after he disappeared Monday, leaving his attorney, Joseph Murtha, standing alone on the steps of Baltimore’s federal courthouse.Murtha said he believed McGrath was planning to fly from Florida to Maryland on Sunday night to appear in court Monday morning, but that didn’t happen. Instead of beginning jury selection in accordance with the trial schedule, a judge issued an arrest warrant for McGrath and dismissed prospective jurors.On Tuesday, the U.S. Marshals Service announced they were launching an interstate manhunt for McGrath, who was indicted in 2021 on federal fraud charges.He stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from the state, including a fraudulent $233,647 severance payment he obtained after leaving his position as executive director of the Maryland Environmental Service to become Hogan’s chief of staff in June 2020, according to a grand jury indictment. He also lied about working while he took multiple vacations and used state funds for personal expenses, the indictment says.McGrath resigned from Hogan’s administration in August 2020 after news of his unusual severance payment became public. Following his arrest, McGrath was released on bond. He was required to turn in his passport as a condition of release, his attorney said.McGrath later moved to Naples, Florida, where his wife, Laura Bruner, watched their home get raided by FBI agents Wednesday morning.Murtha, McGrath’s attorney, confirmed the search in a phone interview Wednesday afternoon, saying agents were likely looking for anything to indicate McGrath’s current whereabouts. An FBI spokesperson said agents “conducted court authorized activity at that residence” but declined to elaborate.A spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service didn’t respond to requests for comment. They issued a wanted poster for McGrath on Tuesday.Murtha, who was recently in contact with McGrath’s wife, said she has been cooperating with authorities since his disappearance. She was present at their house Wednesday when agents conducted the search.“She seemed upset and bewildered,” Murtha said.Murtha said he had no reason to believe his client would skip out on court. He said they had a substantive conversation about the case Sunday evening. McGrath was supposed to board a plane later that night, his attorney said.“I haven’t a clue. I didn’t see this coming,” he said. “This behavior is so out of the ordinary for him. Obviously his personal safety is a concern.”McGrath was appointed by Hogan to serve as executive director of the Maryland Environmental Service in December 2016. The state-owned corporation provides environmental services such as water and wastewater management to government entities and private clients. According to federal and state prosecutors, McGrath personally enriched himself by taking advantage of his positions of trust as the environmental agency’s director and Hogan’s top aide.He got the agency’s board to approve paying him a $233,647 severance payment — equal to one year’s salary — upon his departure as executive director by falsely telling them the governor had already approved the payment, according to prosecutors.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836759,Healthy Holmes gives Indiana women best March Madness shot,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Indiana center Mackenzie Holmes spent a whole year working so she could take one more shot at an NCAA championship.She committed herself to recovering fully from the left knee injury that limited her mobility and productivity last March when the Hoosiers fell short of their title dreams. She promised to come back a better, stronger player.After leading the Hoosiers through an unforgettable season, Holmes finally gets her chance to show everyone she's happy, healthy and capable of helping Indiana meet the lofty expectations that come with being a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.“I think it’s really cool to see different teams getting those one-seeds and just being in those top-10, top-five teams because in years past, it’s pretty consistently been the same teams,” Holmes said after the pairings were announced Sunday. “So to see how much the game has grown and all these different teams up there has been really cool.”Indiana is one of this year's intriguing top-line newcomers and Holmes, of course, is a big reason the Hoosiers are viewed as a legitimate championship contender.Since arriving on campus in 2019-20, the 6-foot-3 Maine native has been a double-digit scorer, a solid rebounder and a team-first player. As Holmes fine-tuned her all-around skills, coach Teri Moren increasingly structured her offense to run through the post.Not surprisingly, Indiana's ascent tracked perfectly with Holmes’ improvements.The Hoosiers jumped from a 10th-place conference finish in 2018-19 to fourth in Holmes' first college season. When Holmes became a full-time starter in Year 2, Indiana finished second in the Big Ten and advanced to the Elite Eight. Last season, with Holmes hobbled, the Hoosiers slipped to a fourth-place conference and lost in the regional semifinals.But in what has undoubtedly been the best of her career, Holmes responded by leading Indiana to unprecedented heights for one obvious reason. She's healthy.“I’m not who I was when I came back from my surgery last season,” Holmes said after a February victory. “I learned from it, and I think I’m better because of it.”Holmes was named a first-team AP All-American on Wednesday. She'd already earned her third straight all-conference selection, made her second appearance on the league's all-defensive team and was selected as the Big Ten's player of the year.She starts postseason play ranked No. 7 nationally in scoring with a career-best 22.3 points per game, second nationally in field goal percentage at 68.8% and second in the Big Ten with 1.9 blocks.Holmes and her teammates never measured success by individual stat lines and that perspective has helped them produce the best season in school history.Indiana (27-3) broke the program record for overall wins and tied the mark for conference wins (16). It finished the season ranked a program-best No. 2, set four new single-game home attendance marks capped by the first-ever Assembly Hall sellout as the Hoosiers celebrated their first regular-season conference crown since 1982-83.“A lot of the credit goes to Grace (Berger) and coach Moren and Mac, they built this program,” said Sydney Parrish, Indiana's 2020 Indiana Miss Basketball who tranferred back to her home state from Oregon before this season. “They're the ones that did this. They built it from the bottom, a program that wasn't much at the start.”They're not finished, either.On Saturday, Indiana hosts NCAA tourney games for the second straight season and the second time in school history. They'll face either Tennessee Tech (22-9) or Monmouth (18-15), who meet in Thursday's play-in game. Eighth-seeded Oklahoma State (21-11) and ninth-seeded Miami (19-12) meet in Saturday's second game.Could all of this have happened last season had Holmes not needed midseason surgery?“Once Mac got hurt, she wasn’t quite 100%,” Moren said last fall. “So I think in retrospect, when we look back at what could have been different — if Mac would have been 100% — could we have won a Big Ten championship? I think we could have.”The Hoosiers have never been big on reflection and they're not about to start now as they step into the national spotlight with Holmes and Berger, the scrappy fifth-year guard, playing the leading roles.Instead, Indiana intends to rely on its nimble centerpiece as long as possible.“I know there are a lot of good post (players) in the country, but there’s none better than the one that lives in Bloomington right now,"" Purdue coach Katie Gearlds said. ""If they stay healthy, if they stay out of foul trouble, there’s a good chance we see this team in Dallas.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

(AP) — Police officers in Oregon revived a 2-year-old girl suspected of overdosing on fentanyl this week, news outlets reported.The officers gave the girl CPR Monday and two rounds of naloxone, the life-saving nasal spray that reverses overdoses, Beaverton police spokesman Matt Henderson told The Oregonian/OregonLive. The girl regained consciousness a few minutes later and was taken to a hospital, where she was doing “much better,” Henderson said.A man who police believe is the toddler's guardian pulled into the driveway of a home in suburban Portland on Monday afternoon after he realized the unconscious girl had overdosed, Henderson said. He became frantic and someone in the neighborhood who saw him called 911.The man, who was not identified, is not in custody. An investigation is ongoing and criminal charges will likely be filed, Henderson said.Henderson told KGW that the fentanyl the 2-year-old swallowed was in pill form. He declined to release additional details.Drug traffickers are selling fentanyl made to look like prescription drugs, which can have deadly consequences, police told KATU.“Please don’t take anything if you don’t know where you’re getting it,” Henderson said. “Over-the-counter medication, make sure that bottle is sealed.”Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two milligrams of the colorless, odorless narcotic can be deadly for adults.“If it wasn’t for our first responders, who acted quickly, this 2-year-old girl would be dead,” Henderson said.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836761,Honduras ditching Taiwan raises larger geopolitical concerns,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Honduras' decision to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China is yet another sign of growing Chinese influence in Latin America.For decades the Asian superpower funneled billions of dollars into investment and infrastructure projects across the region. Now, as geopolitical tensions simmer between China and the Biden administration, that spending has paid off.Honduras' decision was the second foreign policy coup in a week for China, which brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to reestablish diplomatic relations last week.Now, Taiwan will be recognized by only 13 countries. But some of the few remaining in Latin America, like Paraguay and Guatemala, promised Wednesday to keep their support for Taiwan.Honduras’ minister of foreign relations, Enrique Reina, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hondurans “are grateful” for their past relationship with Taiwan, but that their economic links to China ultimately pushed their government to cut diplomatic ties.“These are political decisions. The world has been moving in this direction,” Reina said. “It is a complex decision, we understand, but Honduras’ foreign policy should seek to benefit the people. We believe that this step will benefit the country.”The Central American nation follows the steps of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic in turning their backs on Taiwan.Honduras’ announcement on Tuesday was a blow to the Biden administration, which has rather fruitlessly tried to persuade countries in the region to stick with Taiwan. Taiwan, a U.S. ally, has pushed for sovereignty at the same time that Chinese President Xi Jinping has insisted the island is firmly under its control.In that sense, Tuesday's announcement also exemplifies the American government is “losing it's grasp on” Latin America, said David Castrillon-Kerrigan, research-professor on China-related issues at Colombia’s Externado University.“For countries, like Honduras, not recognizing the government in Beijing meant missing opportunities,” Castrillon-Kerrigan. The United States “is definitely losing influence on every front, especially the economic front, but also diplomatically, politically and culturally.”It's left the island with a dwindling number of allies. Reina told AP that the Biden administration “must understand and respect"" Honduras' needs and decisions.But some, like Paraguay and Guatemala, remained steadfast in their support for Taiwan. Guatemalan officials reiterated the government's ""recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation that shares democratic values.""Over the past two decades, China has slowly carved out a space for itself in Latin America by pouring money into the region, investing in major infrastructure, energy and space projects.Between 2005 and 2020, the Chinese have invested more than $130 billion in Latin America, according to the United States Institute of Peace. Trade between China and the region has also shot up, expected to reach more than $700 billion by 2035.That investment has translated to rising power for China and a growing number of allies.In Honduras, that has come in the form of construction of a hydroelectric dam project in central Honduras built by the Chinese company SINOHYDRO with about $300 million in Chinese government financing.Meanwhile, in many countries, the U.S. government has not stepped in with similarly sized projects.While many view the investment as a positive step for nations that often struggle to pull together funds for development, some, like June Teufel, professor of Political Science at the University of Miami, worry about the long-term ripple effects rising Chinese power could have.Teufel said China is wielding that new influence as “a diplomatic weapon.”In many countries across in Africa and Latin America, Chinese investment has been marred by mounting debt in developing nations. In many cases, infrastructure projects can only be repaired by Chinese companies, racking up a higher bill, said Teufel.“It’s a little bit like the drug dealer saying to the potential customer, the first dose is free,” Teufel said. “It gets another country abandoning Taiwan, which is something it has been wanting to do for a long time, depriving Taiwan of all its remaining allies.”————Associated Press correspondents Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires and Sonia Perez in Guatemala City contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World

NIL, with little uniformity in how it is enforced across states, schools and regions, has widened that gap.So, the commissioners of the four major HBCU conferences — the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA), Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) — recently agreed to work more closely together in partnering with professional sports leagues including the NBA and NFL to increase the value of HBCUs and send more athletes to the pros.""We are doing it in collaboration knowing that we have strength as a collective,” said SIAC Commissioner Anthony Holloman. “We know when we play our conferences, compete, it’s a game, but on all other days we are rooting for each other.”McWilliams, who is in her 10th year as commissioner of the CIAA, a league composed of 12 HBCUs in Division II, has seen NIL make way for schools to help student athletes turn their creativity into money.The Gulf Coast Athletic conference (GCAC), an HBCU league in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, partnered with the NIL marketing company Athlyt and the media company Urban Edge network to create NIL deals for student athletes.“That’s helping us to now enhance a lot of things, our conference operations,” said GCAC Commissioner Dr. Kiki Barnes, “and what we’re able to do for our student athletes.”They're now finding those opportunities amid the backdrop of unprecedented attention for HBCUs.Men's basketball athletes from HBCUs Texas Southern and Howard will compete on the NCAA's national stage this week.The Tigers, who won the SWAC's conference tournament, will face Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Four of the NCAA Tournament Wednesday evening, with the winner advancing to face No. 1 seeded Purdue in the first round. Howard, winner of the MEAC conference tournament, will take on another No. 1 seed in Kansas on Thursday.

Kenyatta Cavil, a professor at Texas Southern who focuses on HBCU athletics, said Sanders' star power, coupled with the racial reckoning following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, allowed more resources to pour into Black schools.“Some people have their popularity, but (Sanders) openness to provide his thoughts, a sound bite, which everybody was driven to see 'What does this mean?'” Cavil said. “And it really shot HBCU programs into this atmospheric rise.”The SWAC conference, which plays in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), leads all HBCU conferences in total NIL earnings, ranking 21st in athlete compensation, according to data compiled by the NIL technology and marketing company Opendorse.Jackson State's popularity is a big reason for that. The school led the FCS in football attendance last season, drawing over 42,000 attendees per game.Sanders' son Shedeur, formerly Jackson State's starting quarterback before he transferred to Colorado, became the first HBCU athlete to land a partnership with the sports fuel drink Gatorade last year.“Obviously we haven’t gotten into the collectives that some of the major institutions have been able to garner,"" said SWAC Commissioner Dr. Charles McClelland, ""but it levels the playing field at least slightly, knowing that a student athlete could come to one of our HBCU institutions and still benefit from the name, image and likeness process.”McClelland said the introduction of NIL coupled with the rise of the transfer portal has brought more athletes to his league, which is also comprised of popular HBCU Grambling State and in 2021 added Florida A&M and Bethune Cookman University.Texas Southern, for example, has several transfers on its men's basketball roster, including its second-leading scorer John Walker III. Walker, who averaged 12.6 points this season as a graduate student, transferred to the Tigers after spending his freshman season at Texas A&M.“Even if you decide to go to a Power Five school straight out of high school, and you change your mind to say, ‘Hey, I think I want to play immediately ... I want to have these opportunities as a freshman or as a sophomore.’ The transfer portal now allows student athletes to do so,” McClelland said.Some HBCU conferences haven't been able to dedicate as much time to NIL.MEAC Commissioner Sonja Stills said her conference has partnered with influencers to educate athletes on the responsibilities of signing marketing deals, but overall, her focus is on upgrading facilities, providing more athlete scholarships and being able to fully fund Olympic sports teams.“It’s other things that we need to prioritize before we prioritize name, image, and likeness,” Stills said.Stills added that her league doesn't have the financial capital to compete in the NIL space in the same way as bigger schools anyway, which she sees as a negative affect for recruitment.“We don’t call up the alumni and say, 'Hey, I want $12 million for all the student athletes for NIL,” Stills said. “We can’t do that. So it’s the difference of widening that gap. Student athletes look at where they want to go to school based on what the NIL deal could be at that particular school. So it definitely puts us at a disadvantage.”McWilliams doesn't believe it's necessarily a goal for HBCUs to compete monetarily with their Power Five counterparts, adding that the playing field will never be completely even anyway.Holloman said the transfer portal is one of the toughest aspects in college sports to navigate because it has made it much easier for schools with larger budgets and better facilities to pluck the talent that they develop at smaller schools.But that is a reality that is not new for HBCUs.“The NIL, the transfer portal, who will it benefit the most, and who will it hurt the most?” McWilliams said. ""It could help us. But it could hurt us. But we’ve been dealing with that for a hundred and sixty-something years.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836764,7th-year guard Bolon finally makes NCAAs with Charleston,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — His teammates call him “Psycho D.” The D stands for Dalton, although no one would be surprised if it was for Dad.Dalton Bolon is 24, six years older than many of his College of Charleston teammates, and nearing the end of his college career. It's a seven-year journey that spans two schools, three degrees, countless teammates and now the NCAA Tournament.“Looking for an eighth (year),” the guard quipped Wednesday. “If there’s a way I can get an eighth, if you people could tell me how, that would be great.”Bolon’s NCAA eligibility finally expires at the end of this season. He’s counting on it not happening Thursday when 12th-seeded Charleston (31-3) plays No. 5 seed San Diego State (24-9) in the South Region.It will be the 155th collegiate game Bolon has played, finishing the last two seasons at Charleston after five years at Division II West Liberty in West Virginia. How did he get such an extended stay?For starters, he redshirted as a freshman at West Liberty and then played four seasons for the Hilltoppers. He earned an extra year because of COVID-19 and decided to make the jump to Division I Charleston as a graduate transfer.He broke his right foot three games into what should have been his final season and was granted a medical redshirt for another year. So now’s he’s closing in on his 25th birthday and his third college graduation ceremony.“They just call me ‘Old Man,’"" he said. “They say I’m like 30. Really? I’m young for my age.”He’s the butt of many age jokes — Bolon’s “got a mortgage to pay” and “kids back home” — and even provides fodder. He wears “dad shoes” when he’s not on the court, something wider and more comfortable for his still-sore foot.“I don’t care what anybody says,” Bolon said. “They see grandpas wearing these things. Like, grandpas are the smartest people on the earth. I don’t know why people don’t take their advice more often. These are so comfortable.”He’s admittedly “not as hip” as his teammates, which shows up mostly when they’re choosing music to play in the locker room.“But, honestly, we’re not crazy far apart,” he said. “I’m still in the same stage of life that they are, best friends with all of ’em, to be honest with you.”They look up to him because of his age and experience and admire him for his determination in returning from last year’s season-ending injury. He also does enough wild things to earn the “psycho” nickname.“He’s probably the craziest dude I’ve ever met,” teammate Jack Miller said.Bolon is steady on the court, averaging 12.3 points and 4.2 rebounds. He talks trash, makes 3-pointers and is willing to sacrifice his body to help the Cougars win.They’ve done that as well as anyone in the country this season — 10 in a row and 30 of 32 since getting blown out at North Carolina in early November.The Colonial Athletic Association champions have a chance to notch their first NCAA Tournament victory since 1997 — and with a starting guard who was born a year later and doesn’t want his college career to end.“It would be super impressive if he gets an eighth year,” Miller said. “I mean he’s really working the system at that point.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

Under the agreement, “beer” is defined as “ale, porter, stout, malt beverages and any other versions or combinations of the foregoing, including nonalcoholic versions.”In its complaint filed in federal court in New York, Grupo Modelo said the seltzers don’t fall under those definitions. It sought to halt their sale and force Constellation to pay damages.But in its court filings, Constellation, which is based in Victor, New York, said its hard seltzers fall under the “malt beverage” category, and that the licensing agreement gives it the right to develop and market Corona beverages.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan declined to dismiss the case before a jury trial, ruling in December that the contract's definition of “beer” was too ambiguous.In a statement issued Wednesday, Grupo Modelo said it was disappointed in the verdict and was evaluating its options.A message seeking comment was left with Constellation Brands.",2023/03/16,,World

They could. They have deliberated more than 20 hours since getting the case March 8. Deliberations will resume Thursday.Michael Boatwright, 28 and the accused shooter; Dedrick Williams, 26 and the accused ringleader and getaway driver; and Trayvon Newsome, 24 and the alleged second gunman, are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery. They face mandatory life sentences if convicted. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty.During the monthlong trial, prosecutors tried to link the men to the shooting outside Riva Motorsports in suburban Fort Lauderdale through extensive surveillance video taken inside and outside the store, plus the cellphone videos they took of them flashing $100 bills.Prosecutors also had the testimony of a fourth man, Robert Allen, a former friend of the defendants who said he participated in the robbery. He pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder. He has not been sentenced pending the conclusion of this trial. He could get anywhere between time served, meaning he could soon be released, and life, depending partly on how prosecutors perceive his assistance.Twice this week, the jury asked to review text messages from Boatwright, the accused shooter, from the day of the shooting. A printout from prosecutors shows that from the time he woke up about 10:30 a.m. until 3 p.m., about an hour before the shooting, he sent 17 to various people, including one about getting a car. Prosecutors say the SUV used in the shooting was rented from a woman through a phone app. He then stopped texting for about two hours.About an hour after the shooting, he sent a text saying, “Tell my brother I got the money for the new phone.” Minutes after that, he sent someone a screenshot of a news story saying XXXTentacion had been shot.Defense attorneys accused Allen of being a liar trying to avoid a life sentence. They also said prosecutors and detectives did a poor investigation that didn’t look at other possible suspects, including the Canadian rap star Drake — he and XXXTentacion had an online feud.XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, had just left Riva Motorsports with a friend when his BMW was blocked by an SUV that swerved in front.Surveillance video showed two masked gunmen emerged and confronted the 20-year-old artist at the driver’s window, and one shot him repeatedly. They then grabbed a Louis Vuitton bag containing cash XXXTentacion had just withdrawn from the bank, got back into the SUV and sped away. The friend was not harmed.Allen testified that the men set out that day to commit robberies and went to the motorcycle shop to buy Williams a mask. There they spotted the rapper and decided to make him their target. Allen and Williams went inside the shop to confirm it was him. They then went back to the SUV, waited for XXXTentacion to emerge and ambushed him, according to testimony.The rapper, who pronounced his name “Ex ex ex ten-ta-see-YAWN,” was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836769,N. Carolina justices could revive voter ID previously tossed,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A photo voter identification mandate first sought over a decade ago by North Carolina Republicans could be revived after the state Supreme Court reheard on Wednesday a case that led a different combination of justices a few months ago to strike down a voter ID law.The justices agreed last month to take a second look at the court's December ruling that upheld a trial court ruling that declared a 2018 voter ID law was unconstitutional, tainted by racial bias and designed to help Republicans retain their grip on power at the General Assembly.That ruling was penned by the 4-3 Democratic majority on the court. But Republicans have held a 5-2 seat advantage since January, the result of two associate justice election victories in November by GOP candidates.This latest edition of the court soon granted requests by Republican legislative leaders to rehear separate voter ID litigation and redistricting litigation decisions. Rehearing a case is an option for the court when someone contends justices ""overlooked or misapprehended” facts or laws, but it’s only happened two other times in the past 30 years, according to one justice.The justices held the redistricting rehearing on Tuesday. There is no timeline set for when the court will rule in either case. The justices could restore the 2018 law, which has never been used in an election, or direct trial judges to scrutinize the law again using different standards.During Wednesday's voter ID arguments, four of the court's five Republicans defended the ability of justices to rehear the matter, or expressed skepticism about rulings from a three-judge panel that held a trial on the law or the previous edition of the Supreme Court. Democrats and their allies say this week’s hearings happened solely on the partisan makeup of the court.A chief issue on appeal is whether the judges who struck it down relied too heavily on a 2013 voter ID law and a decision three years later by a federal appeals court that struck it down on the basis of racial bias.Attorneys for the minority voters who challenged the 2018 law have said the trial judges were able to consider the history surrounding the 2013 law as part of the broader circumstances in determining whether legislators acted in part with discriminatory intent.For example, the lawyers contend, dozens of legislators in 2018 who also voted in 2013 for voter ID likely knew about previous studies showing Black voters are more likely to lack qualifying photo IDs than white registered voters. But they pushed the 2018 law through anyway, said Paul Brachman, who represented the plaintiffs on Wednesday.Peter Patterson, an attorney for the GOP legislators, said the courts wrongly presumed the 2018 law was tainted as well. The evidence affirmed the law was constitutional by providing more ID options and offering the ability for people to cast ballots even if they lack an ID by filling out a form. Patterson also pointed out the measure had support from some Democrats, including a Black senator.“Factually, the record in this case does not support a finding of racially discriminatory intent under any potentially applicable standard of review,” Patterson said.Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr., a Republican, questioned whether under Brachman's viewpoint identical voter ID legislation could ever be approved.“I think of it like fruit of the poisonous tree,"" Berger asked. ""At what point is the taint removed such that this legislation in your argument could be passed by the legislature?” Brachman offered no bright-line answer, except that circumstantial evidence surrounding the law's passage would be reviewed.The lack of direct evidence from a legislator stating the 2018 law was passed out of racial animus or to disenfranchise voters “does nothing to undermine the correctness of the trial court’s judgment or this court’s ruling,"" Brachman said.Republicans at the legislature, which first passed a voter ID law in 2011 that was vetoed, say requiring identification at the polls will bolster confidence in elections, root out any voter fraud and is broadly popular. Voter ID critics say the incidence of such fraud is overblown. Thirty-five states request or require some ID at the polls, with about half asking for photo identification, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Berger is the son of Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, who is a named defendant in the lawsuit. The younger Berger wrote the dissenting opinion in December. Associate Justice Anita Earls, a Democrat who wrote the majority opinion, once represented litigants challenging the 2013 law in state court.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836770,2 Florida men guilty of participating in Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Florida men were convicted Wednesday of storming the U.S. Capitol during the January 2021 insurrection.Joshua Christopher Doolin, 25, of Polk City, and Michael Steven Perkins, 39, of Plant City, were each found guilty of felony civil disorder, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, according to court records. Doolin was also convicted of theft of government property. Perkins was separately convicted of assaulting a federal officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon and engaging in acts of physical violence while on the restricted Capitol grounds. Sentencing is scheduled for July 13.Doolin and Perkins were arrested on June 30, 2021, along with co-defendants, Joseph Hutchinson and Olivia Pollock, officials said. A federal judge issued bench warrants for Hutchinson and Pollock earlier this month after the FBI reported that they had tampered with or removed their ankle monitors and disappeared. A fifth co-defendant, Jonathan Pollock, has not yet been apprehended, and the FBI is offering a reward of up to $30,000 in exchange for information leading to his arrest and conviction.According to court documents, Doolin and Perkins joined with others in objecting to Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over then-President Donald Trump. A mob attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying election results for Biden over the Republican Trump, authorities said. Five people died in the violence.According to evidence and testimony presented at trial, Doolin and Perkins were on the west side of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Hutchinson, pushed from behind by Perkins, charged a line of police officers in an effort to break through the line, prosecutors said. As officers descended into the crowd to assist another officer, Perkins picked up a flagpole and thrust it into the chest of an approaching officer, authorities said. Perkins then raised the flagpole over his head swung it down, striking two officers in the back of their heads, officials said.Doolin and Perkins then advanced closer to the Capitol building, where Doolin acquired a Metropolitan Police Department crowd-control spray cannister and a U.S. Capitol Police riot shield, prosecutors said. Doolin eventually re-located to a Capitol building entrance passageway where he used the stolen riot shield to join the crowd of rioters pushing against the police officers inside the passageway in an effort to break through and enter the Capitol, officials said.Since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 999 people have been arrested for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, officials said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836771,Kansas 'school choice' backers struggle to get past governor,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Conservative Republicans in Kansas hoping to earmark state education dollars for helping parents pay for private schooling are struggling to win over enough rural and moderate GOP colleagues to get a law enacted, in sharp contrast to debates in neighboring states.The Kansas House on Tuesday approved, 64-61, a bill creating a program that would give thousands of parents $5,150 for each child they want to move into home or private schools, starting in the 2024-25 school year. And last month, the Kansas Senate voted 22-16 to approve a bill that would expand an existing program providing income tax credits to donors who contribute to funds granting private school scholarships to students who are considered at risk of failing in public schools.Republicans hold two-thirds majorities in both chambers, which is what would be necessary to override an expected veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. But moderate Republicans and many rural GOP lawmakers oppose the measures, leaving supporters well short of being able to overturn a veto.In the House, supporters of its “education savings accounts” bill hoped to push Kelly into accepting it by bundling it with her proposal to increase spending on public schools' special education programs by 14%, or $72 million, and by directing school districts to increase teachers' pay. Kelly has said repeatedly that she believes state education dollars ought to go to public K-12 schools.“I don’t really react very well to game-playing or bribery or whatever you want to call it,” Kelly told reporters after the House vote.The debate in Kansas comes with Republican legislators in at least a dozen other states pushing “school choice” measures. Iowa lawmakers approved a law in January to provide state tax dollars to parents who want to send their children to public schools. And a proposal to create an income tax credit to funders of private school scholarships appears to have enough support in the Nebraska Legislature to pass.But in Kansas, before a bill can go to Kelly's desk, conservative Republicans must themselves agree on the final version of a single bill. After the House vote Tuesday, the next step is negotiations between three senators and three House members.State Rep. Kristey Williams, a Wichita-area Republican who chairs a House committee on K-12 spending and is likely to be its lead negotiator, said the plan for education savings accounts has support in the Senate. But Senate Education Committee Chair Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican and likely her chamber's top negotiator said, “They gutted our bill.”Conservative Republicans across the U.S. have argued that states' education dollars ought to fund individual students' educations, not “systems.” They argue that many parents would remove their children from failing public schools if they could afford to and that public schools simply aren't a good fit for some children.“If we do school choice, not only do we increase the competition in the school space, we put the parents firmly in the driver’s seat,” Republican state Rep. Patrick Penn, of Wichita, said during a news conference earlier this week.But Kelly, her fellow Democrats and education groups argue that such proposals are designed to weaken public schools, especially when they divert their funds to paying for private or home schooling. Some critics also argue that there will huge additional costs when parents who already have kids in private schools take advantage.“I don't even know where to start,” Lauren Tice, a lobbyist for the state's largest teachers' union and a member of a local Topeka-area school board, said of the union's objections. “Nobody can predict what kind of fiscal impact this will have.”Moderate Republicans in Kansas have long been skeptical of school choice initiatives, but they've been joined this year by rural Republicans who don't believe those measure have anything to offer areas with few or no private schools. They said public schools often are the heart of small communities.“Frankly, the home schoolers in my district want the government to stay out of their living room,” said state Rep. Bill Clifford, a Republican from southwestern Kansas. “They were very resistant.”The House's measure would at first limit education savings accounts to students who are considered at risk of failing or who are at least one grade level behind in reading and math, as well as another 2,000 from working-class or middle-class families. The program would expand over three years so that students could be eligible if they are in a family of four with an income of up to $180,000 a year.After the House vote, Williams said that she hopes Kelly will have “an open mind” about its measure, arguing that it represents “meeting in the middle.”“This is really about helping disadvantaged kids,” Williams said.___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836774,Here is what's at stake in abortion medication case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a lawsuit that poses a threat to the nationwide availability of a leading abortion medication. The hearing comes as a conservative Christian group seeks to reverse federal approval of the drug mifepristone.A two-pill combination of mifepristone and another drug is the most common form of abortion in the U.S. and the ruling would affect states where abortion is legal as well as those that outlaw it. The case has raised concerns about court transparency and so-called judge shopping.Here's a look at some of the legal issues surrounding the case:HOW DID THE ABORTION PILL CHALLENGE START?Abortion opponents who helped overturn Roe v. Wade filed a lawsuit in November, asking a judge in Texas to reverse the approval of mifepristone.Research shows that medication-induced abortions are safe and effective, and they were approved by the Food and Drug Administration more than 20 years ago.But the group, Alliance Defending Freedom, argued in the lawsuit that the FDA process was flawed for mifepristone. It also took aim at more recent changes that have eased access to the drug.The suit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, which meant that it was assigned to U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a former attorney at a Christian law firm who previously wrote critically about Roe. He was appointed by former President Donald Trump and confirmed over fierce opposition from Democrats.WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?Medication is the most common form of abortion in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. It’s become more available as the FDA allowed it to be prescribed online and sent through the mail. Demand continued as states began banning abortion after Roe was overturned and more women traveled for access, or sought medication online.If Kacsmaryk reverses the approval of mifepristone, it could restrict access nationwide. Such a ruling would be an unprecedented challenge to the FDA, which approved mifepristone in combination with a second pill, misoprostol, as a safe and effective method for ending a pregnancy in 2000.That would be “nothing short of catastrophic,"" a group of 22 Democratic-led states said in court documents filed in the case. Another group of 22 Republican states filed briefs supporting the reversal. They argue the ability to order pills by mail undermines their laws banning abortion.WHY IS THIS IN THE HANDS OF ONE TEXAS JUDGE?Kacsmaryk is a federal judge and one of the major tasks of the U.S. court system has always been deciding whether laws and policy are constitutional. That means any judge weighing a case challenging a federal law or policy could make a decision that has ripple effects across the nation.Lawyers on either side of a case can appeal a ruling, however, and federal appeals courts can block or overturn a decision. In this case, an appeal would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which also leans conservative. It upheld Kacsmaryk's decision in another high-profile case requiring the Biden administration to continue the “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy implemented by Trump. The ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court.The case has also raised concerns about judge shopping, a term for litigants seeking to file cases in front of judges they consider sympathetic to their cause. It's a tactic that's been utilized by groups across the ideological spectrum, but the volume of cases filed before Kacsmaryk and other Texas judges has raised concerns among experts.WHAT SET OFF TRANSPARENCY ALARM BELLS?Kacsmaryk set the first hearing in the closely watched case on a conference call with attorneys. He also asked them to for the “courtesy” of not publicizing the upcoming arguments, according to a court transcript.He said he planned to delay making the hearing public until the evening before, making it difficult for many to attend because Amarillo is hours away from major cities. Such a delay is highly unusual in the American judicial system, where hearing notices are typically quickly made public and often scheduled weeks or months in advance.After news reports about the call, the hearing was placed on the public docket a day and a half before it was scheduled.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?A ruling in the case could come any time after the arguments conclude. A decision against the FDA would almost certainly be swiftly appealed by the Justice Department.A ruling reversing approval 20 years later is all but unprecedented, so it's not clear exactly what would happen next or how quickly access might be curtailed.

A spokesperson for Mercyhurst, a school of about 3,000 students in Erie, Pennsylvania, said earlier in the day the process of looking into Briere's conduct had just begun.Carson Briere apologized in a statement released through the NHL's Flyers.“I am deeply sorry for my behavior on Saturday,"" he said. ""There is no excuse for my actions, and I will do whatever I can to make up for this serious lack of judgment.”Danny Briere, who was promoted to run the Flyers last week when Chuck Fletcher was fired, said he was shocked to see his son's actions in the video.“They are inexcusable and run completely counter to our family’s values on treating people with respect,” he said. ""Carson is very sorry and accepts full responsibility for his behavior.”In a statement sent to The Associated Press and posted on social media, Mercyhurst said the actions displayed in the video falls short of the school's “belief in the inherent dignity of each person,” adding the school's ""tradition also reminds us that students and all people who make poor choices deserve opportunities to learn, change behaviors and atone for harmful actions.”Carson Briere previously was dismissed from Arizona State’s hockey club in 2019 for what the school called a violation of team rules.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836778,UN warns gangs consuming Haiti despite help for police,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The U.N.’s special envoy to Haiti warned Wednesday that the ongoing training and resources the international community is providing to Haiti’s national police force is not enough to fight increasingly violent gangs.Helen La Lime, head of the U.N.'s Integrated Office in Haiti, unexpectedly joined an Organization of American States meeting in Washington, D.C., saying it’s time to look at new partnerships as she called once again for the deployment of a specialized foreign force.“We’re not getting the job done,” she said. “We need to get down to the business of building this country back.”Powerful gangs have been infiltrating once peaceful communities in the Haitian capital and beyond, with experts estimating that they now control about 60% of Port-au-Prince. They have pillaged neighborhoods, raped adults and children and kidnapped hundreds of victims ranging from U.S. missionaries to a hot dog street vendor in a bid to control more territory, with violence worsening since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.“It is urgent for the OAS…to understand that the worsening security situation on the ground has reached its peak, and armed gangs now roam the country unfettered,” said Victor Généus, Haiti’s foreign affairs minister.Top Haitian officials including Généus and Prime Minister Ariel Henry have repeatedly sought international boots on the ground, a request first made in October that has gone unheeded by the U.N.’s Security Council, which has instead implemented sanctions, as have the U.S. and Canada.On Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters the sanctions have targeted “elite families in Haiti who are so responsible not just for funding gangs, but for destabilizing the political world and their economy in Haiti at the terrible cost for the Haitian people.”He said Canada also continues to help Haiti's national police force and other institutions, noting that previous outside intervention hasn't worked to create long-term stability for Haiti.“What is clear is there needs to be a fresh approach to Haiti that actually puts the Haitian people themselves in the driver seat on building strong opportunities and strong democracy for them,” Trudeau said.But top Haitian officials disagree.“Haiti does not have the means to resolve this crisis alone,” Généus said during the OAS meeting.Haiti’s National Police has only 9,000 active duty officers in a country of more than 11 million people, and officials say the department remains under resourced and understaffed despite international help.“It’s not enough to have weapons. It’s not enough to strengthen the National Police and Army,” said Léon Charles, Haiti’s permanent representative to the OAS and the country’s former police chief.At least 78 police officers have been killed by gangs, which have seized control of police departments in some areas and burned others, according to human rights activists.The spike in violence also has left tens of thousands of Haitians homeless and prompted a mass migration to the U.S. and other islands in the Caribbean, with an increasing number of voyages aboard rickety boats turning fatal. Meanwhile, officials in nations including the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands have cracked down on migrants and complained about the strain that they have placed on government services.“The security problem of Haiti pose a threat to the entire region,” Généus said.The OAS called the meeting to analyze what kind of assistance is needed and where so Haiti can finally hold long-awaited general elections.Before OAS members went behind closed doors to continue the discussion, La Lime said Haiti urgently needs a safer environment before elections are held.“Nothing is going to move unless the situation on the ground…changes,” she said. “Without more security assistance…they’re not going to make it.”The meeting was held as a delegation of U.N. officials visited Port-au-Prince on Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Ariel Henry and observe what they called “the scale and gravity of the humanitarian crisis” and provide support for humanitarian operations.Tareq Talahma, with the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said they were seeking $700 million to help at least 3 million Haitians out of 5 million who are in need of humanitarian assistance.So far, he said, funding pledges has not met expectations, ""and that is why we are here,” he said.“The Haitian people are very dignified people and humanitarian assistance is not the only thing they are waiting for. This community is looking for peace, security and protection, and this is the important thing and should be the priority.” Talahma said.___Associated Press reporters Evens Sanon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836783,Rule changes boost Bruins in regular-season record quest,"BOSTON (AP) — It takes a little bit of hockey history to put the Boston Bruins' run at a record-breaking season in context.The Bruins are on pace to surpass 62 wins, the NHL record set in 1995-96 by the Red Wings and matched by the 2018-19 Tampa Bay Lightning. Detroit did it in the first year of the current 82-game schedule. Before that, teams played anywhere from 22 games per season at the league’s founding in 1917 to 84 games from 1992-94.The Bruins also have a shot at the NHL record of 132 points set by the 1976-77 Canadiens, who played an 80-game season and didn’t have the opportunity to accumulate points for overtime or shootout wins.For more than 40 years, games were called a draw if they were tied at the end of regulation, and both teams received one point. Since 2005, games cannot end in a tie. Teams now play a five-minute sudden death overtime, followed by a shootout if necessary; the winning team gets two points, the OT or shootout loser gets one point and a regulation loser gets zero.“The game has changed so much,” said Murray Wilson, a forward on the record-setting Canadiens.It's important to view achievements in the context of their era. When Roger Maris approached Babe Ruth’s single-season mark of 60 home runs, MLB Commissioner Ford Frick suggested that record books note Maris was playing in a 162-game season, while Ruth had just 154 tries.More recently, NFL quarterbacks have taken advantage of decades of offense-friendly rule changes to obliterate marks set by their predecessors.And this season, when LeBron James broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA scoring record of 38,387 points, he did so with the benefit of the 3-pointer. The bonus shot was added in 1979 — midway through Abdul-Jabbar’s tenure.James made 2,237 3-pointers to reach the record.

I didn't really count,” Keller said.“How many do you think you'll throw on the 30th?” Shelton asked.“I have no idea. What's the 30th?” the pitcher replied.“Opening day,” Shelton said.“Ha ha!” Keller said, taking a moment to let it sink in. “Come on! Oh my god, dude!""Shelton offered a congratulatory handshake and the two hugged. Shelton told Keller how proud he was of the hard work the pitcher put in transforming himself from prospect to big leaguer.“Thanks! This is so sick!” said Keller, who requested another hug.Shelton then handed Keller a bottle of Champagne. “First of many. You and Clanc, go ahead and celebrate,” the manager said, referring to Keller's wife, Clancy.“Yeah, we will,” said Keller, who added, “I can't wait to tell my parents. This is cool.""After struggling in his first three big league seasons, Keller revived his career in 2022, going 5-12 with a 3.91 ERA in 31 games, with 29 starts. A brief stint in Triple-A last spring helped him refine a sinker that became an important secondary pitch during a promising second half. Keller went 2-5 with a 3.09 after the All-Star break.Shelton later told reporters it was a special moment breaking the news to Keller.“He was pretty fired up. This is a kid who was a very highly touted prospect and had to grind a little bit and discovered himself. It was a cool moment,” Shelton said. “Everybody aspires to be an opening day starter at some point in their career, but for young guys coming up, I do think it’s something they can look and say, ‘Hey, this is a guy who came through our system.'''Keller is the seventh different opening day starter for the Pirates in the last seven years, including JT Brubaker last season.The last Pirate to start consecutive opening days was Francisco Liriano, who took the mound first for Pittsburgh from 2014-16.KOWAR OPTIONEDThe Kansas City Royals optioned right-hander Jackson Kowar, a first-round pick in the 2018 draft, to Triple-A Omaha along with right-hander Max Castillo and infielder Samad Taylor as they continue to finalize their opening day roster.Kowar was drafted out of Florida as part of a wave of college prospects that Kansas City hoped would form the backbone of its rotation. But so far, only Brady Singer has emerged as a potential staff ace. Kowar, who allowed 17 runs in just 15 2/3 innings last season, coughed up three runs in five innings this spring.Castillo and Taylor were acquired from the Blue Jays in a trade for infielder Whit Merrifield lsat season. Taylor in particular had a good spring, hitting .400 with a pair of homers, and is expected to help the Royals at some point this season.IKF TO CF?With Harrison Bader expected to be out until late April with a left oblique strain, the New York Yankees are considering having Isiah Kiner-Falefa play center field. Manager Aaron Boone plans to start Kiner-Falefa in center field beginning Friday.“He’s worked in the outfield the last couple of days and I looked at some video of it the other day, just watching how his feet move and stuff,” Boone told reporters. “I think he’d be natural out there; the ability to move around, his speed and athleticism, his bat-to-ball.""Kiner-Falefa, who came into spring training competing for the job at shortstop, said it's ""just good to add some tools. Shortstop is obviously the second-hardest position on the field after being a catcher, so adding center field to my resume a little bit is good; just being able to play there in a pinch if something happens and the team needs me.”___AP Sports Writers Will Graves in Pittsburgh and Dave Skretta in Kansas City contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

It means most of the taunts will be replaced by cheers at Legacy Arena, especially for All-America freshman Brandon Miller. Hostile crowds have targeted Miller with taunts since his presence at the scene of a fatal shooting was made public.It will be an overwhelmingly crimson and white crowd at Thursday's game against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, (24-10) which advanced with a 75-71 win over Southeast Missouri State in a play-in game for its first NCAA Tournament win.“This isn’t technically a home game, but I sure hope that Legacy is packed out like a home game,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “And it’s been nice to play in front of our own fans and some friendly fans in Coleman. I hope we get a similar treatment here at Legacy.”On the court, Alabama (29-5) is among the favorites to win the national title, behind only Houston according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Off the court, the Tide are much less popular these days outside of their own giddy fan base. Case in point: The security guard accompanying Miller at the arena on Wednesday after some of the angry messages Oats said have been sent his way.""If you guys saw some of what I’ve seen sent his way, I think you would understand why that’s the case,” Oats said. “I don’t want to get into all that. The entire situation, as you know, is just a heartbreaking situation on all accounts.”Police tied both he and freshman point guard Jaden Bradley to the scene of a shooting that led to capital murder charges against then-Tide teammate Darius Miles and another man. Though neither have been accused of any crime or been held out of a game, police say Miles had left his gun in the back of Miller's vehicle that night.Through it all, Alabama has won both the Southeastern Conference regular-season and tournament titles with Miller leading the way.The Tide returned to the No. 1 ranking in The Associated Press poll for the second time this season. The first was followed swiftly by a loss at Tennessee.“We have been No. 1 during the season,” Miller said. “I feel like before we weren’t as prepared, but I feel like now we are more prepared for anything that comes our way.”The Islanders came in Thursday savoring the “shock the world” possibilities — if not the challenge of defending MIller.“Everybody in the country and most of the world will know who the heck we are if we beat them,"" Corpus Christi coach Steve Lutz said. “This is what you dream about when you're a little kid.

Again, we can practice with guys that have broomsticks attached to their hands. This is going to be new for us in some ways.”___No. 7 Missouri vs. No. 10 Utah State, at Sacramento, California 1:40 p.m. (TNT)Missouri guards Nick Honor and Tre Gomillion don’t need anyone to warn them about the quality of play in the mid-major conferences before the Tigers take on Utah State of the Mountain West.Honor began his college career in the Atlantic 10 at Fordham and Gomillion transferred to Missouri from Cleveland State of the Horizon League.“We don’t get caught up too much in level when it comes to basketball,” Honor said. “Even though we’re at the high major level, we still have the mid-major chip on our shoulder because at the end of the day we’re still underrated and slept on around the country. We don’t get caught up in that too much.

No, not the first-round stunner to 16th-seeded Maryland-Baltimore County in 2018. The Cavaliers scored just 39 points in a 26-point drubbing to Florida at the Amway Center in 2017.It remains the lowest-scoring game in the program’s tournament history.“Not a lot has changed in this tournament,” UVA coach Tony Bennett said. “You’d better be ready.”The fourth-seeded Cavaliers (25-7) expect a better showing against No. 13 seed Furman (27-7) on Thursday. The Paladins have won six in row and 12 of 13, culminating with winning the Southern Conference Tournament more than a week ago.Furman has a dynamic duo of super seniors – guard Mike Bothwell and forward Jalen Slawson – who could pose problems for Bennett’s stout pack-line defense.___No. 12 Charleston vs. No. 5 San Diego State at Orlando, Fla., 3:10 p.m. (TRU).If College of Charleston’s players can match coach Pat Kelsey’s energy and intensity, they should be in good shape in their first-round matchup against fifth-seeded San Diego State (27-6) on Thursday.The 47-year-old Kelsey is known for hanging on rims at practice to get his guys’ attention. But he divulged a little secret Wednesday.“People think I go up with my vertical leap,” he said. “I actually pull myself up on the net and grab that bad boy.”Players nonetheless raved about Kelsey swinging from the rim like he’s in a dunk contest.“Coach thinks he’s 7 feet,” guard Dalton Bolon said. “He’ll be walking around with his chest out and stuff like that. ... He’s got the most energy I’ve ever seen on every day.”The 12th-seeded Cougars (31-3) have won 10 in a row under Kelsey, culminating with the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament title. Their last and only NCAA Tournament victory came in 1997.Now they get a San Diego State team that landed in Orlando after midnight thanks to its charter flight getting delayed because of restricted air space regarding President Joe Biden and Air Force One.The Aztecs have lost four straight NCAA Tournament games, including the last two years as the higher seed.___AP Sports Writers Paul Newberry, Josh Dubow and Mark Long contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836789,Real Madrid beats Liverpool to reach Champions League QF,"MADRID (AP) — There was no historic comeback for Liverpool. Real Madrid's title defense in the Champions League rolls into the quarterfinals.Liverpool never really came close to overcoming its three-goal deficit from the first leg against the titleholders at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Wednesday, losing 1-0 to end its hopes of another run to the final.Karim Benzema scored late and Madrid advanced to the last eight for the third straight season with a 6-2 aggregate score following a 5-2 win from the first leg in England, when it rallied from two goals down early in the first half.Liverpool was trying to pull off something never done before in the Champions League — erase a three-goal loss as a visitor. Only five times the team that lost at home rallied in the second leg in Europe's top club competition.“You needed a special performance and we didn’t show a special performance,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. “In moments, it was a good performance, but Real Madrid was the team in control the whole game. Madrid was the better team and deserved to advance.”The only time Madrid failed to advance in the Champions League after winning the first leg on the road was in 2019, when it was eliminated by Ajax in the round of 16. It had won six of its last seven matches against Liverpool in the tournament, drawing another.“It was the type of match we wanted,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “It was difficult for them to press up front. The team played well, it was focused from the start.”Napoli defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 in the other round-of-16 match on Wednesday to join Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Manchester City in the draw for the quarterfinals on Friday.Benzema scored from close range after a pass by Vinícius Júnior in the 79th minute. The France striker, who had missed Madrid’s Spanish league win against Espanyol last weekend because of an injury, has scored 13 goals in his last eight Champions League knockout stage matches. He limped during the goal celebration but said afterward it was just a knock.“It was a complicated match, against a good opponent,” Benzema said. “We showed from the start that we wanted to attack, so it was a good match for the fans and we are into the quarterfinals.”Liverpool came out with an attack-minded lineup and showed its intentions early, with Darwin Núñez forcing Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to make a tough save on a breakaway seven minutes into the match.It was an open match at the Bernabéu and Madrid had its chances as well, with Eduardo Camavinga coming close to scoring in the 20th with a shot from outside the area that struck the crossbar after a deflection by Alisson Becker. The Liverpool goalkeeper also stopped a chance by Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior in the first half and another in the second in a one-on-one situation with midfielder Federico Valverde.Klopp kept trying to push his team forward from the sideline, but as the minutes passed it became clear it wasn’t going to be enough for the English team.Liverpool had managed a big comeback at home in the 2019 semifinals, rallying against another Spanish club, Barcelona. It won 4-0 after losing 3-0 at the Camp Nou to keep alive a run that eventually ended with the team winning the trophy.Madrid, which had beaten Liverpool in last year's final, played in its 300th Champions League game.The loudspeakers at the Bernabéu played Liverpool’s “You’ll Never Walk Alone” anthem at the end of the match as fans from both clubs applauded.“We are two heavyweights who meet each other quite frequently in international football and quite clearly we respect each other a lot,"" Klopp said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836790,Minnesota courts expand camera access to criminal trials,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota courts will allow greater audiovisual coverage of criminal proceedings starting next year under an order filed Wednesday by the Minnesota Supreme Court, but the rules will nonetheless remain more restrictive than those in many other states.Worldwide broadcasts and livestreams of the 2021 trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and his conviction for murdering George Floyd, which were allowed under special pandemic rules, were widely seen as a success. That led Chief Justice Lorie Gildea to launch a process that led to the easing, which takes effect Jan. 1.The order removed a longstanding requirement in Minnesota that both the defense and prosecution consent to camera coverage of most criminal proceedings, which effectively prevented it. The rules were eased five years ago to allow live and recorded coverage of sentencings. But trial judges will retain broad discretion to allow or disallow coverage on a case-by-case basis.The order, signed by Gildea, said the changes ""will promote transparency and confidence in the basic fairness that is an essential component of our system of justice in Minnesota and protect the constitutional rights and safety of all participants in criminal proceedings in the State.""Jane Kirtley, director of The Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota, said she would have preferred a presumption for allowing audiovisual coverage of all proceedings. But she said it's still a “huge breakthrough” in a state where much of the legal establishment has been firmly against cameras in the courts.“I really cannot say enough about what a giant step forward this is for Minnesota,” Kirtley said.The justices acknowledged that a special court advisory committee and victim advocate groups raised “serious and legitimate concerns"" about the risks and challenges of broader audiovisual coverage.“We conclude, however, that the modifications to the rules that we adopt provide important protections against those risks,"" the justices said. ""The modified rules prohibit a district court judge from allowing visual and audio coverage if there is a substantial likelihood that coverage would expose any victim or witness who may testify at trial to harm, threats of harm, or intimidation.”Video coverage of jury selection and pretrial proceedings will remain prohibited, along with witnesses or defendants who are minors, or coverage that might identify a juror. Some restrictions will also remain in place for criminal sexual conduct and domestic abuse cases. Camera coverage of adult crime victims will be prohibited unless they consent; minors who are victims can't be coveredBut the order also said judges' decisions to allow or disallow camera coverage should include the consideration that allowing it “in appropriate circumstances” can increase transparency and ""enhance the public’s understanding of, and confidence in, its court system.”Justice Anne McKeig dissented, citing opposition by groups for trial judges, prosecutors and crime victims. She also cited the lack of research on potential impacts on third parties — such as victims' and defendants' families — of ""deeply personal, embarrassing, or hurtful details"" that can come out at trial.""Consider the parent of an adult victim in a sexual assault case being forced to publicly encounter, explain, and confront the harrowing details of their child’s assault because the trial was livestreamed; or imagine the child of a defendant who has to endure their parent being constantly vilified in the media, or questions from classmates or co-workers about gruesome details from their parent’s case,"" she wrote.McKieg also said there's a lack of information on how the changes may affect communities of color — and public perceptions of them. She pointed out that the televised trials of Chauvin, and former suburban Officer Kim Potter, involved white defendants. She said there's no data on how perceptions would have been affected had those trials involved defendants of color.Kirtley said it will now be up to the media to make the case to judges that allowing coverage will serve the public interest.",2023/03/16,,World

(AP) — A federal grand jury has indicted a former University of Wisconsin-Madison student accused of threatening people at the school, prosecutors announced Wednesday.The grand jury in Madison indicted 32-year-old Arvin Raj Mathur on six counts of transmitting communications containing threats to injure other persons. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted on each count.Prosecutors have accused Mathur, a former UW-Madison anthropology graduate student, of using email to threaten graduate students, staff and professors in February. He threatened to “personally stalk and kill all of your loved ones” in one email and wrote in another that he would kill their children, according to the FBI.Prosecutors initially charged Mathur via complaint on March 8. He was arrested Friday at a Detroit-area airport after traveling from Copenhagen, where he has been enrolled at a university, court records and online jail records show.He remains in custody in Michigan pending an arraignment in Madison. A date for the proceeding hasn't been set yet.Online court records did not list an attorney for Mathur. The Detroit News has reported that Mathur’s court-appointed attorney is Amanda Bashi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836804,NY bank's demise: Contagion or a problem with the business?,"Signature Bank's collapse came stunningly fast, leaving behind the question of whether there was a fundamental flaw in the way it did business — or if it was just a victim of the panic that spread after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.There were few outward signs that Signature Bank was crumbling before the New York Department of Financial Services on Sunday seized the bank’s assets and asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. take over its operations. The FDIC will run it as Signature Bridge Bank until it can be sold.But leading up the the takeover, there were calls on social media warning depositors to get their funds out of the bank — and those were followed with a real-life frenzy of withdrawals. There hasn't yet been a public accounting of exactly how much money was withdrawn from the bank with a history of being friendlier than most in the U.S. to the cryptocurrency industry.“This is not about a particular sector in the case of Signature Bank,"" Adrienne Harris, superintendent of the Department of Financial Services, said at a media briefing this week. “But we moved quickly to make sure depositors were protected.”The department has described the New York-based financial institution as a “traditional commercial bank,"" but its two-decade history was certainly unconventional.Signature catered to privately held businesses and their owners and executives. It became one of the 20 largest banks in the country that way, based on deposits. By the same measure, it was also the third largest U.S. bank to fail, after Washington Mutual's collapse in 2008 and Silicon Valley Bank's demise last week.Founded in 2001, it was a major lender to New York City apartment building owners. Clients included former President Donald Trump and the family of his son-in-law and former White House adviser, Jared Kushner. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who also became a key Trump administration adviser, was on the bank's board of directors from 2011-13, before her father's run for president.She wasn't the only high-profile member of the board. Over the years, two former members of Congress also served on it: Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, and Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who was a co-author of the landmark 2010 legislation that overhauled regulation of the financial industry.Signature also made loans to New York taxi drivers seeking medallions, a part of the business that struggled as ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft took off and the value of medallions fell.Unlike most U.S. banks, it was also friendly to cryptocurrency businesses, becoming the first FDIC-insured bank to offer a blockchain-based digital payment platform in 2019.Partly because of crypto, the bank's deposits grew by 67% in 2021. But last year, as the crypto exchange FTX crashed and declared bankruptcy, Signature pulled back. Its deposits over the year declined by $17 billion, or nearly 17%. The bulk of that was because of what the bank called a ""planned reduction"" in crypto-related assets.In a January earnings release, Joseph DePaolo, then Signature's CEO, said the bank planned to expand geographically.“We see growth on the horizon,"" DePaolo said.Even as he made the prediction, the bank's stock was falling amid crypto struggles and a broader stock market slump. After hitting a high of $365 in early 2022, the bank's stock plunged to less than one-third that value by late February of this year. The freefall began this month until trading was halted on March 10 with the stock sitting at $70.Until it was shuttered, it had been a go-to bank for the crypto industry. Konstantin Shulga, co-founder and CEO of Cyprus-based Finery Markets, which connects cryptocurrency businesses with banks and other businesses, said that many of his firm's clients banked with Signature or Silvergate Capital, which last week voluntarily shut down its bank, warning it could end up “less than well capitalized.”Shulga said that having so few banks catering to the cryptocurrency industry is a problem.“Because of this concentration, both parties failed,” he said. “The clients failed because they were only forced to operate within these two banks, and the banks failed because they were not able to pick up more business from other areas to diversify.”The other problem, he said: Social media accelerated the run on Signature deposits.Twice in March, Signature took the uncommon step of issuing financial updates as depositors fled Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by regulators two days before Signature was.It said that as of March 8, 80% of its deposits came from “middle market” businesses including law and accounting firms, healthcare companies, manufacturers and real estate management firms.But it also shared had one key characteristic with Silicon Valley Bank, which was a major player in financing the tech industry: a high portion of uninsured domestic deposits. Signature Bank was fourth in that category as of the end of 2021, with nearly 90% uninsured. Silicon Valley Bank was second. Uninsured deposits are amounts above the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 per individual account. Only after the bank was taken over did the FDIC waive the insurance cap for depositors in both it and Silicon Valley Bank.In the meantime, the bank's reassurances did not slow the withdrawals, which picked up Friday and then continued into the weekend, until regulators stepped in.Frank, the former congressman, called it “an unjustified total shutdown” and said he believed it came about because New York banking officials wanted to send a message to banks to stay away from the crypto business. He said that things were stabilizing.The state regulatory agency that shut it down rejected that claim and pointed to what bank executives did as withdrawals continued to mount.“The bank failed to provide reliable and consistent data, creating a significant crisis of confidence in the bank’s leadership,” an agency spokesperson said in an email.A spokeswoman for the bank's former leaders declined to respond, but Frank said that the numbers were changing because the situation was shifting.An autopsy of the bank could play out in court.This week, a shareholder filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn claiming the bank and its executives misrepresented the facts with its two assurances this month that the business was healthy.""We intentionally maintain a high level of capital, strong liquidity profile and solid earnings,” Eric Howell, then Signature Bank's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement March 9, three days before the bank in its old form ceased to exist, ""which continues to differentiate us from competitors, especially during challenging times.”",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836805,US tribes get bison as they seek to restore bond with animal,"GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) — Dozens of bison from a mountain park outside Denver were transferred Wednesday to several tribes from across the Great Plains, in the latest example of Native Americans reclaiming stewardship over animals their ancestors lived alongside for millennia.Following ceremonial drumming and singing and an acknowledgement of the tribes that once occupied the surrounding landscape, the bison were loaded onto trucks for relocation to tribal lands.About a half-dozen of the animals from Colorado will form the nucleus of a new herd for the Yuchi people south of Tulsa, Oklahoma, said Richard Grounds with the Yuchi Language Project.The herd will be expanded over time, to reestablish a spiritual and physical bond broken two centuries ago when bison were nearly wiped out and the Yuchi were forced from their homeland, Grounds said.He compared the burly animals' return to reviving the Yuchi's language — and said both language and bison were inseparable from the land. Bison were “the original caretakers” of that land, he said.“We've lost that connection to the buffalo, that physical connection, as part of the colonial assault,” Grounds said. “So we're saying, we Yuchi people are still here and the buffalo are still here and it's important to reconnect and restore those relationships with the land, with the animals and the plants.”The transfers also included 17 bison to the Northern Arapaho Tribe and 12 to the Eastern Shoshone Tribe — both of Wyoming — and one animal to the Tall Bull Memorial Council, which has members from various tribes, city officials said.Wednesday’s transfer came two weeks after U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland issued a bison conservation order meant to further expand the number of large herds on Native American lands. Haaland also announced $25 million to build new herds, transfer more bison from federal to tribal lands and forge new bison management agreements with tribes, officials said.American bison, also known as buffalo, have bounced back from near-extinction in the 1880s but remain absent from most of the grasslands they once occupied.Across the U.S., 82 tribes now have more than 20,000 bison, and the number of herds on tribal lands have grown in recent years. The animals have been transferred to reservations from other tribes, from federal, state and local governments and from private ranches.Tens of millions of bison once roamed North America until they were killed off almost entirely by white settlers, commercial hunters and U.S. troops. Their demise devastated Native American tribes across the continent that relied on bison and their parts for food, clothing and shelter.The animals transferred to the tribes Wednesday descend from the last remnants of the great herds. They were under care of the Denver Zoo and kept in a city park before being moved to foothills west of Denver in 1914.Surplus animals from the city's herd were for many years auctioned off, but in recent years city officials began transferring them to tribes instead, said Scott Gilmore, deputy executive director of Denver Parks and Recreation.Gilmore said the land acknowledgement statement read out loud during Wednesday's ceremony underscored the historical importance of the area to the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Ute and dozens of other tribes that once lived in the area. But he added those were just “words on a piece of paper.”“What we're doing is putting action to those words for Indigenous people. Buffalo are part of the land, they are part of their family,"" Gilmore said. ""They are taking their family members back to their ancestral home.”To date, 85 bison from Denver have been transferred to tribes and tribal organizations. City officials said the shipments will continue through 2030.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836806,March earns Brighton 1-0 win over Palace with timely goal,"BRIGHTON, England (AP) — Solly March’s timely goal boosted Brighton’s bid for European qualification as the south-coast team beat big rival Crystal Palace 1-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday.March scored the winner in the 15th minute — on March 15 — to move Brighton level on points with sixth-place Liverpool with a game in hand.It also provided a double celebration for Brighton owner Tony Bloom, after his horse Energumene won the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival hours earlier.The problems are mounting for 12th-place Palace, though, after its winless run stretched to 11 matches.Palace manager Patrick Vieira was forced to hand teenage goalkeeper Joe Whitworth a professional debut with regular No. 1 Vicente Guaita and deputy Sam Johnstone both injured.At 19 years and 15 days, Whitworth was the youngest goalkeeper to appear in a Premier League game since Ben Alnwick played for Sunderland in December 2005.The former Palace ballboy made a nervous start with an unconvincing headed clearance outside the area, but Brighton could not punish him.Jason Steele was the busier keeper in the opening stages, despite Palace not managing a shot on target in their last three matches.Wilfried Zaha ended that poor run by testing Steele with an angled drive. Steele saved with his knee after Joachim Andersen’s through-ball split the Brighton defense and sent Michael Olise through on goal, before he palmed Odsonne Edouard’s drive away.Whitworth got his first decent touch of the ball when he held Kaoru Mitoma’s long-range effort but he was beaten moments later when Mitoma sent March through to find the net with a composed finish.The second half was delayed after a floodlight failure momentarily plunged the stadium into darkness and referee Peter Bankes then stopped the match, apparently because his headset was no longer working.Once play resumed, Whitworth highlighted his potential with a stunning reaction save to keep out Alexis Mac Allister’s header at a corner.Mac Allister almost added a second with a mazy run and shot which flew just wide, but in the end Brighton had to hang on to March’s goal for nine minutes of stoppage time.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836812,Sharp drop in illegal border crossings continues in February,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A sharp drop in illegal border crossings along the Southwest border that started in January after the Biden administration announced stricter immigration measures continued into February, the administration announced Wednesday.The data released by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection paints a picture of who is attempting to enter the country at a time of intense political controversy with Republicans seeing immigration as a potent issue with voters and accusing President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of not doing enough to secure the southern border.U.S. Border Patrol officials encountered migrants 128,877 times trying to cross the border in February between the legal border crossings. That's about the same as January's number — 128,913 — and is the lowest number of encounters per month since February 2021, the agency said.The numbers of encounters doesn't necessarily equate to individual people since some migrants try repeatedly to cross the border. The agency said about 25% of those encountered in February were repeat encounters meaning that at some time during the last 12 months they'd been detained by U.S. officials as they tried to enter the country.In comparison, U.S. officials stopped migrants 221,693 times between the ports of entry along the Mexican border in December.Then in early January the administration announced a new policy in which Mexico would take back Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans under a pandemic-era rule that denies migrants the right to seek asylum as part of an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The number of migrants intercepted from those four countries plunged after the new policy went into effect and remained low during February.At the same time they announced the new policy, the U.S. also agreed to admit up to 30,000 people a month from those four nations on a process called humanitarian parole if they applied online, entered at an airport and found a financial sponsor. According to the CBP figures, 22,755 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans were paroled into the country through that process in February. Humanitarian parole differs from other immigration pathways in large part because it's temporary — often only for a year or two — and doesn't provide a long-term pathway to live in the U.S.The administration has also proposed generally denying asylum to anyone who travels though another country on their way to the U.S. without seeking protection there — effectively all non-Mexicans who appear at the U.S. southern border. That proposal, which has met with stiff criticism from immigration rights advocates, is currently in a 30-day comment period before it is expected to go into effect when Title 42 expires in May.According to the CBP report, drug seizures were also up 6% in February compared to January. Fentanyl seizures specifically were up 58%.__Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836813,"Business Highlights: Bank runs, government investigations","___Bank runs used to be slow. The digital era sped them upNEW YORK (AP) — What made the failure of Silicon Valley Bank unique compared to past failures of large banks was how quickly it collapsed. Last Wednesday afternoon, the $200 billion bank announced a plan to raise fresh capital; by Friday morning it was insolvent and under government control. Regulators, policymakers and bankers are looking at the role that digital messaging and social media may have played in the collapse, and whether banks are entering an age when the psychological behavior behind a bank run — mass fear from depositors of losing their savings — may be amplified and go viral quicker than bank officers and regulators can successfully respond.___Justice Dept, SEC probing collapse of Silicon Valley BankWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. That’s according to what two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The people said the investigations – which are separate inquiries – are in the early stages and will also examine the actions of the bank’s senior executives. The Justice Department’s investigation involves federal prosecutors in California, along with prosecutors involved in fraud cases. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss the specific details of the ongoing investigations and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.___Bank fears spread to Europe, drag down shares of big lendersGENEVA (AP) — Fears about the world banking system spread to Europe as shares in the globally connected Swiss bank Credit Suisse plunged. The steep drop on Wednesday dragged down other major European lenders in the wake of bank failures in the United States. At one point, Credit Suisse shares lost more than a quarter of their value. The stock price hit a record low after the bank’s biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — told news outlets that it would not invest more money into the Swiss lender. Credit Suisse was beset by problems long before the U.S. banks collapsed.___Wall Street falls on new bank fears, bond yields plungeNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell amid fresh worries about the banking sector, although Wall Street more than halved its losses by the closing bell. The S&P 500 closed with a decline of 0.7%. The Dow posted a slightly steeper drop, while the Nasdaq rose slightly thanks to late gains in tech shares. Treasury yields plunged following several reports on the economy that were weaker than expected. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse sparked a broad selloff early Wednesday after its shares fell to a new low. Markets pared some of their losses as the Swiss National Bank said it could provide some assistance to Credit Suisse if needed.___US wholesale inflation fell last month on lower food costsWASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale price increases in the United States slowed sharply last month as food costs declined, a sign that inflationary pressures may be easing. From January to February, the government’s producer price index fell 0.1%, after a 0.3% rise from December to January, which was revised sharply lower. Compared with a year ago, wholesale prices rose 4.6%, a big drop from the 5.7% annual increase in January.___What can ChatGPT maker’s new AI model GPT-4 do?LONDON (AP) — The company behind the ChatGPT chatbot has rolled out its latest artificial intelligence model, called GPT-4, in the next step for a technology that’s caught the world’s attention. San Francisco-based OpenAI says GPT-4 is more reliable, creative and can handle “more nuanced instructions” than its predecessor, GPT-3.5, which is the system that ChatGPT was built on. GPT-4 can be fed both text and images that it uses to come up with answers. Unlike ChatGPT’s fixed tone, users can customize GPT-4 by asking for responses in the style of a Shakespearean pirate, for example. OpenAI have warned users to be careful, saying GPT-4 is “still not fully reliable” because it “hallucinates” facts and makes reasoning errors.___NY bank’s demise: Contagion or a problem with the business?NEW YORK (AP) — A New York-based bank’s demise was stunningly fast. The state regulators who shut down Signature Bank on Sunday said they were concerned about a frenzy of withdrawals after California’s Silicon Valley Bank failed two days earlier. But there may have been some underlying problems for the Signature Bank, too, including one of the highest ratios of uninsured deposits in the nation. Signature was big in the cryptocurrency world. It also made loans to New York City apartment building owners. And it was politically connected, with Ivanka Trump and two former members of Congress sitting on its board of directors over the years.___Retail sales dip 0.4% in February after buying burst in Jan.NEW YORK (AP) — America’s consumers trimmed their spending in February after a buying burst in January, underscoring the volatility of the economic environment. The government said Wednesday that retail sales slipped 0.4% after jumping a revised 3.2% in January, helped by an increase in auto sales. Retail sales were down in November and December, the critical holiday period. The February retail sales figure was dragged down by a 1.8% drop in auto sales as well as declines in restaurants and stores selling furniture and clothing. Excluding autos, sales slipped 0.1% from January, according to the Commerce Department. But shoppers spent more online and at electronics stores, health and beauty stores and food retailers, according to the report.___First major US railroad merger in 2 decades will go forwardThe first major railroad merger in more than two decades, one that would link the United States, Canada and Mexico, is being approved by federal regulators. Canadian Pacific’s $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern will combine the two smallest of the nations seven major railroads after an arduous two-year review from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, released Wednesday. The bar for railroad mergers in the U.S. was raised substantially at the start of the century after a couple problematic tie-ups that snarled rail traffic for weeks. Safety was also at the forefront after the fiery derailment in Ohio last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836814,Scheyer leads surging Duke into March Madness for 1st time,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — New look, same expectations for success.A season removed from reaching the Final Four for a 13th time under Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski, Duke not only is in the NCAA Tournament again but appears to be peaking at the right time with first-year coach Jon Scheyer at the helm.The fifth-seeded Blue Devils (26-8) face No. 12 seed Oral Roberts (30-4) in the opening round of the East Regional on Thursday night, eager to build on a rich March Madness legacy Krzyzewski fashioned over more than four decades.“I’ve been fortunate now, I think this is number 12 that I’ve been a part of, and each time it’s so special. It’s something I will never, ever, ever take for granted,” the 35-year-old Scheyer, a former Duke player and assistant who helped Krzyzewski win two of the legendary coach’s five national championships, said Wednesday.“I just promised myself as I made this transition to being a head coach just to be in the moment fully this whole year,” Scheyer added. “And that’s when things weren’t as good as I wanted them to be, that’s when we are playing great, and that’s in preparation for any game you want to play really well.”Hampered by injuries for prolonged stretches of the season, the Blue Devils hit their stride late and enter March Madness on a roll after winning the ACC Tournament. They've won nine straight games — the third-longest winning streak Duke has ever carried into the NCAA Tournament.Scheyer has had use of his full complement of players for the past 10 games. The team is 18-1 overall in outings in which the full roster has been available.Not that it will make a difference against Oral Roberts, the Summit League regular-season and conference tournament champions.The high-scoring Golden Eagles are led by 6-foot senior guard Max Abmas, who two years ago helped Oral Roberts make a surprising run to the Sweet 16 with wins over Ohio State and Florida, who were seeded second and seventh, respectively.Duke’s No. 5 seeding is its highest since 2007.Scheyer is well aware of the mystique regarding 5-12 matchups in the tournament.“You’re going to see a lot of opinions, predictions. And I’ve been on both ends of the spectrum, where one, they pick you to win the whole thing or they pick you to win where that doesn’t happen, or it’s the opposite where nobody thinks you have a chance,” the Duke coach said.“It doesn’t matter what’s happened before. Any seed in the history of the tournament has lost. So nobody is safe going into this. You can’t take anything for granted. You have to focus on one game,” Scheyer added. “We know when you get a 12 seed, a lot of the time you have a champion. Oral Roberts, they’re champions of their league. ... They haven’t lost since Jan. 9. They’re used to winning.”Abmas is averaging 22.2 points and Oral Roberts’ only losses this season were on the road at Houston, Saint Mary’s, Utah State and New Mexico. The confident The Golden Eagles were the only team in the nation to go undefeated in conference play.“Being here a couple of years ago, kind of understanding everything and what comes with it,” helps, Abmas said.“We’re not complacent,” backcourt mate Issac McBride said. “We want to keep advancing, so we want to do everything it takes to be able to take those steps.”FRESH START?In Thursday’s only other East Regional matchup, fourth-seeded Tennessee (23-10) faces No. 13 seed Louisiana-Lafayette (26-7), also in Orlando.The Volunteers struggled down the stretch, especially after losing point guard Zakai Zeigler to a torn ACL in the opening minutes of a win over Arkansas in the final week of regular season. They’ve won nine of 10 previous matchups with the Ragin’ Cajuns, with Louisiana’s lone victory coming in 1985.Tennessee began the season with high expectations. The Vols are one of two teams in the NCAA field of 68 that has multiple victories over No. 1 seeds. In addition to beating Alabama and Kansas, they also defeated No. 2 seed Texas in January.After losing two of three entering the tournament, Thursday night is an opportunity for a fresh start.“I would say a lot of teams have gone through some ups and downs this year, and we’re no different. ... But right now, we’ve got to rely on the work, everything that we’ve put into our program,” coach Rick Barnes said. “We believe in it and know that if we come out and compete ... at the highest level, we feel like we can give ourselves a chance to win.”IT'S BEEN AWHILELouisiana earned its first berth in March Madness since 2014 by winning the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. The ragin' Cajuns finished second in the league during the regular season, and their 26 wins are the second-most they had under coach Bob Marlin.It's the school's seventh appearance in the national championship tournament. It's lone win was a four-point win over Oklahoma in 1992.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.",2023/03/16,,World

Frankfurt fans rejected their allocation of 2,700 tickets meaning the away end of the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium was completely empty.On the field, Osimhen has lit up Napoli's season with 23 goals in 28 appearances and the Nigerian striker was untouchable again here, opening the scoring with an athletic looping header that left Kevin Trapp stranded in the Frankfurt goal.Limited only to a few half chances without their own suspended striker Kolo Muani, Frankfurt never got started against the runaway Serie A leaders. Luciano Spaletti's side doubled their lead through Osimhem, who finished a slick Napoli move from close range – injurying his wrist in the process.Napoli were awarded a soft penalty when Djibril Sow was penalized for a trip, and Polish midfielder Piotr Zielinski made no mistake from the spot – firing down the middle and beyond Trapp and completing a comfortable path into the final eight, where they will be one of three Italian sides still left in the competition alongside AC and Inter Milan.Frankfurt's exit from the competition comes after Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig lost to English opposition, leaving Bayern Munich as Germany's sole representative.",2023/03/15,,

Andrew Cuomo who accused him of sexual harassment in a federal lawsuit filed a separate lawsuit Wednesday against the state.Charlotte Bennett filed a complaint in state court in Manhattan saying her former employer, the state of New York, is liable for Cuomo’s sexual harassment and for the actions of his top aides, who failed to take corrective action once she reported it.Bennett already filed a federal lawsuit in September against Cuomo and three top aides. In both suits, she says she was sexually harassed and retaliated against.Bennett, who turned 25 when she worked for Cuomo, claims he subjected her to invasive questions about her personal life and sexual relationships. He once told her he was “lonely” and wanted a girlfriend who lived in Albany, according to the state lawsuit.Cuomo has denied the allegations.When Bennett reported the harassment, top aides to the governor transferred her to a lesser job in health policy instead of taking appropriate measures, she said. She eventually resigned, according to the suit.“She experienced near-debilitating anxiety, symptoms of depression, and began suffering from a chronic neurological disorder as a direct result of Governor Cuomo’s sexual harassment of her and the hasty and disorganized transfer of her to the health policy team,” according to the complaint filed Wednesday.An email seeking comment was sent to the attorney general's office, which defends the state against lawsuits.In February 2021, Bennett became the second woman to come forward with accusations against Cuomo, playing a critical role in his downfall.Cuomo resigned that August after the attorney general released the results of an investigation t hat concluded Cuomo had sexually harassed at least 11 women, including Bennett.Cuomo has denied those allegations and criticized the attorney general’s report.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836822,Arkansas lawmakers send Gov. Sanders school bathroom bill,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Transgender people at Arkansas public schools would not be able to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity under a bill lawmakers sent to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday.The bill approved by the majority-Republican House applies to multi-person restrooms and locker rooms at public schools and charter schools serving prekindergarten through 12th grades. The House, which approved an earlier version of the bill last month, passed the bill on a 77-15 vote without any debate.The proposal is among dozens of bills proposed this year targeting transgender people, who have also faced increasingly hostile rhetoric at statehouses.Teachers, principals and superintendents who violate the measure could face fines from a state panel, and parents could file lawsuits to enforce the restriction.Sanders' office did not say whether the Republican governor planned to sign the legislation. Alexa Henning, a spokeswoman, said Sanders “would sign a law that focuses on protecting and educating our kids, not indoctrinating them.""Opponents of the bill said the restriction would further marginalize and risk transgender youth at schools, and urged Sanders to veto it.""By requiring schools to police student’s restroom usage and forcing trans youth to use restrooms that do not align with their gender identity, this bill creates a hostile and discriminatory environment that could lead to exclusion, harassment, and bullying,"" Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, said in a statement.Similar laws have been enacted in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the Oklahoma and Tennessee restrictions.The bill advanced as lawmakers are considering a more far-reaching bathroom bill that would make it a crime for a transgender person to use a public restroom corresponding with their gender identity.Critics have said that bill would be the most extreme in the country and goes further than a bathroom law North Carolina enacted in 2016 and repealed a year later following widespread protests.The House approved the school bathroom bill two days after Sanders signed legislation that would make it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming medical care for children.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836823,"Texas built strong bond to survive turmoil, hit March stride","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Texas Longhorns have only one player who has been around longer than two years, a unique roster shaped by super seniors who showed up through the transfer portal and true freshmen who came to the program the traditional way.Still, try finding a team in this NCAA Tournament with better chemistry.Strong relationships can form quickly, and the Longhorns sure needed theirs to be secure on Dec. 12. That's when former coach Chris Beard was arrested on a felony domestic violence charge. He was fired three weeks later when the school determined he was “unfit” to lead the program. The charge has since been dropped against Beard, who was hired this week as the new coach at Mississippi.“I think a lot of people like to go back to December because of what transpired, but this group and the specialness of this team and our bond did start in the summertime,” leading scorer Marcus Carr said. “It started with us working together.”Interim coach Rodney Terry saw it, too.“We spent a lot of time encouraging our guys to spend time with themselves off the court, and it wasn't really — to be honest — coach-driven. It was player-driven in terms of those guys spending time with one another off the court, and I think when you’re able to do that, that carries over into the start of your season,” Terry said on Wednesday, when the No. 2 seed Longhorns were preparing to play Colgate in a first-round game in the Midwest Region.Carr, Timmy Allen, Sir'Jabari Rice, Christian Bishop and Brock Cunningham are all in their fifth or sixth year of college basketball. Dylan Disu is in his fourth year, giving the Longhorns six players 22 and older. Carr (Pittsburgh, Minnesota), Allen (Utah), Rice (New Mexico State), Bishop (Creighton) and sophomore Tyrese Hunter (Iowa State) all transferred to Texas to play for Beard. The Longhorns are loaded with the depth and talent to reach the Final Four for the first time since 2003.“Twenty years from now, I will still be connected with these guys and we will always remember this moment, because we faced so much this year but we stuck together,” freshman Dillon Mitchell said. ""This is something I’m blessed to be a part of.”The Big 12 Tournament champion Longhorns (26-8) will have their hands full with a Colgate team that gave Wisconsin a first-round scare as a No. 14 seed last year. The No. 15 seed Red Raiders (26-8) are the second-best shooting team in the nation at 51.4% behind only Gonzaga.WILL SASSER BE BACK?Houston's leading scorer Marcus Sasser will be a game-time decision when the No. 1 seed Cougars face Northern Kentucky in Birmingham, Alabama.Averaging 17.1 points per game, Sasser suffered a groin injury last Saturday in the semifinals of the American Athletic Conference tournament against Cincinnati. He didn’t play the following day against Memphis, which upset the Cougars (31-3) to claim the AAC championship.Houston's resume was secure enough for the top seed despite the loss, and now the spotlight is on Sasser's recovery. Even with his uncertain status, the Cougars are an 18½-point favorite on Thursday night against No. 16 seed Norse, according to FanDuel Sportsbook odds.Coach Kelvin Sampson could play it safe this weekend and give Sasser some more rest. If the Cougars win, they'll face the Iowa-Auburn winner.“He did some things today. Broke a sweat. Did some shooting drills. He didn’t go full speed. So that’s the update,” Sampson said on Wednesday. “It’s one of those infamous game-time decisions, I guess. We’ll see. I mean, if it had been up to Marcus he might have tried to play Sunday. Sometimes as a coach you have to save them from themselves. I’m not going to jeopardize he or our team, but Marcus and I have the kind of relationship where he will do what I ask him to do.”The Horizon League Tournament champion Norse (22-12) are making their third NCAA appearance in seven seasons of eligibility for the tournament, after the required four-year reclassification period following the move up from Division II. They have yet to win an NCAA Tournament game.“This is the goal. This is where we want to be every year,” coach Darrin Horn said. “We played our best basketball down the stretch.”SIDELINE SHOUTINGThe Auburn-Iowa matchup will feature two different brands of basketball on the court — and a similarly intense style of coaching on the sideline.The Tigers’ Bruce Pearl was asked about a CBSSports.com story highlighting the matchup as especially intriguing “if you’re into seeing coaches act like children.” The article also predicted the over/under on technical fouls called on Pearl and Iowa’s Fran McCaffery “at a cautious 1.5.”Pearl smiled at the assessment, but took the under.“I’ve got a couple of grandkids, and I love their energy and I love their passion and every now and then they throw a fit,” he said. “You still love them, right? I think it’s one of the best matchups because of the quality of the teams and how competitive the game could be. Fran wears it on his sleeve also, but we respect the game.”The Tigers (20-12) rank fifth nationally in holding opponents to 28.8% in 3-point shooting. The Hawkeyes (19-13) are averaging 80.2 points per game, 18th-best.RISING STARPenn State coach Micah Shrewsberry guided the Nittany Lions in his second season to the Big Ten Tournament championship game, where they lost by two points to East No. 1 seed Purdue. That has made him a hot name on the market, with Notre Dame and Georgetown mentioned on the rumor mill as interested programs with vacancies.When asked directly on Wednesday if he would be at Penn State next season, he was non-committal. Out of respect to his players, he politely declined to discuss the possibility of other opportunities.“We played four games in four days and our backs have been against the wall for three weeks, and now this is my first time in the NCAA Tournament as a head coach,"" he said. ""I don’t have time to focus on anything else other than that.”GRATEFUL AGGIESPenn State (22-13) will play Texas A&M (25-9) on Thursday, with the winner facing the Texas-Colgate winner on Saturday. Despite finishing second in the Southeastern Conference in the regular season and reaching the championship game of the league tournament, the Aggies are a No. 7 seed. Nonconference losses to Murray State and Wofford, though months ago, didn't help their resume.So was the slight snub from the selection committee a source of extra motivation?“It’s not needed at all,” guard Wade Taylor IV said. “I was talking to them. We’re just happy to be here. It’s a blessing to be here, from where we started to where we are now. Just hearing our name get called, that’s more than enough for what this team has been through.”___AP Sports Writers Paul Newberry and John Zenor in Birmingham, Alabama, and Eric Olson in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836824,"Review: New ‘Shazam!' has more everything, but less charm","Sequels, by nature, are more. Whatever the original had, just add more, the rule seems to be. Even more words in the title — how often is a sequel’s title shorter than the original?And so, exactly four years after the original DC superhero pic “Shazam!” surprised with its clever blend of innocence and silliness, and enough wit to blunt the inevitable ridiculousness of plot, we have “Shazam! Fury of the Gods.” It brings five times the title wordage, more action, more villains, more monsters and more star wattage — Oscar winner Helen Mirren, for example.But not more charm. The sequel, again directed by David F. Sandberg, feels less breezily funny, less fresh, less fleet of foot. (At two hours and 10 minutes, it’s actually two minutes shorter than the original, but doesn’t feel shorter).In its favor, though, are some elements that lent the original its pleasures, especially Zachary Levi and his goofy efforts (if perhaps more frenetic) to play a youngster in an adult superhero body, and Jack Dylan Grazer as fast-talking, always-thinking best bud (and foster brother) Freddy — this time given a love interest in appealing Rachel Zegler. It also smartly drops colorless villain Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, who’s apparently still in that lonely cell.First, a plot refresher. We’re back in Philadelphia with teen hero Billy Batson (Asher Angel), the foster kid who was bestowed in the original with magic powers by a wizard (Djimon Hounsou) and learned that the word “Shazam!” turned him into a strapping superhero (Levi). But now, his foster fam (well, just the siblings) has joined the superhero biz.It’s not going great, though. The group is known in the City of Brotherly Love as the “Philadelphia Fiascoes,” because of frequent youthful mistakes. We know teenagers have only partly developed brains, right? No matter how many buses or train cars they can hold with one arm.And there’s a big new villain to fight — actually three, the ancient Daughters of Atlas, who arrive in the human world to reclaim their stolen magic.Turns out the mythical staff of the gods, which Billy/Shazam had broken at the end of the first film, lies in a museum, and let’s just say the visitors are not in for a good day when two daughters of Atlas appear — Hespera and Kalypso — ready to annihilate anyone in their way. They’re soon revealed as Mirren and Lucy Liu, adding some real mean goddess vibe to the proceedings.Meanwhile, Billy/Shazam is in a therapy session, saying he feels like a fraud. (He’s mistakenly gone to a pediatrician, but it’s not hard to diagnose impostor syndrome.) Soon, though, he and his siblings are called upon to save the city from a collapsing bridge.The funniest parts of “Shazam!” and now its sequel involve the overlap between teen-human and superhero life. Witness the teen-designed secret lair, complete with all the Skittles and other junk food anyone would want (Skittles will play a key role at one point.) There, we also learn what’s currently occupying each of the siblings. The oldest, Mary, who studies organic chemistry for fun, is aching for college over superhero life. And Freddy wants to forge his own identity.But Billy, abandoned as a child by his parents, wants family unity at all costs. Mary tries to tell him nothing lasts forever — plus, soon he’ll be 18 and checks to his foster parents will stop coming. Then what? (Ya think we’ll have a scene later where someone assures him family lasts forever?)Meanwhile, the Daughters of Atlas, accompanied by a big old dragon and some other monsters, are on the warpath. Where’s the third, you ask? Ah, she’s masquerading as human, and she’s taken a shine to Freddy, who cannot believe his luck.That’s all you need to know to understand the action. And there's lots. Still, the best moments are when the wit of the original shines through — like when Hespera (Mirren) reads aloud a letter that’s been dictated by the young superheroes to a magic quill pen, who like a smartphone catches the extraneous dialogue, which means she’s repeating gravely: “Anyone else want a Gatorade?” (Would that Mirren — and Liu, too — had more such comic moments.)The action, laden with CGI battles, could fatally weigh down the film if it weren’t for Levi, who brings the nimbleness of a musical theater performer (ever see him sing while cartwheeling on Broadway? ) and Grazer, a bit older but still irascible, not to mention singleminded (“We can’t let her die, she called me sweet!”).Angel still makes an appealing teen Billy, and Hounsou gets a dashing fashion moment. The family’s all back, and foster mom Rosa gets at least one good line amid apocalyptic destruction: “I am not entirely sure how to parent here.”Oh wait, we forgot the unicorns!Did we need a dragon AND unicorns? Well, of course we did, because in a sequel, there’s always more.“Shazam!

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836825,North Korea launches ICBM before South Korea-Japan summit,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday just hours before the leaders of South Korea and Japan were to meet at a Tokyo summit expected to be overshadowed by North Korean nuclear threats.The North’s first ICBM test in a month and third weapons test this week also comes as South Korean and U.S. troops continue joint military exercises that Pyongyang considers a rehearsal to invade.The missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) with a maximum altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) during the 70-minute flight, according to South Korean and Japanese assessments. That’s similar to the flight details from a February launch of another ICBM, which experts said demonstrated a potential range to reach deep into the U.S. mainland.The missile fell in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan after being launched on a steep trajectory, apparently to avoid neighboring countries. Japan said the missile landed outside its exclusive economic zone and that there were no reports of damage of ships and aircraft.North Korea has yet to test ICBMs on a standard trajectory, but it has repeatedly claimed it possesses functioning nuclear missiles. Some foreign experts still doubt the North has mastered the technologies needed to build warheads small enough to be placed on those missiles and protect the warheads during atmospheric reentry.U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said Washington will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and its allies South Korea and Japan. She said the launch “needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.”Before heading Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said, “North Korea’s reckless provocations will pay the clear price.”During an emergency security meeting on the North Korean launch, Yoon instructed the South Korean military to thoroughly proceed with its ongoing exercises with U.S. forces, conduct some of the planned joint drills in an intensive manner and strengthen Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security cooperation, according to Yoon’s office.In Tokyo, Kishida said: “We must further strengthen cooperation among the allies and like-minded countries.”The Yoon-Kishida summit set for Thursday afternoon was arranged after Yoon’s government last week took a major step toward repairing bilateral ties strained by Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The South Korean plan — to use local funds to compensate some of the colonial-era forced labor victims without contributions from Japanese companies that employed them — has met fierce domestic opposition, but it reflects Yoon’s resolve to boost Seoul-Tokyo-Washington security cooperation.“Yoon’s Tokyo trip faced domestic opposition for allegedly rushing historical reconciliation in the interest of improving relations with Japan,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. “North Korea’s ICBM test on the day of the Yoon-Kishida summit may have been intended to aggravate those politics but instead makes patently clear the need for deepening security cooperation among U.S. allies.”President Joe Biden welcomed the South Korean plan as a major step toward enhancing the partnership between two of America’s closest allies, which together host about 80,000 U.S. troops. The United States has sought stronger alliances in Asia to deal with a Chinese rise and North Korean threats.North Korea’s pursuit of an expanded nuclear arsenal has pushed South Korea and Japan to seek to boost their security partnerships with the United States, as both countries are within striking distance of North Korean nuclear-capable missiles. Last October, North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over northern Japan, forcing communities there to issue evacuation alerts and halt trains.Under Kishida, Tokyo has also made a major break from its post-World War II principle of self-defense only, adopting a new national security strategy in December that includes the goals of acquiring preemptive strike capabilities and cruise missiles to counter growing threats from North Korea, China and Russia.The North’s ongoing aggressive run of weapons tests has been widely expected. Leader Kim Jong Un last week ordered his military to be ready to repel what he called “frantic war preparations moves” by his country’s rivals, referring to large joint drills between the U.S. and South Korea that began Monday.North Korea has long argued that U.S.-South Korean military drills are proof of their hostile policies against North Korea, though Washington and Seoul say they have no intentions of invading the North. Many experts say North Korea uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to boost its nuclear capability to pressure the United States to make concessions like the relaxing of international sanctions.After conducting a record number of missile tests last year, North Korea has extended its testing activities this year, including the Feb. 18 launch of its Hwasong-15 ICBM. After that launch, North Korea said the test was meant to further bolster its “fatal” nuclear attack capacity against its rivals.The Hwasong-15 is one of the North’s three ICBMs, which all use liquid propellants that require pre-launch injections. Kim has vowed to build solid-propellant missiles, which are more mobile and harder to detect before their launches because their fuels are already loaded inside.South Korea’s military said Thursday's missile launch occurred in Pyongyang’s Sunan neighborhood, home to its international airport. It is a major testing site where the North has launched most of its recent ICBM tests.Pyongyang also this week fired cruise missiles from a submarine and sent short-range ballistic missiles across its territory into its eastern sea. Last week, North Korea fired at least six short-range ballistic missiles from a western coastal area in an exercise that its state media called a simulated attack on an unspecified South Korean airfield.The ongoing U.S.-South Korean drills are scheduled to continue until March 23 and include computer simulations and live-fire field exercises. Experts had expected North Korea to further ramp up its testing activities during the drills.The top nuclear envoys of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo discussed the North’s ICBM launch over the phone and agreed to coordinate to elicit a unified international response toward the North’s weapons activities, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836826,Minnesota meat processing firm accused of employing minors,"A meat processing company in Minnesota employed children as young as 13 to work in hazardous conditions, such as operating meat grinders, while they worked overnight shifts and longer hours than allowed by law, the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry said Wednesday.The state agency is asking a district court to issue a temporary restraining order against Tony Downs Food Company, based in Mankato, while it investigates the allegations.According to the complaint, the meat processing company employed at least eight children ranging from 14 to 17 at its plant in Madelia. Investigators also have identified other employees who were hired before they were 18 years old, the department said.The young employees, one of whom was 13 years old when hired, operated meat grinders, ovens and forklifts on overnight shifts and also worked in areas where meat products are flash frozen with carbon monoxide and ammonia, according to the complaint. They also allegedly worked longer hours than permitted by law.The company’s reports showed some children have been injured while working in the dangerous areas, according to the complaint.Messages left after working hours Wednesday for Tony Downs Food Company were not immediately returned.The announcement comes after Packers Sanitation Services Inc., one of the country's largest cleaning services for food processing companies, was fined more than $1.5 million in February for employing more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country.At least three of the young workers for Packers Sanitation Services were burned by caustic cleaning chemicals while working at a JBS meatpacking plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, U.S. Department of Labor officials said.The investigation into Tony Downs began after the Minnesota labor department received a complaint about working conditions at the Madelia plant, according to the complaint. Investigators conducted an overnight inspection on Jan. 26-27, interviewed workers, documented working conditions and contacted area school districts. The company also provided employee records through February.The labor department found that Tony Downs was aware of the issue. It also learned that minors were working under assumed names and were not native English speakers, according to the complaint.“Child labor laws exist so that when children are introduced to employment, it is in a safe environment and the work advances the economic, social and educational development of our youngest workers,” DLI Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach said in a statement. “When child labor laws are violated, the best interests of our children are being tossed to the wayside to advance the interests of an employer.""The investigation is continuing. The labor department, which is working with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, can issue injunctions, penalties and criminal referrals against companies when warranted.Minnesota law prohibits employers from hiring minors to work in hazardous conditions. Employers also are prohibited from requiring employees under the age of 16 to work after 9 p.m., more than eight hours a day, or more than 40 hours a week.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836827,Tennessee GOP advance new narrow abortion exemption bill,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Republican lawmakers on Wednesday took another swing at adding a narrow exemption to one of the strictest abortion bans in the United States.Nearly a month ago, a Republican legislative panel defied political threats made by the state's influential anti-abortion lobbying group and advanced legislation clarifying situations where abortion could be allowed in Tennessee.However, despite the committee's endorsement, the legislation was almost immediately considered doomed inside the GOP-dominant Statehouse, owing to the reluctance of the members to support efforts to loosen the strict abortion ban.After weeks of political negotiating, Tennessee Right to Life announced on Monday they would support a newly crafted proposal that's even much more narrowly focused than the original version. The House Health Committee then advanced the proposal Wednesday.Currently, Tennessee has no explicit exemptions in its abortion ban. Instead the law includes an “affirmative defense” for doctors, meaning that the burden is on the physician to prove that an abortion was medically necessary — instead of requiring the state to prove the opposite.The new proposal unveiled Wednesday removes the affirmative defense for doctors and adds in language that doctors may provide abortion services for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages. However, it does not include the previous version's inclusion of “medically futile pregnancies” and lethal fetal anomalies as approved reasons for physicians to provide an abortion. Instead, it allows doctors to use “reasonable medical judgment” to determine if an abortion is necessary.There is no exception for rape and incest.Defenders of Tennessee's so-called trigger law, which include Republican Gov. Bill Lee, say pregnant women are protected from harm and doctors are unlikely to face any of the law's hefty felony charges. However a group of Republican lawmakers have voiced that the ban should be changed. Many have cited that doctors are terrified to do their job out of fear of being prosecuted and losing their medical licenses, while others point out that many Republican voters are in favor of clear exemptions.Yet ever since the ban went into place, there has been massive disagreement on how Tennessee's law should be modified. Republican-led attempts to add exemptions this year for rape and incest have been spiked by GOP-controlled committees, while Democratic attempts to explicitly state that birth control does not fall under the state's abortion ban have also faltered.“Removing affirmative defense, it gives doctors the ability to take care of a woman with these pregnancies,” said Republican Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, the bill’s sponsor. ""I was passionate about making sure affirmative defense was removed. When I spoke with physicians, that was their number one goal. It will save mother’s lives.""When pressed on whether she was comfortable with the new language, Helton-Haynes responded that she was “comfortable knowing this language will pass.”Republican Rep. Ryan Williams called the new language “dramatically different” and praised Helton-Haynes for finding a compromise to getting more Republicans on board with the change.Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons warned that the new language still places on a burden on doctors and hospitals to prove in court that an abortion was necessary and lamented that lawmakers were giving into political pressure rather than advancing public policy that would benefit women.“At what point, where in that timeline, how close to death’s door have to be before that doctor’s decision is deemed reasonable?” Clemmons asked. “Doctors are going to wait until the very last minute.”The bill would have to still clear the full House and Senate before it could head to the governor's desk. The Republican governor has not weighed in publicly on whether he supports the new proposal.Nationally, attempts to loosen strict abortion bans in Republican-led states have popped up in Arkansas, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia, according to the Guttmacher Institute research group that supports abortion rights. Many of the bills are backed by Democratic lawmakers, but a handful are being pushed by Republicans.“For the Democrats who introduce these bills, they’re trying to showcase the harms of an outright ban,” said Elizabeth Nash, the group’s state policy analyst. “For the Republican side, we’re seeing them introduce these bills because they understand their constituents are unhappy.”Meanwhile, Nash argued the overall push to add exemptions to strict abortion bans would only apply to a narrow group of people, and doctors could still end up feeling unsure how they can proceed under a narrow exception.“These exemptions don’t actually provide for meaningful access to abortion,” she said. “By their very nature, they put a preference on some sort of abortion over others.”",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836828,Dolphins release CB Byron Jones after three seasons,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Miami Dolphins released veteran cornerback Byron Jones Wednesday in a cost-cutting move.Jones missed the entire 2022 season after having surgery on his lower left leg last March. He started 30 games for Miami, which in 2020 made him the highest-paid cornerback in the league at the time after signing him to a five-year, $82.5 million contract.In two seasons with the Dolphins, Jones had 95 tackles, two interceptions, 14 passes defensed and two forced fumbles.Jones is designated a post-June 1 cut, which clears $13.6 million in cap room for Miami, while creating nearly $10 million in dead money, and allows Jones to sign with any team, though it is uncertain when, or if, he will return to the field.Last month, Jones tweeted that he can't “run or jump” because of injuries sustained playing football.""Much has changed in 8 years,"" Jones wrote on Twitter. “Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game. DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones added in another tweet. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities. Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”Jones, who was drafted in the first round by the Cowboys in 2015, has 57 career passes defensed, four interceptions and made the Pro Bowl in 2018.The Dolphins, who were thin at cornerback last year because of injuries, have already brought in Jones' replacement. Miami traded for Rams All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey last week to pair with veteran Xavien Howard and Kader Kohou, who had a standout season in 2022 as an undrafted free agent.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836831,What's the next step for Black reparations in San Francisco?,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco supervisors have backed the idea of paying reparations to Black people, but whether members will agree to lump-sum payments of $5 million to every eligible person or to any of the more than 100 other recommendations made by an advisory committee won't be known until later this year.The idea of Black reparations is not new, but the federal government's promise of granting 40 acres and a mule to newly freed slaves was never realized. It wasn't until George Floyd, a Black man, was killed in police custody in 2020 that reparations movements began spreading in earnest across the country.The state of California and the cities of Boston and San Francisco are among jurisdictions trying to atone not just for chattel slavery, but for decades of racist policies and laws that systemically denied Black Americans access to property, education and the ability to build generational wealth.WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR REPARATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO?Black migration to San Francisco soared in the 1940s because of shipyard work, but racially restrictive covenants and redlining limited where people could live. When Black residents were able to build a thriving neighborhood in the Fillmore, government redevelopment plans in the 1960s forced out residents, stripped them of their property and decimated Black-owned businesses, advocates say.Today, fewer than 6% of San Francisco residents are Black yet they make up nearly 40% of the city's homeless population.Supporters include the San Francisco NAACP, although it said the board should reject the $5 million payments and focus instead on reparations through education, jobs, housing, health care and a cultural center for Black people in San Francisco. The president of the San Francisco branch is the Rev. Amos C. Brown, who sits on both the statewide and San Francisco reparations panels.WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT AGAINST REPARATIONS?Critics say California and San Francisco never endorsed chattel slavery, and there is no one alive today who owned slaves or was enslaved. It is not fair for municipal taxpayers, some of whom are immigrants, to shoulder the cost of structural racism and discriminatory government policies, critics say.An estimate from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, which leans conservative, has said it would cost each non-Black family in San Francisco at least $600,000 in taxes to pay for the costliest of the recommendations: The $5 million per-person payout, guaranteed income of at least $97,000 a year for 250 years, personal debt elimination and converting public housing into condos to sell for $1.A 2022 Pew Research Center survey found 68% of U.S. respondents opposed reparations compared with 30% in favor. Nearly 80% of Black people surveyed supported reparations. More than 90% of Republicans or those leaning Republican opposed reparations while Democrats and those leaning Democratic were divided.HOW WILL SAN FRANCISCO PAY FOR THIS?It's not clear. The advisory committee that made the recommendations says it is not its job to figure out how to finance San Francisco's atonement and repair.That would be up to local politicians, two of whom expressed interest Tuesday in taking the issue to voters. San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey said he would back a ballot measure to enshrine reparations in the San Francisco charter as part of the budget. Shamann Walton, the supervisor leading the charge on reparations, supports that idea.WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER REPARATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS?Recommendations in education include establishing an Afrocentric K-12 school in San Francisco; hiring and retaining Black teachers; mandating a core Black history and culture curriculum; and offering cash to at-risk students for hitting educational benchmarks.Recommendations in health include free mental health, prenatal care and rehab treatment for impoverished Black San Franciscans, victims of violent crimes and formerly incarcerated people.The advisory committee also recommends prioritizing Black San Franciscans for job opportunities and training, as well as finding ways to incubate Black businesses.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?There is no deadline for supervisors to agree on a path forward. The board next plans to discuss reparations proposals in September, after the San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee issues a final report in June.WHAT ABOUT REPARATIONS FROM THE STATE?In 2020, California became the first state to form a reparations task force. But nearly two years into its work, it still has yet to make key decisions on who would be eligible for payment and how much. The task force has a July 1 deadline to submit a final report of its reparations recommendations, which would then be drafted into legislation for lawmakers to consider.The task force has spent multiple meetings discussing time frames and payment calculations for five harms experienced by Black people, including government taking of property, housing discrimination and homelessness and mass incarceration. The task force is also debating state residency requirements.Previously, the state committee voted to limit financial reparations to people descended from enslaved or freed Black people in the U.S. as of the 19th century.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836832,Stanford University employee charged with lying about rapes,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 25-year-old Stanford University employee was arrested Wednesday and charged with felony perjury for allegedly lying about being raped twice last year on campus, authorities said.Jennifer Ann Gries, of Santa Clara, first reported a false sexual attack in August when she told a nurse at Valley Medical Center in San Jose that a man grabbed her while she was at a campus parking lot, dragged her to a restroom and sexually assaulted her, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office said.In October she went to Stanford Hospital to get another rape examination and told the nurse conducting the exam that she was returning to her office from lunch when a man grabbed her arm, forced her into a basement storage closet and raped her, prosecutors said. She again declined to speak with police, they said.Both of Gries’ sexual assault examination kits were analyzed quickly “given the extreme public safety risk of a potential sex offender,” prosecutors said, adding that the lab results “were not consistent with her story.”On both occasions she signed a consent form acknowledging the nurse was a mandated reporter who must inform law enforcement of the attack and signed forms to get public funds, prosecutors said.In January, during an interview with a District Attorney’s Office investigator, Gries is said to have admitted to lying about the rapes and written an apology letter to the man who was the target of her allegations.“She stated she was upset with the victim because she felt he gave her ‘false intention’ and turned her friends against her,” prosecutors said.Gries was charged with two felony counts of perjury and two misdemeanor counts of making a false crime report to nurses at two different hospitals, prosecutors said. It was not immediately known if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.In a statement, Stanford said Gries was placed on a leave of absence and the university “will be reviewing her employment.”“These false reports are damaging, both for true survivors of sexual assault and for the members of our community who experienced fear and alarm from the reports,” the university said, while adding that false reports in sexual assault cases are rare.Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen called the alleged false rape reports “a rare and deeply destructive crime” and said he felt for those who are falsely accused, for the students who had to look over their shoulders and for the ”legitimate sexual assault victims who wonder if they will be believed.”The rape reports led Stanford University police to issue campus-wide electronic alerts, which prompted widespread fear and a protest in October by hundreds of students who marched to demand university officials do more to protect students.Investigators also found Gries had filed a sexual harassment complaint in March 2022 against a male coworker with the university's human resources department, which found the allegation was unfounded, prosecutors said. The co-worker fit the description Gries gave the nurses she reported the rapes to, they said.Gries is listed on the university’s website as a Housing Service Center Supervisor.In 2016, the university was in the national spotlight after the emotional victim impact statement of Chanel Miller, who was sexually assaulted on campus by Stanford athlete Brock Turner, went viral. Turner, a star swimmer, infamously received a six-month sentence for sexually assaulting an unconscious Miller the previous year.Judge Aaron Persky, who imposed the sentence, was recalled by voters in 2018, the first judge to be recalled in California since 1932.",2023/03/16,,World

Eight students and two teachers were killed at the school, located about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southeast of Houston.In February, state District Judge Jeth Jones ordered Pagourtzis be held at the hospital for up to another year.But last week, Jones held a last-minute hearing in which he ordered Pagourtzis to be evaluated by an outside expert to determine his competency.In their motion Tuesday to recuse Jones, Pagourtzis’ lawyers said they believe Jones is determined to find experts who will conclude their client is competent to stand trial and that the judge indicated he could appoint a new expert on a weekly basis.In the recusal motion, attorney Nicholas Poehl wrote that Jones expressed during a Jan. 26 meeting that doctors and staff at the state hospital “might not care to see"" Pagourtzis restored to competency so that he can be tried.In a statement, Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady, whose office is prosecuting Pagourtzis, said he opposes the motion to remove the judge.Jones’ office did not return a call or email seeking comment Wednesday. The judge told the Houston Chronicle he could not comment on the motion and had referred it to Susan Brown, the presiding judge over the six-county region that includes Galveston County. Brown could handle the motion herself or appoint another judge to hear it. No court hearings have been scheduled on the motion.Jones took over the case after being elected in November.The motion alleges that after ordering Pagourtzis be hospitalized for another year, the judge secretly asked the state hospital to perform another competency evaluation, which found that Pagourtzis remained incompetent.Jones then held a hearing last week in which he ordered an evaluation from an outside expert.The judge’s recent actions come as family members of those killed or wounded have expressed frustration the case has not gone to trial. They also say they have not been given access to evidence in the case, including autopsy reports and surveillance footage, that could provide more information on their loved ones’ final moments. A bill has been filed in the current session of the state Legislature that would give crime victims’ families access to such evidence without making it public.“Judge Jones’ proposed scheme appears to be designed to either create the appearance to the public as if the Court is doing something or to eventually arrive at the specific result of ...

He has a record of 18-1 this year and is currently ranked 205th in the world junior rankings.The Indian Wells amateur event is being held for the first time in conjunction with the BNP Paribas Open, featuring the combined ATP and WTA tours.Leach is the oldest child and only son of Davenport, a former No. 1-ranked player and Olympic gold medalist. She and her husband, Jon, also have three daughters.Leach is the latest offspring of a successful pro player to follow in their parents' footsteps.Brandon Holt, the son of two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin, plays on the ATP Tour. So does Sebastian Korda, the son of Australian Open winner Petr Korda. Elizabeth Mandlik, daughter of four-time major champion Hana Mandlikova, plays on the WTA Tour.In 2020, Leach was in an all-terrain vehicle accident in Hawaii in which he sustained a severe compound fracture of his femur. He needed multiple blood transfusions and was in the hospital for eight days after experiencing complications from surgery.He fully recovered and resumed tennis, along with running, surfing and golfing.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836837,O'Ward not dwelling on issue that cost win in IndyCar opener,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Pato O'Ward isn't dwelling on the temporary loss of engine power that almost certainly cost him a victory in the season-opening IndyCar race on the streets of downtown St. Petersburg. He is instead focused on the second-place finish that he did have.“It's just all about looking at how our weekend went,” O'Ward said Wednesday. “In ‘21 and ’22, we had terrible weekends there. So ‘23, qualified third and we ended the race on the podium. We went forward even with having a couple of issues. That's a fantastic start to our (season).”Still, it could have been even better. O'Ward led with three laps remaining March 5 when his Arrow-McLauren Chevrolet had a sudden loss of power. That brief hiccup allowed Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson to pass him, and drive on to the victory.During an appearance at Texas Motor Speedway to promote the April 2 race where he got the first of his four career IndyCar wins in 2021, O'Ward said that a “plenum issue” was to blame at St. Pete. That part is related to the fuel-air mixture in the engine.“We all win and lose together as a team,” O'Ward said. “It’s not like it was done on purpose. It’s something that is sometimes inevitable.”Rob Buckner, Chevrolet’s IndyCar program manager, told Motorsport.com that it was a very rare occurrence.“Unfortunately, in the entire lifetime of this program, that was the most consequential one we’ve had,"" Bucker said. “Terrible timing. And it was absolutely on us. I hate it for the No. 5 car and hate it for Pato, because I’m very confident they had the race won without that.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836838,Broncos continue upgrades by signing special teams ace,"After fortifying their offensive and defensive lines with splashy moves earlier this week, the Denver Broncos turned their attention to upgrading their special teams Wednesday when they agreed to a two-year deal with cornerback Tremon Smith worth up to $5.5 million.Smith, 26, who has played for the Chiefs, Colts and Texans, has averaged nearly 25 yards on 94 kick returns over his five-year NFL career. The Broncos were last in the league at 17.5 yards last season when rookie Montrell Washington averaged 18.9 yards on 18 kickoff returns.Smith also provides depth at cornerback for the Broncos, who parted ways with veteran Ronald Darby and didn't tender Essang Bassey.The Broncos have been among the league's most active teams in free agency under new head coach Sean Payton and in the new Walton-Penner ownership group's first offseason.The Broncos have guaranteed nearly $140 million in salaries to nine free agents this week: right tackle Mike McGlinchey, defensive end Zach Allen, left guard Ben Powers, inside linebacker Alex Singleton, tight end Chris Manhertz, backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, running back Samaje Perine, backup fullback Mike Burton and Smith ($2.5 million).Burton, who receives a one-year, $1.3 million deal, is a ninth-year pro who spent the past two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs after playing in 2020 for Payton in New Orleans. He replaces Andrew Beck, who agreed to a two-year, $6.25 million deal Monday with the Houston Texans.Free agency officially started Wednesday with the start of the league's new year.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World

(AP) — Max Rice remembers the excitement he saw watching Northwestern win its first NCAA Tournament game six years ago.Now, Rice wants to do the same for his Boise State team that is looking for its first tournament win when the 10th-seeded Broncos take on the seventh-seeded Wildcats in a West Region game in Sacramento on Thursday.“I think the last couple years we’ve done a lot of checking off boxes that this program has never done before,” Rice said. “That’s one of the last boxes I think would be huge for this program, to check off an NCAA Tournament win. I know Northwestern did that a couple years ago, I think. I remember watching that. That’s something that has been our goal all year.""In a West Region filled with powerhouses like defending champion Kansas, UCLA, Connecticut and Gonzaga, the Wildcats and and Broncos are clearly lacking.Northwestern (21-11) has made it to this stage for just the second time, beating Vanderbilt in the first round in 2017 before losing to Gonzaga.Boise State (24-9) has been to this stage a lot more, making its ninth trip. But the Broncos have lost their opening-round game the previous eight times, including 64-53 to Memphis last year.“It would mean so much for our fans,” coach Leon Rice said. “I want it so bad for our players to keep them going. I want to keep this group together as long as I can keep this group together.”After making the tournament for the first time back in 2017 in what coach Chris Collins said was viewed by many fans like a Final Four at other schools, success has been harder to come by.The Wildcats followed that up with five straight losing seasons before breaking through again this year with a second-place finish in the Big Ten that Collins hopes lays the groundwork for more seasons like this.“I think coming a second time, it’s gratifying because if you go once, it’s great, but it can almost be like kind of the one-hit-wonder type of deal,” Collins said. “To be able to now stamp it and be back a second time, hopefully that will help us as we continue to build for the future.”In the other games Thursday in the West Region, second-seeded UCLA (29-5) takes on No. 15 seed UNC Asehville (27-7) in Sacramento; while in Des Moines, Iowa, top-seeded Kansas (27-7) takes on Howard (22-12) with hopes that coach Bill Self will return from a stint in the hospital, and No. 8 seed Arkansas (20-13) faces ninth-seeded Illinois (20-12).FAMILIAR FOETerrence Shannon Jr. will get another crack at Arkansas in the NCAA Tournament, this time with Illinois.Two years ago, when he was at Texas Tech, Shannon scored a team-high 20 points in a 68-66 second-round loss in Indianapolis.Shannon leads the Illini with 17.1 points per game and has wowed crowds with electrifying dunks.Davonte “Devo” Davis is the only current Arkansas player who appeared in the game against the Red Raiders. Davis led the Razorbacks with 15 points that day.“Once I found out we had the Arkansas matchup, he’s the first person that came to mind because he hit big shots my sophomore year when I was at Texas Tech, and he’s one of the best defenders in the country,” Shannon said.Davis, who guarded Shannon two years ago and expects to be assigned to him again Thursday, said the Illini point guard’s game has changed since the last time they met.“Now he’s got the ball in his hand more and he’s ball dominant,” Davis said. “It’s not just me guarding him, it’s the whole team.”UPSET MINDEDLast year's tournament is front and center for UCLA and UNC Asheville.The Bruins want to avoid another first-round scare after surviving 57-53 against Akron on the way to the Sweet 16.The Bulldogs are trying to repeat the run St. Peter's went on as a 15th seed, making it to the Elite Eight.“Who wouldn’t want to be in that situation? They had a great run last year,” forward Drew Pember said. “Could we be the Cinderella team? Only the Lord knows that. It could happen.”While UNC Asheville has never advanced beyond the round of 64, they feature a lineup that includes the school's all-time leading scorer in Tajion Jones and Pember, who averages 21.2 points.“They’re not scared,” Bruins guard Tyger Campbell said. “They’re here for a reason. So we’re going into this game, we just got to prepare like it’s any regular game.”BISON PRIDEHoward is the opponent for No. 1 seed Kansas on Thursday, on the five-year anniversary of UMBC’s victory over Virginia that remains the only win by a No. 16 seed in a non-play-in game in NCAA Tournament history.The Bison would love to be the next one, but they’re playing for a bigger purpose as the perhaps the most prominent member of the country’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.At his news conference in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday, coach Kenneth Blakeney proudly listed all of the school’s famous alumni – from Kamala Harris to Thurgood Marshall – and his efforts to lead his players in social justice causes and other experiences off the court.“I just really feel we have to develop and we have to have well-rounded young men,” Blakeney said. “If we’re not doing that off the court, then I’m not doing my job.”INJURY REPORTIllinois freshman Jayden Epps, who collapsed in practice on Feb. 28 and later was diagnosed with a concussion, is “good to go” against Arkansas, Illini coach Brad Underwood said.Epps missed two games and played two minutes and scored three points in a 79-76 loss to Penn State in the Big Ten Tournament last week.Epps collapsed after he took an elbow to the jaw in practice and was hospitalized overnight.UCLA will be without defensive stopper Jaylen Clark (Achilles) for the tournament, but could get big man Adem Bona (shoulder) back after he missed the Pac-12 title game.___AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell and Eric Olson in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836842,Swiss central bank throws financial lifeline to Credit Suisse after shares pummelled,"March 15 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse CSGN.S in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares tumbled as much as 30% on Wednesday.In a joint statement, the Swiss financial regulator FINMA and the nation's central bank sought to ease investor fears around Credit Suisse, saying it ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks."" They said the bank could access liquidity from the central bank if needed.The statement came after a major government and at least one bank put pressure on Switzerland to act, said people familiar with the matter, as the lender became caught up in a crisis of confidence after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week.Credit Suisse said it welcomed the statement of support from the Swiss National Bank and FINMA.Credit Suisse would be the first major global bank to be given such a lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis - though central banks have extended liquidity more generally to banks during times of market stress including the coronavirus pandemic.SVB's demise, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent global bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride this week, with investors discounting assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and emergency steps giving banks access to more funding.By Wednesday, focus had shifted from the United States to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a rout in bank shares after its largest investor said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.Hoping to quell concerns, FINMA and the Swiss central bank said there were no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions from U.S. banking market turmoil.Earlier, Credit Suisse shares led a 7% fall in the European banking index .SX7P, while five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for the flagship Swiss bank hit a new record high.The investor exit for the doors prompted fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their exposures to Credit Suisse.One source said, however, that they saw Credit Suisse's problems as specific to that bank, rather than being systemic.""(The) SVB collapse is a firm- and U.S.-specific problem, but now markets have reawakened to global banks’ risks – from interest rate/duration to liquidity and credit risk – and European banks are engulfed by a confidence crisis,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard.The U.S. Treasury is monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and is in touch with global counterparts, a Treasury spokesperson said.Asked about the impact of Credit Suisse's problems on the U.S. banking system, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders told Reuters: ""Everybody is concerned.""On Wall Street, major indexes closed down on Wednesday, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N falling. The KBW regional banking index .KRX declined 1.57%.'FLIGHT TO SAFETY'In the United States, large banks have managed their exposure to Credit Suisse in recent months and view risks emanating from the lender as manageable so far, according to three industry sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.Rapid rises in interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders who are also worried about a recession.Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which just last week was expected to accelerate its interest-rate-hike campaign in the face of persistent inflation, may be forced to hit pause and even reverse course.Futures tied to the Fed's policy rate were pricing a slightly better-than-even chance that policymakers will leave their benchmark lending rate in its current 4.5%-4.75% range at their upcoming meeting on March 21-22.Traders' bets on a large European Central Bank interest-rate hike at Thursday's meeting also evaporated quickly as the Credit Suisse rout fanned fears about the health of Europe's banking sector. Money market pricing suggested traders now saw less than a 20% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike at the ECB meeting.Unease sparked by SVB's demise has also prompted depositors to seek out new homes for their cash.Ralph Hamers, CEO of Credit Suisse rival UBS UBSG.S said market turmoil has steered more money its way.""In the last couple of days as you might expect we've seen inflows,"" Hamers said. ""It is clearly a flight to safety from that perspective, but I think three days don't make a trend.""Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE CEO Christian Sewing said that the German lender has also seen incoming deposits.Focus is also shifting increasingly to the possibility of tougher rules for banks, particularly mid-tier ones like SVB SIVB.O and New York-based Signature BankSBNY.O, whose collapses triggered the market tumult.U.S. Congress needs to act on bipartisan legislation strengthening banking industry controls, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, though Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown downplayed the likelihood of Congress passing a ""significant"" banking bill anytime soon.",2023/03/16,298,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836857,TSMC's Germany chip plant talks hone in on govt subsidies - sources,"TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC's (2330.TW) talks with the German state of Saxony about building a new factory are at an advanced stage and are now focused on government subsidies to support the investment, two people familiar with the matter said.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and Asia's most valuable listed company, flagged in 2021 that it was in the early stages of reviewing a potential expansion into EU member Germany, in what would be its first European plant.
The European Union last year unveiled the European Chips Act to ease government funding rules for semiconductor plants that had previously faced state aid bans, as the bloc tries to guarantee supplies after a chip shortage and supply chain bottlenecks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
One person briefed on the matter said talks between TSMC and Saxony are ""serious and advanced"", and delegations from the eastern German state with its capital in Dresden, have been coming to Taiwan for talks with TSMC.
Given the higher costs associated with building in Germany, including for labour, TSMC has been discussing subsidies it could get in return for building the factory, said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks are private.
TSMC said in December that there was ""no concrete plan"" to build a chip factory in Germany.
In January, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the company was talking to customers and partners about building an automotive-focused plant in Europe based on customer demand and the level of government support. TSMC declined to comment further.
The EU has been courting Taiwan as one of the ""like-minded"" partners it would like to work with to build new plants to shore up chip supplies.
The German and Saxony governments are willing to give subsidies but they also need further EU funds, the second person familiar with the situation said.
""Without subsidies nobody will come,"" the person added.
The Saxony government said decisions about building plants would be taken by companies, but added it was always in talks with leading firms about investing further in the region.
Saxony officials discussed the EU Chips Act with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 6 in Brussels, according to the state government.
Germany's economy ministry said it could not comment on individual company plans, but noted the federal government was willing to support and promote semiconductor production projects under the European Chips Act.
The European Commission declined to comment.
TSMC is already expanding internationally. It has committed $40 billion to build a chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona, and is also building one in Japan and considering a second one there.
The Arizona factory, among the largest foreign investments in U.S. history, will start production in 2024, using advanced 5-nanometre technology. Construction was announced after the U.S. passed a law granting $53 billion in subsidies and tax credits for the chips industry.
TSMC's German factory, if is goes ahead, will likely produce less advanced chips, especially those used in the auto industry, the first person said.
""These are the kinds of chips German industry needs,"" the person added.TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC's (2330.TW) talks with the German state of Saxony about building a new factory are at an advanced stage and are now focused on government subsidies to support the investment, two people familiar with the matter said.TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and Asia's most valuable listed company, flagged in 2021 that it was in the early stages of reviewing a potential expansion into EU member Germany, in what would be its first European plant.The European Union last year unveiled the European Chips Act to ease government funding rules for semiconductor plants that had previously faced state aid bans, as the bloc tries to guarantee supplies after a chip shortage and supply chain bottlenecks during the COVID-19 pandemic.One person briefed on the matter said talks between TSMC and Saxony are ""serious and advanced"", and delegations from the eastern German state with its capital in Dresden, have been coming to Taiwan for talks with TSMC.Given the higher costs associated with building in Germany, including for labour, TSMC has been discussing subsidies it could get in return for building the factory, said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks are private.TSMC said in December that there was ""no concrete plan"" to build a chip factory in Germany.In January, TSMC CEO C.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836858,Judge wants plan to protect humpback whales from fishery,"A U.S. judge this week ruled that the National Marine Fisheries Service violated the law when it failed to develop a plan to prevent West Coast commercial sablefish fishermen from harming humpback whales.The Endangered Species Act requires the fisheries service to develop a plan to reduce the number of whales accidentally injured or killed by the fishery, but the agency neither crafted such a plan nor started to create one, the ruling said.About 150 commercial fishing vessels use traps to capture sablefish in waters off California, Oregon and Washington.The fisheries service estimates the fishery accidentally injuries or kills an average of one humpback whale per year.Sablefish dwell on muddy ocean floors deeper than 650 feet (200 meters). To target the fish, fishermen place multiple heavy pots on the seafloor and link them together with heavy-duty fishing line.The number of pots ranges from 15 to 50 while the lines can stretch about two miles (three kilometers), according to court documents. The fishery deployed an annual average of 75,000 pots from 2015 to 2019, the document said.Judge James Donato, of the Northern District of California, found inadequate the agency’s reasoning that it didn't have enough money to develop take-reduction plans for all species that need them. The judge said insufficient funds may absolve the government from meeting all deadlines for such plans, but the agency “cannot indefinitely delay” creating them.Donato ordered the parties back in court next month to discuss next steps.Michael Milstein, a spokesperson for the agency, said officials are reviewing the decision and didn't have further comment at this time.The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental organization that sued the fisheries service over the issue last year, welcomed the ruling.“This is a clear win for endangered humpback whales, who face enough deadly threats in the water already,” Kristen Monsell, the center's oceans legal director, said in a statement.The lawsuit said humpback whales can die of starvation or infection when they become entangled in sablefish pot gear.Fishing lines can wrap around a whale, sometimes anchoring the whale in place, which can drown or severely injure it, the lawsuit said. Whales can also swim away, dragging the gear behind. In such cases, fishing line can dig into the whale's body and drain its energy.Most of the fishing was concentrated off Astoria and Newport in Oregon and off Fort Bragg and San Francisco in California, the lawsuit said.Humpback whales live in oceans around the world and often migrate long distances. In the North Pacific, they feed in colder waters during the summer and breed in warmer waters during the winter.There are two distinct populations of humpback whales in West Coast waters. The Mexico population is classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. These whales breed and calve along the Pacific coast of Mexico and feed from California to Alaska's Aleutian Islands.The Central America population is endangered.

Argentina had offered Duarte political asylum, but Ecuador refused to grant her safe passage.Argentina told Ecuador on Monday that Duarte was no longer in the Quito residence, saying she had left of her own accord. It was later revealed that she left Friday.Ecuador did not hide its anger, summoning Argentina’s ambassador, Gabriel Fuks, and telling him to leave the country. Argentina followed suit and ordered the expulsion of Ecuador’s ambassador in Buenos Aires, Xavier Monge.Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Holguín told lawmakers that “there was complicity” from Argentina in Duarte’s escape. Holguín said there were “inconsistencies” in what Fuks told Ecuadorian authorities, leading the government to conclude he could no longer be trusted.Argentina accused Ecuador of escalating the disagreement, “taking it to a level that damages the bilateral relationship.” It said it was being blamed for the “ineffectiveness of the Ecuadorian authorities” that allowed Duarte to leave undetected. It said Duarte was not a prisoner of its embassy in Quito.Grace Jaramillo, a professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said that “the two states bear responsibility"" for the fight.Argentina “didn’t respect due process in Ecuador,” while Ecuador’s Foreign Affairs Ministry “didn’t react on time through regular channels,” she said.Juan Francisco Camino, a professor at Ecuador’s Hemisferios University, said he didn’t believe that “this will lead to a rupture in relations.”Duarte held several posts in Correa’s government, including minister of transport and public works in 2010-2014. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for bribery in a case that had to do with irregular campaign donations.___Associated Press writer Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836860,Ex-Wells Fargo exec to plead guilty for role in bank scandal,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former Wells Fargo Bank executive accused of overseeing a ruse that created millions of bogus customer accounts has agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges likely to send her prison for her role in the scandal.The agreement filed Wednesday in a Los Angeles federal court calls for the former Wells Fargo executive, Carrie Tolstedt, to serve a 16-month prison sentence for obstructing regulators' investigation into abusive sales practices that culminated in the bank paying billions of dollars in fines. Tolstedt, 63, also agreed to pay a $17 million fine in a separate civil settlement with the government that also bans her from working again in the banking industry.Prosecutors are requesting an April 7 court hearing to review the plea agreement.Tolstedt was the longtime head of the Wells Fargo's division responsible for its sprawling network of retail branches, before leaving in 2016 just before evidence of the bank's abusive sales tactics surfaced. After previously denying any wrongdoing, Tolstedt becomes the first Wells Fargo executive to be held criminally culpable for a scandal that resulted in the firing of 5,300 employees for falsifying bank records and other ethics violations.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo had previously admitted that its ambitious sales goals had fostered a culture that prodded its branch employees to open millions of unauthorized and fraudulent accounts from 2002 to 2016. The U.S. Justice Department alleged Tolstedt — now a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona — knew about the abuses dating back to 2004 and subsequently tried to cover up the misconduct in a memo prepared for regulators looking into the practices in 2015.“Obstructing an investigation compromises the mission of those seeking the truth, and we will hold accountable any individual who attempts to conceal wrongdoing.” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph T.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836861,NTSB: Wing parts from air ambulance fell far from wreckage,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A new federal report says parts of the right wing on a medical transport plane that crashed last month in rural Nevada, killing all five people aboard, fell far from the main wreckage site.The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary findings released Wednesday could support the agency's initial theory that the aircraft had broken apart before hitting the ground. NTSB is expected to release its final report with a probable cause within two years.The agency says parts of the plane's right wing were located as far as three-quarters of a mile (1.1 kilometers) from where the single-engine Pilatus PC12 crashed in Stagecoach, Nevada, a rural community of about 2,500 residents outside of Reno.Authorities have said the Care Flight piloted by Scott Walton, 46, was headed from Reno to Salt Lake City when it crashed around 9:15 p.m. on Feb. 24 amid a winter storm. Care Flight is a service of REMSA Health, and its aviation vendor is Guardian Flight.Guardian Flight said in a statement Wednesday it was reviewing the report and assessing ways to strengthen its safety protocols.“The safety and well-being of our patients and crew is our utmost priority and we will continue to make significant investments to bolster our commitment,"" the company said.The other victims also included 69-year-old patient Mark Rand and his 66-year-old spouse Terri Rand, as well as two medical crew members, Edward Pricola, 32, and Ryan Watson, 27.Walton contacted air traffic control minutes before the crash to report that the plane was climbing past 15,400 feet (4,694 meters), according to the report. But no further radio transmissions came in from the pilot, the report states.Just minutes later, the plane began to fall — dropping about 8,000 feet (2,440 meters) in 30 seconds — before the aircraft's navigation tracking system went dark, according to the report.Dan Rose, an aviation attorney retained by relatives of the Rands, told The Associated Press that they hope NTSB will investigate Guardian Flight’s decision to fly instead of waiting for the winter storm to pass. Rose also said Mark Rand’s condition wasn’t life-threatening at the time.“I know the family would want the NTSB to look carefully at the two issues,” Rose said Wednesday. “They’re really intertwined.”The National Weather Service said it was snowing steadily when the flight left Reno, with winds around 20 mph (30 kph) and gusts up to 30 mph (50 kph). Visibility was under 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) with a cloud ceiling about 2,000 feet (600 meters).",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836864,Utah bans abortion clinics in wave of post-Roe restrictions,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Abortion clinics in Utah could be banned from operating under a law signed by the state’s Republican governor, setting off a rush of confusion among clinics, hospitals and prospective patients in the deeply conservative state.Administrators from hospitals and clinics have not publicly detailed plans to adapt to the new rules, adding a layer of uncertainty on top of fear that, if clinics close, patients may not be able to access care at hospitals due to staffing and cost concerns.The law signed by Gov. Spencer Cox on Wednesday takes effect May 3, at which time abortion clinics will not be able to apply to be licensed. It institutes a full ban Jan. 1, 2024. Both the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the Utah Hospital Association declined to detail how the increasingly fraught legal landscape for providers in Utah will affect abortion access.In addition to banning abortion clinics from operating, the law also clarifies the definition of abortion to address liability concerns about how exceptions are worded in state law — a provision Cox called a compromise.On Thursday, the governor rebuffed critics who've equated restricting clinics to a de facto ban on abortion and said the law offered clarity to hospitals providing emergency abortions in the case of threats to maternal health and rape or incest reported to authorities.“This bill clarifies that so that those abortions can continue. They will continue in a hospital setting, but there's nothing to prevent those from continuing,” he said at a news conference.The turmoil mirrors developments in Republican strongholds throughout the United States that have taken shape since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, transformed the legal landscape and prompted a raft of lawsuits in at least 21 states.Utah lawmakers have previously said the law would protect “the innocent” and “the unborn,"" adding that they don’t think the state needs the clinics after the high court overturned the constitutional right to abortion.Though Planned Parenthood previously warned the law could dramatically hamper its ability to provide abortions, Jason Stevenson, the association's lobbyist, said Wednesday it would examine the wording of other provisions of the law that could allow clinics to apply for new licenses to perform hospital-equivalent services.Based on Planned Parenthood's interpretation, he said in an interview, clinics will no longer be able to provide abortions with their current licenses. They plan to continue, however, to provide the majority of their services such as sexually transmitted disease and cancer screenings and pregnancy testing. Stevenson said they were “looking closely” at the law's licensing options, but would not say whether the clinics would apply at this point.Utah's Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions about how it would enact the law, but lawmakers have said Planned Parenthood and other clinics could apply for different licenses under the law's framework.Jill Vicory, a spokesperson for the Utah Hospital Association, said in an email that it was “too early to comment” on whether hospitals could soon be the only abortion providers in Utah, noting each ""will need to make a determination on how they choose to proceed.""If clinics stop providing abortions, experts are concerned hospitals’ comparatively higher cost of care and nationwide staffing shortages will make it harder to get legal abortions in Utah, even though the law isn’t explicitly a restriction on those seeking them in the state, where they remain legal up to 18 weeks.Dr. Carole Joffe, a University of California, San Francisco professor who has written about the societal effects of reproductive health care, said stripping clinics of licenses would upend how abortions have been provided for decades. Historically, patients with low-complication pregnancies have mostly received abortions at outpatient clinics, which on average are able to provide them at a lower cost.“Everything in a hospital is more expensive than in a clinic. Doing an abortion in a hospital, you need more personnel,” she said, noting hospitals, with teams of anesthesiologists, physicians and surgeons have historically provided them in emergency scenarios.Another challenge facing already overburdened hospitals is staffing. Especially in states where anti-abortion sentiment runs strong, many physicians or nurses at hospitals may not want to provide them, Joffe said.“You have to draw from a pool that may or may not be sympathetic to abortion, unlike in a clinic where you don’t go to work at unless you’re committed to abortion being part of health care,” Joffe said.Abortion advocates say confusion stems from unclear language about the de-licensing process. The law prohibits clinics from obtaining new licenses after May 2 and institutes a full ban on Jan. 1, 2024. However, advocates worry about a separate provision in the 1,446-line bill that specifies under state law that abortions may only be performed in hospitals.The clinic-focused legislation has also raised questions about which kinds of facilities are best equipped to provide specialty care to patients regardless of their socioeconomic status or location.If clinics stop providing abortions — as early as May or as late as next year — it could reroute thousands of patients to hospitals and force administrators to devise new policies for elective abortions. To do so would require expanding their services beyond emergency procedures they have previously provided, prompting questions about the shift's impact on capacity, staffing, waitlists and costs. Roughly 2,800 abortions were provided in Utah last year.The Utah Hospital Association said no hospitals provided elective abortions in the state last year.The new restrictions are most likely to affect those seeking to terminate pregnancies via medication, which accounts for the majority of abortions in Utah and the United States. Abortion medication is approved up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, mostly prescribed at clinics and since a pandemic-era FDA rule change, increasingly offered via telemedicine.The new law takes on added significance amid legal limbo surrounding other abortion laws that have been signed in Utah.Last year's Supreme Court ruling triggered two previously passed pieces of legislation— a 2019 ban on abortion after 18 weeks and a 2020 ban on abortions regardless of trimester, with several exceptions including for instances of risk to maternal health as well as rape or incest reported to the police. The Planned Parenthood Association of Utah sued over the 2020 ban, and in July, a state court delayed implementing it until legal challenges could be resolved. The 18-week ban has since been de facto law.Abortion-access proponents have decried this year’s clinic ban as a back door that anti-abortion lawmakers are using to limit access while courts deliberate. If abortions were restricted regardless of trimester to the exceptional circumstances, closures would have less wide-ranging implications for patients pursuing elective abortions up to 18 weeks of pregnancy.",2023/03/17,,World

Grant Singleton scored seven points during a 19-6 run in which the Knights led by as many as 18 points at the end of the first half.Jordan Gilliam made a jumper that got Texas Southern as close as 10 points with 10:01 left in the second half. The Tigers shot 42% and went 1 for 17 from 3-point distance.Fairleigh Dickinson shot 50% and made 11 3's to advance to the East Region and play top-seeded Purdue in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday.“Our press got us going, and then our half-court defense was excellent. We shared the ball. We played unselfish,” Fairleigh Dickinson coach Tobin Anderson said. “When you play that well, life’s pretty easy, so I thought we played very, very well.”Joe Munden Jr. scored 17 points, Demetre Roberts had 15, Singleton finished with 13 and Sean Moore 10 for Fairleigh Dickinson (20-15).John Walker III led Texas Southern (14-21) with 22 points. Joirdon Karl Nicholas added 10.“Unfortunately, we just didn’t have enough to overcome those guys and their 3-point shooting tonight,” Texas Southern coach Johnny Jones said.A DREAM FOR ANDERSONAround a year ago, Anderson wrapped up his ninth season as head coach of Division II St. Thomas Aquinas.He compiled a 10-7 record in the NCAA Tournament and took the Spartans to the Elite Eight in 2016-17.Anderson arrived at Fairleigh Dickinson in 2022 tasked with improving on a 4-22 season. In less than one year, he and the Knights captured an NCAA Tournament win.“It’s hard to put it into words, really,” Anderson said. “There’s not something I could say. It’s just been an unbelievable ride. We never would’ve dreamed of this 10 months ago.”SETTING THE TONEFairleigh Dickinson led the Northeastern Conference behind an average scoring offense of 77.8 points per game.The Knights started fast, leading by as many as 12 points in the first three minutes. Singleton scored seven of Fairleigh Dickinson final 19 points in the first half that helped keep the Tigers more than three points behind for the rest of the game.“Once you get the butterflies out, you get used to this stage,” Singleton said. “Coach was telling us to have fun. It’s fun being out there, fun playing in a crowd like that with a team that’s so good. We just wanted to get the butterflies out and keep playing.”SMALL BUT MIGHTYThe Knights are the shortest team in Division I, standing at an average height of 6-foot-1.Disregarding size, the Knights had the upper hand on the glass. Fairleigh Dickinson had a 32-31 rebounding advantage and held Texas Southern to 10 offensive rebounds.“We’re the shortest team in Division 1, so we got to make an impact in some way,"" Roberts said. ""I think when we throw the first punch, it’s a good outcome for us so we got to just keep on doing that.”BIG PICTUREFairleigh Dickinson: First-year coach Tobin Anderson turned around a Knights squad that went 4-22 a season ago.“I just think that’s a testament to coach and how much we believe in coach,” Munden said. “We came in from Day 1 and we gelled together and we’re doing pretty well.”Texas Southern: The Tigers missed their first 13 3’s before making their first with 4:52 remaining. Their 28.4% clip this season from 3-point distance ranks worst in the Southwest Athletic Conference, and Texas Southern missed out on winning its third-straight appearance in the First Four.UP NEXTFairleigh Dickinson will play Purdue on Friday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

Ralston, who died in November, did not call a special session in the weeks after the November 2020 election.The five grand jurors — three men and two women — spoke to the newspaper but declined to be named because they were concerned about their safety and privacy.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the Georgia investigation in early 2021, shortly after another recording of a phone call between Trump and a top state official was made public. During that Jan. 2, 2021, phone call, Trump suggested that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could “find” the votes needed to reverse his narrow loss in the state.“All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump said during the call. “Because we won the state.”In a separate recording made public in early 2021, Trump can be heard talking to the lead investigator in Raffensperger's office in December 2020, pressing her to look into Fulton County, saying she would “find things that are gonna be unbelievable.” Trump also told her, “When the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised.”The special grand jury, which was seated in May, heard from about 75 witnesses and considered other evidence before wrapping up its work in December. It did not have the authority to issue indictments but instead produced a report with recommendations for Willis.The foreperson of the special grand jury said in news interviews last month that the panel recommended that numerous people be indicted, but she declined to say who.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836886,Company gets a bit closer to raising $1.1B it needs for mine,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A mining company that wants to extract a collection of rare elements from beneath southeast Nebraska raised funds Wednesday toward its goal of finding the $1.1 billion it needs to build the mine that has been in the works for decades.Shareholders of a special purpose acquisition company called GX Acquisition Corp. II overwhelmingly approved merging with NioCorp, a Centennial, Colorado-based mining company, according to a regulatory filing. About $15 million from the deal will go to NioCorp, the company said.The GXII deal involves one of the risky shell companies once popular on Wall Street before many fell out of favor and had to be liquidated before they ever completed a deal. The SPACs, as they are known, are essentially companies created solely to merge with another business to invest in it.NioCorp shareholders also approved an $81 million financing deal with Yorkville Advisors Global last week.But the mine the company hopes to build about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Omaha near the town of Elk Creek could get an even bigger boost later this year. The Export-Import Bank of the United States recently issued a formal ""letter of interest"" saying that NioCorp may qualify for up to $800 million in financing. If that comes through after the bank conducts a detailed review of the project, NioCorp would have enough cash to build the mine.First the project will have to undergo at least six to nine months of review by the bank. The letter from the Export-Import Bank is just a preliminary step, but it has NioCorp officials extremely optimistic.“It’s unbelievably exciting. Sleep is a little hard to come by for our team right now,” NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. “We see what’s happening and this project is actually going to happen.”NioCorp has raised more than $80 million since 2013 to explore the site, but development of the project dates back to the 1970s when a different company first started drilling samples. The proposed mine is expected to create over 400 jobs if it is built.The main element NioCorp plans to produce is a heat-resistant element called niobium, which is used to make steel lighter and stronger. The mine could also produce scandium that can be used to make aluminum stronger and titanium that would be used in paint production. The company has said analysis of samples from the site shows there is also a significant amount of rare earth elements used in a variety of high-tech products that are primarily produced in China. But it’s not yet clear whether it will be economically feasible to mine those rare earth elements that President Joe Biden wants to see more of produced domestically.The letter the bank issued to NioCorp is one of the first given to a U.S. project since the Export-Import Bank decided last year — in response a Biden executive order — to expand funding to domestic projects proposed by companies planning to export their products. A bank spokeswoman said NioCorp operates in an industry the bank is eager to support because so few critical minerals are produced in the United States.NioCorp officials say getting funding from the bank, which is run by the government under congressional authorization, would help level the playing field with Chinese companies that are heavily subsidized by their government. The Export-Import Bank would likely offer better terms than commercial banks, but NioCorp continues to talk with other banks.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836894,"UN: South Sudan must halt fighting, move faster to elections","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday demanded an immediate end to all fighting in South Sudan and pushed for swift progress by the government to ensure that delayed elections are held peacefully and freely in December 2024.The council resolution, which was approved by a vote of 13-0 with Russia and China abstaining, also extended the more than 17,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan until March 15, 2024.Last week, U.N. special envoy for South Sudan Nicholas Haysom, who heads the peacekeeping mission, called 2023 a “make or break” year for the world’s newest nation, which has been beset by civil war.Haysom told the council it’s possible the country can keep its commitment to hold elections in 21 months but only if there is political will. Most people would argue that at this stage that the political environment doesn’t exist “in which the country can withstand a robust political competition,” Haysom said.There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions, with forces loyal to President Salva Kiir battling those loyal to Vice President Riek Machar.Tens of thousands of people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity.The resolution expresses urgent concern that 2.2 million people are displaced within the country and for the ongoing humanitarian crisis, which has resulted in 9.4 million people currently in need of assistance.South Sudan was supposed to hold elections before February 2023, but that timetable was pushed back last August to December 2024.The Security Council resolution underscores “that elections should be viewed as a phased approach.”It calls for South Sudanese authorities to make immediate progress on key milestones toward peaceful elections, including adopting a constitution and required legislation, approving transitional security arrangements, and establishing an independent electoral commission.The council said the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNMISS, should focus in the near-term on key conditions, among them preventing further escalation of political violence, creating conditions for an inclusive constitutional drafting process, and helping establish ""the inclusive civic space that is a prerequisite to the conduct of free and fair elections.""The resolution reaffirms UNMISS’ primary mandate of protecting civilians as well as creating conditions for the delivery of humanitarian aid, supporting implementation of the peace agreement, and monitoring, investigating and reporting on violations of international humanitarian law and human rights including rape and other forms of sexual violence.New text authorizes peacekeepers “to use all necessary means to ensure effective, timely, and dynamic protection of civilians under threat of physical violence” and “to prevent, deter, and stop violence against civilians, including politically driven violence, particularly in high-risk areas.” It also authorizes them to promptly engage any actor preparing or engaging in attacks against civilians, camps for the displaced and sites where UNMISS is protecting civilians.Ghana’s U.N. Ambassador Harold Agyeman, speaking on behalf of fellow African council members Gabon and Mozambique after the vote, called UNMISS “a stabilizing factor” in South Sudan and critical to addressing South Sudan's socioeconomic, political and security challenges.Russia’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva said Moscow supports UNMISS’ contribution to stabilizing the situation in South Sudan but abstained because the resolution is “intrusive"" and ""risks undermining the peace process at a very important stage for the country where it’s finalizing their transition and moving forward to the elections in December 2024.”China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dai Bing commended UNMISS’ efforts to maintain peace and help accelerate nation-building in South Sudan but said the “harshly worded” and “unbalanced” resolution contains elements “designed to exert lopsided pressure on South Sudan” and so abstained.South Sudan’s U.N. Ambassador Akuei Malwal told the council that “consent” is essential in any U.N. peacekeeping resolution – and if the U.S. had considered proposals from his government and other council members “the text just adopted would have been more balanced and reflective of facts and realities on the ground.”The government recognizes that protecting civilians “is of utmost importance,” he said, and South Sudan also needs humanitarian and economic support in its journey toward lasting peaceAs for preparations for the elections, Malwal said South Sudan sought help from the United Nations and is grateful for the U.N.’s acceptance. But he criticized the council for making electoral assistance “conditional"" in the resolution, ""which does not conform to the spirit and letter received from the United Nations.”,",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836895,"NFL free agency opens with Aaron Rodgers, other QBs on move","After a flurry of moves in the two days ahead of the official start of the NFL free agency period, Aaron Rodgers made the biggest news Wednesday by announcing his intention to play for the New York Jets.Several more players switched teams, others are staying put and a few stars, including Ezekiel Elliott, will be looking for new homes in 2023.But Rodgers is the dominant story of the offseason, and the four-time AP NFL MVP cleared things up during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube and Sirius XM a few hours before the league year started at 4 p.m. EDT.Rodgers said the Packers assured him after the season they wanted him to return, but things changed after he emerged from a five-day darkness retreat. He said he was told by people, mostly players on other teams, that the Packers shopped him around because they want to move on and make 2020 first-round draft pick Jordan Love their starting quarterback.Rodgers said he entered the retreat “90% retiring, 10% playing” but he has since made a decision to play this season.“At this point, as I sit here, I think since Friday, I’ve made it clear that my intention was to play and my intention was to play for the New York Jets,” Rodgers said. “I haven’t been holding anything up at this point. It’s been compensation the Packers are trying to get for me, kind of digging their heels in.”Rodgers, who replaced Brett Favre as the starter in Green Bay after the Hall of Famer was traded to the Jets, spent 18 seasons with the Packers and led them to a Super Bowl title following the 2010 season.Once the teams figure out trade details, Rodgers will be following in Favre’s footsteps by going to New York and trying to lead the Jets to their first championship since another No. 12 — Broadway Joe Namath — delivered a victory that he guaranteed against the Baltimore Colts on Jan. 12, 1969.Former No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield was among other players on the move Wednesday, agreeing to an $8.5 million, one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person, along with all other unnamed sources cited in this story, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement they confirmed hadn't been announced.Mayfield, the top pick by Cleveland in 2018, joins his third team since last July. He gets an opportunity to compete with Kyle Trask to replace Tom Brady, who retired after three seasons with the Buccaneers.Mayfield was 2-8 in 10 starts last season with the Panthers and Rams.Jacoby Brissett, who replaced Mayfield in Cleveland while Deshaun Watson served a suspension, agreed to terms with the Washington Commanders on a one-year contract worth $10 million with $8 million guaranteed, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.Brissett will compete with projected starter Sam Howell, a second-year pro. Brissett threw for 2,608 yards, 12 touchdowns and six interceptions last season for the Browns in 11 starts.Two 1,000-yard rushers are off the market.Running back Jamaal Williams and the Saints agreed on a $12 million, three-year contract, a person familiar with the deal told the AP. Williams led the NFL with 17 rushing touchdowns while running for a career-best 1,066 yards with the Detroit Lions last season.Running back Miles Sanders, coming off his best season with the NFC champion Eagles in which he ran for a career-high 1,269 yards with 11 touchdowns, is heading to Carolina.Carolina also added former Cincinnati Bengals tight end Hayden Hurst on a three-year contract. Hurst caught 52 passes for 414 yards and two touchdowns last season with another 13 receptions for 141 yards and a TD in the playoffs.Late Wednesday night, four-time Pro Bowl tackle Orlando Brown Jr. agreed on a $64.09 million, four-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals.Brown’s agent, Michael Portner, confirmed the deal to the AP. He said it includes a $31 million signing bonus. Brown goes from protecting Patrick Mahomes for the Super Bowl champion Chiefs to blocking for Joe Burrow and the AFC runnerup Bengals.The New England Patriots made their first big pickup of free agency, adding wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. A person with knowledge of the deal said it is for three years and could be worth as much as $33 million.Smith-Schuster confirmed the move in a post on Twitter saying he was “Excited for my next chapter in New England!”Smith-Schuster had 78 receptions for 933 yards and three touchdowns last season for Kansas City. He was held by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry on a play that led to a go-ahead field goal late in the fourth quarter of the Chiefs’ 38-35 win in the Super Bowl.The Browns agreed with safety Juan Thornhill on a three-year contract worth $21 million — $14 million guaranteed — a person familiar with the negotiations told the AP.Thornhill leaves the Super Bowl champion Chiefs after four seasons. He’s the third defensive player to join the Browns in free agency along with run stopper Dalvin Tomlinson and end Ogbonnia Okoronkwo.Six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Fletcher Cox is returning to the Philadelphia Eagles on a $10 million, one-year deal, according to a person familiar with that deal.Veteran safety Jordan Poyer, a two-time second-team All-Pro, is staying in Buffalo on a two-year deal.___AP Pro Football Writers Schuyler Dixon and Dennis Waszak, AP Sports Writers Tom Withers, John Wawrow, Kyle Hightower, Steve Reed, Steve Megargee, Stephen Whyno contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/16,,World

Oshie scored in the shootout to give Washington a 5-4 comeback victory against the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night that may have saved the Capitals' season.“There was some desperation out there that you typically see in the postseason, some big goals out of our big guys,” said Oshie, who also scored in regulation. “Every game has to kind of be a playoff mentality for us, and there’s no time like playoffs when you’re down goals and able to fuel comebacks.”It's still a major uphill climb for Washington to make the playoffs after selling at the trade deadline and dealing with a growing list of injuries. But this win pushed the Capitals three points back of the second and final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference with 12 games to play.“When you look back at the game, you can see the urgency in our game and just the compete level and just the will — the will to win,” said goaltender Charlie Lindgren, who stopped Alex Tuch and Tage Thompson in the shootout after making 23 saves in regulation and overtime. “For us to come back and win the way we did, this might be the best-feeling win all year.”It was only possible after Kuznetsov scored early in the third period and Alex Ovechkin cut the deficit to one with under 10 minutes left in regulation. Then Wilson's scored a 6-on-4 goal with Lindgren pulled for an extra skater with 1:08 left on the clock.It was Washington's first tying or go-ahead goal in the final two minutes this season.After getting Ovechkin back from missing the game Tuesday at the New York Rangers because of a lower-body injury, the Capitals lost defenseman Nick Jensen in the third period. Coach Peter Laviolette said there was no update on Jensen's status.The team got a scare late in the second when trade pickup Rasmus Sandin took a slap shot off his left knee and departed the game, before returning in the third.""When he goes down and comes back it’s a good feeling for our team,"" said Dylan Strome, who had two assists.The feelings were mostly bad in the visiting locker room for the Sabres, who have lost seven of nine to hurt the chances of ending the franchise’s 11-season postseason drought, which is by far the longest in the NHL. But Buffalo's playoff hopes are still alive after picking up a point, and it has extra games left to play compared to other teams in the race, including the Capitals.“Down the stretch, every point matters, so it’s huge and everyone realizes this in the locker room,” Buffalo's Tyson Jost said. ""We care so much and want it and that’s good to see and we’ve just got to keep pushing and focus on the next game and keep putting together wins here.""Still, the OT loss represented a missed opportunity after goals in regulation by Ilya Lyubushkin, JJ Peterka, Jost and Zemgus Girgensons and 35 saves in net by Ukko-Pekka Lukkonen, who lost his stick in the corner before Wilson tied it on a goal Tuch blamed himself for allowing.“We had the lead for the whole game and then a couple bad mistakes — mine in particular,” Tuch said. “It’s unacceptable. I’m not a rookie. I’ve been in this league a couple years now and I know time management. I felt like I let the team down.”UP NEXTSabres: Visit Philadelphia on Friday night.Capitals: Host St. Louis on Friday night.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

Before Wednesday, Miami's most recent double-digit win was Jan. 18 at New Orleans, a 124-98 romp. And the Heat hadn't shot better than 54.5% in any game this season.“We just haven't had many of these this year,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 25 for Memphis, which got 14 from Luke Kennard, 12 from Ziaire Williams and 11 apiece from Desmond Bane and Tyus Jones.“Credit to the Heat,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “They played great tonight. They had an answer for everything we had. I thought our guys gave a great effort tonight. The Heat were just on a different level.”The Heat (38-33) moved within two games of idle Brooklyn (37-30) for the No. 6 spot — and final guaranteed playoff berth — in the Eastern Conference. They ended the third quarter on a 14-0 run, their third-best run of unanswered points all season, and turned a 14-point lead into a 105-77 blowout going into the final 12 minutes.Memphis (41-27) is now tied for second in the Western Conference with Sacramento, which won in Chicago.It was the sixth game that Memphis has played without Ja Morant, who was given an eight-game suspension by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver earlier Wednesday as the penalty for “conduct detrimental to the league” — in this case, the All-Star guard “holding a firearm in an intoxicated state while visiting a Denver area nightclub” and live-streaming it on March 4.The Grizzlies fell to 3-3 in Morant’s absence, but Jenkins said his team is learning plenty by having to use different lineups down the stretch — both because of the All-Star’s suspension and other injury issues.“I’ve always known the togetherness of our team and the competitiveness of our team,” Jenkins said. “Obviously guys are assuming different roles. We haven’t had that come to light over the course of the season until this recent stretch. ... There’s so many things that we’ve seen over the last couple weeks that are going to benefit us moving forward.”TIP-INSGrizzlies: Bane was ejected with 6:44 left in the third quarter after being called for a Flagrant-2 for striking Love just below the waist. ... Memphis’ starters were outscored by Miami’s starters 15-0 from the foul line in the first half. ... The Grizzlies have 14 games left — eight at home, six on the road. ... Kenneth Lofton Jr. scored 10 for Memphis.Heat: Miami’s 28-point lead was its second biggest of the season; the Heat led by 30 at New Orleans on Jan. 18. ... This game ended a run where Miami had eight of nine at home; the Heat now play seven of their final 11 on the road. ... Cody Zeller (broken nose) missed his second straight game. When he plays again — the Heat aren't sure if he'll be ready Saturday at Chicago — it'll be with a mask that he used for the same injury last season.JA VS. MIAMIThis was the third consecutive Miami-Memphis game that Morant missed. He didn’t play in the Grizzlies’ 101-93 win on Dec. 5 because of left ankle soreness, and sat out a 105-90 win at Miami on Dec. 6, 2021 with a sprained left knee. Morant’s last game against the Heat was Oct. 30, 2021, a 129-103 Miami win.The Heat are the only team (other than the Grizzlies, obviously) that Morant has never scored more than 20 points against.WELCOME, JALENNewly acquired Miami Dolphins safety Jalen Ramsey was at the game, along with Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836932,"Japan, South Korea renew ties at Tokyo summit","TOKYO (AP) — Japan and South Korea agreed to resume regular visits between their leaders and take steps to resolve a trade dispute during a long-awaited summit Thursday. Japan's prime minister called their meeting a “big step” to rebuilding the two nations’ security and economic ties as they try to overcome a century of difficult history.The summit could revise the strategic map of northeast Asia. The two U.S. allies, who have long often been at odds over their history, are seeking to form a united front, driven by shared concerns about a restive North Korea and a more powerful China.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol both stressed the importance of improved ties as they opened the summit, hours after a North Korean missile launch and encounters between Japanese and Chinese vessels in disputed waters.LEADERS RENEW SECURITY TIESIn his opening remarks, Kishida said that the meeting will mark the resumption of regular visits between the leaders, which have been on hold for more than a decade. He told a joint news conference that the countries had agreed to resume defense dialogue and vice-ministerial strategic talks, while also restarting a process of trilateral communication among Japan, South Korea and China.“Cherry blossoms just started blooming in Tokyo this week, and after a long winter season, in terms of our bilateral relations, Japan is now able to welcome the president of South Korea for the first time in 12 years,” Kishida said. The two leaders agreed that “reinforcement of Japan-South Korea relations is an urgent task under the current strategic environment,"" he added.Yoon said Thursday's meeting “has special significance as it shows the people of both countries that South Korea-Japan relations are off to a new beginning after being plagued by various issues.” He added that the two countries that share same democratic values “are partners that must cooperate on security, economic issues and global agendas.”“The ever-escalating threat of North Korea’s nuclear missile program poses a huge threat to peace and stability not only in East Asia but also to the (broader) international community,” Yoon said. “South Korea and Japan need to work closely together and in solidarity to wisely counter the threat.”“South Korea’s interests are not zero-sum with Japan’s interests,"" Yoon said. Better bilateral relations would “greatly help both countries deal with their security crises.”The two leaders agreed to increase cooperation in areas such as security, economy, and people to people exchanges, Yoon said.Washington appears to have worked intensively to bring about the summit. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said his country and its two allies had about 40 trilateral meetings and he thinks cooperation in the process helped to build up trust.The White House cheered Kishida's and Yoon’s meeting. “And the United States will continue, of course, to support Japan and the ROK as they take steps to translate this new understanding into enduring progress,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN REACH DEAL TO RESTORE TRADE TIESHours before the summit began, South Korean Trade Minister Lee Chang-yang said that Japan had agreed to lift export controls on South Korea following talks this week, and that South Korea will withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organization once the curbs are removed.Japan and South Korea have long had disputes over the 1910-1945 Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula and atrocities during World War II, which included forced prostitution of “comfort women” for Japanese soldiers, and territorial disputes over a cluster of islands. Ties reached a nadir when the South Korean Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to pay compensation to Korean victims or bereaved relatives in 2018, and Japan imposed trade sanctions on South Korea shortly after.The Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry said it acknowledged improvement in South Korea export controls during the talks and that as a result of Seoul's decision to drop the WTO case, Japan decided to drop restrictions against South Korea and restore the country to the status it had before July 2019.Japanese export controls had covered fluorinated polyimides, which are used in OLED screens for TVs and smartphones, and photoresist and hydrogen fluoride, used for making semiconductors.Lee's ministry said the countries will continue to discuss restoring each other to preferred trade status. The two countries also agreed to begin regular dialogues on economic security, according to Kishida.REGION IN FLUX AS WASHINGTON, BEIJING TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCEThe summit comes as a series of dramatic events underscores what Kishida called a “severe security environment.”Washington will welcome better Japan-South Korea ties, as feuding over historical issues has undermined a U.S. push to reinforce its alliances in Asia. The three countries began joint anti-submarine warfare drills Thursday, joined by Canada and India.North Korean launched a missile early Thursday, just before Yoon departed for Tokyo. North Korea said Friday that the intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which was supervised by leader Kim Jong Un, was intended as a warning to the largest U.S.-South Korean joint military drills in years. China’s dispute with Japan over tiny islands in the East China Sea also heated up as both sides accused the other of violating their maritime territory Thursday. The summit follows a series of Chinese diplomatic successes in regions traditionally seen as more influenced by the U.S. Honduras announced Wednesday that it would end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of China, marking progress in Beijing's efforts to isolate the autonomously governed island, while last week Saudi Arabia and Iran announced a surprise deal to renew diplomatic ties brokered by China.DINNER, BUSINESS TALKS FOLLOW SUMMITKishida and Yoon had dinner and informal talks after the summit, according to Kishida’s office. Kishida hosted a two-part dinner serving Yoon's favorite dishes: “sukiyaki” beef stew at a Japanese restaurant, then “omu-rice,” or rice topped with omelet, at another. One of the photos released by the Japanese government showed smiling leaders toasting with beer at the second place.The outcome of their meeting was largely welcomed by the Japanese as a first step of cooperation. “Japan and South Korea need to have their normalized relations contribute not only for themselves but for the benefit of the entire international society,” Japan's largest newspaper Yomiuri said in an editorial Friday.Yoon faces criticism at home from people who say he compromised too much, and rallies in Seoul opposing the deal were attended by a few dozen people.After his arrival Thursday, Yoon attended a reception hosted by the Korean Residents’ Union in Japan. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Korean residents of Japan, many of them descendants of those forcibly brought there during the war, called for better ties as relations affect their lives.On Thursday, a powerful Japanese business lobby, Keidanren, or the Japan Business Federation, also announced that it and its South Korean counterpart have agreed to each establish private funds for bilateral projects such as youth exchanges. Keidanren said they aim to start with funding worth 100 million yen ($752,420).A dozen business leaders traveling with Yoon are to meet their Japanese counterparts on Friday.___Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836933,MacKinnon's shootout goal gives Avs 2-1 win over Maple Leafs,"TORONTO (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon was the only scorer in the shootout as the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 2-1 on Wednesday night.Mikko Rantanen scored in regulation for Colorado (38-22-6).MacKinnon's five-game goal streak came to an end, but his play carried Colorado to the win.“Been playing awesome,” Avalanche defenseman Bowen Byram said of MacKinnon, who entered with 15 goals in his last 15 games. “He’s the guy that our team follows. When he’s going, I feel like everyone else is sharper.”Alexandar Georgiev made 17 saves for injury-ravaged Colorado (38-22-6), which has found its game since the All-Star break and climbed within five points of the Central Division-leading Dallas Stars with two games in hand.“That dedication to the way we have to play to have success is the key to it,” Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said. “Some nights we’re as good as we want to be. Seems like recently we’ve wanted to win these hockey games. We know they’re important. Winning the division isn’t the be all, end all. But certainly to have short-term goals like that and chase down the teams that are in front of us is part of it.“It’s part of playing with a little bit of pressure, even if it’s self-induced.”Morgan Rielly scored for Toronto (40-18-9). Ilya Samsonov stopped 28 shots.“There wasn’t a whole lot that we gave up,” Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said. “They checked extremely hard to show you what a Stanley Cup-winning team does in terms of the defending.“They’re well-known for the offense that they can generate with their elite players, but they defend extremely hard and make it difficult on you to get to their net.”After a frantic overtime in which both teams had terrific chances, MacKinnon beat Samsonov on a nice deke on the Avalanche’s second shot.Georgiev then denied Mitch Marner for Colorado, which improved to 4-4 in shootouts. Toronto dropped to 0-2 in shootouts.Coming off A 4-3 home loss to Buffalo on Monday in which Toronto held a 2-0 lead late in the second period, the Maple Leafs opened the scoring three minutes into the first when Rielly scored his third, after earlier hitting the post.The Avalanche responded on a power play later in the period, when Rantanen’s pass went in off Toronto defenseman Jake McCabe for his 44th of the season.Samsonov stopped Valeri Nichushkin on a short-handed breakaway in the second before Cale Makar nearly went end-to-end on a rush, but the puck trickled wide.Georgiev matched his Russian counterpart at the other end by denying Rielly on a power play and Calle Jarnkrok from in close to keep things even through 40 minutes.After the Maple Leafs killed two penalties early in the third, William Nylander and Auston Matthews had a good chance on Georgiev.RANTANEN RISINGRatanen's 44 goals are the most by a Finnish-born player since Teemu Selanne scored 48 in 2006-07.EARLY STARTMarner factored in on the game-opening goal for the 19th time this season, which trails only MacKinnon (20) for the most among all players.WAITING ON GABEAvalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog, who has yet to play this season, continues to work his way back from knee surgery.Colorado head coach Jared Bednar said following Tuesday’s practice there’s still no timeline for the winger’s return.“Making progress,” Bednar said. “Gonna keep grinding to get back as soon as he can. I don’t know when that will be. I don’t know if it’ll be regular season, beginning of post-season. It’s all going to be up to him.”SCHENN’S BACKLuke Schenn returned to Scotiabank Arena as a member of the Maple Leafs for the first time in more than a decade.Acquired from Vancouver prior to the trade deadline, the veteran defenseman rejoined the club after his wife recently gave birth to the couple’s third child.The Leafs selected Schenn, who didn’t dress against Colorado, with the fifth overall pick in 2008 before trading him to Philadelphia in 2012.“Coming into this dressing room, it’s surreal,” the 33-year-old said Wednesday morning. “You appreciate what it means to play in Toronto, but not to the extent I do now.”LOSING LEHKONENArtturi Lehkonen will be out at least four weeks with a broken finger suffered in Colorado’s 8-4 victory over Montreal on Monday, adding to the club’s season-long injury misery.The winger was scheduled to have surgery Wednesday in Colorado.“One of our identity guys,” Bednar said. “One of the hardest-working guys on the ice in every single game.”UP NEXTAvalanche: At Ottawa on Thursday in the third game of a four-game trip.Maple Leafs: Host Carolina on Friday in the finale of a four-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836934,California regulators could decide oil profits penalty,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he wants state regulators to decide whether to impose the nation's first penalty on oil companies for price gouging, pivoting after months of negotiations with legislative leaders failed to reach an agreement on a bill aimed at reining in the state's notoriously high gas prices.Gas prices in California are always more expensive than the rest of the country because the state has higher taxes and fees than other states and requires a special blend of gasoline that is better for the environment but more expensive to make.But last summer, the average price for a gallon of gas in California was more than $2.60 higher than the national average — a difference state regulators said could not be explained simply by taxes and fees. Meanwhile, oil companies recorded supersized profits.Newsom, a Democrat, responded by asking state lawmakers to pass a law that would impose hefty fines on oil companies if their profits surpassed a certain threshold — with all of the money generated from the fines going back to drivers. The bill was so important to Newsom that he took the rare step of calling lawmakers into a special session to pass it, a maneuver that allows them to focus on just one issue instead of being distracted by hundreds of other bills in a regular session.But the proposal never got traction in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, where the oil industry is one of the top contributors to lawmakers' campaign accounts.Wednesday, the governor announced he was changing course and instead will ask lawmakers to empower the California Energy Commission to decide whether such a penalty is necessary and, if it is, how much it would be. The commission would be aided by a new, independent agency made up of experts, economists and lawyers that would have subpoena power to monitor the gasoline market and make recommendations.If the commission imposed any fines, it would be up to the Legislature to decide what to do with the money.“What we’re asking for is simple: transparency and accountability to drive the oil industry out of the shadows,” Newsom said. “Now it’s time to choose whether to stand with California families or with Big Oil in our fight to make them play by the rules.”The modified proposal means it's possible California wouldn't penalize oil companies at all. But it would give Newsom more control over what happens because he appoints all five members of the California Energy Commission, who must also be confirmed by the Democratic-controlled state Senate.That did not win over the oil industry, which has been battling Newsom over this proposal and a host of other environmental proposals aimed at transitioning the nation's most populous state away from fossil fuels.“It sounds like the governor wants to create a new state agency and empower unelected bureaucrats to impose more taxes and increase costs,” said Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, a nonprofit trade association that represents the industry. “At the end of the day, this proposal does not solve Californians' gasoline supply problem and will likely lead to the very same unintended consequences legislators have reiterated to the Governor: less investment, less supply, and higher costs for Californians.”State legislative leaders have not yet agreed to Newsom's proposal. But the governor's office expects lawmakers to hold public hearings on it soon, ideally before the summer months when gas prices usually increase. The Newsom administration did not view the new proposal as a concession, saying the governor made the changes after consulting with experts.“We feel like this is stronger from where we started,"" said Dana Williamson, Newsom's chief of staff. “It is the only one of its kind in the country. And it’s really going to set up a watchdog entity that is going to watch the industry every single day. And then the (Energy Commission) will be able to then act upon the findings.”Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, a Democrat, said lawmakers are “continuing to work toward resolution on the Governor's oil price proposal."" Republicans, who don't control enough seats to influence votes in the Legislature, decried the proposal as a tax that would inevitably be passed on to drivers.“If Democrats give unelected bureaucrats the authority to impose this new tax, they will be responsible for the shortages, rationing, gas lines and price spikes that come with it,” Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher said.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836936,TikTok dismisses calls for Chinese owners to sell stakes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — TikTok was dismissive Wednesday of reports that the Biden administration was calling for its Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the popular video-sharing app, saying such a move wouldn't help protect national security.The company was responding to a report in The Wall Street Journal that said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., part of the Treasury Department, was threatening a U.S. ban on the app unless its owners, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., divested.“If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn’t solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said. ""The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing.”The Journal report cited anonymous “people familiar with the matter.” The Treasury Department and the White House’s National Security Council declined to comment.Late last month, the White House gave all federal agencies 30 days to wipe TikTok off all government devices.The Office of Management and Budget called the guidance a “critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data.” Some agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, already have restrictions in place. The White House already does not allow TikTok on its devices.Congress passed the “No TikTok on Government Devices Act” in December as part of a sweeping government funding package. The legislation does allow for TikTok use in certain cases, including for national security, law enforcement and research purposes.Meanwhile, lawmakers in both the House and Senate have been moving forward with legislation that would give the Biden administration more power to clamp down on TikTok.Rep. Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, has been a vocal critic of the app, saying the Chinese Communist Party is using it to “manipulate and monitor its users while it gobbles up Americans’ data to be used for their malign activities.”“Anyone with TikTok downloaded on their device has given the CCP a backdoor to all their personal information. It’s a spy balloon into your phone,” the Texas Republican said.TikTok remains extremely popular and is used by two-thirds of teens in the U.S. But there is increasing concern that Beijing could obtain control of American user data that the app has obtained.The company has been dismissive of the ban for federal devices and has noted that it is developing security and data privacy plans as part of the Biden administration’s ongoing national security review.",2023/03/16,,World

They were up 108-101 when Embiid was whistled for plowing into Evan Mobley while making a jumper.As Cleveland fans began to celebrate Embiid's apparent disqualification, Sixers coach Doc Rivers immediately challenged the call, which was overturned after a replay review and the superstar was allowed to stay on the floor.“I thought he flopped,"" Rivers said. “I called that one right away. I didn’t even look at my (replay) guy. I thought there was a good chance they would overturn it. I didn’t think they would foul Joel out on that.”Afterward, Embiid said he was confident the call would be changed.“I thought it was a good call (to overturn),"" Embiid said. ""I never extended my arm. Right before the hit, you could see he was already starting to flop. I watch basketball every day and I was pretty confident they would call it the other way.”Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff saw it differently.“It’s clear as day that’s a charge,"" Bickerstaff said. “There’s no doubt about it. The call was made on the floor. He stands between him and the basket. Evan laid it all out on the line. Guys ought to be reward for that. If you stick your nose in there and scarifce your body, you should be rewarded for the correct play.”Bickerstaff wasn't satisfied with the explanation he received from officiating crew of John Goble, Nick Bucher and Derek Richardson.“They said there wasn’t enough contact to be a charge,” said Bickerstaff. ""I mean, there’s a 300-pound man who bowls through your chest, it’s a charge. It’s that simple.”With Embiid in foul trouble, the Cavs attacked the rim and closed to 110-107 before Maxey drained a 3-pointer and the 76ers made five straight free throws in the final 51 seconds to close it out.Philadelphia went 2-1 vs. Cleveland and wins any tiebreaker for playoff seeding.Caris LeVert scored 24 points and Donovan Mitchell added 21 for the Cavs, who were playing the second night of a back-to-back. Cleveland was without center Jarrett Allen, who missed his third straight game with a bruised right eye.The Cavs have tried various defensive schemes — double- and triple-teams, shadowing — to try and slow the versatile Embiid, a rare big man who can play out on the perimeter and inside.“This is a unique human being we're talking about,” Bickerstaff said before the game. “We'll keep throwing things at him and see if something sticks.”It didn't start well for Cleveland as Embiid drew two fouls on the Cavs in the first 43 seconds.But although he was giving up 65 pounds, Mobley showed no fear while guarding the massive center and he got plenty of help as the Cavs collapsed on Embiid any time he touched the ball near the hoop.Embiid made his trips to the foul line count, sinking all 10 attempts. Harden went 9 of 12 from the line.“Not taking anything away from those guys, they’re phenomenal basketball players and they know how to play within the rules,” Bickerstaff said. “I was with James for four years in Houston and he’s a master at manipulating he rules, and Joel does the same.”TIP-INS76ers: F Jalen McDaniel (bruise hip) missed his first game this season with an injury after being hurt Sunday against Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836941,Thousands of LA school district workers to hold 3-day strike,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tens of thousands of workers in the Los Angeles Unified School District will strike for three days next week over stalled contract talks and teachers will join them, likely shutting down the nation's second-largest school system, union leaders announced Wednesday.The strike was set to begin Tuesday. It was announced at a rally by the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 30,000 teachers' aides, bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers and other support staff.United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing 35,000 teachers, counselors and other staff, expressed solidarity.“Educators will be joining our union siblings on the picket lines,” a UTLA tweet said.Teachers waged a six-day strike in 2019 over pay and contract issues but schools remained open.This time, schools would likely close and there wouldn't be any access to virtual learning, Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho said in an email to parents on Monday.“We would simply have no way of ensuring a safe and secure environment where teaching can take place,” Carvalho said.On Wednesday, Carvalho accused the union of refusing to negotiate and said that he was prepared to meet “day and night” to prevent a strike, which he said would harm students already struggling to regain academic ground lost when classrooms were closed and they were forced to learn remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.At a news conference, he said averting a strike ""will avoid keeping kids home, will avoid kids from going hungry in our community without access to the food they get in school.”“We are calling on them to come to the table for staff and students, right now,” he said in a later statement.The SEIU says district support staffers earn, on average, about $25,000 per year and many live in poverty because of low pay or limited work hours while struggling with inflation and the high cost of housing in LA County. The union is asking for a 30% raise. Teachers want a 20% pay hike over two years.The district has made what it called an historic offer to the SEIU of a $15 wage increase, some of it retroactive, and 9% in retention bonuses.The strike has wide support among union members. Thousands of people, many dressed in red, rallied Wednesday outside City Hall, holding signs, chanting, and garnering support in the hours before the strike date was announced.The district has more than 500,000 students. It serves Los Angeles and all or part of 25 other cities and unincorporated county areas.SEIU members have been working without a contract since June 2020 and the contract for teachers expired in June 2022. The unions decided last week to stop accepting extensions to their contracts.",2023/03/16,,World

An update on how long he will be out will be provided after the surgery.Iguodala missed 57 of the first 60 games due to hip issues. He returned March 5 against the Los Angeles Lakers and had played in five games until the latest injury. He was averaging 2.1 points and 2.1 rebounds on the season.“It’s a huge loss. Andre has made a big impact since he returned a few weeks ago,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""Our defense just gets dramatically better the second he steps on the floor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836943,Mets' Edwin Díaz injured celebrating Puerto Rico's WBC win,"MIAMI (AP) — New York Mets fans began the year dreaming about a World Series closed out by Edwin Díaz.For now, they’re facing a potential nightmare.In a startling scene, Díaz was taken off the field in a wheelchair after injuring his right knee celebrating Puerto Rico’s victory over the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic on Wednesday night.There was no immediate word on how severely Díaz was hurt — the Mets said he will undergo more tests Thursday. But the way his teammates stood around him in shock didn't look encouraging.The injury was exactly what big league teams and their fans fear the most when their high-priced stars go play for their countries in the WBC. Díaz signed a $102 million, five-year deal in November.No matter what, this setback was sure to set off spirited debate about whether the tournament, which started in 2006 and was held every three or four years until a cancellation in 2021, is worth it.“Those things, they can happen to anybody at any given time,” said Los Angeles Dodgers star outfielder Mookie Betts, who was playing for the United States when Díaz was hurt.“You can always try to place blame on the WBC, but that was just a freak accident that could happen to anyone at any given time,"" he said.Mets teammates Pete Alonso and Jeff McNeil also were with the U.S. team in a game against Colombia when a coach told them about Díaz.""It’s just really heartbreaking to hear about Edwin,"" Alonso said after a 3-2 win in Phoenix.“Every day you show up to the yard, there’s a possibility of getting hurt. There’s hazard in the job. Anyone can get hurt at any given time. Anything can happen,"" he said. ""That’s the risk we run playing baseball. We’re athletes and injuries are unfortunately part of the game.”It's true that injuries can happen anytime in baseball. Infielder Gavin Lux tore his knee in a recent exhibition game for the Dodgers and is out for the season. Los Angeles teammate Freddie Freeman hurt his hamstring this week playing for Canada.Still, the intensity of many WBC games is what often scares MLB teams about seeing their players in this event.“Obviously there’s risk involved,” three-time AL MVP Mike Trout of the Angels said after helping the U.S. win. “You’re still playing baseball, and it’s spring training.”Díaz was swarmed by teammates after pitching a perfect ninth inning in a 5-2 win that clinched Puerto Rico a spot in the WBC quarterfinals. The group was jumping together in the infield when the right-hander collapsed to the ground, and he immediately reached for his right leg.As famous for his trumpet-driven entrance music as his dominant pitching, Díaz was in tears and did not put any weight on his right leg as a coach and trainer helped him limp toward the dugout.Díaz’s brother, Reds pitcher Alexis Díaz, was also crying as Edwin was put in a chair and wheeled away. Mets teammate and Puerto Rico shortstop Francisco Lindor stood nearby with his hands on his head.“Nightmare scenario for Mets fans and the WBC,” tweeted longtime reliever Jerry Blevins. “Edwin Díaz seems to have been really injured after celebrating a win. This is the big fears mlb players & teams have with participating in the Tournament.”Díaz is critical to the Mets' World Series aspirations. Without him, newcomer David Robertson probably would be next in line for the closer's spot.Puerto Rico manager Yadier Molina said Díaz underwent testing at the stadium.“I was hugging our coaches in the dugout. Then when we looked up, Edwin was on the ground,” Molina said. ""I didn’t know. I didn’t know how to act, I didn’t know how to — what to say. I mean, I didn’t know. It got me for a surprise.“Like I said in the dugout, it sucks, sorry, but when you see a guy that works so hard like Edwin, I mean when you see him on the ground like that, I mean it just is sad.”The 28-year-old Díaz is a two-time All-Star and two-time reliever of the year. He converted 32 saves for the Mets last season with a 1.31 ERA and 118 strikeouts in 62 innings.He's become a sensation in New York for his pitching and his dance-inducing entrance music that leads with a rousing trumpet riff. Díaz comes out of the bullpen at Citi Field to “Narco” by Blasterjaxx and Timmy Trumpet. He even had trumpets painted onto his cleats for the WBC.Díaz is hardly the first pro athlete injured during a rowdy celebration. Los Angeles Angels slugger Kendrys Morales broke his leg in 2010 taking a big leap onto home plate after hitting a game-ending grand slam — manager Mike Scioscia subsequently outlawed bouncing scrums at home plate.Chicago Cubs pitcher Ryan Dempster broke a toe catching his foot in a dugout railing while rushing the field in 2009, and the Minnesota Twins' Denny Hocking had his nose broken by overzealous teammates after his first walk-off home run in 2001. Perhaps most famously of all, Arizona Cardinals kicker Bill Gramatica ended his rookie season in 2001 by tearing his ACL jumping up and down after a field goal.But those were games that counted for their teams in regular-season play. Díaz’s injury is sure to fuel those who say it’s a bad idea for big league teams to loan out players for international play.The WBC tournament is being played as MLB players ramp up for the start of the season at the end of March. The WBC has rules in place — in addition to some request from MLB teams — to try and protect players, particularly pitchers, from getting injured.Pitchers for all countries are limited to 65 pitches per outing in the first round. If a player throws more than 50 pitches in an outing, he can’t pitch for the next four days. If he throws more than 30, he can’t pitch the next day. Finally, if he throws on back-to-back days, he must sit out the next day.But few could have imagined Wednesday's scene.Puerto Rico center fielder Kiké Hernandez said the locker room was quiet after Diaz’s injury.“It's a certain point that its bigger than the game,” Hernandez said. “It’s very unfortunate that it happened. As excited as we were about the game and all that, that’s one of our brothers.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

They remained a game ahead of Philadelphia for second in the Eastern Conference and closed within 2 1/2 games of Milwaukee for first.“I thought our physicality, that competitive nature was at a 10 and we just have to continue to execute the margins in clutch situations,” Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. “We won most of them tonight.”Anthony Edwards had 28 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, which has lost three of four. The Timberwolves started the day seventh in the West, one game ahead of Oklahoma City, Dallas and the Los Angeles Lakers.Kyle Anderson scored 15 for Minnesota and Naz Reid added 15 off the bench.“I like the way we fought tonight,” Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert said. “The way we stayed locked in on defense, playing defensively. Not having a lot of things going our way. But we, for the most part, kept our composure. Kept our physicality throughout the whole game. I’m really proud of the way we played.”Trailing 101-99, Edwards missed a 3 with 32.2 seconds left that would have given the Timberwolves their first lead since the first quarter. Grant Williams collected an offensive rebound for Boston and won a jump ball after being tied up.Tatum finished with a pair of free throws to put the game away. Edwards and Anderson were then ejected with 1.7 seconds left after arguing with officials.“For us to be able to win games with adversity, it’s going to be key for us,” Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. “We’re going to get everybody’s best shot. For us, it’s just to keep playing. Teams are going to go on runs and we’ve just got to do a good job of taking the blow and then delivering our own.”Mazzulla went the length of the court to call a timeout while Williams was tied up. Official Brian Forte told a pool reporter that the officiating crew didn’t assess a technical foul on Mazzulla because they didn’t see him cross the mid-court line.Forte also said that Edwards was ejected for “directly questioning the integrity of the officiating crew” and Anderson “was ejected after being assessed his second technical foul for multiple profanities directed at the officiating crew.”Wolves coach Chris Finch said, “I just thought it was just rough. You know, it was really rough out there. A little unbalanced at times.”PHYSICAL PLAYBrown was assessed a technical foul in the first half after an altercation with Gobert. Brown, who is wearing a mask after sustaining a facial fracture, seemed to take offense after getting hit with an elbow from Gobert.Gobert was given a Flagrant I foul in the second half after he challenged a dunk from Tatum. Gobert hit Tatum with his hands as he elevated and Tatum fell hard to the court.Moments earlier, Gobert also got a technical foul for hanging on the rim after a dunk.TOWNS GETTING CLOSERThe Wolves released an injury update on Karl-Anthony Towns on Wednesday and said the big man is expected to return “in the coming weeks” from his right calf strain.

The Rockets countered with an 8-0 run, with the first five points from rookie Jabari Smith Jr., to push it to 96-83.The Rockets were up by eight with 7.2 seconds to go before Malik Beasley hit a 3 for the Lakers to cut the lead to 114-109. Austin Reaves then got a steal and Porter fouled him with 0.3 seconds remaining. It was ruled a Flagrant-1 foul after a review, but Reaves made just 1 of 2 free throws and Houston held on.Porter was disappointed that Houston let it get that close in the final seconds.“We got a little comfortable,” he said. “We were up like eight or 10 ... when our youth kind of showed right there. We'll learn from that. We've got to stay focused until the last buzzer.”It’s the second straight victory for the Western Conference-worst Rockets, who beat Boston on Monday night.Already without LeBron James because of an injury, the Lakers were also missing Anthony Davis against Houston. Davis, who had 35 points and 17 rebounds in a win over New Orleans on Tuesday night, isn’t playing both games of back-to-back per doctors’ orders after coming back from a right foot injury.“Houston — young team — and regardless of what their record is, they came to play,” coach Darvin Ham said. “And we felt them. They made us feel them in terms of them attacking the paint, them getting hits... (and) we should have been the ones playing with that type of edge.”Reaves had 24 points off the bench and D’Angelo Russell added 18 as the Lakers lost for the second time in three games as they fight to stay in line for one of the last playoff spots in the Western Conference.Porter had 18 points before halftime despite missing the last two minutes of the second quarter after sustaining a cut about his left eye. He was bleeding profusely as he held a towel to the cut as he walked to the locker room. He returned to start the third quarter with a band-aid covering the cut.He said that he received some stitches and had glue put on the cut at halftime.Coach Stephen Silas was impressed with Porter's peformance.“He was great right from the start,” he said. “He was aggressive. He was making plays for his teammates... just a solid, complete game.”Houston took advantage of the absence of Davis to dominate in the paint where the team outscored the Lakers 78-46.The Rockets led by as many as 18 in the first half and had a 62-48 lead at halftime. That deficit came a night after Los Angeles led 75-40 at halftime after making a franchise-record 15 3-pointers in the first two quarters.The Lakers used a 9-2 run to get to 79-74 with about three minutes left in the third quarter. Troy Brown Jr. made the first five points in that stretch and Wenyen Gabriel capped it with a basket.But the Los Angeles offense went cold after that and didn’t score for the rest of the quarter as Houston got baskets from Jae’Sean Tate and Jalen Green to lead 83-74 after three.TIP-INSLakers: James was out for the ninth straight game with a right foot injury. Mo Bamba missed a fifth straight game with a sprained left ankle. … Beasley had 16 points. ... Jarred Vanderbilt added 13 points with 11 rebounds. ... Gabriel had a career-high 15 rebounds.Rockets: Alperen Sengun had 13 points and nine rebounds in his return after sitting out Monday night with a groin injury. … Kenyon Martin Jr. had 16 points and eight rebounds. ... Green scored 11 points.HOUSTON'S GROWTHDespite his team's record this season, Silas has seen growth in the Rockets in recent weeks.“All of them have some sort of chip on their shoulders it seems,” he said. “They are young but they’re all competitive… and they really want to do the right thing. Sometimes we just don't because we're young, but they're a fun group to coach because they're all good guys.”UP NEXTLakers: Host Dallas on Friday night.Rockets: Host New Orleans on Friday and Sunday nights. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

Human rights groups say that there have been many instances of prisoner abuses and that innocent people have been swept up in police raids.The government announced the mass inmate transfer with a slickly produced video posted on social media. It showed prisoners forced to run barefoot and handcuffed down stairways and over bare ground, clad only in regulation white shorts. They were then forced to sit with their legs locked in closely clumped groups in cells.Gustavo Villatoro, the government's minister for justice and peace, said the suspected gang members would never return to the streets, even though about 57,000 of those arrested are still awaiting formal charges or a trial.“They are never going to return to the communities, the neighborhoods, the barrios, the cities of our beloved El Salvador,” Villatoro said.Only about 3,500 people swept up in the crackdownhave been released so far.Bukele, who revels in taking a contrarian stance and once described himself as “world's coolest dicator,” wrote in his Twitter account that “there are now 4,000 gang members in the world's most criticized prison.”Dubbed the Terrorism Confinement Center, the prison was inaugurated in February and already holds about 2,000 suspected gang members. It is a sprawling campus 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of San Salvador, the capital, that could eventually house up to 40,000 inmates.Congress must still approve the extension of the antigang measures, but legislators are expected to do, as they have done a dozen times before.Bukele requested the special powers to pursue the gangs last March 27, following a surge in gang violence in which 62 people were killed in a single day across the country. Streets gangs like MS-13 and Barrio 18 have long killed and extorted money from residents in El Salvador.The measures have reduced killings and have proved widely popular among most Salvadorans. Officials say that since the crackdown began, there have been 200 days with no homicides at all.Under the special powers, the right to association is suspended, police don’t have to tell someone being arrested the reason or inform them of their rights. Someone arrested does not have a right to a lawyer and can be held for 15 days without seeing a judge rather than the previous 72 hours.The local rights group Cristosal documented 3,344 cases of human rights abuses in the first 11 months of the state of emergency.",2023/03/16,,World

The sixth-year guard is on a roll, scoring 2O or more points in 14 of his last 16 games and averaging over 30 in that span.And his confidence, especially when game is on the line?“I think it's through the roof,” Fox said ""I have a whole group of guys and coaching staff who believe in me. They have confidence in me taking the last shot, so the least I can do is go out there and have confidence in myself.”Fox cooly hit his 25-foot winner before the Bulls could double-team him. The buzzer-beater improved the Kings to 41-27 and moved them a step closer to their first winning record and playoff berth since 2005-06.Domantas Sabonis had his second straight triple-double and 11th of the season — finishing with 14 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists — and Sacramento roared back in the second half with hot 3-point shooting.“You know Fox is the most clutch player out there,” Kings coach Mike Brown said. “And Domas with his ability to bring to the table triple-double after triple-double after triple-double and we get a win, both those guys should be on an all-NBA team.”Malik Monk had 19 points, going 5 for 8 on 3s as the Kings overcame a 10-point halftime deficit to win for the fourth time in five and improve to 9-2 in their last 11.“We didn't play well and we found a way to win tonight,” Brown said. “The biggest thing was the unforced turnovers and our spacing wasn't great.”The Kings turned the ball over 19 times compared to 14 for Chicago.DeMar DeRozan led Chicago with 33 points and hit a 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 11.6 seconds left to cut the Kings' lead to 114-113.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836984,Scientists create mice from two fathers,"Japanese scientists have created eggs from the cells of male mice and produced healthy mice pups.The scientific journal Nature published details of the study, led by Professor Katsuhiko Hayashi of Kyushu University and Osaka University, on Wednesday.In a commentary published alongside the study, Diana Laird, a stem cell and reproductive expert at the University of California, and her colleague Jonathan Bayerl said the work ""opens up new avenues in reproductive biology and fertility research.""In the future, it might be possible to reproduce endangered mammals from a single male.""It might even provide a template for enabling more people,"" such as male same-sex couples, ""to have biological children, while circumventing the ethical and legal issues of donor eggs,"" they wrote.Hayashi himself, however, warned the research was at a very early stage.""There are big differences between mice and humans,"" he told a human gene-editing summit at the Crick Institute in London last week.A Chinese study in 2018 reported that mice with two mothers were born, but when they tried it with male mice, their pups survived only a few days.The Japanese scientists used a different approach, and the pups in their study appeared to grow normally and were able to become parents themselves in the usual way.The technique involves first taking a skin cell from male mice's tails and transforming them into a stem cell.Then, through a process that involved growing them and treating them with a drug, they converted male mouse stem cells into female cells and produced functional egg cells.Finally, they fertilized those eggs and implanted the embryos into female mice.Laird described it as ""an important step in both stem cell and reproductive biology.""The research is still in its early stages and the method is still extremely inefficient.Only seven of 630 embryos transferred to surrogate mothers produced living pups.Researchers have not determined why only a tiny fraction of the embryos placed into surrogate mice survived.They also stressed that it's still too early to know if the protocol would work in human stem cells.In her commentary, Laird also said scientists need to be mindful of the mutations and errors that may be introduced in a culture dish before using stem cells to make eggs.lo/sms (AP, dpa)",2023/03/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837000,Microsoft supports Inchcape on its data-driven digitalization journey with Azure,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 16 March 2023 - In a digital-first world, enterprises are generating data at breakneck speed as they integrate technology into all areas of the business to adapt to market and digital disruptions.   Over the last few years, market changes in the automotive sector have created a growing value gap between manufacturers and consumers. Industry disruptions such as changing customer digital behavior, stricter ESG regulations, and the boom in demand for electric and hybrid vehicles have led companies to rethink their digital transformation strategy, with data and analytics at the heart of it.   To set the foundation for analytics success, global automotive distributor Inchcape turned to Microsoft for its business needs. Inchcape distributes and markets vehicles of some of the world's most popular brands like Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW to over 40 countries across six continents, including Singapore.   Hitting the accelerator on data transformation   Recognizing the value in embracing data-driven digitalization for predictive analytics in customer engagement, pricing optimization, and demand forecasting, the company established a new strategy called 'Accelerate', which had digital transformation at its heart. To build out its data and analytics capabilities, Inchcape sought out Microsoft Singapore's partner, Tiger Analytics Inc, to put its digital strategy into action.   Inchcape's platform of choice for a seamless omni-channel transformation was Microsoft Azure to leverage the company's existing SQL-based systems. Using Azure meant that migration and deployment of workloads could be automated, faster, and more agile compared to other platforms. In addition, Inchcape could access Databricks and Data Factory to facilitate efficient data transformation.   Navigating data-driven digitalization with Azure   Inchcape identified three areas for initial use cases for its data models, utilizing them as tools for making better business decisions. The first was a lead scoring tool centered around car sales built using the Azure Databricks Data Analytics Platform for customers. The solution allowed Inchcape to determine customers by their 'digital body language' based on website interactions, showroom visits and sales history.   The second use case was for after-sales churn prediction, which was tied to service warranties. By analyzing warranty and car servicing data, Inchcape could engage with customers proactively before they decide to leave.   The third was used in parts pricing optimization and profit maximization, which are tied to transactions with dealerships and shops. By evaluating parts transaction data, Inchcape can determine better opportunities to maximize product price elasticity.   Together with Tiger Analytics, Inchcape built a data analytics center of excellence, achieving a centralized approach to harnessing the power of data. ""Data and analytics are at the heart of our Accelerate strategy to set our business up for success. Our leaders empowered us to build a central analytics team and pursue a modern analytical architecture that provides real-time and event-driven business intelligence and predictive analytics insights,"" says Ram Thilak, Global Head of Data Science & Analytics at Inchcape. ""Effective use of Microsoft products helped accelerate delivery and future-proof Inchcape's data management strategy,"" says Lakshmi Vaideeswaran, VP and Client Partner for Inchcape.   ""For instance, having centralized data resulted in a 75 percent improvement in data accessibility across the organization, which fed into day-to-day decision-making. Furthermore, the implementation of Azure Purview helped Inchcape manage metadata, eliminate KPI discrepancies, and support end-to-end data pipelines for advanced analytics and reporting. Azure also provided Inchcape with visibility over cloud use so the company could scale up or down cost-efficiently.""   Charting sustainable growth with analytics   As the company plans to expand its analytics capabilities across the business, Inchcape's central analytics team has grown from 20 to 150 employees globally.   Inchcape also established a long-term analytics roadmap to unlock the true value of data and drive its digital strategy well into the future. Learning from the initial use cases, the company is now evaluating 20 more possible use cases to establish how data can be leveraged for business intelligence.   Lee Hui Li, Managing Director of Microsoft Singapore said ""data and AI continue to play a prominent role in supporting businesses on their digitalization journey. Microsoft's tools and technologies are designed to benefit everyone, and that includes helping our customers better organize and make sense of their data. As a global leader in cloud and digital technology, we are proud to partner enterprises across industries and help them gear up for success, as we empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.""

Skincare manufacturer Jourdeness Cooperation spent NT$3 billion (US$98 million) on building fountains, the castle, and other facilities.The ongoing two-month-long purple-themed festival features thousands of hydrangeas and lavenders. It has already attracted over one million visitors in March, according to the venue.Manager Chen Chun-an (陳春安) said that they also work with local farmers and universities to design their seasonal menus and will change courses every three months. Chen noted that the castle aims to bring a downshifting lifestyle, which focuses on valuing a simpler life rather than materials.Their restaurant is also in the process of applying for an international slow food certificate, said Chen.During the upcoming Children's Day Holidays, the tourist spot will invite local performance art groups to host bubble parties and interesting pop-up events.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837010,"China, Japan trade accusations over maritime incursions","BEIJING (AP) — China’s dispute with Japan over tiny Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea is heating up again, with both sides accusing the other of infringing on their maritime territory.China says the islands belong to it and refuses to recognize Japan’s claim to the uninhabited chain known as the Senkakus in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Taiwan also claims the islands, which it calls Diaoyutai, but has signed access agreements for its fishermen with Japan and does not actively take part in the dispute.China routinely sends coast guard vessels and planes into waters and airspace surrounding the islands to harass Japanese vessels in the area and force Japan to scramble jets in response.On Wednesday, a Chinese coast guard spokesperson said Chinese vessels had “expelled some Japanese vessels which had illegally entered the territorial waters.” The unidentified official said its moves were routine measures to safeguard sovereignty and maritime interests.Japan’s coast guard on Thursday said Chinese coast guard vessels were violating Japanese territorial waters around the islands and have been repeatedly requested to leave and not to approach Japanese fishing boats operating in the area.Unlike islands in the busy South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, the Senkaku/Diaoyu chain lying between Okinawa and Taiwan has little strategic importance. However, China has made it a cause celebre in its campaign to rally nationalism based on memories of Japan's brutal invasion and occupation of much of China that ended in 1945.Meanwhile, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida were meeting in Tokyo Thursday for talks underscoring their shared sense of urgency to form a united front on North Korea and China with their mutual ally, the United States.Chinese intrusions by China’s military vessels into waters around the Islands featured in wide-ranging January discussions in Washington between President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.Those talks came as Japan is increasing defense spending dramatically and looking to build security cooperation with allies in a time of provocative Chinese and North Korean military action.The U.S. is also bolstering alliances in the Indo-Pacific to meet new threats, including providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, gaining increased access to Philippine bases and boosting defense cooperation with Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy China claims as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report from Tokyo.",2023/03/16,,World

It estimated 28% of the people in the world, approximately two billion, are ""subject to extreme levels of repression.""In the 26 countries and territories listed in the Asia region, Taiwan is again the only country rated as truly open. The report said as epidemic prevention restrictions were lifted, ""efforts to stifle dissent and crack down on civil society and social movements remained prevalent"" and, in some nations, even escalated.The report assesses civic space from the perspectives of the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly, and expression. Each country is rated as falling into one of five categories: “open,” “narrowed,” “obstructed,” “repressed,” or “closed.”In the Asia Pacific, the number of countries and regions rated as closed rose to seven, with China, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam being joined by Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and Myanmar. Eight countries were listed as repressed, including Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.The seven countries in the obstructed category were Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste. Three countries, Japan, Mongolia, and South Korea, were rated as having their civic space narrowed.In addition, there are no countries listed in Central or Western Asia as open.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837014,"Struggling Crusaders, Blues to meet in Super Rugby Pacific","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Christchurch-based Crusaders and Auckland-based Blues meet Saturday in what should be one of the marquee matches of the Super Rugby Pacific season — a repeat of last year’s final.But the match-up comes in the only the fourth round of season and at a point in which both teams already have lost matches. For that reason it may lack the impact or importance it usually would carry. Neither team is performing at its best.The Crusaders lost in the first round to the Hamilton-based Chiefs and last weekend to the Fijian Drua in one of the largest upsets in Super Rugby history. That defeat has dropped them to eighth place in the 12-team competition.The Blues lost in the second round to the ACT Brumbies who, with the Chiefs, remain the only unbeaten teams in the competition. Last weekend the Blues held on to beat the Wellington-based Hurricanes when a good first half gave way to a poor second-half performance.Blues coach Leon MacDonald remains confident his team is improving week by week and is ready to meet the defending champion Crusaders.“We’re in round (four) and as long as we continue to get better, you’ve got to be happy,” MacDonald told the Stuff news website. “We have to be better against the Crusaders.“I think we were better (against the Hurricanes) than we were against the Brumbies in a lot of areas. Getting our kicking balance is going to be really important this week as well.”Saturday’s match at Auckland’s Eden Park might be held up as a quasi All Blacks trial for this year’s World Cup. However, the All Blacks selectors likely have most of their squad inked in.The clash of All Blacks flyhalves Beauden Barrett for the Blues and Richie Mo’unga for the Crusaders also will be highlighted, though both are also playing below their best form.Barrett’s play, especially his kicking game, has been seen as predictable and MacDonald has acknowledged the Blues generally are not kicking well.“In the first half (against the Hurricanes, Barrett) kicked really well, applied pressure and we had good control of the game,” MacDonald said. “In the second half across the board our game drivers didn’t kick as accurately and we felt under pressure. We weren’t getting quality ball . . . so a lot of the second-half kicks weren’t the type he’d be wanting to make.”The Crusaders’ loss to the Drua in Lautoka breathed life into a tournament which was losing interest because it had become predictable. News of the result excited rugby fans around the world who felt the Crusaders got their just desserts for picking an under-strength team.Pictures of fans clinging to the branches of a tree outside Lautoka’s Churchill Park to see the match without paying went viral on social media.The Crusaders now are 1-2 after three rounds and have to beat the Blues to get their season back on track.Drua coach Mick Byrne said his players had to quickly put aside the joy of last weekend’s win to prepare for Sunday’s match against the Queensland Reds in Brisbane.“We’re three matches into a season, we’ve won two games late and nothing’s changed from our goals. We want to play finals footy this year,” Byrne said.The Chiefs will face the Melbourne Rebels and the Brumbies will play Moana Pasifika, both on Saturday, in an effort to keep their perfect records intact.Elsewhere, the Hurricanes host the New South Wales Waratahs at Wellington on Friday to open the round.

You want to be playing this way at this time of year,” Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said. “That’s what it’s all about. I truly believe that our schedule and the games we’ve been in, especially late in the season, prepares you for these types of games. And it was across the board, just everyone contributed. Our defense was outstanding in the first half.”Arizona State hit 67.7% of its shots from the floor and forced 10 turnovers in the first half, putting together a 22-2 run over eight minutes to pull away, meanwhile keeping the defensive pressure on and forcing the Wolf Pack to the perimeter.“I think when we get off to starts like that, it just feeds on to everybody on the team and builds energy, and I feel like it showed tonight,” Horne said.The Sun Devils shot a stunning 64% from the floor, much better than their season average of 41.3%. They hit 11 of 21 (52.4%) from 3-point range, with Horne making four of his five tries.Desmond Cambridge Jr. — a Nevada transfer — had 17 points, Jamiya Neal had 16 and Desmond's brother, Devan Cambridge, added 15 for Arizona State.Will Baker scored 17 and Tre Coleman had 14 for the Wolf Pack (22-11). One of Nevada’s top players, Kenan Blackshear, picked up three fouls early and sat on the bench for more than five minutes of the opening half. Averaging 14.4 per game through the season, he was held to four points in this one.“You've got to give Arizona State credit,” Nevada coach Steve Alford said. “I’ve watched a bucket load of games on them, and I thought that’s as well as they’ve played all year. That’s a great credit to them, because if you can play some of your best basketball in March, that’s really, really good.”Both teams appeared in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2019. The Sun Devils beat St. Johns in the First Four that season, but lost in the round of 64.BIG PICTURENevada: The Wolf Pack shot better in the second half (60.7% compared with 33.3% in the first) but couldn't climb out of the hole Arizona State put them in early. Nevada couldn't get closer than 19 points after halftime.Arizona State: The Sun Devils forced 11 turnovers and kept the pressure on in the second half after Nevada was already crushed. They were 11 for 21 (52.4%) from beyond the 3-point line.“We already play good defense, so that’s what we hang our hats on,” Desmond Cambridge Jr. said. “But when our offense is clicking like that, we’re a hard team to stop.”DID YOU KNOW?Arizona State has forced double-digit turnovers in 60 of 66 games dating to last season.DAYTON ON TOPThe University of Dayton Arena has now hosted 133 NCAA Tournament games, more than any other venue in the country. The First Four has been played here since 2011, except for 2020 when the event was canceled because of the pandemic, and 2021, when it was played in the COVID-19 bubble in Indiana.UD has an agreement to host the First Four through 2026. There is discussion aimed at expanding the March Madness field beyond its current 68 schools, but the situation is still too speculative to foresee what it might mean for the Dayton event.The First Four is one of the most important events of the year for the city, with an estimated economic benefit to the region of more than $5 million and national TV exposure for the medium-sized city that’s often overshadowed by nearby Columbus and Cincinnati.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837016,"TCU back in NCAA, motivated by OT loss to top seed last year","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Chuck O’Bannon, Mike Miles and their TCU teammates have been motivated all this season by what happened in the NCAA Tournament last year, when the Horned Frogs came so close to upsetting a No. 1 seed and getting to the Sweet 16.“Still to this day, we talk about that last game,” O’Bannon said.After getting through another brutal Big 12 schedule, including a six-game stretch without leading scorer Miles after he hyperextended his right knee, 22nd-ranked TCU (21-12) is making consecutive March Madness appearances for the first time in 70 years.“It feels like it’s come up on us quick,” Miles said. “I feel like we’re more prepared than last year. We’re more experienced, we know how it feels to be in the tournament.”TCU last March beat Seton Hall for its first NCAA Tournament victory in 35 years, when current coach Jamie Dixon was a senior guard on that 1987 team. The Frogs then overcame a nine-point deficit in the final eight minutes of regulation against Arizona before falling 85-80 in overtime.Seven of the nine TCU players who took part in that OT loss are with the sixth-seeded Frogs in Denver for their first-round game Friday night. They play No. 11 seed Arizona State, which beat Nevada 98-73 in a First Four game Wednesday night.Francisco Farabello transferred after last season to Creighton, also a No. 6 seed in this NCAA tourney. The guard reunited there with a former TCU assistant coach who had recruited him from Argentina.Eddie Lampkin, the 6-foot-11, 263-pound center who had 20 points and 14 rebounds (10 offensive) against Arizona, is still listed on TCU's roster but has entered the transfer portal after not being at the Big 12 tournament last week. He has deleted Instagram posts with screenshots of text messages from his mother that appeared to accuse Dixon of player mistreatment and “racial comments.”Dixon has said he and the Frogs still love Lampkin, but there have been no further comments from the school.It has been a difficult past year for Lampkin, whose brother, former Oklahoma defensive tackle Du’vonta Lampkin, was shot to death in a robbery in Dallas last May. Lampkin was sidelined several games because of a high ankle sprain, and missed another game to attend his aunt’s funeral. In 24 games, the big center averaged 6.3 points and 5.9 rebounds, both slightly below last season's totals.O'Bannon had a career-high 23 points against Arizona last March. Miles scored 20, including a go-ahead basket with 3 1/2 minutes left, but lost the ball at midcourt at the end of the regulation without being able to at least attempt a tiebreaking shot.“I'll always think about that,” Miles said.That was the first NCAA appearance for the Frogs since 2018, and came 20 years after their only other one since Dixon was playing. Their only previous back-to-back tourneys were 1952 and 1953.With so much talent back this season, a tourney return was expected. And the Frogs made it, working through a serious of injuries and absences to get there.TCU played its first six games without senior guard Damion Baugh because of an NCAA-imposed suspension for signing with an NBA certified agent after last season. Baugh, who self-reported the incident, has started all 27 games since.Miles got hurt before the first media timeout in a loss at Mississippi State on Jan. 28. TCU then lost four of the next five games without him during a stretch when Lampkin was also in and out of the lineup. Micah Peavy (back) missed four games in January, and Oklahoma State transfer Rondel Walker (elbow) was out four games in February.“It shows we’re resilient,” Miles said. “We’ve missed a lot of players and a lot of games. We’ve mixed the lines up a lot this year. But we still find a way to compete, still find a way to win.""After Big 12 coaches tabbed Miles the preseason player of the year, he was a second-team All-Big 12 pick after the missed time. He still averages 17.3 points a game, and in TCU's two games at the Big 12 tournament was 12-of-26 shooting (five made 3-pointers) for 37 points.“I feel like I’ve got a rhythm going into the tournament. I feel confident in everything, my knee and my shot,” Miles said.“He’s playing really well, he’s practicing well, he’s shooting the ball well. ... Mike is defending well,” Dixon said. “He’s playing his best basketball this time of the year. He’s healthy.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

Kennedy of New York announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.In 1972, in a nationally broadcast address, President Richard Nixon called for a moratorium on court-ordered school busing to achieve racial desegregation.In 1984, William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut, was kidnapped by Hezbollah militants (he was tortured by his captors and killed in 1985).In 1994, figure skater Tonya Harding pleaded guilty in Portland, Oregon, to conspiracy to hinder prosecution for covering up an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan, avoiding jail but drawing a $100,000 fine.In 2004, China declared victory in its fight against bird flu, saying it had “stamped out” all its known cases.In 2014, Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia, overwhelmingly approving a referendum that sought to unite the strategically important Black Sea region with the country it was part of for some 250 years.In 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to take the seat of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who had died the previous month. (Republicans who controlled the Senate would stick to their pledge to leave the seat empty until after the presidential election; they confirmed Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch in April 2017.)In 2020, global stocks plunged again amid coronavirus concerns, with Wall Street seeing a 12% decline, its worst in more than 30 years; the S&P 500 was down 30% from its record set less than a month earlier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837022,"US pregnancy deaths dropped in 2022, after COVID spike","NEW YORK (AP) — Deaths of pregnant women in the U.S. fell in 2022, dropping significantly from a six-decade high during the pandemic, new data suggests.More than 1,200 U.S. women died in 2021 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, according to a final tally released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there were 733 maternal deaths, according to preliminary agency data, though the final number is likely to be higher.Officials say the 2022 maternal death rate is on track to get close to pre-pandemic levels. But that's not great: The rate before COVID-19 was the highest it had been in decades.“From the worst to the near worst? I wouldn’t exactly call that an accomplishment,” said Omari Maynard, a New Yorker whose partner died after childbirth in 2019.The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.COVID-19 can be particularly dangerous to pregnant women, and experts believe it was the main reason for the 2021 spike. Burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women's worries, some advocates said.In 2021, there were about 33 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. The last time the government recorded a rate that high was 1964.What happened “isn’t that hard to explain,” said Eugene Declercq, a long-time maternal mortality researcher at Boston University. “The surge was COVID-related.”Previous government analyses concluded that one quarter of maternal deaths in 2020 and 2021 were COVID-related — meaning that the entire increase in maternal deaths was due to coronavirus infections or the pandemic's wider impact on health care. Pregnant women infected with the coronavirus were nearly 8 times as likely to die as their uninfected peers, according to a recent study published by BMJ Global Health.The bodies of pregnant women are already under strain, their heart forced to pump harder. Other health problems can make their condition more fragile. And then on top of that, “COVID is going to make all that much worse,” said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, chief medical and health officer for the March of Dimes.It didn’t help that vaccination rates among pregnant women were disappointingly low in 2021 — particularly among Black women. Part of that was related to limited vaccine availability, and that the CDC did not fully recommend shots for pregnant women until August 2021.“Initially there was a lot of mistrust of the vaccine in Black communities,” said Samantha Griffin, who owns a doula service that mainly serves families of color in the Washington, D.C., area.But there's to more to it than that, she and others added. The 2021 maternal mortality rate for Black women was nearly three times higher than it was for white women. And the maternal death rate for Hispanic American women that year rose 54% compared with 2020, also surpassing the death rate for white moms.More than a year into the pandemic, a lot of doctors and nurses were feeling burned out and they were getting less in-person time with patients.Providers at the time ""were needing to make snap decisions and maybe not listening to their patients as much,” Griffin said. “Women were saying that they thought something was wrong and they weren't being heard.""Maynard, who is 41 and lives in Brooklyn, said he and his partner experienced that in 2019.Shamony Gibson, a healthy 30-year-old, was set to have their second child. The pregnancy was smooth until her contractions stopped progressing and she underwent a cesarean section.The operation was more involved than expected but their son Khari was born in September. A few days later, Shamony began complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath, Maynard said. Doctors told her she just needed to relax and let her body rest from the pregnancy, he said.More than a week after giving birth, her health worsened and she begged to go to the hospital. Then her heart stopped, and loved ones called for help. The initial focus for paramedics and firefighters was whether Gibson was taking illicit drugs, Maynard said, adding that she didn't.She was hospitalized and died the next day of a blood clot in the lungs. Her son was 13 days old.“She wasn’t being heard at all,” said Maynard, an artist who now does speaking engagements as a maternal health advocate.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837034,Poll shows Taiwan VP Lai Ching-te's surge over KMT's trump card,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) expressed worry after the latest polls show Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) leading in the constituency of New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜).Support for Lai grew in multiple polls by different media outlets in the past month.Known as the KMT's best shot at getting inside the Presidential Office in 2024, Hou has yet to announce his presidential bid, while Lai, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), signed up for the party's presidential primary election on Wednesday (March 15).Former KMT chairman and Legislator Johnny Chiang (江啓臣) said in an interview later that day that it is a worrisome poll result that Hou gained less support in the age bracket between 20 and 29 compared to Lai and, even worse, lost to his DPP rival in New Taipei City too.The poll cited in the interview was carried out by Z.Media (震傳媒), which is reportedly affiliated with the KMT. According to the poll, Lai was favored by 39.3% of voters, followed by Hou's 27.8% and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je's (柯文哲) 18.2%.""There are only 65% of pan-blue poll respondents saying they would cast their vote for Hou, and that is much less satisfactory,"" he added. ""Hou should gain the support of close to 80% among the pan-blue voters to win the 2024 presidential race.""Chiang also expressed worry about the participation of Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Chairman Ko and Foxconn Technology founder Terry Gou (郭台銘), who is now an independent, in the race. Chiang believes that would split the pan-blue voters, making the battle more difficult for the KMT.Chiang said that the KMT should decide which candidate should represent the party as fast as it can and dedicate its resources to supporting the candidate to stop losing ground.In early March, a survey by Taiwan’s Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) with Gallup showed Lai with Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) as his running mate receiving 36.45% of the vote, with a combination of Gou with Ko as his running mate winning 23.59%; and Hou with Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) finishing third at 18.23%.On Thursday (March 16), Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) Chairman Ying-lung You (游盈隆) released a survey that shows 54.3% of voters disagree with Hou's running for the 2024 presidential election in less than a year after he was elected as the New Taipei City's mayor. In the same survey, 52.8% of voters said they would not support Hou if he decides to run for president.",2023/03/16,1575,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837041,String of data leaks expose Taiwan firms’ lack of cybersecurity awareness,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Inadequate awareness of cybersecurity is to blame for the series of breaches reported at Taiwan’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since the start of the year, said IT experts.From car rental platforms including iRent and Car-plus to department stores like Breeze Center, incidents of data leaks concerning customers over the past months have sparked concern. Many companies in Taiwan lack the expertise, resources, and willingness required to protect their systems, a Business Today investigation has found.In an example, the system of a server at a firm that received complaints about personal data being leaked was found to be lacking any sort of safeguards. Not only was the database it held not password-protected, it also appeared without access restrictions, the report quoted a Taiwanese information security expert as saying.Jason Hsieh (謝昀澤), head of advisory services of KPMG in Taiwan, shared another example in which a company’s staff used the computer storing files of sales orders to “play video games.”Many are simply pushing their luck, said Akuei Hsu (徐富桂) of IEK Consulting, and there is also the issue of accountability and insufficient investment in cybersecurity, according to Tsai Sung-ting (蔡松廷), founder of TeamT5, a digital security services provider.The role of information security is often dwarfed by other IT elements in SMEs, such as infrastructure upgrades, which results in meager spending on security bolstering measures. According to KMPG, Taiwanese companies invest an average of 5% to 12% of their IT budget in cybersecurity, but a large proportion of SMEs do not fork out even 5%.Meanwhile, fines incurred from cybersecurity incidents are considered too lenient, discouraging expanded investment. Supervisory measures also have been criticized for being ineffective.Digital Minister Audrey Tang (唐鳳) has said the government is introducing higher penalties following the data leak events, with the Securities and Futures Bureau recently warning listed companies in Taiwan will face NT$5 million (US$163,178) in fines for not disclosing cyberattacks. The Cabinet is seeking to mend regulations, addressing the loopholes in how the country manages IT risks.",2023/03/16,722,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837074,"With Saudi deals, US, China battle for influence in Mideast","WASHINGTON (AP) — In a matter of days, Saudi Arabia carried out blockbuster agreements with the world’s two leading powers — China and the United States.Riyadh signed a Chinese-facilitated deal aimed at restoring diplomatic ties with its arch-nemesis Iran and then announced a massive contract to buy commercial planes from U.S. manufacturer Boeing.The two announcements spurred speculation that the Saudis were laying their marker as a dominant economic and geopolitical force with the flexibility to play Beijing and Washington off each other. They also cast China in an unfamiliar leading role in Middle Eastern politics. And they raised questions about whether the U.S.-Saudi relationship — frosty for much of the first two years of President Joe Biden's term — has reached a détente.But as the Biden administration takes stock of the moment, officials are pushing back against the notion that the developments amount to a shift in the dynamics of the U.S.-China competition in the Middle East.The White House scoffs at the idea that the big aircraft deal signals a significant change in the status of the administration's relations with Riyadh after Biden's fierce criticism early in his presidency of the Saudis' human rights record and of the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel move to cut production last year.""We’re looking forward here in trying to make sure that this strategic partnership really does in every possible way support our national security interests there in the region and around the world,"" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. He spoke after Boeing announced this week the Saudis would purchase up to 121 aircraft.But China's involvement in facilitating a resumption of Iran-Saudi diplomatic ties and the major Boeing contract — one the White House said it advocated for — have added a new twist to Biden's roller-coaster relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.As a candidate for the White House, Biden vowed that Saudi rulers would pay a ""price” under his watch for the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom’s leadership. More recently, after the OPEC+ oil cartel announced in October it was cutting production, Biden promised “consequences” for a move that the administration said was helping Russia.Now, Washington and Riyadh seem intent on moving forward, and at a moment when China is at least dabbling in a more assertive Middle East diplomacy.Saudi officials kept the U.S. up to date on the status of talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia on restarting diplomatic relations since they began nearly two years ago, according to the White House. Significant progress was made during several rounds of earlier talks hosted by Iraq and Oman, well before the deal was announced in China last week during the country's ceremonial National People’s Congress.Unlike China, the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and was not a party to the talks.The Iran-Saudi relationship has been historically fraught and shadowed by a sectarian divide and fierce competition in the region. Diplomatic relations were severed in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Protesters in Tehran stormed the Saudi Embassy and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed “divine revenge” for al-Nimr’s execution.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan earlier this week said China was “rowing in the same direction” with its work at quelling tensions between the Gulf Arab nations that have been fighting proxy wars in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq for years.“This is something that we think is positive insofar as it promotes what the United States has been promoting in the region, which is de-escalation, a reduction in tensions,” Sullivan said.But privately White House officials are skeptical about China's ability, and desire, to play a role in resolving some of the region's most difficult crises, including the long, disastrous proxy war in Yemen.Iran-allied Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile in Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in 2015.Years of inconclusive fighting created a humanitarian disaster and pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine. Overall, the war has killed more than 150,000 people, including over 14,500 civilians, according to The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.A six-month cease-fire, the longest of the Yemen conflict, expired in October, but finding a permanent peace is among the administration's highest priorities in the Middle East. U.S. special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking is visiting Saudi Arabia and Oman this week to try to build on the U.N.-mediated truce that has brought a measure of calm to Yemen in recent months, according to the State Department.Beijing swooped in on the Iran-Saudi talks at a moment when the fruit was already “ripening on the vine,” according to one of six senior administration officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private White House deliberations. The Iran-Saudi announcement coincided with Chinese leader Xi Jinping being awarded a third five-year term as the nation’s president.The official added that if China can play a ""reinforcing role” in ending hostilities in Yemen the administration would view that as a good thing. But both the White House and Saudi officials remain deeply skeptical of Iran's intentions in the Yemen war or more broadly acting as a stabilizing force in the region.“While these discussions were going on, in the last 90 days, we have interdicted five major weapons shipments coming from Iran to Yemen,” Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, told lawmakers on Thursday. ""One of those shipments included components, inertial navigation systems for short-range ballistic missiles. So again, I think the implementation is a completely different matter.”To date, China, which has a seat on the U.N. Security Council, has shown little interest in the Yemen conflict, Syria or the Israeli-Palestinian situation, according to administration officials. Yet, Xi this week called for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs after Beijing scored a diplomatic coup with the Iran-Saudi agreement.""It has injected a positive element into the peace, stability, solidarity and cooperation landscape of the region,” China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. “We hope it can also create conducive conditions for improving the situation in Yemen.”The administration officials said Beijing has shown modest interest in reviving the seven-party Iran nuclear agreement — of which it is a signatory — that President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2018. The Biden administration put efforts to revive the nuclear agreement on hold last fall after protests broke out in Iran following the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for allegedly flouting Iran’s strict dress code for women.To be certain, China — a major customer of both Iranian and Saudi oil — has been steadily increasing its regional political influence. Xi traveled to Riyadh in December and received Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Beijing last month.But Miles Yu, director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute, said Xi's call to be a more active player on the international stage would require Beijing to dramatically change its approach.“China's diplomatic initiatives have been based on one thing: money,” said Yu, who served as a China policy adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the Trump administration. “They've made friends in Africa and Asia, but mostly it was monetary. These kind of transactional dealings do not forge permanent friendship.”Not every move China takes to engage more deeply with the Middle East necessarily harms the United States, noted Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and a frequent critic of Saudi Arabia.“But it’s probably true that China should pick up some of the cost of securing the oil that … frankly, is probably more important to them than to the United States in the long run,"" Murphy said. “I think China has benefited by being a free rider on U.S. security investments in the region for a long time.""The White House is not particularly concerned at the moment about the Saudis reorienting themselves toward China for several reasons, including that the Saudis' entire defense system is based on American weapons and components, administration officials said. The officials added that it would take the Saudis at least a decade to transition from U.S. weapons systems to Russian or Chinese oriented systems.Saudi Arabia’s reliance on U.S.-made weapons systems and the American military and commercial presence in the kingdom — some 70,000 Americans live there — have played a big part in the relationship weathering difficult moments over the years, said Les Janka, a former president of Raytheon Arabian Systems Co. who spent years living in the kingdom.It would take ""an unbelievable amount of activity to dismantle, given the reliance on American weapons, American technology, American training, everything that goes into it,” Janka said.___Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837075,Trump's VP? Some in GOP already jockeying for consideration,"OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — Trips to Mar-a-Lago. Glowing speeches. Front-row seats at major events.The first Republican presidential primaries are nearly a year away and the candidate field is unsettled. But already, a shadow contest of another sort is underway with several Republicans openly jockeying to position themselves as potential running mates to Donald Trump, the early front-runner for the nomination.“A lot of people are right now auditioning,” Trump boasted to supporters in Florida last month.The mere mention of a running mate this early in the process is a departure from the traditional timeline of presidential primaries, where candidates typically spend the opening months of a campaign introducing themselves to voters and sharing their visions for the country. But as a former president, Trump needs no introduction and is eager to project an air of inevitability around his campaign, particularly as attention builds around Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as his toughest potential GOP rival.Trump campaign officials insist that the vice presidential search is not something they have been actively discussing.“We appreciate all support for President Trump, but the clear focus is on making sure that he wins the Republican nomination and is well-positioned to win the general election in 2024,” said Jason Miller, a longtime Trump adviser.That, however, hasn't stopped some could-be candidates from taking full advantage of opportunities to be in close proximity to Trump, at his club and at events. The dynamic was on full display earlier this month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where a trio of women who have been mentioned as possible contenders sat in the audience to cheer Trump's headline speech.They were Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Elise Stefanik of New York and Kari Lake, the news anchor-turned-failed-Arizona gubernatorial candidate who ended her remarks at a keynote event dinner by kissing a portrait of Trump that was placed on stage.While Trump, according to people who have spoken to him, is in no rush to make a decision and understands that he has to let the nomination process play out, he has nonetheless talked through possible choices since well before he formally announced his candidacy last fall. In those conversations, he has indicated his interest in selecting a woman this time around.But allies say Trump is looking, first and foremost, for someone who will be unabashedly loyal after feeling burned by former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to overturn the results of the 2020 election.In 2016, running as a celebrity businessman with no experience in politics, Trump chose a person who was, in many ways, his total opposite, picking the Indiana governor and former congressman who could bolster his standing with conservatives and the religious right.Trump, this time, is looking for someone more like himself, said Michael Caputo, a longtime friend and adviser who believes Stefanik would be Trump’s best choice.“I think the president learned a lot from his experience with Pence,"" he said. “I think this time Trump’s going to be looking for someone cut from the same cloth he is, not from a different, complementary cloth.”While Trump is looking for someone with star power, he has also signaled that he is reluctant to choose someone who might overshadow him in the race.Among those who are seen as most eager for the job is Lake, who is popular with Trump's MAGA base and won — and then promoted — a CPAC straw poll that asked audience members whom they would like to see as the Republican vice presidential nominee. She is seen as unequivocally loyal to the former president, but detractors note she lost her only race and continues to dispute the results, which would draw attention to Trump's own election failures and intensify criticism that he is too focused on the past.She said in a statement that she is “100% dedicated to serving as Arizona Governor"" — even though Democrat Katie Hobbs, who defeated Lake, now holds the job — and “will also work to make sure President Trump gets back in the White House ASAP. Anything outside of those two goals is nothing but a distraction.”A person close to Lake said that she has had no formal discussions about the role and is currently gearing up for a potential run for the Senate. But the person, who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, also said Lake is unapologetically pro-Trump and would likely do anything he asked.Greene, the flame-throwing congresswoman who recently proposed a “national divorce” between red and blue states, is also seen as eager for the role. She was a constant presence at Trump's midterm rallies, often speaking during the pre-show program, and has been a frequent visitor to Florida, including sharing dinner with Lake at a local restaurant, Rocco’s Tacos, on Valentine’s Day.“She sees herself on the short list for Trump’s VP. Paraphrasing Cokie Roberts, when MTG looks in the mirror she sees a potential president smiling back,” Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist who frequently hosts Greene on his podcast, told NBC, referring to the late political reporter.When asked about her vice presidential ambitions recently, Greene told reporters, “That's up to President Trump who he chooses.”Stefanik is also frequently mentioned as a likely contender, but has taken what allies describe as a more subtle approach. She endorsed Trump before he even announced he was running, and has become one of his chief defenders on the Hill. During CPAC, Stefanik used her speech to call for Trump's reelection and introduced him at a private event organized by his super PAC. Trump, in turn, praised her as a “rocket ship.”People close to Stefanik say that, instead of overtly angling for the position, she is focused on doing her job as GOP conference chair and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, believing that if she does it well, good things will follow. But she nonetheless has the support of several Trump allies, who see her as disciplined and less risky than other potential options, and also point to her record for winning swing, suburban districts.Stefanik, in an interview, said she had not discussed the position with Trump, though she has previously said she would be honored to serve in his administration.“We have a lot of work to do over the next two years and I am gonna work no matter what to make sure that we have a Republican president, House and Senate in 2024,"" she said. ""So that’s what I focused on, and it’s a big job.”Trump has also discussed other potential running mates, including his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who has been reluctant to criticize the former president since launching her bid. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who would be the first Black man on a Republican presidential ticket, is seen as another potential option.Allies say both are serious about running for president in their own right, not in hopes of angling to serve as vice president or in another Cabinet post, though many believe Haley, in particular, would be open to an offer.Also mentioned as possible contenders: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is considering her own presidential run; Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a supporter of the former president in 2016 and 2020; and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who appeared alongside the former president as he visited the state Monday.“We’re going to have a lot of great choices for vice president. We’re gonna pick a great one,"" Trump said during his swing through Iowa.___Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price and Meg Kinnard contributed to this report.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837076,TikTok says US threatens ban if Chinese owners don't sell stakes,"The Biden administration has demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners divest their stakes in the popular video app or face a possible U.S. ban, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.The move is the most dramatic in a series of recent steps by U.S. officials and legislators who have raised fears that TikTok's U.S. user data could be passed on to China's government. ByteDance-owned TikTok has more than 100 million U.S. users.It is also the first time under the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden that a potential ban on TikTok has been threatened. Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by U.S. courts.TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told Reuters that the company had recently heard from the U.S. Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which demanded that the Chinese owners of the app sell their shares, and said otherwise they would face a possible U.S. ban of the video app.The Wall Street Journal first reported the move. ByteDance confirmed that 60% of its shares are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders.CFIUS, a powerful national security body, had unanimously recommended in 2020 that ByteDance divest TikTok. Under pressure from then-President Trump, ByteDance in late 2020 unsuccessfully sought to finalize a deal with Walmart and Oracle Corp to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity.""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" Tiktok's Oberwetter said in a statement.The White House declined to comment.TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew is due to appear before the U.S. Congress next week. It is not clear if the Chinese government would approve any divestiture and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month, the White House gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have TikTok on federal devices and systems. More than 30 U.S. states have also banned employees from using TikTok on government-owned devices.Any U.S. ban would face significant legal hurdles and potential political ramifications, since TikTok is popular with millions of young Americans.Last week, Democratic Senator Mark Warner said it was important the U.S. government do more to make clear what it believes are the national security risks from TikTok. ""It's going to be incumbent on the government to show its cards in terms of how this is a threat,"" Warner said.TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements. TikTok said it has spent more than $1.5 billion on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations.TikTok said on Wednesday that ""the best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification.""Last week, the White House backed legislation by a dozen senators to give the administration new powers to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national security threats. It could give the Biden administration new ammunition in court if they sought to ban TikTok.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the bipartisan bill, saying it ""would strengthen our ability to address discrete risks posed by individual transactions, and systemic risks posed by certain classes of transactions involving countries of concern in sensitive technology sectors.""The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee this month voted along party lines on a much broader bill aimed at Tiktok, sponsored by Republican Representative Michael McCaul, that Democrats said would require the administration to effectively ban TikTok and other subsidiaries of ByteDance.(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Echo Wang in New York and Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Daniel Wallis, Leslie Adler and Edmund Klamann)",2023/03/16,408,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837077,"Palmieri, Nelson lead Islanders' 6-3 rout of Anaheim Ducks","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Kyle Palmieri had a career-high four points with a goal and three assists, Brock Nelson scored two goals and linemate Pierre Engvall also scored in the New York Islanders’ 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday night.Nelson scored the tiebreaking goal late in the second period and added another in the third to secure his second straight 30-goal season for the Islanders, who snapped a two-game skid. Engvall matched his career high with his 15th goal by scoring in his third consecutive game for the Isles, who acquired the Swedish winger from Toronto two weeks ago.The 32-year-old Palmieri scored four points for the first time in his 724-game NHL career, which began with five seasons in Anaheim. The Ducks chose Palmieri in the first round back in 2009.“Feels nice just to do it,” Palmieri said after his latest return to Anaheim, where he always receives a warm ovation. “Doesn't matter where it was. Our line stepped up and was able to make a positive contribution. ... (Engvall) is fitting in well with us, and it's clear he's working hard.”Hudson Fasching and Zach Parise also scored and Ilya Sorokin made 20 saves in a bounce-back performance for New York, which had been outscored 10-3 in its first back-to-back regulation losses since January. Facing the NHL's worst defensive team at Honda Center, the Isles produced their highest-scoring performance since Jan. 3.“I thought our line did a lot of good things,” Nelson said. “Probably the best thing for us was to get right back at it (after getting routed by Los Angeles on Tuesday). These two points are huge for us.""New York is even with Pittsburgh and five points ahead of Florida atop the Eastern Conference wild-card standings, but the Penguins and the Panthers both have three games in hand on the Isles.Kevin Shattenkirk scored two goals and Max Jones scored 25 seconds after the opening faceoff for the Ducks, who have lost four of five despite earning a point in eight of their previous nine games. John Gibson stopped 17 shots in Anaheim's second straight loss to open its eight-game homestand.“We've taken some really great strides here, but tonight we took a step backwards,” Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said. “We just couldn't come out of it. We're going to have to get back to the game we were playing.”Jones beat Sorokin for his sixth goal of the season after being left all alone in the slot in the opening minute, but Palmieri tied it on a cross-ice pass from Engvall later in the first.Trevor Zegras then made a magical through-the-legs pass to himself to maintain puck possession before slipping a pass to Shattenkirk for the defenseman's third goal of the season.“The kid is skilled,” Eakins said of Zegras. “It all comes very naturally to him.”Shattenkirk added a power-play goal in the third period for the sixth two-goal game of his long career.Nelson put the Islanders ahead for good when he ripped a one-timer past Gibson with 23 seconds left in the second period for his 29th goal.The Ducks announced goalie Anthony Stolarz will miss the rest of the season after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday. Stolarz played in only 19 games this season for the NHL's worst defensive team, making his last appearance Feb. 7.UP NEXTIslanders: At San Jose on Saturday.Ducks: Host Columbus on Friday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

Díaz’s brother, Reds pitcher Alexis Díaz, was also crying as Edwin was put in a chair and wheeled away. Mets teammate and Puerto Rico shortstop Francisco Lindor stood nearby with his hands on his head.Díaz signed a $102 million, five-year deal to stay with the Mets in November, one of several moves Mets owner Steve Cohen hopes bring a championship to Queens.Now, his season could be in jeopardy.“It’s just a freak thing,” Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber said after the United States beat Colombia 3-2 in Phoenix. “You hate to see it, but that’s the risk you have in these things. Someone can get hurt.”Díaz isn't the first player injured while celebrating. Here are some others:— After the Los Angeles Angels’ Kendrys Morales beat the Seattle Mariners with a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth in 2010, he took a big leap onto home plate and broke his leg. The bouncing scrum at home was subsequently banned by manager Mike Scioscia.— Chicago Cubs pitcher Ryan Dempster broke his big right toe in 2009 when his foot got caught in the dugout railing while he was trying to run out with his teammates to celebrate a win over the Brewers.— In 2001, Denny Hocking of the Minnesota Twins broke his nose, compliments of his overzealous teammates, who kept smacking the bill of his helmet — and a few accidental face shots — after his first walk-off home run.— After the San Diego Padres clinched their division in 2005, pitcher Jake Peavy broke a rib while getting a big hug from his teammates. The injury wasn’t discovered until weeks later when Peavy had an MRI following his forgettable postseason (eight hits and eight earned runs in 4 1/3 innings).— Washington Redskins quarterback Gus Frerotte decided to head-butt the padded wall behind the end zone after scoring on a short run against the Giants in 1997. Stunned but unbowed, he was checked by the team trainers and continued to play before leaving later in the game. He was then transported to a hospital with a sprained neck.— Arizona Cardinals kicker Bill Gramatica ended his rookie season in 2001 with an ACL tear. He was hurt jumping up and down after making a 42-yard field goal against the Giants.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837083,Credit Suisse shares soar after central bank offers lifeline,"GENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse shares surged Thursday after the Swiss central bank agreed to loan the bank up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) to bolster confidence in the country’s second-biggest lender following the collapse of two U.S. banks.Credit Suisse announced the agreement before the Swiss stock market opened, sending shares up as much as 33% before they settled around a 17% gain, to 2 francs ($2.15), in late afternoon trading. That was a massive turnaround from a day earlier, when news that the bank's biggest shareholder would not inject more money into Credit Suisse sent its shares tumbling 30%. The plunge in price dragged down other European banks and deepened concerns about the international financial system.European banking stocks also rose modestly Thursday.The Swiss National Bank said Wednesday that it was prepared to back Credit Suisse because it meets the higher financial requirements imposed on “systemically important banks,” adding that the problems at some U.S. banks don’t “pose a direct risk of contagion” to Switzerland.Regulators are trying to reassure depositors that their money is safe. They “don’t want anybody to be the person who sits in a darkened room or darkened cinema and shouts fire, because that’s what prompts a rush for the exits,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the online investment platform AJ Bell.Credit Suisse, which was beset by problems long before the U.S. bank failures, said the loans from the central bank would give it time to complete a reorganization designed to create a “simpler and more focused bank.""“These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation,” Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner said in a statement.Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe's banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances.European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said at a news conference that European banks’ exposure to Credit Suisse is “quite limited.”Higher rates fight inflation but in recent days have fueled concern that banks may have caused hidden losses on their balance sheets.Central banks in the U.S. and Europe have moved quickly to restore confidence after last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history.American authorities moved quickly to guarantee all of the deposits of the California-based bank and the smaller Signature Bank of New York. The U.S. Federal Reserve also announced additional funding to ensure other banks could meet the needs of depositors.In a similar move, the British government and Bank of England facilitated the sale of Silicon Valley Bank’s U.K. arm to HSBC, one of Europe’s biggest banks, ensuring that customers would have access to their money.The rapid response is different from what happened at the start of the global financial crisis 15 years ago, when U.S. authorities allowed the investment banking giant Lehman Brothers to collapse.The loans to Credit Suisse “should prevent a Lehman moment, much to the relief of markets and investors,"" said Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at the online investment service known as Interactive Investor. ""This is a bank that’s been around since 1865 and has been instrumental in supporting growth of the Swiss economy.""ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks ""are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis.After that crisis, Europe strengthened its banking safeguards by transferring supervision of the biggest banks to the central bank.“Crises are never exactly the same,” she said, “but the architecture of our banking system, the framework within which they operate, the supervision that is applied to the banking system, have been all considerably improved.""Banks are under pressure after interest rates rose rapidly following a prolonged period of historically low rates.To boost the return on their investments, banks needed to take more risks and some “did this more prudently than others,” said Sascha Steffen, professor of finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.As a result, some banks now face a shortage of “liquidity,” meaning they cannot sell assets quickly enough to meet the demands of depositors.Credit Suisse shares dropped to a record low Wednesday after the Saudi National Bank said it would not put more money into the Swiss lender to avoid regulations that kick in if an investor’s stake rises above 10%.Credit Suisse also reported that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned new doubts about the bank’s ability to weather the storm.Its stock has suffered a long, sustained decline: Now trading for a little over 2 francs ($2.15), the stock was valued at more than 80 francs ($86.71) in 2007.The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving Zurich rival UBS.Outside a Credit Suisse branch on Thursday, accountant David Glaus said the Swiss government is unlikely to let such a large bank fail, if for no other reason than to protect Switzerland's banking industry.""It remains a Swiss bank. In the background, there are people who will support and protect it because I don’t think it’s in our best interests for it to go bankrupt,” he said.But he thinks the country has a fallback position to keep up appearances in case of the worst.“We still have chocolate and cheese, anyway, to uphold our image,” he said.___Kirka reported from London.

The MOE has not offered any scholarships to students from Honduras, while no Taiwanese are currently studying in the Central American country, per Radio Taiwan International (RTI).NTU expressed willingness to help Honduran students find other scholarships or employment so they could complete their studies in Taiwan, in the event that their scholarships were canceled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837124,Dozens of workers reject union at big Nissan Tennessee plant,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Several dozen workers among thousands at a Nissan factory in Tennessee voted not to unionize Thursday, another loss in tough territory for organized labor at a foreign-owned auto assembly plant in the traditionally anti-union South.The 62-9 vote against the union at Nissan’s Smyna plant followed two years of legal wrangling in front of the National Labor Relations Board that spanned two presidential administrations.In a statement, the machinists union said the delayed decision from the federal labor board had a “chilling effect” on the campaign. A machinists union representative noted earlier this week that some employees from the original drive had quit, left for other jobs or retired since the push began.“The IAM will continue to support these workers so we will be prepared for them to join our union when the time is right again. We want to thank our organizers for their tireless work in this campaign,” Thursday's statement said.In a statement after the vote, Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said the workers “elected to maintain their direct relationship with the company.”Love-Carter has previously said Nissan believes its workplace is “stronger without the involvement of third-party unions” like the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Still, she emphasized that employees have the right to decide whether to join a union — a right that has been enshrined in federal law since the 1930s.Nationwide, several high-profile unionization campaigns — at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and other companies — have given organized labor a renewed spotlight of late, even as the union membership rate reached an all-time low last year. The number of workers belonging to a union actually increased by 1.9% to 14.3 million, but that failed to keep pace with higher overall employment rates.Organizers cited a variety of reasons to unionize at the Nissan plant about 25 miles (40 kilometers) outside Nashville. Those include retirement, work-life balance and health care issues they want to negotiate.Last month, organizers finally secured a vote after long arguing that the group of 75 tool and die technicians were eligible for standalone representation because they have extremely specialized skills for a job that can’t be done by others at the facility. The Japan-based company contended the employees are not sufficiently distinct from other plant workers to be eligible for their own unionized bloc.Plant workers first reached out to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union in 2020. A federal labor official in June 2021 ruled against letting the dozens of workers vote on their own union. They would need to include thousands more employees. The facility currently has about 7,000 employees. The union didn’t pursue the facility-wide vote.After that decision, control of the National Labor Relations Board switched from Republicans to Democrats. After reviewing the decision panel since December 2021, the board ultimately overturned the previous ruling last month, giving the union a green light for the vote.Unions have run into opposition from Republican politicians when they attempt to organize at foreign automakers in the South, including in Tennessee. There were no immediate reports of that happening during the tool and die campaign at Nissan.Nissan does work with organized labor in the rest of the world, but votes to unionize broadly at the two Nissan plants in the U.S. have not been close. Workers in Smyrna rejected a plantwide union under the UAW in 2001 and 1989.The automaker’s other U.S. assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, rejected facility-wide representation by the UAW during a 2017 vote.The margin was much closer in 2014 and 2019 votes at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where workers twice rejected a factory-wide union under the UAW.The year after the 2014 vote failed, 160 Chattanooga maintenance workers won a vote to form a smaller union, but Volkswagen refused to bargain. The German automaker had argued the bargaining unit also needed to include production workers. As a result, the 2019 factory-wide vote followed.Tennessee already has a big union presence at an American automaker: The General Motors plant in Spring Hill has thousands of production and skilled trades workers represented by the United Auto Workers union.There's also an open question about whether workers will unionize at four sprawling new factories planned by Ford in Kentucky and Tennessee by 2025, with an aim of hiring nearly 11,000 workers. Three of the plants — two in Kentucky, one in Tennessee — will be built with Ford’s South Korean corporate partner, SK Innovation, to produce electric vehicle batteries. A fourth, in Tennessee, will make electric F-Series pickup trucks.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837125,Kentucky lawmakers pass ban on youth gender-affirming care,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a measure Thursday to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors, completing whirlwind voting on a repackaged proposal that triggered outrage and tears among opponents unable to stop the sweeping policymaking on a culture wars issue.Supporters of the proposal — which affects how gender is discussed in schools — beat a Thursday deadline to retain their power to override an expected gubernatorial veto.GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill, a day after a slimmed-down version had stalled in the Senate and seemingly left the issue in limbo. A cascade of shouting erupted from some bill opponents in the Senate gallery after the measure won final passage.The bill's foes denounced the fast-track maneuvering and the expanded measure's consequences for trans youths. Overcome with emotion, a sobbing Rep. Josie Raymond said children would be harmed. “I'm embarrassed and I'm appalled and I'm scared,” the Democrat said in opposing the bill in committee.Republicans backing the far-reaching rendition cobbled together a separate bill that hastily cleared a committee and won House passage. It gained Senate passage a short time later, sending the bill to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who portrayed it as government intrusion in family health decisions.Republican House Speaker Pro Tempore David Meade, in presenting the revived bill in committee, said: “Our job is to protect children, and that’s what we’re doing here.""“Surgery or drugs that completely alter their life, and alter their body, is not something we should be allowing until they are adults,” Meade said later during the House debate.The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky quickly warned that it “stands ready” to challenge the measure in court if it becomes law.""Legislators cannot erase transgender people from existence, and we will continue to fight for equal rights and equal protection under the law,” said Amber Duke, the organization's interim executive director.The new bill designated to carry the sweeping trans-related provisions retained its original language — allowing teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by their preferred pronouns and requiring schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.Multiple layers were added to it — including the proposed ban on gender-affirming medical care for trans youths. It would outlaw gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 18, as well as the use of puberty blockers and hormones, and inpatient and outpatient gender-affirming hospital services. It would not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age.The House passed the bill on a 75-22 vote. One after another, opponents stood to denounce the bill while supporters were mostly silent. Democratic Rep. Keturah Herron called the bill “an attack on a very, very, very small population of people.”The debate was shorter but no less fiery in the Senate, which passed the bill 30-7.“This is absolute, wilfull, intentional hate. Hate for a small group of people that are the weakest and the most vulnerable among us,” said Democratic Sen. Karen Berg.The bill’s supporters say they are trying to protect children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments that they might later regret as adults.“We're talking about removing healthy body parts that you cannot put back on,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Tichenor said in supporting the bill. “I've seen the pictures. It's horrifying.”Thursday was the last day Kentucky lawmakers were in session until late March, when they'll reconvene for the final two days of this year's session. By beating the Thursday deadline to send the bill to the governor, the GOP supermajorities retained their ability to override a veto.Beshear, who is seeking reelection this year, said such bills amount to “big government stepping in and imposing its will” on health care decisions that should be left to families.“I also believe that every child is a child of God — every single one,” the governor said Thursday at his weekly news conference.The expanded version was in stark contrast to the more limited version that stalled Wednesday in the Senate. That version pared down the restrictions on transgender youth, their families and health care providers.The issue has spurred emotional debate from bill opponents who call it discriminatory and say it would hurt transgender youth. On Tuesday, a former Kentucky lawmaker said his young grandchild would be among those affected if lawmakers banned access to gender-affirming medical care for those under 18.“This bill condemns vulnerable children to an even more difficult life than they’ve already been born into,” Jerry Miller, a Republican who formerly served in the House, told lawmakers. “Please don’t let a parent’s right to protect their children be collateral damage in the culture wars.”Nationally, state lawmakers are approving extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ people this year, from bills targeting trans athletes and drag performers to ones limiting gender-affirming care. In Mississippi, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed a bill to ban gender-affirming hormones or surgery in the state for anyone younger than 18. The Republican governors of South Dakota and Utah have signed bans on gender-affirming care this year.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837126,Imports leading the way in India's Women's Premier League,"MUMBAI, India (AP) — U.S.-born, Britain-based Tara Norris set the tone early with a five-wicket haul and others including Australia captain Meg Lanning soon followed: Foreign players have starred in India's long-awaited inaugural Women’s Premier League.It was only Day 2 of the tournament when the Philadelphia-born Norris, the only player from an “Associate,” or non test-ranked, country in the league, became the first bowler in the WPL to take five wickets in an innings. She snared five wickets and conceded just 29 runs from four overs to help propel Delhi Capitals to victory.Left-arm medium pacer Norris signed with Capitals at the bargain price of $12,000 after the Feb. 13 player auctions. It gave the Delhi team an advantage because Norris, being from an Associate country, isn't subject to the selection restrictions that limit each starting 11 to four overseas players.“I feel really proud to get picked and represent not just the United States, but all Associate nations,” Norris said.The 24-year-old Norris had previously played franchise cricket in England in the women’s Super League and The Hundred. But she could now be signed for the Caribbean Premier League and the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia later this year.At the other end of Capitals’ inaugural victory was Australian star Lanning, arguably the most celebrated women’s cricketer in the world. Delhi had signed her for $133,000 and the investment quickly paid off — Lanning smacked 72 runs off 43 deliveries in her first WPL outing against Royal Challengers Bangalore.It was followed by innnings of 70 off 42 balls against UP Warriorz and 43 off 41 balls against Mumbai Indians. Overall, Lanning leads the league in scoring with 221 runs from five games. Her opening stands with young Indian batter Shafali Verman have had the most impact on the Capitals’ run of four wins in five games.Mumbai, the five-time men’s Indian Premier League-winning franchise, is an early favorite to claim the inaugural women’s trophy as well. It is the only team with five straight wins and has confirmed its spot in the playoffs.West Indies’ allrounder Hayley Matthews has been key to Mumbai’s unbeaten run. Her 168 runs at a strike-rate 140 at the top of the batting order, along with 10 wickets at an average of 10.50, makes her the most valuable player in the league. With bat and ball, she props up Indians and teammates Harmanpreet Kaur (180 runs) and Saika Ishaque (12 wickets).The most surprising foreign import in the league so far has been Australian allrounder Grace Harris. In the opening game for UP Warriorz, she clubbed 59 runs off only 26 balls, with seven fours and three sixes against Gujarat Giants. She went to the crease with 84 needed off 48 balls and helped the Warriorz to victory.More surprisingly, she was left out for the next game because of those tournament restrictions on the foreigners on the playing 11. That rule has hit Warriorz hard, with Harris only appearing in three games so far.On Wednesday night, she scored 46 runs off 32 balls to rescue the Warriorz from a precarious 29-4 to a total of 135 runs against Royal Challengers Bangalore. She then took 1-28 to help reduce Bangalore to 14-2, but Bangalore rallied for its first victory.Meanwhile, the race is on for the three knockout spots in the WPL. Mumbai (10 points) has already qualified, but Delhi (eight points) could still challenge for the top spot which guarantees direct entry into the March 26 final.UP Warriorz (four points) have the lead over Bangalore and Giants (two points each) with a tight battle to come for the remaining eliminator spot against Mumbai or Delhi.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837127,Willow oil project approval intensifies Alaska Natives' rift,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration’s approval this week of the biggest oil drilling project in Alaska in decades promises to widen a rift among Alaska Natives, with some saying that oil money can't counter the damages caused by climate change and others defending the project as economically vital.Two lawsuits filed almost immediately by environmentalists and one Alaska Native group are likely to exacerbate tensions that have built up over years of debate about ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project.Many communities on Alaska’s North Slope celebrated the project's approval, citing new jobs and the influx of money that will help support schools, other public services and infrastructure investments in their isolated villages. Just a few decades ago, many villages had no running water, said Doreen Leavitt, director of natural resources for the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope. Housing shortages continues to be a problem, with multiple generations often living together, she said.“We still have a long ways to go. We don't want to go backwards,” Leavitt said.She said 50 years of oil production on the petroleum-rich North Slope has shown that development can coexist with wildlife and the traditional, subsistence way of life.But some Alaska Natives blasted the decision to greenlight the project, and they are supported by environmental groups challenging the approval in federal court.The acrimony toward the project was underscored in a letter dated earlier this month written by three leaders in the Nuiqsut community, who described their remote village as “ground zero for industrialization of the Arctic.” They addressed the letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to lead a Cabinet department.They cited the threat that climate change poses to caribou migrations and to their ability to travel across once-frozen areas. Money from the ConocoPhillips project won't be enough to mitigate those threats, they said. The community is about 36 miles (58 kilometers) from the Willow project.“They are payoffs for the loss of our health and culture,” the Nuiqsut leaders wrote. “No dollar can replace what we risk. ... It is a matter of our survival.”But Asisaun Toovak, the mayor of Utqiaġvik, the nation's northernmost community on the Arctic Ocean, told the AP that she jumped for joy when she heard the Biden administration approved the Willow project.“I could say that the majority of the people, the majority of our community and the majority of the people were excited about the Willow Project,” she said.Willow is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a vast region on Alaska’s resource-rich North Slope that is roughly the size of Maine. It would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, the use of which would result in at least 263 million tons (239 million metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions over 30 years, according to a federal environmental review.The Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, Sierra Club and other groups that sued Tuesday said Interior officials ignored the fact that every ton of greenhouse gas emitted by the project would contribute to sea ice melt, which endangers polar bears and Alaska villages. A second lawsuit seeking to block the project was filed Wednesday by Greenpeace and other environmental groups.For Alaska Natives to reconcile their points of view with one another, it will take discussions. “We just continue to try to sit at the table together, break bread and meet as a region,"" said Leavitt, who also is the secretary for the tribal council representing eight North Slope villages.“I will say the majority of the voices that we heard against Willow were from the Lower 48,"" she said of the contiguous U.S. states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.ConocoPhillips Alaska said the $8 billion project would create up to 2,500 jobs during construction and 300 long-term jobs, and generate billions of dollars in royalties and other revenues to be split between the federal and state governments.The project has had widespread support among lawmakers in the state. Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation met with Biden and his advisers in early March to plead their case for the project, and Alaska Native lawmakers also met with Haaland to urge support.Haaland visited the North Slope last spring just hours after state Rep. Josiah Aullaqsruaq Patkotak, a whaling co-captain along with his brother on their father's whaling crew, harvested a roughly 40-ton (36-metric tons) bowhead whale and spent hours pulling it on the ice from the Arctic Ocean at Utqiaġvik. He left the ice around 7 a.m. to be ready to meet with Haaland just two hours later.For him, the juxtaposition of those activities on the same day underscored the dual life led by Alaska Natives on the North Slope and highlights the choices that communities make every day for their survival.“That's the walk our leaders have to walk,” said Patkotak, an independent who supported Willow. “We maintain our culture and our lifestyle and our subsistence aspect where we’re one with the land and animals, and the very next hour you may be having to conduct yourself, you know, in a manner that you’re playing the Western world’s game.”He invited Haaland to view the bowhead whale that they harvested, but when Patkotak couldn't provide a street name of where she would go, her security didn’t allow it. “Well, it's on the ice, there are no street names,” he said.Patkotak met again with Haaland this month in Washington, D.C., where he extended an invitation to leaders in the White House to visit Utqiagvik, ""because it's our duty to tell our story so that we're able to strike that balance of both worlds.“That's a reality for us,” he said.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.___This story has been updated to correct that Patkotak is a co-captain of whaling crew and that Haaland’s visit was in the spring.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837132,Asian shares up after First Republic aid spurs Wall St rally,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares advanced Friday in Asia, tracking a rally on Wall Street after a group of big banks offered a lifeline to First Republic Bank, the lender investors had focused on in their latest hunt for troubles in the banking industry.Chinese markets gained more than 1% while others also rose. U.S. futures edged lower and oil prices climbed.The S&P 500 jumped 1.8% Thursday, erasing earlier losses following reports that First Republic Bank could get help or sell itself to another bank. Markets have gyrated this week on concerns over the toll on banks from the fastest set of interest rate hikes in decades. The turmoil flared with last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.8% to 19,545.94 and the Shanghai Composite index surged 1.6% to 3,278.01.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.8% to 27,222.25 and the Kospi in Seoul was up 0.8% at 2,396.06. Shares in major Japanese banks, which fell sharply at times this week, were mostly slightly higher.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,985.30. Shares in India and Taiwan also rose.Stocks rallied Thursday after 11 of the biggest banks offered help for First Republic with a combined deposit of $30 billion.All told, the S&P 500 rose 68.35 points to 3,960.28. The Dow gained 1.2% to 32,246.55 and the Nasdaq jumped 2.5% to 11,717.28.Since SVB's failure, investors have been on the lookout for banks with similar traits, such as lots of depositors with more than the $250,000 limit that’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or lots of tech startups and other highly connected people that can spread worries about a bank’s strength quickly.First Republic Bank rose 10% Thursday after slumping as much as 36% early in the day. In the statement announcing their deposits, the group of 11 banks said the move “reflects their confidence in First Republic and in banks of all sizes.”Across the Atlantic, European stocks rose after the European Central Bank announced a hefty increase to interest rates. Concerns there were also easing about another bank, Credit Suisse, which has been battling troubles for years, but its plunge to a record low raised concerns just as more attention was shining on the wider industry.Credit Suisse’s stock in Switzerland leaped 19.2% Thursday after it said it will strengthen its finances by borrowing up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank.Much of the damage for banks is seen as the result of the Federal Reserve’s fastest barrage of hikes to interest rates in decades. They've shocked the system following years of historically easy conditions in hopes of driving down painfully high inflation.Higher rates can tame inflation by slowing the economy, but they raise the risk of a recession later on. They also hurt prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. That latter factor was one of the issues hurting Silicon Valley Bank because high rates forced down the value of its bond investments.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a Senate committee on Thursday that the nation’s banking system “remains sound” and Americans “can feel confident” about their deposits.Wall Street increasingly expects this week's turmoil to push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates next week by only a quarter of a percentage point. That would be the same sized increase as last month's, half the hike of 0.50 points that was earlier expected.The European Central Bank on Thursday raised its key rate by half a percentage point, brushing aside speculation that it may reduce the size because of all the turmoil around banks.Some of Wall Street's wildest action this week has been in the bond market, as traders rush to guess where the Fed is heading.The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.57% from 3.47% late Wednesday. Earlier in in the day, it dropped as low as 3.37% and has been veering sharply since climbing above 4% earlier this month. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.All the stress in the banking system has raised worries about a potential recession because of how important smaller and mid-sized banks are to making loans to businesses across the country. Oil prices have slid this week on such fears.Reports on the U.S. economy are showing mixed signals. A report said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 76 cents to $69.11 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercentile Exchange. It picked up 74 cents on Thursday to $68.35 a barrel.Brent crude, the pricing basis for international trading, climbed 82 cents to $75.52 a barrel.The dollar fell to 133.25 Japanese yen from 133.76 yen. The euro rose to $1.0644 from $1.0611.___AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837134,Hartman scores twice in Wild win; Blues' Binnington ejected,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Ryan Hartman had two goals and an assist and the surging Minnesota Wild beat St. Louis 8-5 on Wednesday night in a game in which Blues goalie Jordan Binnington was ejected for throwing a punch.Binnington was whistled for a match penalty with 7:35 left in the second period. After giving up a goal — the Wild’s fifth — to Hartman, Binnington left the crease and went after Hartman, swinging his blocker glove at the forward’s face.Minnesota goalie Marc-Andre Fleury skated the length of the ice to confront the unmasked Binnington, but the two were separated by officials and Binnington was sent off the ice.“I mean, those blockers aren’t soft,” Hartman said. “We don’t have much protection on our face. I’d say so (it was a cheap shot). It’s nothing new from him. He’s been doing stuff like this for a while.”Binnington said he has no grudge against Hartman.“We know the type of player he is. I actually like his game, to be honest,” Binnington said. “I’ve played against him since the jungle days for a while now. He plays the game hard and I respect it and it’s no problem. It’s kind of how it played out and it’s all good. ""The match penalty call surprised Binnington.“A little bit. I don’t think I caught him too clean with my going after him,” Binnington said. “Like I said, he’s pretty good at diving. That’s his game and that’s totally fine. If they don’t want to stay in there and compete until that end, that’s fine, but that’s it, that’s the ref’s decision and that’s fine.”The Wild completed a four-game trip with the win and are the NHL’s hottest team, going 11-0-3 since Feb. 15. The 14-game points streak is a franchise record.The Blues are 3-8-2 over their last 13 games. St. Louis has had plenty of success against Minnesota, going 10-1-1 in its previous 12 regular-season games against the Wild, and taking a first-round playoff series last season 4-2. Fleury made 31 saves. He had no second thoughts about skating to Binnington.“I’m not surprised. I’ve seen Jordan do a few things in his career,” Fleury said. “That’s why I went. I made it (decision) pretty quick.""Binnington thought the two would have made a lasting memory if they had squared off.“I’m not surprised. I kind of think it was our moment, but I got nothing but respect for Fleury, too,” Binnington said. “He’s a legendary goalie. Coming down there, shows a lot about him.”Joel Eriksson Ek added a goal and two assists for the Wild. John Klingberg, Oskar Sundqvist, Mason Shaw, Hartman and Alex Goligoski scored for Minnesota in the second period. Three of the goals came in a span of 1:58. Ryan Reaves scored in the third.“We had to stay out of the penalty box,” Wild coach Dean Evasobn said “They scored two power-play goals in the first. We had to control that a bit. Once the second period, we gathered ourselves. We stayed out of the box and played a lot better hockey. We played more in their end and we got rewarded for it.”Pavel Buchnevich had his second career hat trick and Jakub Vrana added two goals for St. Louis, which held a 3-1 lead after the first period. Buchnevich has scored at least one point in 10 straight games.NOTES: Blues coach Craig Berube coached his 500th NHL regular-season game. He became the sixth person to have played in 1,000 NHL games and been a head coach in 500. ... Ppro wrestling great Ric Flair was at the game and fired up the crowd before the puck dropped.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837135,Drought over? Spring outlook finds relief -- and flood risk,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Record snowfall and rain have helped to loosen drought’s grip on parts of the western U.S. as national forecasters and climate experts warned Thursday that some areas should expect more flooding as the snow begins to melt.The winter precipitation wiped out exceptional and extreme drought in California for the first time since 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday in a seasonal, nationwide outlook that came as parts of the state are under water. In neighboring Nevada, flood warnings were in effect and rushing water prompted some evacuations overnight in one of Arizona's tourist towns.Elsewhere, NOAA's forecast warned of elevated flood risks from heavy snowpack this spring in the upper Midwest along the Mississippi River from Minnesota south to Missouri.Despite the receding drought, experts cautioned that the relief may be only a blip as the long-term effects persist from what has been a stubborn dry streak.Groundwater and reservoir storage levels — which take much longer to bounce back — remain at historic lows. It could be more than a year before the extra moisture has an effect on the shoreline at Lake Mead that straddles Arizona and Nevada. And it's unlikely that water managers will have enough wiggle room to wind back the clock on proposals for limiting water use.That's because water release and retention operations for the massive reservoir and its upstream sibling — Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border — already are set for the year. The reservoirs are used to manage Colorado River water deliveries to 40 million people in seven U.S. states and Mexico.Lake Powell could gain 35 feet (11 meters) as snow melts and makes its way into tributaries and rivers over the next three months. How much it rises will depend on soil moisture levels, future precipitation, temperatures and evaporation losses.Paul Miller, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service’s Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, said that sounds like a lot of water for one of the nation's largest reservoirs, but it still will be only one-third full.“It’s definitely moving in the right direction, but we’re far from filling the reservoirs in the Colorado River system and we’re far from being at a comfortable point from a water supply perspective,” Miller said during Thursday's NOAA briefing.Federal forecasters outlined other predictions for temperature, precipitation and drought over the next three months, saying the spring wet season is expected to improve drought conditions across parts of the northern and central Plains and Florida could see dryness disappear there by the end of June.Overall, the West has been more dry than wet for more than 20 years, and many areas will still feel the consequences. The northern Rockies and parts of Washington state will likely see drought expand over the spring, while areas of extreme to exceptional drought are likely to persist across parts of the southern High Plains.An emergency declaration in Oregon warns of higher risks for water shortages and wildfires in the central part of the state, and pockets of central Utah, southeastern Colorado and eastern New Mexico are still dealing with extreme drought.Ranchers in the arid state already are planning for another dry year, and some residents are still reeling from a historic wildfire season.Jon Gottschalck, chief of the operational prediction branch at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said the start of the fire season in the Southwestern U.S. likely will be delayed.“But it doesn’t mean that it couldn’t end up being a very strong season,” he said. “It's just likely to be a more muted beginning for sure.”Gottschalck said warmer than average temperatures are forecasted for New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to the Gulf Coast and up the eastern seaboard, as well as in Hawaii and northern Alaska. Lower than normal temperatures are probable, he said, for North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota and the Great Basin region.The real standout this winter has been the Great Basin, which stretches from the Sierra Nevada to the Wasatch Mountains in Utah. It has recorded more snow this season than the last two seasons combined. That’s notable given that over the last decade, only two years — 2017 and 2019 — had snowpack above the median.“We’ve pretty much blown past all kinds of averages and normals in the Lower Colorado Basin,” Miller said, not unlike other western basins.Tony Caligiuri, president of the preservation group Colorado Open Lands, said all the recent precipitation shouldn't derail work to recharge groundwater supplies.“The problem or the danger in these episodic wet year events is that it can reduce the feeling of urgency to address the longer-term issues of water usage and water conservation,"" he said.The group is experimenting in the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado, the headwaters of the Rio Grande. One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande and its reservoirs have been struggling due to meager snowpack, long-term drought and constant demands. It went dry over the summer in Albuquerque, and managers had no extra water to supplement flows.Colorado Open Lands reached an agreement with a farmer to retire his land and stop irrigating roughly 1,000 acres. Caligiuri said the idea is to take a major straw out of the aquifer, which will enable the savings to sustain other farms in the district so they no longer face the threat of having to turn off their wells.“We’ve seen where we can have multiple good years in place like the San Luis Valley when it comes to rainfall or snowpack and then one drought year can erase a decade of progress,” he said. “So you just can’t stick your head in the sand just because you’re having one good wet year.”___Associated Press writers Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, and Drew Costley in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837136,"‘Star Trek’, swear words and TV characters’ changing mores","For nearly four decades, Jean-Luc Picard of “Star Trek” has largely been presented as genteel, erudite and — at times — quite buttoned up. Yes, he loses his temper. Yes, he was reckless as a callow cadet many years ago. Yes, he occasionally gets his hands dirty or falls apart.But the Enterprise captain-turned-admiral stepped into a different place in last week’s episode of the streaming drama “Star Trek: Picard.” Now, he’s someone who — to the shock of some and the delight of others — has uttered a profanity that never would have come from his mouth in the 1990s: “Ten f—-ing grueling hours,” Patrick Stewart's character says at one point during an intense conversation in which he expects everyone will die shortly.The whole thing was in keeping with the more complex, nuanced aesthetic of this decade’s “Star Trek” installments. And the online conversation that ensued illustrates the journey undertaken when a fictional character voyages from the strictures of network and syndicated television to high-end streaming TV.“'Star Trek’ was G-rated when it first came out. 'The Next Generation’ was clean-cut and optimistic. What we’re seeing now with ‘Picard’ is a little bit more of the grit,” says Shilpa Davé, a media studies scholar at the University of Virginia and a longtime “Trek” fan.Over the weekend, “Star Trek” Twitter reflected that tension.“Totally out of character,” said one post, reflecting many others. Some complained that it cheapened the utopia that Gene Roddenberry envisioned, that humans wouldn’t be swearing like that four centuries from now, that someone as polished as Picard wouldn’t need such language.“Part of Star Trek’s appeal is the articulate way characters speak. Resorting to gutter language feels like a step backward since Star Trek’s characters are meant to be better than this,” John Orquiola wrote for the website Screen Rant on Sunday.The backlash to the backlash followed. Christopher Monfette, the Paramount+ show’s co-executive producer, wrote an extensive and persuasive thread about the moment and why he believed it worked.“It’s easy to hear that elevated British tone escaping the mouth of a gentlemanly Shakespearean actor and assume some elevated intellectualism,” he said, while acknowledging: “Criticism of its use is fair even if it just strikes a personal nerve — or if you’ve equated 'Trek' with more broader, family-friendly storytelling. But regardless, cursing in the show is carefully debated & discussed in the room or on set. We don’t take it lightly.”The showrunner for “ Star Trek: Picard ” this season, Terry Matalas, said the F-word from Picard wasn’t scripted but was a choice by Stewart in the moment. The result, Matalas said, was “so real.”“Everything you do as artists, as writers and actors, even as editors, is authenticity. That’s the thing you want to feel,” he told Collider. “I was really torn because hearing that word come from your childhood hero, Captain Picard, it throws you. But wow, is it powerful.”“Star Trek” has a long history of pushing boundaries, linguistic and otherwise.“Let’s get the hell out of here,” Capt. James T. Kirk said on network TV in 1967, when that word was edgy. He’d just lost someone dear to him in the most trying of circumstances. Dr. McCoy, the ship’s irascible physician, would often say, “Dammit, Jim.” And in the larger realm, the original series delicately danced with NBC censors over everything from women’s costumes to racial, sexual and war references.But the crossing of last week's linguistic frontier is an interesting case. It highlights the turbulence generated when a beloved character born during the “family-friendly” TV era evolves against the streaming landscape, where constraints are fewer and opportunities for unflinching authenticity greater.""This isn't just a rethinking of a fictional world. This is the same actor and the same character in the same setting that we had before. And all these years, he has been speaking and behaving in a certain way,"" says Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.Sometimes this transition unfolds erratically. Velma, a member of the Gen-X-era Saturday morning cartoon “Scooby Doo,” recently appeared in a more multicultural cartoon reboot on HBO Max that featured a high-school shower scene and overt sexual references. It has been roundly panned. Several years ago, when “Riverdale” premiered, the attempts to push Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica from the sunny world of comics into the darker realm of teen drama produced uneven, sometimes jarring results.“Star Trek” is in a whole different universe, so to speak.Roddenberry famously framed it as a utopian future where the main characters generally avoided conflict with each other, their society wasn't motivated by greed and humanity was seen as inexorably moving forward. Purists have criticized the recent years of what they call “new Trek” as a darker, more fragmented universe.Nonsense, say many others: Both allegory and word usage evolve with the times. After all, it was only seven decades ago that Lucille Ball (and her character) was expecting a baby on “I Love Lucy” and the word “pregnant” couldn't be uttered on national television — except, oddly, in French.And for years before and after that, Hollywood's production code prescribed the ways morality and amorality could be depicted in film, with strict regulation of everything from sexual innuendo to whether criminals were portrayed sympathetically to whether the good guys won. Hence the term “Hollywood ending,"" which remains with us today in many parts of life.All of which raises the question: Could it also be the boundaries themselves that help create memorable film and television, rather than merely the breaking of them?“Star Trek had a certain kind of sincerity — almost like 'the 23rd century will be a family-friendly kind of thing,'” Thompson says. “The question is, what happens when your characters outlive the media industry standards? How do you accommodate the fact that you’re no longer limited without completely betraying the world that you’ve created?”In this case, Stewart has said he returned to the character because he was persuaded there were new stories to tell. Just as he had aged two decades since his last ""Star Trek” appearance, so, too, had Picard — with all the evolution that went along with it.The kind of evolution, perhaps, that might make a man facing his own end choose a word that still carries a lot of power — even in today's swearing, streaming world. When Jean-Luc Picard says that word, you can be absolutely sure he means it.___Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, has been writing about American culture since 1990.

The insurance industry in India is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), which is an autonomous body established in 1999.Market segment insightsIn India, currently there are 24 life insurance players, which comprise 1 public sector and 23 private sector players. The Indian life insurance market is exhibiting immense growth, next to banks for mobilized savings, and is a formidable part of the Indian capital market. In FY 2019, the life insurance sector accounted for approximately 2.68% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP).LIC is the sole public sector life insurance company in India. However, private life insurance companies have been penetrating the market since 2000, mainly through unique customer services. In terms of the number of new policies issued, shares of both LIC and private insurers have increased during the FY 2017-FY 2018 period. In FY 2018, LIC held a share of ~75.67% in terms of the number of new policies issued, the rest being acquired by private insurers. The demand for LIC policies is usually high, owing to the handsome maturity value offered by the company at the end of the policy terms. Considering the amount of premium collected in FY 2018, LIC alone held a share of ~69.36%. However, the share of private insurers, in terms of premium collected, had increased during the FY 2017-FY 2018 period at a rate of ~19.17%, mainly due to innovative product mixes offered by the companies. In FY 2018, out of the top private insurers operating in India, ICICI Prudential had the highest market share (~5.9%), followed by SBI Life (~5.53%) and HDFC Standard (~5.14%).Key growth drivers of the marketOn the macroeconomic front, the Indian economy has been gaining momentum since FY 2018. Moreover, Indias young population with increased purchasing power and greater inclination towards security products is growing. However, the penetration of life insurance in India is shallow, compared to the advanced and emerging economies of the world. In a way, life insurance companies are utilizing the opportunity of penetrating the Indian market, thereby taking advantage of its expanding economy and rising individual income level.Key deterrents to the growth of the marketHigh lapse ratio, due to low persistency, is having a detrimental impact on the overall business of insurers. This is because lapsation of insurance policies result in a negative impact on customer retention, product performance, pricing factors, product image and workforce planning.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-life-insurance-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Key Companies Covered in the Male Grooming Products Market Research are Emami Limited, Gillette India Limited, Godrej Consumer Products Limited, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Marico Limited, Himalaya Drug Company Private Limited, LOreal India Private Limited, Mcnroe Consumer Products Private Limited, Nivea India Private Limited, Vi-John India Group, Happily Unmarried Private Limited, Helios Lifestyle Private Limited, Zed Lifestyle Private Limited and other key market players.Of late, the male population of India have become much conscious of their appearance and seldom do they shy away from indulging in personal care products, spa and rejuvenation services. This trend is mostly observed in men belonging to the age group of 25-40 years. FMCG giants are launching gender specific products to cater to the increasing demand for male grooming products.Market insights:Beard growth oils, cologne soaps, face washes, beard combs, deodorants, talcs and perfumes are some of the major male grooming products available in the market.The increasing influence of social media and rise in disposable income among the urban working men of the country are the key factors that are fueling the growth of the market in the country. Around 177 new male grooming products have been launched by FMCG giants, as well as start-up companies to capture the untapped male grooming market in India between the marketing year March 2018 and March 2019.Retail stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and e-commerce websites are the major distribution channels for male grooming products. During the 2019-2024 period, online distribution channels/e-commerce websites are expected to witness steady growth, owing to the rising popularity of the e-commerce market in India. Start-ups which are entering the male grooming products market, like Beardo and Bombay Shaving Company, sell their products through e-commerce platforms to reach out to a larger consumer base.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-male-grooming-products-market/QI042Market segment insights:Based on product type, the male grooming products market is segmented into face care, body care and hair care products. As of 2018, the face care products segment held the largest market share (~53%) in terms of market revenue, followed by body care products (~41%) and hair care products (~6%). The face care products segment for men was valued at INR 74.47 Bn in 2018 and it is expected to reach INR 136.69 Bn by 2024. Major players in the face care products market for men are Nivea Men, Emamis Fair and Handsome, and Garnier Men.Key growth drivers of the market:The traditional idea of masculinity conforming to physical appearances has undergone considerable changes and men have become conscious about how they look. As a result, demand for products like moisturizers, whitening creams, anti-aging creams, sunscreens, body lotions and other products for men has picked up.
Increased penetration of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp have exposed men, both in urban and rural areas, to global fashion trends, thereby increasing the demand for male grooming products like beard oil, hair gel, and hair masque.Key deterrents to the growth of the market:In India, the male grooming products market is dominated by a few major players like Emami, Gillette, and L’Oral, offering products at higher prices. Such high price ranges affect the adoption of male grooming products on a large scale, especially by the middle class and lower middle-class population of the country. This is likely to impede the growth of the male grooming products market in India.Consumers in semi-rural and rural areas are hardly aware of niche and premium male grooming products such as beard oil, beard wax, moisturizers, whitening creams, face wash, body wash, face scrubs, exfoliators, sunscreen lotion, and serum, among others. The market in rural and semi-rural areas remains unpenetrated, since men using grooming products are still considered a taboo, which presents a major challenge for market growth.Competition analysis:Some of the major players operating in the male grooming products market in India are Emami Limited, Gillette India Limited and Godrej Consumer Products Limited. In 2018, Procter & Gamble held the largest market share (~20%), followed by HUL (~8%) and Malhotra Group (~6%).Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-male-grooming-products-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Rise in fashion and brand consciousness among the young population of the country and increase in the sale of branded eyewear are some of the important factors fueling the growth of prescription eyewear, as well as sunglasses in the domestic eyewear market. On the other hand, initiatives undertaken by the Indian government like setting up of free eye check-up and vision treatment programs have also contributed towards the growth of the eyewear market in India. However, presence of counterfeit products in the market and the increasing popularity of vision corrective surgeries act as major pitfalls for the market.Market segmentation analysisBased on product type, the India eyewear market is segmented into spectacles, sunglasses and contact lenses. Value-wise, in 2018, the spectacles segment captured the highest market share (~70.15%). The segment is expected to continue accounting for the highest market share throughout the forecast period due to unhealthy lifestyles and increasing exposure to display screens. In terms of market revenue, the sunglass and contact lens segments are expected to account for ~18.47% and ~10.60% market shares, respectively, in 2024.Competition analysisIn India, the eyewear market is composed of both organized and unorganized players. The unorganized sector dominates the market with almost 70% market share. Titan Company Limited, GKB Opticals Limited, Lenskart Solutions Private Limited, Bausch & Lomb India Private Limited, and Johnson & Johnson Private Limited are some of the major players operating in the organized eyewear market. These players have accelerated the sale of eyewear products by generating awareness regarding vision disorders and setting up free eye check-up camps in tier-II and tier-III cities. Price differentiation between branded and unbranded eyewear products poses challenge for organized players to capture a substantial market share in the overall eyewear market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-eyewear-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Mobile banking facilities are provided across the country by ~96,068 scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), through wireless application protocol (WAP), short message systems (SMS) and unstructured supplementary service data (USSD). In recent years, several government initiatives and the launch of payment systems like unified payment interface (UPI) and Bharat interface for money (BHIM) have resulted in increased use of mobile banking.In FY 2019, INR 29,584.07 Bn amount funds were transferred, using mobile banking, thus increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~131.21% from INR 1,035.30 Bn in FY 2015. In FY 2019, SCBs recorded the highest growth in mobile banking transactions (~43.17%), based on value, between February 2019 and March 2019.

Through initiatives like Digital India, the government plans to empower the country technologically, by improving online infrastructure and internet connectivity. Services like banking and utility bill payments are being made accessible to Indians through online platforms, both in urban and rural areas. As a result, a large part of the Indian population now has turned to mobile banking for fund transfer.With the introduction of mobile banking market channels, customers can avail banking services any time of the day. The installation of a single app makes the various types of banking facilities easily accessible. The instant responses obtained from the mobile banking apps like emPower (Allahabad Bank), Axis Mobile (Axis Bank), Baroda mPassbook (Bank of Baroda), and BOI mobile (Bank of India), improve customers experiences. Owing to such benefits, customers preference has shifted in favour of mobile banking from branch-based banking.Key deterrents to the growth of the marketAs much as the increased adoption of wireless Internet and mobile data connection has driven mobile banking facilities, it has also led to a rise in fraudulent activities in both the public sector and private banks across the country. Since fund transfer has become easy through mobile banking platforms, the young generation nowadays use application-based mobile banking channels for making miscellaneous digital payments. In the process, chances of data breach and fraudulent activities are high due to successful interoperability. Increased cases of cybercrimes in India have developed fear among the existing, as well as the potential mobile banking app users to adopt digital transaction processes, thus impeding the growth of the mobile banking market in India.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-mobile-banking-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

This recognition can be attributed to the high brand consciousness among millennial consumers, celebrity endorsement and aggressive marketing strategies adopted by fashion brands. Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru are the leading markets for wrist watches in India, in terms of sales volume.Market insightsIn the past few years, smartwatches and premium watches have witnessed a significant growth in demand and popularity. These two are the main components which have attributed to the rapid growth of the wrist watch market. Slashed goods and services tax (GST) rates on luxury watches and increasing fashion consciousness among consumers have further accelerated the market growth. Moreover, with the progressing retail landscape and increase in Internet retailing, the sale of wrist watches is anticipated to experience a swift increase in the Indian market. However, the presence of counterfeit products is a major challenge for the market.

Private Limited, Rolex Watch Company Private Limited and Timex Group India Limited.

Due to increased sense of self care, men are also indulging in skin care products, allowing FMCG giants to launch skin care brands exclusively for men.

Increase in the disposable income of women has resulted in escalated demand for skin care products, which is propelling the growth of the market.Rise in stress levels, exposure to dust and pollution, and long hours in air-conditioned environments have led to increased skin problems like pigmentation, acne, pimples and sunburns. Therefore, demand for remedial skin care products like sunscreen lotions, whitening creams, and moisturizing creams has picked up. This is a major driver of the skin care products market.Key deterrents to the growth of the market:Consumers in India tend to switch brands if products of similar quality are available at lower price points. Though brand awareness is high among Indian consumers, however, they still switch brands frequently and have low brand loyalty, which presents a challenge for the companies operating in this market. Factors like quality, price, allergic reactions, recommendations, ineffectiveness of products, and unavailability of products, sales and marketing of other brands are encouraging consumers to explore other skin care brands.Sale of counterfeit products available online is on the rise because they are inexpensive, which works in favour of Indias price sensitive consumers. Counterfeit products are raising significant legal concerns for manufacturers, distributors and retailers, along with affecting consumers well-being. Hence, counterfeit skin care products are a threat to the growth of the market.Competition analysis:Consumers tend to purchase skin care products based on the quality and reputation associated with a brand. Therefore, to gain high sales volume and revenue in the skin care market in India, a company needs to develop a strong brand identity, which is a difficult task for any new entrant. Several domestic and international players dominate the skin care market in India. These players often compete in terms of price and quality, therefore creating a price advantage for customers.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-skin-care-products-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Key Companies Covered in the India Organic Personal Care Products Market Research are Dabur India Limited, Emami Limited, Bio Veda Action Research Private Limited, Forest Essentials Private Limited, Jovees Herbal Care India Limited, Kama Ayurveda Private Limited, Lotus Herbals Private Limited, Patanjali Ayurved Limited, Shahnaz Ayurveda Private Limited, The Himalaya Drug Company, Honasa Consumer Private Limited, Juicy Chemistry Private Limited, Soulflower India Private Limited and other key market players.The trend of using organic products has caught on following the growing awareness about the side effects of harmful chemicals. The demand for organic personal care products, made of naturally sourced ingredients like herbal and floral extracts, without any chemical intervention, has thus increased among people, in recent years.Market insights:Exposure to high levels of air pollution, dust, excessive sunlight, and long hours in air-conditioned environments often causes skin and hair problems. Often, chemical-based personal care products, used to treat these problems, result in side effects like skin rashes, itchy scalp and other forms of irritation on skin, scalp and body. Therefore, the demand for organic personal care products has picked up.Market segment insights:Product type-wise segmentation:Based on product type, the organic personal care market in India is segmented into skin care, hair care, color cosmetic, and oral care products. Among these, the organic skin care products segment accounted for ~32% of the overall revenue of the organic personal care market in 2018, followed by the hair care (~30%), and color cosmetics (~23%) segments.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-organic-personal-care-products-market/QI042Product benefit-wise segmentation:Based on the benefits obtained from the products, the organic personal care market is segmented into problem solution, enhancement and maintenance products. In 2018, the organic personal care products offering maintenance benefits held the largest market share (~38%), with most demands coming from the sates of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab.Key growth drivers of the market:People have become aware of the harmful effects of chemicals like parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol and formaldehyde, which are used in personal care products. As a result, consumers are preferring products made of herbal and organic ingredients over conventional personal care products.Key deterrents to the growth of the market:Organic personal care products market are devoid of preservatives like paraben and therefore have shorter shelf life than their conventional counterparts. Hence, Indian consumers prefer buying conventional personal care products of popular brands with greater shelf lives which would last long. This is a major challenge for the growth of the organic personal care products market in India.
Products of major players in the market like Lotus Herbals, Kama Ayurveda, Forest Essentials and Jovees Herbals are on the expensive side. Also, start-ups entering the market offer luxury organic personal care products at premium price ranges. Indian consumers are mostly price-sensitive, and those belonging to the middle and low income group can hardly afford expensive organic products. Instead, they make use of homemade besan, haldi or neem pastes in their beauty and personal care regime. This in turn limits the sale of organic personal care products, impeding market growth.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-organic-personal-care-products-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Key Companies Covered in the India Online Taxi Services Market Research are ANI Technologies Private Limited, Carzonrent (India) Private Limited, Mega Cabs Private Limited, Meru Mobility Tech Private Limited, Savaari Car Rentals Private Limited, Uber India Systems Private Limited and other key market players.The online taxi service offers mobility services to customers via mobile platform connected through the Global Positioning System (GPS) or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) system. Organized cab services were introduced in the Indian market with the launch of Mega Cabs services in 2000, and the market evolved from the car-ownership concept to the alternative of ride-sharing. Online taxi or radio taxi service providers in India operate either as aggregators or as radio cabs, based on their tracking feasibility.Market Insights:With the transition from the radio signals-based conventional tracking system to the GPS or GPRS-enabled system, the organized taxi market in India witnessed a momentous growth. In FY 2019, the organized taxi market held a share of ~11.5% of the total revenue generated by the overall taxi market in India. Rise in smartphone penetration in India, improved availability of high-speed internet connectivity, increasing investments in the online taxi market by the foreign institutional investors (FII) and swelling disposable income are the major factors that are driving the growth of the market. However, the imposition of goods and services tax (GST), shortage in the supply of online cab services as a consequence of the reduction in drivers incentives, surge in ride fares and extended wait-time for passengers, and the growing popularity of affordable ride-sharing services like SRide and Quick Ride are some of the factors impeding market growth. With the implementation of the new policy of the Indian government, that does not allow commercialization of ride-sharing services, the growth of the online taxi services market in India is expected to rebound.Competition Analysis:The online taxi services market in India is mainly driven by two major players ANI Technologies Private Limited (Ola Cabs) and Uber India Systems Private Limited (Uber India). In FY 2019, Ola Cabs accounted for almost 72.44% of the total revenue generated by the online taxi services market in India, whereas, Uber India held a share of ~21.01%. Other players in the market include Meru Mobility Tech Private Limited, Mega Cabs Private Limited and Carzonrent (India) Private Limited, and together they held ~6.55% of the overall market in FY 2019. The transition from the radio signal-based tracking system to GPS and GPRS-based tracking system was introduced by the market leader, ANI Technologies Private Limited. The company’s extensive geographical reach within India (152 cities), coupled with its wide range of services available for customers belonging to different income profiles has helped the company to fetch such a high market share. Large scale investments by big private equity firms on major players of the market and introduction of new customer-friendly features in their applications by the companies are anticipated to further accelerate their market growth.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-online-taxi-services-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution.

KG, Enbala, GreenSync, MediIT Health Solutions India Pvt. Ltd, Next Kraftwerke GmbH and other key market players.The Indian power sector has been undergoing transformation since the past few years, with growing contribution of renewable resources in the energy mix. The limited supply of fossil fuel has encouraged the penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) in the Indian power sector. Any energy resource which is connected to the grid at distribution level is known as DER. Grid integration of DERs has allowed the shift from centralized to decentralized systems. The development of this newly designed flexible energy network can be achieved using virtual power plants (VPP).VPP allows numerous decentralized power plants to aggregate and operate as a single platform. It functions as a Cloud-based or SaaS-based platform which governs multiple decentralized power plants through various distribution routes and demand centers. Distributed plants can be remotely operated and controlled through VPP.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-virtual-power-plant-market/QI042VPP ecosystem insightsThe VPP Market ecosystem comprises technical virtual power plant (TVPP), commercial virtual power plant (CVPP), VPP aggregators, DERs, distribution companies, transmission companies and the electricity market. TVPP operates at distribution and transmission levels, whereas CVPP runs the DER units based on demand and generation potential. VPP aggregators facilitate the aggregation of DERs and communicate with TVPP and CVPP. DERs include controllable loads, electric vehicles (EV), solar PV units, natural gas turbines, small power plants, fuel cells, prosumers and energy storage.The VPP platform consists of the solution developer, VPP platform operators and VPP users. The ecosystem consists of various energy assets such as solar plants, wind turbines, energy storage systems, EV charging stations, demand-response management centers and smart meters. Power utilities, renewable energy operators, demand response operators, energy retailers, VPP operators, and building managers are the major stakeholders involved.Market influencers:Various functionalities of VPP like distributed asset monitoring, asset analytics, distributed asset control, renewable energy management, energy storage management, EV charging asset management, and demand response management are anticipated to influence the adoption of VPP in the Indian power sector.
Furthermore, favourable government policies and regulations are likely to play an important role in the adoption process. Vehicle electrification policy of the government, as part of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) and National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, will require the development of EV charging infrastructure. Implementation of VPP can help in effectively managing the charging stations spread across the country and control the load on each charging station. Furthermore, successful implementation of five-minute scheduling policy can be possible by using VPP.
However, the large scale implementation of VPP in India can be deterred by a number of challenging factors such as weak regulatory framework.Various utility companies are hesitant to join the VPP architecture owing to issues regarding grid safety, stability, operational efficiency, and pricing. Threat of cyberattacks significantly challenges the virtualization of power plants. Maintaining security and privacy of the enormous data generated from consumers and prosumers becomes a considerable challenge of the VPP market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-virtual-power-plant-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Vibratory Rammers Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Wall Fabric Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Key Companies Covered in the Lithium-ion Battery Manufacturing Market Research are Adani Group, Amara Raja Batteries Limited, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Exide Industries Limited, HBL Power Systems Ltd, Tata Chemicals Limited, Automotive Electronics Power Pvt. Ltd, Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, Panasonic India, Toshiba India Pvt. Ltd and other key market players.Market insightsThe rapid penetration of electric vehicles in India is expected to drive the need for Lithium (Li)-ion battery manufacturing in the country. Li-ion batteries act as the primary storage option for electro-chemical energy. These batteries are rechargeable and contain Li-ion as the key component of electrolyte.
The manufacturing of Li-ion batteries is dependent on the sourcing and mining of lithium, and other minerals like cobalt, aluminium and copper. The overall process of Li-ion battery manufacturing encompasses the production of cell components (electrode, electrolytes and separators), cell and module production, battery pack assembly, and integration of components. The major applications of Li-ion battery include electric vehicles (EV), EV charging and swapping stations, and grid services.Market opportunity insightsThe Li-ion battery manufacturing industry in India is at a nascent stage at present. However, the country holds the potential to emerge as the key manufacturer of Li-ion batteries over the next few years. India can proceed to develop the Li-ion battery manufacturing industry through three distinct stages: stage one (2017 to 2020), stage two (2021 to 2025), and stage three (2026 to 2030). In stage one, during the 2017-2020 period, the primary focus is to create an ambient manufacturing environment in the country.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-lithium-ion-battery-manufacturing-market/QI042In stage two (2021 to 2025), India is predicted to capture around 25%-40% of overall economic opportunity for Li-ion battery manufacturing. The industry is expected strengthen its supply chain network and make sizeable investments on research and development by 2025. During this phase, India is anticipated to be involved in the manufacturing of battery packs, along with limited production of battery cells.India is expected to enter stage three during the 2026-2030 period. In stage three, manufacturers are projected to be engaged in end-to-end manufacture of Li-ion batteries. As a result, the dependency on imports is likely to be reduced significantly at this stage. This phase is projected to be of utmost importance for the country to establish its independence in the electric mobility sector by engaging in the production of both EV and EV batteries at the domestic level.Market influencers:The major driving factor propelling the growth of Li-ion battery manufacturing industry in India is the governments plan to boost electric mobility. The Indian government has envisioned the conversion of two and three wheelers into 100% electric ones by 2030. Currently, India is dependent on other countries for sourcing EV batteries, which has resulted in the hiked price of EVs. The penetration of EVs in the Indian automotive sector is expected to bolster the need for indigenous manufacturing of Li-ion batteries, to make them economically viable.Sizeable investments from foreign and domestic players have been playing a major role in boosting the Li-ion battery manufacturing market in India. Supportive financial policies like land grant, reduction in number of permits, tax reduction in foreign investments and direct government subsidies have encouraged the influx of investments. Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toshiba Corporation and Denso Corporation have invested INR 37.15 Bn and INR 12.14 Bn in two phases to build Li-ion battery assembly lines in Gujarat.A significant impediment to the growth of the market is that the country is reliant on the import of raw materials owing to its lack of mineral reserves. India is dependent on countries like China, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina and Australia to meet the demand for lithium. Furthermore, other crucial raw materials like cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite are also sourced from various foreign countries. On the other hand, the ecosystem consists of numerous stakeholders and the weak coordination among them restrains the development of a robust supply chain network in the industry.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-lithium-ion-battery-manufacturing-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Waterborne Coating Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.The fifth-generation cellular or 5G network technology is predicted to accelerate the digital growth of India. Ultra-fast speed, high bandwidth and low latency of 5G are envisioned to fuel the digital transformation of the country. In India, the commercial launch of 5G is expected to transpire in late 2020.The auction of 5G spectrum by TRAI was scheduled in the second quarter of 2020; however, it has been postponed until late 2020, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.Potential applications of 5G:Sustainable pricing of spectrum, stable policy and regulatory landscape, and innovative use cases are estimated to be key enablers accelerating the growth of the 5G market in India. Agriculture, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, energy & utilities, and media & entertainment are likely to be the potential end-user industries of 5G. It is expected to revolutionize the agriculture industry through high-speed data transfer in agricultural drone, smart irrigation, precision farming, and monitoring of soil, crop and livestock.In the automotive industry, 5G is expected to fast track the implementation of connected cars, V2X (vehicle to everything), autonomous driving, and smart transportation system. The manufacturing industry is predicted to leverage 5G in connected and smart factories, synchronized planning, smart supply-chain network, and smart logistic operations. Furthermore, 5G is likely to digitally transform the healthcare industry through the application of internet of medical things (IoMT), connected healthcare, patient data management and online consultation.5G is expected to find extensive use in smart cities. The major smart city applications of 5G are anticipated to be smart utility management systems, smart grids and metering systems, smart traffic management systems, smart traffic lights, video surveillance and analytics, and waste management.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-5g-market/QI042Market influencers:India has been the largest consumer of data in the world. The country accounted for the consumption of 11 GB data per month per user, on an average. The existing broadband technology falls short to meet the soaring demand owing to lack of adequate infrastructure. 5G has enormous potential to accomplish the various gaps of the existing 4G LTE technology like low mobility speed, high latency and capital intensive deployment. 5G has high data speed, which improves mobility and user experience. Furthermore, the less than one millisecond latency satisfies the acute criteria of industrial and IoT applications. Furthermore, the highly reliable and secured 5G network is crucial to support the budding IoT landscape in India. The mass adoption of IoT devices and applications is projected to foster the 5G market in India.The commercial launch of 5G is thwarted by high price of 5G spectrum, high CAPEX, lack of infrastructure and data security concerns. The pricing of the 5G spectrum recommended by TRAI is exorbitant as compared to the international market, challenging the financially struggling Indian telecom industry. The 5G infrastructure requires fiberized towers, network densification and specialized base station, leading to gigantic CAPEX investments for telecom players. Vodafone Idea Limited, Bharti Airtel Limited and Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited together would require a capital expenditure of around INR 2.1 Tn over the next five years for 5G infrastructure.Impact of COVID-19:The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the 5G roll out plan in India. The 5G spectrum auction, which was scheduled in June 2020, has been postponed. Furthermore, 3GPP has also delayed the release of 5G standards. This in turn, has led layers to stall the production of infrastructure equipment and devices. As a result of the delay in 5G spectrum auction, companies like Samsung and Oppo have launched their recent products without 5G support in India, while the same devices have 5G support features in other country markets. Although the launch has been delayed, the market witnessed a sharp rise in the demand for high-speed data amid the pandemic. An exponential rise in data traffic, the requirement of seamless network connection for remote working and penetration of IoT devices are projected to mark a positive impact of the 5G market amid the pandemic.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-5g-market/QI042Competitive landscapeTelecom operators in India have been keen to harness the 5G opportunity. Strategic collaboration with equipment and infrastructure vendors have been a major focus of telecom companies. Bharti Airtel Limited established strategic alliances with international vendors like Nokia, Ericsson, Cisco, IBM and Red Hat over the recent past to build 5G infrastructure. Vodafone Idea Limited has entered a multi-year agreement with Ericsson to deploy 5G-ready wireless equipment in India. On the other hand, Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) has been strengthening the development of indigenous end-to-end 5G technology.Companies covered5G service providersBharti Airtel Limited

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837274,"'To understand semiconductors, world must understand Taiwan and TSMC': Chris Miller","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The world could not survive a single day without TSMC.That’s according to Chris Miller, the author of the recently published “Chip War,” a book that delves into the history of a product that is essential to the functioning of the global economy, widely known about but poorly understood, and probably on many people right now: the semiconductor. Miller joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) on Thursday (March 16) to discuss the growing polarization of the semiconductor industry, its exponential growth, and his book, which recently won The Financial Times Business Book of the Year.Miller said it is hard to imagine a world without semiconductors, as they are now integrated into everything from refrigerators to cars to lightbulbs, per CNA. He said that people need to understand the importance of the semiconductor industry, and in order to do that, they must understand Taiwan and TSMC’s central role in the process.Miller and Chang both agreed that there was increasing polarization in the chip industry between China and the U.S. Chang said that he supports recent U.S. industrial policies designed to combat China’s growth in the semiconductor industry, despite previous harsh critiques of some aspects.During Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022, Chang reportedly told the then U.S. house speaker that America's plans to enter the industry were “incredibly naive.” Washington is increasing incentives for Taiwan to expand its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S., with TSMC announcing plans to up its investment in the country in December 2022.Miller also spoke about the semiconductor’s unique position as both a key driver of the global economy and a technology that grows exponentially. He said that if airplanes had doubled their speed every two years, as semiconductors have done, they would be flying at the speed of light, and that “only the semiconductor industry has really done this.”In an earlier interview with Engineering & Technology, Miller said that a Chinese annexation of Taiwan would have a “dramatic” impact on the whole world. “The risk is there because China’s military is so much stronger today, while America’s position is weaker in relative terms,” he said.",2023/03/16,1696,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837306,"US, partners stage military drills amid Japan-S. Korea talks","TOKYO (AP) — The United States, Canada, India, Japan and South Korea are staging joint anti-submarine warfare drills amid talks between Japanese and South Korean leaders aimed at strengthening their alliance with Washington against threats from China and North Korea.The Sea Dragon 23 exercises that started on Wednesday will culminate in more than 270 hours of in-flight training “ranging from tracking simulated targets to the final problem of tracking a U.S. Navy submarine,” the U.S. 7th Fleet said in a news release.Pilots and flight officers from all participating countries will also hold classroom training sessions to “build plans and discuss tactics incorporating the capabilities and equipment of their respective nations,” The 7th Fleet said.The drills are being held as a competition, with the country winning the most points taking home the “Dragon Belt.”The U.S. Navy is being represented by two P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft, currently based in Guam. It did not say where the exercises would be held or how long they would last.With 50 to 70 ships and submarines, 150 aircraft and more than 27,000 sailors and marines ready to deploy at any given time, the 7th Fleet “routinely interacts and operates with Allies and partners in preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” it said.That includes operating in the South China Sea, where it routinely draws Beijing's anger by sailing and flying near islands held and fortified by China, which claims the strategic waterway virtually in its entirety.The exercises also come as China's navy is taking part in joint search and rescue exercises in the Gulf of Oman with Iran and Russia, three of the countries most at odds with the United States.Other nations, as yet unidentified, are also taking part in the “Security Bond-2023” exercises, which China's Defense Ministry says will “help deepen practical cooperation between the participating countries’ navies ... and inject positive energy into regional peace and stability.”U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday that the White House was not concerned by the joint training exercise.China’s dispute with Japan over tiny islands in the East China Sea has also heated up, with both sides accusing the other of violating their maritime territory.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837307,Clippers beat Warriors 134-126 despite 50 points from Curry,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Even in the midst of Stephen Curry putting on a shooting clinic during the third quarter, Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers didn't get rattled.They were able to weather Curry's best punches, kept their lead and then pulled away from the Golden State Warriors in the fourth quarter.Leonard continued his hot play with 30 points, Paul George had 24 and the Clippers overcame Curry's 50-point night to beat the Warriors 134-126 on Wednesday night.“You know they are going to make big runs, but we kept our composure, stayed steady and executed on the offensive end,” said Leonard, who had his fourth 30-point effort in the last eight games. He was 10 of 19 from the field and had eight rebounds and five assists.The Clippers (37-33) have won four straight to move into fifth place in the Western Conference. The defending NBA champion Warriors (36-34) are a game back as the teams split the four-game season series.“We didn't get stagnant. We executed our shots,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “When a guy like that (Curry) explodes, we stayed with the game plan. I thought our offense really carried us.”Curry tied a season high in points with the 12th 50-point game of his career. He was 20 of 28 and made eight 3-pointers.“It’s nice to play and shoot well. It is what I expect to do every night,"" Curry said. ""No matter what the stat sheet looks like after the game, it’s just frustrating when you can’t get over the hump and figure out a way to get a win.”Jordan Poole added 19 points for the Warriors. They have lost nine straight road games.Curry had 21 points in the third quarter, and hit three 3-pointers. He was 9 of 11 and had one stretch where he hit five straight shots. Despite that, the Clippers had a 99-93 lead going into the final 12 minutes.Los Angeles had a three-point advantage early in the fourth before it went on a 10-1 run to pull away. Batum’s 3-pointer with 9:07 remaining put the Clippers up 109-97.Warriors coach Steve Kerr said one of the biggest keys in the game was the Clippers grabbing 16 offensive rebounds and having a 27-11 advantage in second-chance points.“With the way our roster is right now, we're vulnerable on the glass,” Kerr said. ""I thought the Clippers played a great game. Steph was sublime. It was incredible to watch him play tonight. It was a great, great game. We just came up short.”KEY RUNThe Clippers trailed 70-66 three minutes into the third quarter, then scored 14 straight points to take a double-digit lead. Eric Gordon, who had 14 points in the quarter, scored the last eight during the run.The Warriors countered with a 16-8 rally, including 12 by Curry, to get within a basket, but Leonard hit a 3-pointer on the next trip down the floor to end the run.NOT SO SWEET 16Draymond Green received his 16th technical foul of the season with 40.8 seconds remaining when he threw the ball off Russell Westbrook's face following a Clippers' layup.Players receive one-game suspensions once they reach 16 in a season and then are suspended a game for each two additional technical fouls.Green, who had eight points before he fouled out, is tied with Memphis' Dillon Brooks for the most technicals in the NBA.Green was optimistic that he might avoid having to sit out Friday night's game at Atlanta.“I expect some changes. I got one technical this year because a ref yelled at me,” he said. “I said, `If I yell at you, I’m going to get fined.' And I got a tech for it. So I think something will change.”EJECTEDOn the ensuing trip down the floor, Marcus Morris Sr. received a Flagrant-2 foul and was ejected with 31 seconds remaining in the first half.Morris and Green were vying in the paint for position while Curry was trying a 3-pointer when it appeared Morris hit Green in the face.Referee Kevin Scott said on the ESPN broadcast: ""All the components (for a Flagrant 2) were met: wind-up, impact, follow-through above the shoulders, high potential for injury and a non-basketball play.”TIP INSWarriors: Klay Thompson had 15 points. ... Green reached 4,400 career defensive rebounds during the second quarter.Clippers: Ivica Zubac had 19 points and 16 rebounds. ... Terance Mann scored 17 points off the bench and Gordon added 16.UP NEXTWarriors: At Atlanta on Friday night.Clippers: Host Orlando on Saturday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837310,"After Cyclone Freddy, flood risk lingers for southern Africa","BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — After four days of destructive wind and rain, local communities and relief workers are now confronting the aftermath of Cyclone Freddy which has killed more than 250 people and displaced tens of thousands of others across Malawi and Mozambique and may still cause further damage.Cyclone Freddy dissipated over land late Wednesday, but weather monitoring centers warned that countries are still vulnerable to flooding and landslides.At least 225 people have been killed in southern Malawi, including within the financial capital of Blantyre, officials said. Around 88,000 people are still displaced and parts of the region remain inaccessible. Malawi's president, Lazarus Chakwera, has declared a 14-day national mourning period. In Mozambique, authorities said at least 53 were killed since late Saturday, with 50,000 more still displaced.“Roads and bridges have been swept away cutting off communities from much-needed support. Houses and homes have been destroyed leaving families stranded and out in the cold,” said Mathew Pickard, the regional director for southern Africa at the aid organization CARE International. “As rescue efforts continue, the death toll is anticipated to rise.”Hundreds of people have been moved to camps but food and clean water is still scarce, said Andrew Mavala, executive director of the Malawi Network for Older Persons, with dozens of older people who don’t know how they’ll recover.In Malawi and Mozambique, where cholera outbreaks were already ongoing when Cyclone Freddy ripped through, deaths from the disease and other water-borne illnesses are also expected to rise.Cyclone Freddy is “very massive in terms of health disruption,” said Ahmed Ogwell, the acting director of the Africa's Centre for Disease and Control Prevention. He warned there’s “every likelihood we may see cross-border spread” of cholera, which already has outbreaks in Mozambique and Malawi. Both countries recorded more than 3,000 new cholera cases in the past week.Scientists say human-caused climate change has worsened cyclone activity.Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Grantham Institute who leads the World Weather Attribution group, drew parallels between Cyclone Freddy and last year's Tropical Cyclone Batsirai and others, where a study by the group found that climate change made heavy rainfall more frequent and severe.“If we did a study on Cyclone Freddy the findings would be very similar, given the processes leading to the heavy rain in Freddy are very similar to those in Batsirai,” Otto said.Cyclone Freddy has caused destruction in southern Africa since late February, when it pummeled Mozambique as well as the islands of Madagascar and Réunion. It then looped back to the mainland.“Ocean temperatures between Mozambique and Madagascar during the second loop that Freddy took between them were quite warm to keep the cyclone alive and provide a lot of moisture,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. ""These persistently warm ocean waters and excess supply of moisture is a clear signal of climate change.”Freddy first developed near Australia in early February and traveled across the entire southern Indian Ocean before it bounced around the Mozambique Channel. The U.N. weather agency said what made Freddy remarkable is that it never completely dissipated while over land, even after two landfalls.The World Meteorological Organization has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record for the longest-ever cyclone in recorded history, which was set by 31-day Hurricane John in 1994. The assessment will take at least two months.___Alexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837311,Former Israeli premier urges world leaders to shun Netanyahu,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel’s former prime minister on Thursday urged world leaders to shun Israel’s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as he presses ahead with a plan to overhaul the country's justice system. The United States and Germany, two of Israel’s closest allies, called on Netanyahu to slow down.The rare calls for restraint and international intervention came as thousands of Israelis once again took to the streets to protest Netanyahu’s plan.Ehud Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006-2009, told The Associated Press that global leaders should refuse to meet with Netanyahu. He appealed specifically to British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is expected to host Netanyahu in the coming weeks.“I urge the leaders of the friendly countries to the state of Israel to refrain from meeting with the Israeli prime minister,” Olmert said.He added that he was aware his call, as a former Israeli prime minister, “is quite extraordinary"" but that the situation calls for it. ""I think that the present government of Israel is simply anti-Israeli,” Olmert said.He took aim at Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, an alliance of ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist parties that oppose Palestinian independence and support increased settlement construction in occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians.Netanyahu's coalition allies today have close ties with the West Bank settler movement and have a history of statements offensive to Palestinians, women, LGBTQ people and minorities.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the current minister for national security was convicted in the past of incitement to racism and supporting a terror group. Netanyahu's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, recently called for a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank to be “erased,” though he later apologized after an international uproar over the comments.""Those who are in favor of the state of Israel should be against the prime minister of the state of Israel,” Olmert said.A spokesman for Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Netanyahu and his allies are now barreling ahead with a plan that aims to weaken Israel’s Supreme Court and give his parliamentary coalition control over the appointment of judges.Netanyahu says the plan will correct an imbalance that he says has given the courts too much sway in how Israel is governed. Critics say the overhaul will upend the country’s system of checks and balances and would give the prime minister too much power. They also say Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, could escape justice once the court system is revamped.Israel’s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, offered a compromise proposal to the nation late Wednesday. But Netanyahu quickly rejected the package as “one sided” and favoring his opponents.The overhaul has plunged Israel into one of its worst domestic crises. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past two and a half months, and the plan has sparked an uproar from top legal officials, business leaders who say it will damage the economy and from within the country’s military, the most trusted institution among Israel’s Jewish majority. Reservists have pledged not to serve under what they see as a shift toward autocracy.Protesters held a “day of disruption” for a third week on Thursday, with thousands of people blocking roads, including the main highway of the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. Protesters in Jerusalem drew a large red and pink streak on city streets leading to the Supreme Court and a small flotilla of bloats blocked the shipping lane off the coast of the northern city of Haifa.“The elected government is doing a legislative blitz that aims to give absolute power to the executive. And absolute power to the executive with no checks and balances is simply a dictatorship. And this is what we’re fighting against,” said Shlomit Tassa, a protester in Tel Aviv, waving an Israeli flag.Five opposition party leaders staged a joint press conference and called on Netanyahu to accept the president’s proposal. Yair Lapid, the Knesset opposition leader, said they “welcome the president’s proposal because in a civil war, there will only be losers.”Key Israeli allies also waded into the debate. At a joint news conference with Netanyahu in Berlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced concern about the overhaul plan and praised the Israeli president’s attempts to seek a “broad basic consensus.”“As close friends of Israel with shared democratic values, we are following this debate very closely, and I cannot hide the fact that we’re following it with great concern,” Scholz said at a news conference alongside Netanyahu. “The independence of the judiciary is a precious democratic asset.”Netanyahu showed no sign of being swayed. “I am attentive to what is happening in the nation, but we need to bring something that is in line with the mandate we received,” he told reporters.The White House also praised Herzog’s effort to broker a compromise.“The genius of our democracy — and frankly Israel’s democracy — is that they’re built on strong institutions, that they include checks and balances that foster an independent judiciary,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. He said Herzog's efforts are ""consistent with those same democratic principles.”Olmert was once one of Netanyahu’s fiercest rivals in the hard-line Likud Party. But over time, Olmert veered far to the left. As prime minister, he held months of intense peace talks with the Palestinians before he was forced to resign to face his own legal troubles.Olmert later spent 16 months in prison after being convicted of accepting bribes and obstructing justice for acts committed years before he was prime minister.Olmert announced his resignation in 2008, long before he was indicted. At the time, Netanyahu, then in the opposition, led the calls for him to step down, saying he was unfit to rule while facing a criminal probe.Asked about Netanyahu’s refusal to step down in similar circumstances, Olmert said he had different values than his old rival. He said that at a certain point, he realized the country’s interests were more important than his personal interests.“The state of Israel comes first,” he said. “I retired a year before I was indicted because I felt that it is not right.” ___Bentov reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

The recording, however, has raised eyebrows because it contains snippets of “Suddenly missing you so bad” (突然好想你), a song by Taiwanese band Mayday.Some have questioned the effectiveness of this approach, while others flagged copyright issues. No complaints have been filed, according to the police department, but it has halted playing the clip to avoid controversy.The police department rushed to secure the authorization of B’in Music, the record label that signed Mayday, and sort out copyright issues with relevant organizations, wrote Storm Media.The incident follows a flurry of controversies surrounding the former head of Foxconn Industrial Big Data Office in the run-up to her election in 2022. Kao, 39, has been lambasted over her comments on thesis plagiarism and the alleged appropriation of wages for legislative assistants.",2023/03/16,887,Politics

In another incident, a soldier allegedly tried to swim to China from the offshore Kinmen County island of Erdan, and at another Marine Corps training center in Pingtung County, a handgun also went missing.The T91 assault rifle actions were reported missing during a weapons inventory check at the 99th Marine Brigade in Kaohsiung City on March 8. Discussions about the incident at the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday (March 15) angered Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱國正), leading him to threaten disciplinary action against those found responsible.Following his comments, the Navy announced Thursday it had located the T91 actions at the 99th Brigade base. The actions were handed over to the judiciary as evidence to allow prosecutors to complete their investigation, UDN reported. There were no details about where exactly the gun parts were found inside the base.",2023/03/16,973,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837347,TikTok faces complete ban in US unless ByteDance divest,"The United States has threatened to ban TikTok in the country unless the social media company's Chinese owners, ByteDance, sell their stakes in the video-sharing app.TikTok confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius) told the popular video-sharing app to part ways with ByteDance to avoid a US ban.It is the first time under the administration of President Joe Biden that a potential ban on TikTok has been threatened.His predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but failed.Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the potential that ByteDance could pass on data to China's government.The company has consistently denied sharing data with Chinese officials.Late last month, the White House gave all federal agencies 30 days to wipe TikTok off all government devices.The European Commission, Canada, and Australia have banned the app from their government phones.But the US has also taken a step that would make a complete ban easier.Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have been working on legislation that would give the Biden administration more power to clamp down on TikTok.Last week White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the move, saying it ""would empower the United States government to prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services... in a way that poses risks to Americans' sensitive data and our national security,"" he said.TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew was due to appear before the US Congress next week.""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said.""The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing,"" she added,The company has been working with the US for nearly two years to address national security concerns. It said it has spent more than $1.5 billion (€1.4 billion) on rigorous data security efforts.TikTok claims it has more than a billion users worldwide, including over 100 million in the US, including two-thirds of the country's teenagers.Users already spent more time on TikTok than on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837348,Credit Suisse to borrow $54 billion from Swiss central bank,"Switzerland-based global investment bank and financial firm Credit Suisse AG early on Thursday said it will borrow 50 billion Swiss francs (€50.7 billion, $54 billion) from the country's central bank in a move meant to strengthen its liquidity and deposit reserves.It also made a buyback offer on $2.5 billion worth of US debt and €500 million in European debt.""These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders,"" said the investment firm's Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Körner.The steps come during a severe slump in Credit Suisse's share price that triggered larger fears of a broader bank deposit crisis.The move to borrow from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) makes Credit Suisse the first major global bank to be extended such a lifeline since the 2008 global financial crisis. Swiss authorities on Wednesday said Credit Suisse met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed.Central banks across the world extended liquidity to banks in general during periods of market turmoil, including that induced by the COVID pandemic.Credit Suisse's stock fell as much as 30% on Wednesday triggered by a Bloomberg TV interview where Mr. al-Khudairy of the Saudi National Bank — Credit Suisse's largest shareholder — said it would ""absolutely not"" push more liquidity into the bank. He later clarified that his staunch position was to abide by regulatory rules and statutory limitations.The market, already on edge from last week's collapse of two mid-size US firms Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, continued to sell Credit Suisse shares despite reassurance that the bank had a strong liquidity base with a 150% cash deposit ratio. A cash deposit ratio is the amount of money a bank should have available as a percentage of the total amount of money its customers have deposited in the bank.Meanwhile, two supervisory sources told Reuters news agency that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to question them about their exposures to Credit Suisse. The US Treasury also said it is monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and is in touch with global counterparts, according to a Treasury spokesperson.mk/sms (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/16,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837356,Jordanian Commercial Office in Taipei statement about incorrect information regarding quake relief effort in Syria,"The Jordanian Commercial Office (JCO) in Taipei expresses grave concerns over a comment, regarding quake relief effort in Syria, made by an NGO entity called Arab Chamber of Commerce Taiwan which is not recognized by the Jordanian Commercial Office or by the other Arabic countries’ trade offices in Taipei at a quake relief fundraising event on March 8.

            At the fundraising event, the JCO was mentioned by those in charge of this entity. The JCO denounces the mentioning of its name without its approval in order to achieve goals that the office is not fully aware of, and that is not consistent with the JCO’s tasks and duties and the work mechanisms carried out by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has exclusive official bodies dealing with the humanitarian relief operations represented by the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization (JHCO).Based on that, the JCO in Taiwan affirms that no one has the right to speak on its behalf under penalty of legal liability.

            On this occasion, the JCO believes that there is a need to shed light on the efforts by Arabs, international groups, and the United Nations, which came together to help Syria after the earthquake disaster, which was marginalized and underestimated during the activities of the aforementioned night to clarify the facts to the Taiwanese.

            From the first moments of the earthquake, Jordan at the highest levels extended its deepest condolences to the people of Syria for the tragic loss engendered by the deadly earthquake. Jordan expressed solidarity with the people of Syria in this catastrophe and the great loss of life and property that resulted from it, and its willingness to provide what is necessary to assist in relief efforts.











            JHCO initiated from the first moments of the disaster in Syria to implement the directives of His Majesty King Abdullah II by standing with Syria to face the effects from the earthquake, where JHCO, in cooperation with the Jordanian private sector and the Jordanian people, conducted convoys of humanitarian aid that crossed the land borders with Syria and delivered aid to Syrian relief agencies and to United Nations organizations operating in Syria. The number of Jordanian trucks loaded with humanitarian aid to Syria exceeded 110 trucks, including 10 ambulances. Meanwhile, JHCO also sent three humanitarian aid planes to Syria, loaded with rescue equipment. The planes also carried Jordanian rescuers from the international search and rescue team and doctors from the Royal Medical Services.

            The value of this aid amounted to more than US$20 million. The aid included family tents, generators, supplies for children and the elderly, infant formula, parcels, foodstuffs, foldable beds, heaters, blankets, mattresses and pillows, flashlights, winter clothes and footwear, mineral water, medicines and medical supplies, sleeping bags, sanitary parcels, food containers, respirators, first aid and recovery bags and rubble removal and rescue equipment.

            Arab countries did not hesitate to fulfill their duty in providing humanitarian aid to the earthquake victims in Syria, as the six Arab Gulf states countries represented by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sultanate of Oman, State of Kuwait, State of Qatar, and the Kingdom of Bahrain were generous in providing financial and in-kind assistance to Syria, as these countries established an air bridge to deliver humanitarian aid, rescue teams, in addition to sending trucks to all Syrian regions. The initial Gulf cash assistance to Syria amounted to more than US$200 million, and the campaign is continuing. Other Arab countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Iraq have sent planes, ships, and trucks loaded with medical and relief materials to Syria.

            Many countries, including those from the European Union, also announced the sending of planes, ships, and trucks loaded with tons of medical and relief materials to Syria. As of March 8, seven United Nations agencies have provided 648 trucks loaded with aid, and this aid entered through the three crossings with the Turkish border, and the United Nations confirmed that its partners will continue to expand the scope of response to the earthquake-affected areas throughout Syria.

            The data published by the Syrian government or the countries that sent the aid show that the aid exceeds 20 thousand tons, as the volume of aid received by the Syrian government reached about 10 thousand tons, transported through 271 planes, three ships, and dozens of trucks entering through the border crossings with Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.

            Data from the Border Crossings Administration with Turkey in northwestern Syria shows the entry of 1,818 trucks provided by the United Nations, Arab and international organizations, local councils, civil, and tribal aid. These trucks’ loads range between 500 kg and twenty tons, according to their size and the materials they carry. This makes it difficult to count the carried quantities.

            In this regard it must be noted that Jordan has been affected significantly by the regional unrest started in 2011, mainly in economic and social aspects.

            However, Jordan has opened its arms and houses to refugees fleeing regional violence despite our scarce natural resources. And we are proud to say that we have never turned away a neighbor seeking refuge and relief. We are hosting 1.4 million Syrians whether as refugees or residents in the Kingdom, who account for more than 20% of total population. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, tens of thousands of Yemenis and Libyans, and about half a million Iraqis, who are already in Jordan.

            We have provided them all with assistance, medical aid, and shelter to ease their suffering. Jordan has spent more than US$12billionfrom its own budget and assistance received from partners since the beginning of the Syrian Refugee Crisis to accommodate the influx of Syrians to the country. We must praise here the support provided by Taiwan to assist Jordan in implementing the Jordanian response plan in bearing the burdens of the Syrian crisis, which is implicitly considered support for Syria and the brotherly Syrian people.

            This is a humanitarian duty that rests on the shoulders of all mankind. The Arab countries and friendly foreign countries including Taiwan as well as the United Nations have all rushed to help Syria and Turkey bear the disaster of the earthquake. Taiwan showed her good will from the beginning of this destructive national disaster and its necessary that we all continue to help each other but through the right and lawful channels to make sure that the aid goes to the rightful people in the affected areas and lands.The Jordanian Commercial Office (JCO) in Taipei expresses grave concerns over a comment, regarding quake relief effort in Syria, made by an NGO entity called Arab Chamber of Commerce Taiwan which is not recognized by the Jordanian Commercial Office or by the other Arabic countries’ trade offices in Taipei at a quake relief fundraising event on March 8.At the fundraising event, the JCO was mentioned by those in charge of this entity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837364,Italy retrial ordered for Americans in killing of officer,"ROME (AP) — Italy’s highest court has ordered a retrial for two American citizens convicted in the slaying of an Italian police officer during a sting operation gone wrong.The Court of Cassation late Wednesday threw out the guilty verdicts against Finnegan Lee Elder, now 23, and Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, 22, both convicted in the stabbing death of the 35-year-old caribiniere during a plainclothes operation in July 2019 while the Americans, teens at the time, were on vacation in Rome.The court will issue its reasons for the verdict in the coming weeks, and instruct an appeals court on the precise issues to examine in a new trial.Elder’s lawyer, Roberto Capra, expressed satisfaction at the decision, saying a new trial would open the possibility of recalculating the sentence.“It confirms a topic we raised from the first day: That Elder was not aware of having in front of him a law enforcement agent. The dynamics of the events exclude this fact,” Capra told reporters. He expressed hope that a retrial would give room to lower the penalty.The two men, friends from Northern California, were sentenced to life in prison, Italy’s toughest penalty, in the initial trial. An appeals court upheld the verdict, but lowered the sentence to 24 years for Elder and 22 for Natale-Hjorth.Carabiniere Vice Brigadier Mario Cerciello Rega, 35, was stabbed 11 times while he and a partner were on a plainclothes operation to recover a backpack that the two Americans took during a failed drug deal. Elder claimed he pulled out a knife in self-defense to break free as he and the officer struggled on the ground, and the officer tried to strangle him.Cerciello Rega's partner testified that they had indeed declared themselves as officers, but the defense has cast doubt on his version.Natale-Hjorth testified that he grappled with Cerciello Rega’s partner and was unaware of the stabbing when he ran back to a hotel.His lawyer, Fabio Alonzi, said the high court's decision indicates a weakness in the prosecution's argument that Natale-Hjorth was an accomplice in the murder, and the retrial in his regard will focus on that element.Alonzi visited Natale-Hjorth in prison on Thursday. “He told me it was the first time he felt relaxed, even though he understands that the road to freedom is long,"" the lawyer said.Elders' parents said the prospect of a new trial, even focused on narrow issues, is giving their son the first sign that he can begin to envision a future beyond the daily prison routine.He didn’t have a hope for the future for a long time after the first sentence,'' Elder's mother, Leah Elder, told The Associated Press. “The second sentence allowed him to have a little bit (of hope), now this third court decision I think truly will allow him to envision what his life may look like.”",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837365,"Exhibit: 'Invisible' Monet, Leon, was key to impressionism","PARIS (AP) — Behind some great men, there is a bigger brother.Claude Monet’s older sibling is the focus of a landmark Paris exhibit illuminating the hitherto unknown role Leon Monet played in the French impressionist painter’s life and art. Leon — a color chemist four years his senior -- is now understood to have been critical in the emergence of Monet’s commercial success as well as the famed color palette that created masterpieces like the “Water Lilies” series.“It’s never been known before, but without Leon there would not have really been a Monet — the artist the world knows today,” said Geraldine Lefebvre, exhibit curator at the Musee du Luxembourg.“His rich big brother supported him in the first period of his life when he had no money or clients and was starving,"" she said. “But more than that. The vivid palette Monet was famous for came from the synthetic textile dye colors Leon created” in the town of Rouen — site of some of Claude's best-known paintings.The groundbreaking exhibit is the fruit of years of investigation by Lefebvre, who visited Monet’s great-grandchildren, studied family albums and brought to light a masterly portrait of Leon by Claude that Leon hid away in a dusty private collection and has never before been seen by the public. The 1874 painting shows Leon with a black suit, stern expression and red — almost wine-flushed — cheeks.The exhibit dispels a long-held view that Claude and his older brother were estranged.“Historians always thought the two brothers had nothing to do with each other. It was assumed because there are no photographs of Claude and Leon together, and no correspondence. In reality, they were incredibly close throughout their life,” Lefebvre said.The brothers had an argument in the early 1900s and that may explain why no direct traces of the relationship exist. “Maybe Leon got rid of the traces, maybe it was Claude. Maybe it was jealousy. We will never know. It is a mystery,” Lefebvre said.What is now known is that Leon would wine and dine his younger brother, introduce him to other artists, give him money, and patronize his art — buying it up at auction at high prices to boost his reputation.“One of the problems was because they shared the surname it seemed like (Claude) Monet was buying back his own pictures. But it was Leon,” said professor Frances Fowle, senior curator of French art at the National Galleries of Scotland.“This exhibit is important as it throws light on Leon Monet, who up until now has been an invisible figure. It also reveals the wider network at work. Leon was a key figure,” Fowle added.Leon’s influence went beyond his brother: He financially supported other impressionists such as Camille Pissarro, Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley — some of whom would connect around his dinner table in Rouen, where the wine would flow freely. Claude followed his brother to Rouen, where he painted his Rouen cathedral masterpieces.Monet also worked for his older brother as a color assistant, a pivotal moment not only in his life — but possibly in the emergence of impressionism as we know it.Leon would dissolve carbon to create a chemical called aniline, which created incredible synthetic colors that natural pigments couldn't compete with. One of the earlier examples of Leon’s color filtering down into Monet’s art is from an 1860s illustration — before he was famous — that is featured in the exhibit. Monet drew his future wife Camille in a dress with an eye-popping green that had never been seen before.“The French press coined the term ‘Monet green,’” Lefebvre said, adding that journalists were initially mocking of it. “At the time, they said he would make a good dye artist.”However, both Monets had the last laugh.Claude Monet founded impressionism — a term coined from his 1872 painting “Impression, Sunrise” — to become one of the most celebrated painters of the last two centuries. And by impressionism's height at the end of the 19th century, an incredible “80% of all impressionists’ work” used the synthetic colors borrowed from Leon, according to Lefebvre.These synthetic hues, which were cutting edge at the time, enabled members of the group to depict the fleeting impression of the moment with shifting colors and luminosity.“Who knows the exact extent of the impact Leon had on the movement?"" Lefebvre said with a shy smile. “But it was extraordinary.”“Leon Monet. Brother of the artist and collector” runs at the Musee du Luxembourg in Paris from March 15 until July 16.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837367,Lebanon's empty schools bode long-term damage from crisis,"BEIRUT (AP) — On a recent school day, the Rene Mouawad High School in Beirut was empty, its classrooms dark, just like all of Lebanon’s public schools have been for most of the past three months. Its striking teachers were protesting in front of the Education Ministry, not far away.About a hundred teachers joined the demonstration outside the ministry, blocking traffic and holding placards demanding pay raises. “We are done with charity,” said Nisreen Chahine, the head of the union for contractor teachers. “We are not negotiating anymore. They should either rightfully pay us or go home.”The teachers gave speeches demanding officials come out and talk to them. But as usual in these regular protests, no one from the ministry emerged. After several hours, the teachers packed up and went home.Lebanon’s schools are crumbling under the weight of the country’s economic collapse as the political leadership — which caused the crisis through decades of corruption and mismanagement — balks at taking any measures to resolve it. Since the meltdown began in late 2019, over three-quarters of Lebanon’s 6 million people have been plunged into poverty, their assets evaporating as the currency's value shrivels and inflation rises at one of the world’s highest rates.Most of the country’s children have not been in school for months — many since even before teachers, who say they can no longer live on their salaries, went on strike in December. Lebanon was once known for producing a highly skilled, educated work force. But now an entire generation is missing out on schooling, wreaking long-term damage on prospects for the country's economy and future.Teachers called their strike because their salaries, in Lebanese pounds, have became too low to cover rent and other basic expenses. The pound has gone from 1,500 to the dollar before the crisis to 100,000 to the dollar currently. Most teachers are now paid the equivalent of about $1 an hour, even after several raises since 2019. Grocery stores and other businesses now usually price their goods in dollars.Teachers are demanding adjusted salaries, a transportation stipend, and health benefits. The government only offered to partially cover transportation, saying it didn’t have the budget for more. Though schools partially reopened last week after some teachers returned to work, most chose to continue striking.Even before the crisis, Lebanon’s investment in public schools was limited. In 2020, the government’s spending on education was equivalent only to 1.7% of Lebanon’s GDP, one of the lowest rates in the world, according to the World Bank. The 2022 budget allocated 3.6 trillion Lebanese lira for education — the equivalent of around $90 million at the time the budget was passed in October, less than half the $182 million budget on education from a donor-funded humanitarian program.Instead, the government has relied for years on private and charity schools to educate children. Humanitarian agencies paid to cover salaries and keep decrepit infrastructure functioning. Two-thirds of Lebanese children once went to private schools, but hundreds of thousands dropped out in recent years because private schools have had to increase tuition to cover soaring costs. Public and private schools struggle to keep lights on as fuel costs mount.Even before the strike, more than 700,000 children in Lebanon, many of them Syrian refugees, were not in school because of the economic crisis. With the strike, an additional 500,000 joined their ranks, according to UNICEF.“It means we now see children ages 10, 12, 14 and they are not able to even write their own names or write basic sentences,” Ettie Higgins, UNICEF deputy representative for Lebanon, told the The Associated Press. UNICEF said that last week it gave almost $14 million to help more than 1,000 public schools pay staff.Rana Ghalib, a mother of four, said it makes her anxious to see her children at home when they should be in school. Her 14-year-old son had to repeat the 6th grade because he has fallen behind during previous disruptions.“The classrooms are basically empty because teachers are demanding their rights and they’re dark because there is no fuel,” Ghalib told the AP.The international community has been pushing Lebanon's leaders to carry out wide-ranging reforms in the economy, financial system and governance in order to receive a $3 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund and unlock development aid. The political elite, which has run the country since 1990, has stalled — because, critics say, reforms would undermine its grip on power and wealth. Amid political deadlock, there hasn’t been a president for months, and the government only functions in a limited caretaker capacity.Education, meanwhile, is joining banks, medicine and electricity in the ranks of Lebanon’s failing institutions. That could cause long-term damage: Lebanon has traditionally relied on its educated and skilled diaspora population abroad to send remittances back home to support families, invest and feed dollars into the banking system. The exodus of skilled people skyrocketed during the economic crisis, leaving remittances as Lebanon’s last economic lifeline.Hussein Cheaito, an economist and nonresident fellow at The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank, says the crippled education system will further “deteriorate the social fabric” of Lebanon and deepen poverty.“This will have a effect on the longer-term growth of the economy,” he told the AP. “This means there will be less access to jobs in the future … (and) weaken the labor market in general.”Ghalib, meanwhile, checks on her children, who are watching TV and playing with their cellphones at a time when they would usually be studying. Even her 9-year-old daughter is aware that her future is in jeopardy, she said.""My youngest daughter tells me, ‘I want to be a doctor, but how can I do that if I’m sitting at home?’” Ghalib said. “I don’t know what to tell her.”",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837368,UN nuclear watchdog: 2.5 tons of uranium missing in Libya,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Some 2.5 tons of natural uranium stored in a site in war-torn Libya have gone missing, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said Thursday, raising safety and proliferation concerns.Natural uranium can't immediately be used for energy production or bomb fuel, as the enrichment process typically requires the metal to be converted into a gas, then later spun in centrifuges to reach the levels needed.However, each ton of natural uranium — if obtained by a group with the technological means and resources — can be refined to 5.6 kilograms (12 pounds) of weapons-grade material over time, experts say. That makes finding the missing metal important for nonproliferation experts.In a statement, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, informed member states Wednesday about the missing uranium.The IAEA statement remained tightlipped though on much of the details.On Tuesday, “agency safeguards inspectors found that 10 drums containing approximately 2.5 tons of natural uranium in the form of uranium ore concentrate were not present as previously declared at a location in the state of Libya,” the IAEA said. “Further activities will be conducted by the agency to clarify the circumstances of the removal of the nuclear material and its current location.”Reuters first reported on the IAEA warning about the missing Libyan uranium, saying the IAEA told members reaching the site that's not under government control required “complex logistics.”The IAEA declined to offer more details on the missing uranium. However, its acknowledgment the uranium went missing at a “previously declared site” narrows the possibilities.One such declared site is Sabha, some 660 kilometers (410 miles) southeast of Libya's capital, Tripoli, in the country's lawless southern reaches of the Sahara Desert. There, Libya under dictator Moammar Qadhafi stored thousands of barrels of so-called yellowcake uranium for a once-planned uranium conversion facility that was never built in his decadeslong secret weapons program.Estimates put the Libyan stockpile at some 1,000 metric tons of yellowcake uranium under Qadhafi, who declared his nascent nuclear weapons program to the world in 2003 to after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.While inspectors removed the last of the enriched uranium from Libya in 2009, the yellowcake remained behind, with the U.N. in 2013 estimating some 6,400 barrels of it were stored at Sabha. American officials had worried Iran could try to purchase the uranium from Libya, something Qadhafi's top civilian nuclear official tried to reassure the U.S. about, according to a 2009 diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks.“Stressing that Libya viewed the question as primarily a commercial one, (the official) noted that prices for uranium yellowcake on the world market had been increasing, and that Libya wanted to maximize its profit by properly timing the sale of its stockpile,” then-Ambassador Gene A. Cretz wrote.But the 2011 Arab Spring saw rebels topple Qadhafi and ultimately kill him. Sabha grew increasingly lawless, with African migrants crossing Libya, saying some had been sold as slaves in the city, the U.N. reported.In recent years, Sabha largely has been under the control of the self-styled Libyan National Army, headed by Khalifa Hifter. The general, who is widely believed to have worked with the CIA during his time in exile during Qadhafi's era, has been battling for control of Libya against a Tripoli-based government.A spokesman for Hifter declined to answer questions from The Associated Press. Chadian rebel forces also have had a presence in the southern city over recent years.___Associated Press writers Samy Magdy and Jack Jeffrey in Cairo contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837369,"Strikes, protests and clashes over deadly Greek rail crash","ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Clashes broke out in Athens Thursday during a general strike in Greece that was called in response to a rail disaster last month.Protesters hurled gasoline bombs at a police cordon near parliament. Riot police responded with tear gas and sound grenades, during the brief flare-up of violence that disrupted large, peaceful demonstrations. There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.The strike grounded flights and extensively disrupted services, while large protests were also held in other cities across the country. Clashes between youths and police also erupted in the southern port city of Patras.The strike also kept ferries to the Greek islands at port, left public hospitals running with emergency staff, halted public transport services and led to class cancellations at state-run schools.Unions have rallied behind railway workers’ associations that have staged rolling walkouts since the head-on train collision in northern Greece on Feb. 28 that left 57 people dead and dozens injured.“This government has had four years to fix problems with the rail network, but instead of owning up to that responsibility, they are blaming everyone else,” Popi Tsapanidou, a spokeswoman for main leftist opposition party Syriza, told private Skai television.The main protests were held in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, and in the capital Athens, where thousands chanted “this crime will not be forgotten” as they reached a police cordon outside a private rail operator.Stores and banks lowered their shutters when the protesters filed past as the capital was brought to a standstill. A wide variety of labor associations — from those representing lawyers to delivery drivers — joined the strike.The government, which faces a parliamentary election before the summer, says rail services will restart on March 22 and be restored gradually through April 11, with additional staff to monitor safety and mandatory speed reduction rules along sections of the track.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ center-right government has seen a strong lead in opinion polls reduced in recent weeks over its main rival, Syriza, with the two sides also locked in an ideological debate over how to reform Greece’s antiquated rail network.Mitsotakis has promised clearer boundaries between privatized services and the authorities overseeing them, seeking assistance from European Union experts in drawing up the changes. His political opponents argue that the poorly managed dismantling of agencies under state control has ultimately compromised rail safety.",2023/03/16,,World

Reina said that the Honduran government did not receive a satisfactory response from Taipei.In addition, Reina also said Honduras has needs that must be addressed in terms of energy, social policies, and refinancing of debt, which are ""drowning the country.""On Thursday, MOFA issued a press release which said Taiwan has been actively discussing bilateral cooperation plans with the Honduran government based on Tegucigalpa's priorities, ever since President Xiomara Castro took office in 2022,. The ministry said Taiwan is willing to assist Honduras in promoting construction and development within its capabilities.The ministry also warned Honduras to beware of ""China's false promises."" It emphasized that Taiwanese diplomats' efforts to communicate with counterparts in Honduras have never ceased.According to MOFA, Taiwan's representatives have ""responded positively to Honduran proposals from the beginning to the end, and expressed sincerity to assist Honduras within (Taiwan's) capabilities based on the best of goodwill."" The ministry said the interview with Reina on Wednesday ""did not fully reflect the actual communication between the two countries.""The ministry acknowledged that warning signs about the relationship between the two countries had emerged in recent months. However, Taiwan has tried its best to maintain friendly ties. In the press release, MOFA made it clear that Taiwan will not use money to compete with China for political influence.MOFA pointed out that the Honduran government has been plagued by debt problems and warned it not to ""drink poison to quench its thirst,"" only to ""fall into a Chinese debt trap instead.""",2023/03/16,643,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837391,US would not 'demolish' Taiwan's chip industry to prevent Chinese control: O'Brien,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Claims that the U.S. would destroy Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing industry rather than let China gain control are untrue, according to the person the comments were attributed to on Monday (March 13).U.S. news platform Semafor released an article, later republished by Business Insider, with the headline “U.S. would destroy Taiwan’s chip plants if China invades,” making a dubious inference from comments made by a former national security advisor to the Trump administration. Semafor misconstrued Robert O’Brien's claim that the U.S. allowing China to take over Taiwan was “never going to happen,” to make the claim that the U.S. would “demolish” Taiwan’s semiconductor industry rather than let China gain control.The interviewer appeared misled by an analogy O’Brien made about Britain’s decision to destroy a French Navy fleet in World War Two to avoid it falling into the hands of the Nazis. “They bombed that fleet!” the interviewer said.In February 2022, Semafor partnered with a think tank that operates under the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) United Front Work Department (UFWD), the CCP's branch responsible for promoting Chinese influence and ideas overseas. O’Brien suggested that his comments were deliberately misinterpreted in the interest of creating Chinese propaganda, per CNA.He revealed, ""The only people that will destroy Taiwan in an invasion are Communist China, and anyone who says that the U.S. is somehow going to destroy Taiwan or attack Taiwan, that's propaganda and misinformation from the Chinese Communist Party.”While O’Brien denied the U.S. would destroy TSMC, a report published by the U.S. Army War College in 2021 recommended destruction as a course of action. “The United States and Taiwan should lay plans for a targeted 'scorched-earth' strategy that would render Taiwan not just unattractive if ever seized by force, but positively costly to maintain,” the authors said.The report claimed, “This could be done most effectively by threatening to destroy facilities belonging to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company."" The report received negative reception in Taiwan and abroad, and critics quickly pointed out that publicizing such a strategy would be an “enormous boon” to the CCP’s UFWD.O’Brien said that Taiwan needs to buy more U.S. weapons and manufacture more defense equipment. Taiwan currently has a backlog of around US$19 billion (NT$589 billion) in U.S. arms purchases, since most weapons are being sent to Ukraine.""My position is that we should give the same priority to Taiwan that we're giving to Ukraine,"" O‘Brien said. “Ukraine is already in a war …but for Taiwan, we have to deter a war.""",2023/03/16,1546,Politics

“I understand that the business community in Taiwan has a lot vested in China. But they're going to lose it all, every single scrap of it.

Most pointedly, until electricity storage using batteries is vastly improved, it is very unwise for Taiwan to abandon nuclear power. “Nuclear is (Taiwan’s) only hedge against a naval blockade,” in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait, he said.

Under the Tsai administration, the government has set the goal of decommissioning and defueling nuclear power plants by the end of 2026, with all plants to be dismantled by 2038. Given the threat posed by China and current constraints on energy production and storage, it is undoubtedly prudent for future administrations to reconsider this plan.Zeihan does make some concessions on the practical applications of the offshore wind farms which Taiwan has invested in. “It’s a better choice than solar (power),” which Zeihan contends is not at all practical for Taiwan to invest in at scale.Ultimately, Zeihan warns that in “a country that imports 90% of its energy,” green tech in its current form is “atrocious” for the physical geography of Taiwan. “Taiwan is going to be an oil, gas, coal, and nuclear country until such time as we figure out a much better battery system,” he said.As far as Taiwan’s economic and political future, Zeihan anticipates that Taipei will likely follow Tokyo’s lead in terms of forming trade blocs or making trade agreements, especially economic deals with the United States.Readers can watch the entire segment below. Part one and part two are also available on YouTube. In part one, Zeihan spoke about China’s approaching economic collapse. In part two, he discussed the potential of military conflict in the Taiwan Strait.",2023/03/16,1472,Politics

Both men denied they had been trying to form spy rings on behalf of Beijing, though they acknowledged they had helped retired officers travel to China.",2023/03/16,856,Politics

            “We will build capacity for battery cells and battery packages for energy storage systems in Wisconsin, while we will also build capacity for battery packages for whole cars in our Ohio facility,” Nikkei cited Foxconn Chairman Young Liu (劉揚偉) as saying during an investors conference.

            Part of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 focuses on investment in domestic energy production and manufacturing, while Washington is also keen to boost domestic production of EVs and their key components, including batteries, the report noted. Under the IRA, domestic production is one of the stipulations for getting tax credits.

            “The timing of the IRA introduction is very good for us. We saw the opportunities in developing battery-related capacity. The U.S. government is also very supportive,” Liu added, according to Nikkei. The outlet also noted that Liu is scheduled for a North America trip in a few weeks.











            The Foxconn chairman also said the company’s revenue from EV components in 2022 hit NT$20 billion (US$653 billion) and is forecasted to increase to between NT$50 billion and NT$100 billion in 2023.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn on Wednesday (March 15) said it intends to build electric vehicle (EV) batteries in Ohio and Wisconsin, according to Nikkei.“We will build capacity for battery cells and battery packages for energy storage systems in Wisconsin, while we will also build capacity for battery packages for whole cars in our Ohio facility,” Nikkei cited Foxconn Chairman Young Liu (劉揚偉) as saying during an investors conference.Part of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 focuses on investment in domestic energy production and manufacturing, while Washington is also keen to boost domestic production of EVs and their key components, including batteries, the report noted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837443,"Exclusive: Apple supplier Foxconn wins AirPod order, plans $200 million factory in India","TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn has won an order to make AirPods for Apple Inc and plans to build a factory in India to produce the wireless earphones, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The deal will see Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and assembler of around 70% of all iPhones, become an AirPod supplier for the first time and underlines efforts by the key Apple supplier to further diversify production away from China. AirPods are currently made by a range of Chinese suppliers.
One source said Foxconn will invest more than $200 million in the new India AirPod plant in the southern Indian state of Telangana. It wasn't immediately clear how much the AirPod order would be worth.
The person, who requested anonymity as the matter was not public yet, said Foxconn officials had debated internally for months about whether to assemble AirPods due to relatively lower profit margins on making the device, but ultimately opted to go ahead with the deal to ""reinforce engagement"" with Apple.
""That way, we are more likely to get orders for their new products,"" the person said.
The decision to set up production in India was requested by Apple, according to the source.
Foxconn vies with Taiwanese rivals such as Wistron Corp and Pegatron Corp to win more orders from Apple, the world's most valuable company.
A subsidiary, Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd <6088.HK>, plans to start construction of a manufacturing facility in Telangana in the second half of this year and begin production by the end of 2024 at the earliest, the person said.
Shares in the Foxconn unit jumped nearly 9% after Reuters first reported the news, reversing an earlier loss of 2.2%. Shares in Foxconn itself traded up 0.5%, while the Taipei benchmark was down 1.1%.
A second person with direct knowledge of the matter, who also declined to be identified as the matter was not yet public, said the Foxconn subsidiary will make AirPods in India without providing further details.
Analysts have previously said Apple has asked suppliers including Foxconn to make AirPods in India, but details such as the size of investment, timeline and which suppliers have manufacturing plans in the country have not been disclosed.
Foxconn declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple and its key suppliers have been shifting production away from China, where strict COVID-19 curbs disrupted Foxconn's biggest iPhone factory last year. They are also seeking to avoid a potential hit to business from mounting Sino-U.S. trade friction.
Foxconn said on Wednesday it would ramp up investment outside China to meet customer demand and lower its reliance on China for production.
It was not immediately clear whether Foxconn's production plan would have impact on current AirPod suppliers, including Luxshare Precision Industry.
Luxshare did not immediately reply to a Reuters' request for comment.
Goertek Inc, another supplier, said in November an overseas client had asked it to suspend assembly work for a smart acoustic product, which analysts at the time identified as AirPods Pro 2, and the suspension would hit revenue by up to 3.3 billion yuan ($480 million).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837447,France's Macron risks his government to raise retirement age,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron ordered his prime minister to wield a special constitutional power Thursday that skirts parliament to force through a highly unpopular bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 without a vote.His calculated risk set off a clamor among lawmakers, who began singing the national anthem even before Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne arrived in the lower chamber. She spoke forcefully over their shouts, acknowledging that Macron's unilateral move will trigger quick motions of no-confidence in his government.The fury of opposition lawmakers echoed the anger of citizens and workers' unions. Thousands gathered at the Place de la Concorde facing the National Assembly, lighting a bonfire. As night fell, police charged the demonstrators in waves to clear the elegant Place. Small groups of those chased away moved through nearby streets in the chic neighborhood setting street fires. At least 120 were detained, police said.Similar scenes repeated themselves in numerous other cities, from Rennes and Nantes in the east to Lyon and the southern port city of Marseille, where shop windows and bank fronts were smashed, according to French media. Radical leftist groups were blamed for at least some of the destruction.The unions that have organized strikes and marches since January, leaving Paris reeking in piles of garbage, announced new rallies and protest marches in the days ahead. “This retirement reform is brutal, unjust, unjustified for the world of workers,” they declared.Macron has made the proposed pension changes the key priority of his second term, arguing that reform is needed to keep the pension system from diving into deficit as France, like many richer nations, faces lower birth rates and longer life expectancy.Macron decided to invoke the special power during a Cabinet meeting at the Elysee presidential palace, just a few minutes before the scheduled vote in France’s lower house of parliament, because he had no guarantee of a majority.“Today, uncertainty looms"" about whether a majority would have voted for the bill, Borne acknowledged, but she said “We cannot gamble on the future of our pensions. That reform is necessary.”Borne prompted boos from the opposition when she said her government is accountable to the parliament. Lawmakers can try to revoke the changes through no-confidence motions, she said.“There will actually be a proper vote and therefore the parliamentary democracy will have the last say,” Borne said.She said in an interview Thursday night on the TV station TF1 that she was not angry when addressing disrespectful lawmakers but “very shocked.”“Certain (opposition lawmakers) want chaos, at the Assembly and in the streets,” she said.Opposition lawmakers demanded the government step down. One Communist lawmaker called the presidential power a political “guillotine.” Others called it a “denial of democracy” that signals Macron’s lack of legitimacy.Marine Le Pen said her far-right National Rally party would file a no-confidence motion, and Communist lawmaker Fabien Roussel said such a motion is “ready” on the left.“The mobilization will continue,” Roussel said. “This reform must be suspended.”The leader of The Republicans, Eric Ciotti, said his party won’t “add chaos to chaos” by supporting a no-confidence motion, but some of his fellow conservatives at odds with the party’s leadership could vote individually.A no-confidence motion, expected early next week, needs approval by more than half the Assembly. If it passes — which would be a first since 1962 — the government would have to resign. Macron could reappoint Borne if he chooses, and a new Cabinet would be named.If no-confidence motions don't succeed, the pension bill would be considered adopted.The Senate adopted the bill earlier Thursday in a 193-114 vote, a tally largely expected since the conservative majority of the upper house favored the changes.Raising the retirement age will make workers put more money into the system, which the government says is on course to run a deficit. Macron has promoted the pension changes as central to his vision for making the French economy more competitive. The reform also would require 43 years of work to earn a full pension.Leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon told the crowd at the Concorde that Macron has gone “over the heads of the will of the people.” Members of Melenchon’s France Unbowed party were foremost among the lawmakers singing the Marseillese in an attempt to thwart the prime minister.Economic challenges have prompted widespread unrest across Western Europe, where many countries, like France, have had low birthrates, leaving fewer young workers to sustain pensions for retirees. Spain’s leftist government joined with labor unions Wednesday to announce a “historic” deal to save its pension system.Spain's Social Security Minister José Luis Escrivá said the French have a very different, unsustainable model and “has not addressed its pension system for decades."" Spain's workers already must stay on the job until at least 65 and won’t be asked to work longer — instead, their new deal increases employer contributions for higher-wage earners.___Associated Press contributors include Jeffrey Schaeffer, Nicolas Garriga, Masha MacPherson and Alex Turnbull in Paris; Barbara Surk in Nice; and Ciaran Giles in Madrid.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837449,Russian dissident ex-mayor handed 14-day sentence,"MOSCOW (AP) — A former mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city was ordered to spend 14 days in custody on Thursday pending his trial on charges that could entail a longer prison term, part of authorities' efforts to muzzle dissent.Yevgeny Roizman, a sharp critic of the Kremlin, is one of the most visible and charismatic opposition figures in Russia. He enjoyed broad popularity while serving as mayor of Yekaterinburg, a city of 1.5 million people in the Ural Mountains.Last year, Roizman, 60, who was mayor from 2013 to 2018, faced accusations of discrediting the Russian military and was barred from attending public events, using the internet, telephone or mail and communicating with anyone other than his lawyers and close family pending his trial.Police arrested Roizman on Thursday on charges of reposting material containing a reference to the organization led by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny that was banned by authorities. Roizman rejected the accusations during a court hearing in Yekaterinburg after his detention and insisted that he wasn't even registered on that social network. His lawyer argued that the repost was done by members of one of his numerous support groups.Despite Roizman's arguments, the court in Yekaterinburg sentenced him to 14 days in jail. The ruling would bar him from running in the elections set for later this year, although Roizman hasn't voiced an intention to join the race.It was unclear whether the authorities would use his conviction to keep him behind bars for breaking the order not to use the internet. It was also unclear what the sentence would mean for his separate trial on charges of discrediting the military that is expected to open later this month.Courts repeatedly fined Roizman last year on charges of discrediting the military, and he could face up to three years in prison for a repeat offense if convicted.Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine last year, Russian lawmakers approved legislation that outlawed the alleged disparagement of the Russian military or the spread of “false information” about the country’s military operation in Ukraine. Courts across the country have increasingly handed out prison terms to critics of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.Roizman was one of the few visible opposition figures in Russia who hadn't yet been been jailed or fled the country under pressure from authorities. A prominent opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, was sentenced to 8½ years in prison on charges of discrediting the military, and another top opposition figure, Vladimir Kara-Murza, has been jailed on the same charges and is now facing trial.Kara-Murza's health has deteriorated significantly behind bars, his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov said. The politician couldn't attend a court hearing on Thursday and it was canceled, Prokhorov said on Facebook. The defense will work on getting the politician to a civilian hospital for examination and treatment and on releasing him from custody pending trial, Prokhorov said.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837450,Baidu unveils ChatGPT-rival Ernie Bot; 650 companies sign up,"HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese search giant Baidu unveiled its artificial intelligence chatbot Ernie Bot, presenting its rival to the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT in a pre-recorded video presentation Thursday that appeared to disappoint investors.Baidu CEO Robin Li said Ernie Bot was still not perfected, but the company went ahead with presenting it due to high demand. Shares plunged 10% after Li showed a prerecorded demonstration of the Ernie bot instead of the real-time live demonstration of its capabilities that many had expected. They closed down 6.4%.During the demonstration, Ernie Bot was asked questions about a Chinese science-fiction novel, “The Three-Body Problem,” and was asked to make an image based on prompts.The Ernie in Ernie Bot stands for “Enhanced Representation of Knowledge Integration.”“Baidu has for over a decade persisted in investing in artificial intelligence … Ernie Bot is the result of many years of hard work,” said Li. He said the first version of Ernie Bot was developed in 2019.Li said 650 companies had signed up to use Ernie Bot, which can be implemented in a variety of applications such as searches, AI cloud, autonomous driving and in smart devices.The Ernie Bot launch comes months after OpenAI’s ChatGPT was first released, demonstrating the AI-chatbot’s ability in answering questions and even writing essays.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837451,Pakistan court rejects ex-PM Khan's plea to suspend warrant,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani court on Thursday rejected a petition from former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s lawyers to suspend a warrant for him to appear in court in a graft case linked to his term in office — a development that increases the likelihood of another police attempt to arrest the ousted premier.Khan has been holed up in his home in the eastern city of Lahore, where clashes erupted earlier this week when police tried to detain him after he failed to show up at an earlier cour hearing in the case.Khan, who was ousted from office last April, is facing charges in several legal cases, including the graft case, and also terrorism, over verbally threatening a female judge last year. He is now due to appear in court in the capital, Islamabad, on Saturday to answer the indictment that he had illegally sold state gifts as prime minister and concealed assets.Judge Zafar Iqbal ruled against suspending the warrant after hearing arguments from Khan’s lawyer Khawaja Haris and the prosecution. The judge explained his decision by saying Khan had forfeited some of his rights with “his defiance of the court process.”Also Thursday, a Lahore High Court extended a pause in the effort to arrest Khan, easing tensions in the city after clashes erupted earlier this week when police tried to detain him. His supporters amassed outside Khan's residence as police fired tear gas and fought back baton-wielding officers for two days.The pause — in effect until Friday morning — was seen as a reprieve for the 70-year-old opposition leader.The courts have also barred Khan and his Pakistan Tehree-e-Insaf opposition party from holding a rally on Sunday ahead of elections for the assembly in Punjab, where Lahore is the provincial capital.Thursday's order sent a wave of relief among Khan's supporters — though security forces deployed around Khan's home were still at the scene.Usman Anwar, the Punjab police chief, said police would “ comply with the court order,"" without elaborating.Khan has claimed his ouster was a conspiracy by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the United States. Both Washington and Sharif's government have denied the allegations.Saad Hassan, a lawyer for Pakistan's election tribunal, said Thursday that Khan has been avoiding court hearings since January.Violence erupted in Lahore on Tuesday when about 1,000 Khan supporters clashed with police when they tried to arrest the former premier at his house in the upscale Zaman Park neighborhood. Khan's supporters hurled petrol bombs, rocks and bricks at police. Officers responded by swinging batons, firing tear gas and using water cannons. They failed to arrest Khan.On Wednesday, Khan said in a video message that he was ready to travel to Islamabad on Saturday to appear in court. He posed for cameras with piles of spent tear gas shells he said had been collected from around his home.“What crime did I commit that my house has been attacked like this,” he tweeted at the time.___Ahmed reported from Islamabad.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837452,"In low-wage Portugal, Europe’s housing crisis bites deep","LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Like a growing number of people in Portugal, Georgina Simoes no longer earns enough money to afford a place to live.The 57-year-old nursing home carer earns less than 800 euros ($845) a month, as do about a fourth of the country's workforce. For the last decade, she got by because she’s been paying just 300 euros a month for her one-bedroom apartment in an undistinguished Lisbon neighborhood.Now, with rents soaring in the capital, her landlord is evicting her. She says she’s not budging because finding another place near work will be too expensive.“You live in this state of anxiety,” she says in her apartment with its partial view of the River Tagus. “Every day you wake up thinking, 'Am I staying here or do I have to leave?”Simoes and many others, increasingly including the middle class, are being priced out of Portugal's property market by rising rents, surging home prices and climbing mortgage rates, fueled by factors including the growing influx of foreign investors and tourists seeking short-term rentals. Deepening fears in recent days about the health of financial institutions, as well as the prospect of continuing high inflation, have added more uncertainty.Portugal’s center-left Socialist government last month unveiled a package of measures to address the problem, and some of them are set to be approved by the Cabinet on Thursday.Between 2020 and 2021, house prices in Portugal shot up by 157%. From 2015 to 2021, rents jumped by 112%, according the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat.But the rising cost of real estate tells only part of the story.Portugal is one of Western Europe’s poorest countries and has long pursued investment on the back of a low-wage economy. Just over half of Portuguese workers earned less than 1,000 euros ($1,054) a month last year, according to Labor Ministry statistics.Across the EU, the recent spike in inflation, especially rising food and energy prices, and the lingering economic and labor consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have aggravated the housing dilemma in the 27-nation bloc.More than 82 million households in the EU have difficulty paying their rent, 17% of people live in overcrowded accommodations and just over 10% spend more than 40% of their income on rent, the the bloc says.Hit hardest by unequal access to decent, affordable housing are young people, families with children, the elderly, those with disabilities and migrants.In Portugal, the problem has been magnified by tourism, whose robust growth before the pandemic has come roaring back, as well as an influx of foreign investors who found relatively low real estate prices in Lisbon and have been driving up prices that force local people out of their neighborhoods.After attracting a record 25 million foreign tourists in 2019, Portugal drew 15.3 million last year — a 158% rise after the previous year of pandemic restrictions. Analysts expect a 33% rise this year.For some people, that long-awaited national success with foreign vacationers is a case of being careful what you wish for.Rosa Santos, a 59-year-old born and raised close to Lisbon’s 14th-century St. George’s Castle overlooking the port city, says most homes in her neighborhood are occupied by short-term vacation rentals, largely for foreign tourists. It's common to see and hear visitors dragging suitcases over the cobblestones.The locals’ rich traditions are gone, and there’s not even a bakery or grocery store there now, Santos says.“It’s not a neighborhood anymore,” she said. “This isn’t a city, it’s an amusement park.”Activists are fighting back against the trend that is robbing the capital of its charm. Santos is part of a growing movement that is calling for a referendum to stop short-term vacation rentals in Lisbon. They gather every weekend in one of the city’s neighborhoods to collect signatures supporting their goal. They need at least 5,000 signatures to start the referendum process at city hall.On a recent rainy day, police helped municipal workers using backhoes demolish several illegal makeshift dwellings on Lisbon's outskirts with no power or running water. The families forced by necessity to live in them pleaded for them to stop.The shacks stood just a few kilometers (miles) from luxury condominiums being built on the Lisbon waterfront, where a four-bedroom apartment sells for 2.4 million euros.Not far away, in the Camarate low-income district close to Lisbon airport, missionary worker Jose Manuel helps needy families, some of whom can’t afford to pay for a room, let alone a house, and are consequently being pushed out of the city.“We are talking already of a room in Camarate for 400 euros, a house for 600 or 700 euros,” he said. “Those who are on a minimum wage cannot afford a house.”Grassroot housing rights groups have sprung up and are helping people struggling to keep a roof over their head. One of them, Habita, is pushing authorities to stop encouraging premium developments that are by, and for, wealthy foreigners.For Habita’s Rita Silva, the government must also introduce tighter rents controls and “stop evictions if there are no suitable housing alternatives.”Prime Minister Antonio Costa says cities that lose their inhabitants forfeit their “authenticity” and become “a Disneyland” for tourists.Among the measures that his government hopes will bring about a market correction:— Forcing the owners of unoccupied properties to rent them out, granting priority to renters under 35, single-parent families or families whose income has dropped by more than 20%.— Capping increases in new rental contracts to 2% above the previous contract.— Ending the government’s “golden visa” program, which grants residence permits to wealthy foreign investors who buy property in Portugal.— Halting new licenses, except in rural areas, for short-term vacation rentals through tourist accommodation platforms.— Switching commercial property to housing use.The proposals have stirred controversy: Some see them as heavy-handed and misguided, others say they lack detail on how they will work. And some are angry.Hugo Ferreira Santos of the Portuguese Association of Real Estate Developers and Investors said foreign investment has ground to a halt as people wait to see how the golden visa changes shape up.“What I have been hearing from international investors is that Portugal is not a credible country,” he said. “It is a country that changes the rules of the game halfway through and a country where foreign investment is not welcome.”Small-time investors in apartments for short-term vacation rentals also are aggrieved.“There are people that left their lives, set up their own businesses, generated jobs, have workers and suddenly one day they are knocked down without any prospect,” said Eduardo Miranda, head of a Portuguese association representing their interests.Some measures will require parliament's approval, and others could be sent to the Constitutional Court for vetting.___This story has been corrected to show that at least 5,000 signatures are needed for a referendum, not 7,500.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837455,"China says US spreading disinformation, suppressing TikTok","BEIJING (AP) — China accused the United States on Thursday of spreading disinformation and suppressing TikTok following reports that the Biden administration was calling for its Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the popular video-sharing app.The U.S. has yet to present evidence that TikTok threatens its national security and was using the excuse of data security to abuse its power to suppress foreign companies, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing.“The U.S. should stop spreading disinformation about data security, stop suppressing the relevant company, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign businesses to invest and operate in the U.S.,” Wang said.TikTok was dismissive Wednesday of a report in The Wall Street Journal that said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., part of the Treasury Department, was threatening a U.S. ban on the app unless its owners, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., divested.“If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn’t solve the problem: A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,” TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said.Shanahan said TikTok was already answering concerns through “transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification.”The Journal report cited anonymous “people familiar with the matter.” The Treasury Department and the White House’s National Security Council declined to comment.In late February, the White House gave all federal agencies 30 days to wipe TikTok off all government devices. Some agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and the State Department already have restrictions in place. The White House already does not allow TikTok on its devices.Congress passed the “No TikTok on Government Devices Act” in December as part of a sweeping government funding package. The legislation does allow for TikTok use in certain cases, including for national security, law enforcement and research purposes.Meanwhile, lawmakers in both the House and Senate have been moving forward with legislation that would give the Biden administration more power to clamp down on TikTok.TikTok remains extremely popular and is used by two-thirds of teens in the U.S. But there is increasing concern that Beijing could obtain control of American user data that the app has obtained and push pro-Beijing narratives and propaganda on the app.China has long been concerned about the influence of overseas social media and communications apps, and bans most of the best-known ones, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube — and TikTok.",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837486,Why is the number of people identifying as 'Taiwanese' declining?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — According a new study, the performance of Taiwan’s ruling political party explains why the number of people identifying as ‘Taiwanese' is declining.Data from National Chengchi University’s (NCCU) Election Study Center shows that in 1992, only about 17% of Taiwan’s people identified as “Taiwanese,"" the majority of people (46%) identified as both “Chinese and Taiwanese,"" and about 25% identified solely as “Chinese.""In 2020, over 64% of people identified solely as “Taiwanese,"" while about 30% identified as Taiwanese and Chinese, and only 3.6% as solely Chinese. This radical shift in Taiwan’s sense of self has typically been attributed to Taiwan’s democratization and growth of national pride, military threats from China solidifying Taiwanese national unity, and generational change, meaning fewer Taiwanese have familial or historical links to China.Despite this turnaround between 2014-2018 and 2020-2022, there was a reduction in the number of people identifying as “Taiwanese” and an increase in those identifying as “Chinese and Taiwanese.” Co-author and Assistant Professor Soochow University’s Department of Political Science Fang-Yu Chen and his co-authors' recent study is focused on finding out why.“Taiwanese identity is always the most salient issue in Taiwan’s party politics,"" according to Chen. Major political parties’ stance on cross-strait issues, such as Taiwan’s relationship with China, is the only area where they can show a meaningful difference in policy.(National Chengchi University Election Center image.)The study describes this as the “single political cleavage” driving voters’ preferences for Taiwan’s two major parties, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT). “Within the DPP there is a spectrum, and on social issues, it is highly overlapping with the KMT,” Chen said.The study proposes that the DPP and KMT’s differing positions on cross-strait issues influence whether Taiwan’s people identify as “Taiwanese” or “Chinese and Taiwanese."" When the DPP performs well, the study links this to an increase in the number of those identifying solely as Taiwanese, because the party’s position on cross-strait relations is de facto independence.Conversely, when the KMT does well, there is an expected increase in those identifying as both Chinese and Taiwanese because the party aligns more closely with the “Republic of China in Taiwan."" The results are reversed when the parties’ performance is reversed.In 2016 the DPP gained control of the legislature and presidency for the first time in Taiwan, an event the study says framed the Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) presidency as the “realization of Taiwanese identity for voters.” It said that when Tsai’s government failed to perform, voters realized identifying as Taiwanese wasn’t lucrative, and became less likely to proclaim that identity.“The DPP did not perform well after fully controlling the government, and since Taiwanese identity is an issue owned by DPP, Taiwanese respondents switched from Taiwan identity to others as a hedging strategy,” the study said.Stamps commemorate Taiwan's first directly elected president, Lee Teng-hui (李登輝), elected in 1998. (CNA Photo)Though Taiwan’s former DPP President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁)'s time in office (2000-2008) was marked by controversy, policy failures, and corruption, those identifying as Taiwanese did not decline during this time. The study pointed to the divided government as one reason which made it more difficult for voters to equate Chen’s performance with national identity.In addition, the percentage of those identifying as “Taiwanese” in the early 2000s was low but still growing across party lines. Post 2016, clear party-political alignments had emerged between those identifying as “Taiwanese,"" and those identifying as “Chinese and Taiwanese,"" with the DPP and the KMT respectively.Associate Teaching Professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia Dr. Sydney Yueh said that it is possible people identify in different ways depending on context. “Identity is usually announced or revealed when there is an external stimulant, such as a survey,” she said.“…NCCU’s election center conducts the survey annually, the answer about one’s identity is a political gesture or announcement,” Yueh said, adding that Chen’s paper is “definitely aligned with this assumption. They want to know people’s political identities, rather than other identities.Yueh gave the example of a DPP supporter with a clear Taiwanese identity and a parallel appreciation for Chinese literature. Chen agreed, saying that Taiwanese people might view identity differently for different purposes, and “some just take Taiwanese identity as an instrumental instead of a fundamental value.”President Tsai Ing-wen casts her ballot in a local election in 2022. (AP photo)According to NCCU’s data, 2020- 2022 shows a decline in the number of Taiwan’s people identifying as “Taiwanese.” Chen said that if the decline is statistically significant, they will replicate the study to see if the theory still applies.“My guess is that it does, as in this period the dissatisfaction on government responses to Covid-19 sharply increases,” Chen said.",2023/03/16,4386,Politics

With the border reopening between Hong Kong and mainland China enacted in early February, coupled with the reduction of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty (AVD) in the 2023/2024 Budget, property buyers have regained confidence in the residential market, with prices rebounding. Residential transactions picked up in Q1 and are expected to record an increase of 49% q-o-q, to approximately 12,500 transactions.   Rosanna Tang, Executive Director, Head of Research, Hong Kong, Cushman & Wakefield, said: ""The border between mainland China and Hong Kong has reopened, prompting improved market sentiment and buyers' confidence. Some buyers moved quickly to seize opportunities in the relatively attractive market before prices fully rebounded. Property inquiries and inspections have also increased from the previous lows of last year. The recent government-announced reduction of AVD for residential properties will benefit first-time home buyers and spur demand for small-to-medium-sized properties below the HK$10 million mark. Property transactions will likely gain pace as some developers are now accelerating their launches of new home sales.""   Edgar Lai, Senior Director, Valuation and Advisory, Hong Kong, Cushman & Wakefield added: ""The latest government data reveals that Hong Kong's overall residential property price level in January 2023 ended a consecutive seven-month decline to rise a modest 0.6% YTD, although this price point is still 15% lower than the peak recorded in 2021. Property prices recovered across market segments, with some housing estates even recording mild V-shaped rebounds. Among them, prices at City One Shatin, representing the mass market bracket, rose by 20% q-o-q. Taikoo Shing, in the middle market, recorded an increase of 11.3% q-o-q. Prices at these popular housing estates had been on a downtrend in H2 2022 and underperformed the overall market, mainly due to the impact of rising interest rates and previous stock market volatility. However, the mainland China-Hong Kong border reopening has given these estates a strong boost, with some owners firming up their asking prices due to the more promising outlook. As for the luxury housing segment, prices edged down only slightly in 2022 on the back of strong holding power from luxury homeowners, and hence the price rebound was generally less noted than in the mass market given the large lump sum commanded by such properties. Prices at Residence Bel-Air, representing the luxury market bracket, rose by 5.3% q-o-q. ""   Commenting on the market outlook,  Edgar Lai shared: ""In terms of primary market supply, we expect developers to focus on launches for mass market and mid-to-low priced properties, in key areas such as Hong Kong Island South, Kai Tak, Northwest New Territories, Sai Sha, and Pak Shek Kok. With the support of the AVD reduction policy, we anticipate that first-time home buyers and upgraders will quicken their pace to enter the market, while mainland buyers will renew their activity to support the recovery in transaction numbers. Considering the low base of transactions last year, it is expected that the annual residential transaction count will rise by 25% to 35% y-o-y, reaching about 58,000 to 60,000 transactions by the end of 2023.""   Rosanna Tang concluded: ""Given that interest rates have yet to peak, and geopolitical and economic uncertainty may still impede a full recovery, the residential market may experience fairly sluggish property price movements in 2H this year. Nevertheless, we are delighted to see the government's active measures to reopen the city, which will help to expedite the return to normalcy in the broader economy and society. Over the long run, we believe that mainland buyers will be integral in supporting a full property market recovery in Hong Kong. The city's overall property price level is expected to rise by 5-10% for the full year in 2023, and this will be mostly reflected in the 1H period.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837529,Credit Suisse thrown $54 billion lifeline in rush to ward off global bank crisis,"March 16 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after a slump in its shares had intensified fears about a global banking crisis.The bank's announcement, which came in the middle of the night in Zurich, prompted a 24% rise in Credit Suisse shares and helped reverse some of the heavy losses on stock markets driven by investor fears over potential bank runs across the world.Credit Suisse is the first major global bank to be thrown an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis and its troubles have raised serious doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain their fight against inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes.Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank.That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed.JP Morgan analysts said that the measures will buy the Swiss lender time to carry out its restructuring.""The combination of measures should be sufficient to stem the negative moves across the capital structure as the market priced in the potential impact of liquidity pressures,"" JP Morgan said in a note on Thursday.While its shares bounced back, the cost of insuring exposure to Credit Suisse debt tumbled. Five-year credit default swaps were down 128 basis points to 1,016 bps from Wednesday's close after hitting record highs that day.The European banking index <.SX7P) was up 2.4% following the dramatic Swiss intervention, with big bank stocks rising and insurance protection on bonds issued by BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and UBS also edging back down.Throughout most of the Asian day, stocks had wallowed in the red as investors rushed to the relative ""safe havens"" of gold, bonds and the dollar. While Credit Suisse's announcement helped trim some losses, trade was volatile and sentiment fragile.The head of Japan's banking lobby said that there were no signs at the moment of the Japanese financial system being affected by a crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse, as Japanese banks are well-capitalised.Credit Suisse's borrowing will be made under the covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility, fully collateralised by high quality assets. It also announced offers for senior debt securities for cash of up to 3 billion francs.Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner told Credit Suisse staff in a memo they should focus on facts as he pledged to rapidly move forward with a plan to streamline operations.Credit Suisse would continue to focus on the transformation from a position of strength, citing an improved liquidity coverage ratio and recent capital raisings, Koerner said.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse bankers in Asia contacted clients to reassure them after the latest inflow of funds.""We've been telling them to read the statements and look at the fact that we are buying 3 billion francs worth of bonds because they are so cheap,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior banker, who declined to be named.EUROPEAN EPICENTREThe 167-year-old bank's problems have shifted the focus for investors and regulators from the United States to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a selloff in bank shares after its largest investor said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) SIVB.O and Signature Bank, two U.S. mid-size firms.Investor focus is also on any action by central banks and other regulators elsewhere to restore confidence.Policymakers in Australia and South Korea sought to reassure markets that banks in their jurisdictions were well-capitalised.SVB's demise last week, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride as investors feared another collapse like Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street giant whose failure sparked the global financial crisis.On Wednesday, Credit Suisse shares led a 7% fall in the European banking index .SX7P.The exit for the doors raised fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their Credit Suisse exposures.The U.S. Treasury also said it was monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and was in touch with global counterparts.NEXT STEPSRapidly rising interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders already worried about a recession.Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which last week was expected to accelerate its interest rate hikes in the face of persistent inflation, may hit pause or reverse course.Bets on a large ECB interest rate hike at Thursday's meeting also evaporated quickly. Money market pricing suggested traders now saw less than a 20% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike.For now, investors are focussed on Credit Suisse.""The next important step needs to come out from their CEO and display their new strategy to the public sooner than later to reassure the markets,"" Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore.",2023/03/16,185,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837530,Disney changes Taiwanese character to Chinese in 'American Born Chinese',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Disney+ has drawn criticism in Taiwan for changing a key character from Taiwanese to Chinese in the TV series ""American Born Chinese,"" prompting the creation of a petition calling for the character's Taiwanese nationality to be restored.In 2006, Gene Luen Yuan released the graphic novel ""American Born Chinese."" It soon garnered a number of awards, including the 2007 Michael L. Printz Award and was a New York Times bestseller.The book centers around a son of immigrants named Jin Wang and his struggles to adjust after moving from San Francisco's Chinatown to a new high school in the suburbs with only one other Asian student.The book is divided into three stories that tie together at the end, with the first story depicting Yang's version of the Monkey King character, Sun Wukong, in the Journey to the West. In the second story, Sun Wukong sends his son to be Jin's companion and learn how to interact with humans.The Monkey King's son takes the form of Wei-Chen Sun, a Taiwanese immigrant who has just arrived in the U.S., and becomes close friends with Jin. In the third story, Jin has transformed into a white boy named Danny and the Monkey King comes to earth and poses as Danny's cousin Chin-Kee, who is a racist stereotype of a Chinese person. Later in the story, the three characters reconcile and embrace their true identities.However, fans of the book recently discovered that the Disney+ TV adaptation of the series changed the origin of Wei-Chen from Taiwanese to Chinese. On Wednesday (March 15), a screenshot of the synopsis for Episode 1 on IMDB was shared on Reddit. The IMDB description states that Jin is ""assigned a new student 'shadow' from China named Wei-Chen Sun.""Synopsis of the series shows Wei-Chen originating from China. (IMDB screenshot)A 31-year-old man named Justin Lai (賴信義) posted a petition on Chang.org with the title: ""Stop Erasing Taiwanese in media - keep Wei-Chen's background in Taiwan."" Lai pointed out that although Taiwanese and Chinese people share some cultural and historical similarities, there are also substantial differences.He explained that ""Taiwan has its own government, military, and legal system, and many Taiwanese people view themselves as a separate and independent nation from China.""Amid China's increasingly aggressive actions against Taiwan, Lai argued that ""it is all the more inappropriate for a story which focuses on one's identity to remove the Taiwanese identity of Wei-Chen for political purposes."" Lai asserted that this not only compromises the story's message, but also denies representation for Taiwanese who ""struggle to see themselves in all forms of media.""He also referenced a memorable section of the book in which the teacher introduced Wei-Chen by saying that he and his family recently moved ""all the way from China!"" To which Wei-Chen said ""Taiwan,"" cueing the teacher to exclaim ""Taiwan!""The petition closes by arguing that it is time to stop deleting depictions of Taiwanese characters from popular media to ""satisfy the cravings of China, which is doing all it can to remove this identity and the livelihood of the people who have this identity.""Lai told Taiwan News that he moved to Taiwan in 2021 because he likes the country and wants to ""have a future here."" He said that although he is not Taiwanese, ""I am heavily into Taiwanese films/shows as well as Chinese mythology.""When he first heard about the show, he was initially very excited given the talent involved. However, he said that discovering the change in Wei-Chen's background was ""disappointing to say the least.""Based on the IMDB page for the show, the actor who plays Wei-Chen, Jim Liu (劉敬), is actually from Taiwan. He is a former Taekwondo champion from Taipei who turned to acting at age 17, before making his debut in 2020 as the lead actor in Limi Band’s music video “One of Two” (二分之一).Disney+ has yet to respond to a request for comment from Taiwan News.",2023/03/16,3727,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837531,"Euro, Swiss franc recover a touch as market mood improves, traders await ECB meet","SINGAPORE/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The euro and Swiss franc regained some lost ground on Thursday, as markets reacted positively to the Swiss central bank's support for Credit Suisse, ahead of a difficult meeting for ECB rate setters.
The euro was up 0.4% at $1.06225 having lost 1.4% a day earlier, its biggest percentage fall in six months, as the focus of fears about the banking sector spread across the Atlantic from the collapsed U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank to the much larger Credit Suisse.
Some calm was restored to markets after the Swiss lender (CSGN.S) said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after its shares on Wednesday plunged as much as 30%.
That helped the Swiss franc to strengthen, and the dollar dipped 0.92% against the franc , to 0.9248, reversing some of its 2.15% surge on Wednesday - the largest daily gain since 2015.
Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco, said the nature of the banking system, such as its interconnectedness, meant that any troubles in the sector made investors particularly jittery.
“It’s like walking through a forest at night, and if you’re nervous and you hear a sound which could be a squirrel or it could be a bear, you react as if it’s a bear.”
But the news of the Swiss National Bank's support for Credit Suisse did calm the mood somewhat.
""Now, Credit Suisse has the clout of (the) Swiss National Bank covering its back, which is a central bank that doesn't mess around in the time of crisis,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst  at City Index.
""So ultimately, I think this is a good thing for market sentiment.""
ECB IN FOCUS
In what would have been the day's main event before the banking sector ructions, the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to set interest rates later on Thursday, with a decision due at 2.15 p.m. CET (1315 GMT).
The central bank had all but committed to a 50 basis point hike at this meeting at its previous meeting in February, but recent market turmoil has thrown such expectations into question.
""If recent inflation data clearly underpinned the ECB’s pledge to hike rates by 50bp in March, the ongoing turmoil in the financial sector is casting doubts on whether policymakers will raise rates at all,"" said Francesco Pesole FX strategist at ING.
Pricing in derivatives markets currently indicates roughly a 50% chance of a 50-basis-point hike, an increase from earlier in the week.
Pesole said it was also unclear how the euro would react to the ECB's decision.
""If the ECB 50bp hike comes in an environment where markets are scaling back concerns on the banking sector thanks to the support from the SNB, then this may actually be read as a signal of confidence by Frankfurt on the health of the eurozone banking system, and can ultimately lift the euro.""
""Should the ECB force a hike in a still fragile environment for the European banking sector, the impact on EUR/USD may actually be negative, as investors see this as another major risk for the financial stability in the area.""
Elsewhere, the safe-haven Japanese yen remained in favour even as markets calmed a little.
The dollar was last down 0.5% against the yen at 132.77, a 3.7% slide since the U.S. currency near three-month high hit on March 8 before markets entered their tailspin.
Sterling was up 0.3% at $1.20890, and the dollar index, which tracks the unit against six main peers, was down 0.34% at 104.29.SINGAPORE/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The euro and Swiss franc regained some lost ground on Thursday, as markets reacted positively to the Swiss central bank's support for Credit Suisse, ahead of a difficult meeting for ECB rate setters.The euro was up 0.4% at $1.06225 having lost 1.4% a day earlier, its biggest percentage fall in six months, as the focus of fears about the banking sector spread across the Atlantic from the collapsed U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank to the much larger Credit Suisse.Some calm was restored to markets after the Swiss lender (CSGN.S) said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after its shares on Wednesday plunged as much as 30%.That helped the Swiss franc to strengthen, and the dollar dipped 0.92% against the franc , to 0.9248, reversing some of its 2.15% surge on Wednesday - the largest daily gain since 2015.Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco, said the nature of the banking system, such as its interconnectedness, meant that any troubles in the sector made investors particularly jittery.“It’s like walking through a forest at night, and if you’re nervous and you hear a sound which could be a squirrel or it could be a bear, you react as if it’s a bear.”But the news of the Swiss National Bank's support for Credit Suisse did calm the mood somewhat.""Now, Credit Suisse has the clout of (the) Swiss National Bank covering its back, which is a central bank that doesn't mess around in the time of crisis,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst  at City Index.""So ultimately, I think this is a good thing for market sentiment.""In what would have been the day's main event before the banking sector ructions, the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to set interest rates later on Thursday, with a decision due at 2.15 p.m. CET (1315 GMT).The central bank had all but committed to a 50 basis point hike at this meeting at its previous meeting in February, but recent market turmoil has thrown such expectations into question.""If recent inflation data clearly underpinned the ECB’s pledge to hike rates by 50bp in March, the ongoing turmoil in the financial sector is casting doubts on whether policymakers will raise rates at all,"" said Francesco Pesole FX strategist at ING.Pricing in derivatives markets currently indicates roughly a 50% chance of a 50-basis-point hike, an increase from earlier in the week.Pesole said it was also unclear how the euro would react to the ECB's decision.""If the ECB 50bp hike comes in an environment where markets are scaling back concerns on the banking sector thanks to the support from the SNB, then this may actually be read as a signal of confidence by Frankfurt on the health of the eurozone banking system, and can ultimately lift the euro.""""Should the ECB force a hike in a still fragile environment for the European banking sector, the impact on EUR/USD may actually be negative, as investors see this as another major risk for the financial stability in the area.""Elsewhere, the safe-haven Japanese yen remained in favour even as markets calmed a little.The dollar was last down 0.5% against the yen at 132.77, a 3.7% slide since the U.S. currency near three-month high hit on March 8 before markets entered their tailspin.Sterling was up 0.3% at $1.20890, and the dollar index, which tracks the unit against six main peers, was down 0.34% at 104.29.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837532,China disputes Japan's territorial claims over disputed waters in East China Sea,"BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry on Thursday countered Japan's territorial claims over disputed waters in the East China Sea, calling the move a ""grave violation"" of Chinese sovereignty.""Chinese coast guard vessels carried out law enforcement on the scene in accordance with the law, it is a legitimate measure to safeguard Chinese sovereignty,"" spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular press briefing.Wang made the remarks in response to a question on Japan's coast guard saying Chinese coast guard vessels violated Japanese territorial waters around the disputed East China Sea islets.The area is claimed by both China and Japan and has long been a sticking point in bilateral ties. China calls the islands Diaoyu while Japan calls them Senkaku.China's coast guard said on Wednesday it entered the waters around disputed East China Sea islets to counter what it called the incursion of Japanese vessels into Chinese territorial waters.China Marine Police spokesperson Gan Yu said in a statement that coast guard vessels entered the waters of the Diaoyu for a ""normal rights protection patrol"" calling it a ""routine move"".""(This also）is a strong countermeasure to the Japanese side's intrusion of one yacht and several patrol vessels into our territorial waters,"" Gan said, though he did not specify any incident.China's coast guard said in late January that the Shinsei Maru and four other Japanese ships illegally entered the territorial waters of the Diaoyu islands before being driven away by Chinese coast guard vessels.On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will hold a summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Tokyo, the first such meeting in Japan in more than a decade, at a time when the United States hopes the two neighbours can form a more united front against Beijing.",2023/03/16,228,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837533,Lebanon Central Bank chief questioned by European lawyers,"BEIRUT (AP) — Under heavy security, Lebanon's embattled Central Bank chief was questioned for the first time on Thursday before a visiting European legal team in a money-laundering probe linked to the governor.Several European countries are investigating Gov. Riad Salameh, who in recent years has been charged with a handful of corruption-related crimes. Salameh has been the head of Lebanon's Central Bank since 1993.The questioning was originally scheduled for Wednesday, when Salameh failed to show up. According to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency, his legal team filed a complaint saying the presence of foreign judges violates the country's sovereignty. The judiciary dismissed the complaint, saying their presence was in line with Lebanon's international obligations.Lebanese soldiers and police stood guard around the Justice Palace in Beirut after Salameh arrived there earlier in the day. About a dozen protesters gathered and chanted slogans against the 72 year-old central bank chief and the cash-strapped country's political leaders.The European delegation — with representatives from France, Germany, and Luxembourg — questioned Salameh through another Lebanese judge, acting as a go-between. Under Lebanese laws, they cannot directly question Salameh.The session lasted around six hours and another session was scheduled for Friday, judicial officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.Salameh gave no statements to the media after Thursday's questioning.Judge Helena Iskandar, representing the Lebanese state in the questioning and the European probe, has charged Salameh, his brother Raja and associate Marianne Hoayek with corruption, judicial officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday.She urged the Lebanese judge questioning Salameh on behalf of the European delegation to order Salameh's arrest and that of the other two suspects, the officials said. However, no warrant was issued. Also, officials said Thursday that earlier statements about an arrest warrant issued for Salameh had been incorrect.In addition to the European probe, there are other legal proceedings against Salameh underway in Lebanon. In late February, Beirut’s public prosecutor, Raja Hamoush, charged the same three suspects — the governor, his brother and the aide — with corruption, including embezzling public funds, forgery, illicit enrichment, money-laundering and violation of tax laws.The European delegation is investigating the laundering of some $330 million.Lebanon is grappling with the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, an economic meltdown that began in late 2019, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class. More than 75% of the tiny nation’s population of 6 million has been plunged into poverty.Salameh was once hailed as the guardian of Lebanon’s financial stability, but many in the country now hold him responsible for the crisis, citing policies that drove up national debt. He still enjoys backing from the country's top politicians, however. His term ends in July and he has told local media that he would like to step down from his post instead of pursuing another term.Salameh's questioning by the European team is a major breakthrough and a development free from meddling by political players, according to Nizar Saghieh, a rights lawyer and co-founder of Lebanese watchdog group Legal Agenda.“Such autonomy in defending the state's interests might open lots of doors and limit the political hegemony,” Saghieh added.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837535,Analysis: Chalk rules in women's March Madness bracket picks,"The women’s NCAA Tournament field is set and now the fun begins with 68 teams vying for the national championship and cutting down the nets in Dallas.There's a new format to March Madness, with two regionals in Seattle and Greenville, South Carolina, instead of the usual four. Here’s a look at what could happen over the next few weeks. This guidance will be 100% accurate — until the first round tips off on Friday.CHALK RULESA No. 1 seed has won the national championship the past 10 tournaments and 14 of 15. The only time that didn’t happen was in 2011 when coach Gary Blair led Texas A&M to the title as a No. 2 seed. Since 2005, at least two of the No. 1s have made the Final Four every year except for 2016. This year's overwhelming betting favorite is top-ranked and defending national champion South Carolina, the only undefeated team in the tourney.LACK OF MAJOR UPSETSThere is a feeling that parity continues to find its way into women's basketball with 19 losses by top 10 teams in the AP Top 25 poll to unranked schools. Still, it's hard to pick against the top teams in the tournament as no 14 or 15 seed has ever won a game (the women's tournament was the first to see a 16 seed upset a top seed when Harvard beat Stanford 71-67 in 1998). Two came close last season with Jackson State falling late to LSU and UT Arlington hanging tough with Iowa State.BEWARE THE 12No. 12 seeds have had success, just like in the men's bracket the last few seasons, beating some of the 5s. At least one 12 has made it out of the first round in four of the last five tournaments, including two last season.And now the picks:GREENVILLE REGION 1Analysis: South Carolina won't have to leave the state to reach the Final Four if it wins, playing its first two games at home and then traveling 90 minutes to Greenville for the regional. The Gamecocks (32-0) have been tested this season and still found a way to win every game. Dawn Staley's squad is looking to be the 10th team to finish a season unbeaten by winning a national championship. Second-seeded Maryland and No. 4 UCLA both played South Carolina during the season, giving them familiarity if there's a rematch.Players to watch: Aliyah Boston, South Carolina; Cherita Daugherty, Southern Utah; Diamond Miller, Maryland; Charisma Osborne, UCLA.Bracket Buster: Sixth-seed Creighton is the team most likely to spoil brackets. Last season as a 10-seed the team made the regional final before falling to South Carolina. Host Notre Dame is missing star Olivia Miles and the third-seeded Irish could fall to the Bluejays.First-round picks: South Carolina, South Florida, Oklahoma, UCLA, Creighton, Notre Dame, Arizona, Maryland.Second-round picks: South Carolina, UCLA, Creighton, Maryland.Regional semifinal picks: South Carolina, Maryland.Regional champion pick: South Carolina.GREENVILLE REGION 2Analysis: Indiana has been the second-best team most of the season behind South Carolina and earned the first No. 1 seed in school history. Led by Mackenzie Holmes in the middle and a dominant defense, the Hoosiers will be looking to reach their first Final Four. There's a lot of star power in the region including Villanova's Maddy Siegrist, LSU's Angel Reese and Utah's Alissa Pili.Other players to watch: Leigha Brown, Michigan; Kaitlyn Chen, Princeton; Charlisse Leger-Walker, Washington State.Bracket Buster: UNLV is one of three 30-win teams in the country, yet the Lady Rebels haven't faced many teams as good as Michigan this year. Florida Gulf Coast knocked off Virginia Tech as a 12 seed last season and could do it again this time if they beat Washington State.First-round picks: Indiana, Oklahoma State, Florida Gulf Coast, Villanova, Michigan, LSU, Princeton, Utah.Second-round picks: Indiana, Villanova, Michigan, Utah.Regional semifinal picks: Indiana, Utah.Regional champion pick: Indiana.SEATTLE REGION 3Analysis: No one had a worse string of injuries than UConn this season and yet Geno Auriemma has the Huskies playing their best basketball heading into the tournament. They've made every Final Four since 2008 and there's no reason to think that streak can't continue if star guard Azzi Fudd keeps getting healthier. Virginia Tech is the one seed and has had a stellar year behind Elizabeth Kitley.Other players to watch: Ashley Joens, Iowa State; Myah Selland, South Dakota State; Jacy Sheldon, Ohio State.Bracket Buster: No. 9 seed South Dakota State ran through the Summit League and also beat Louisville and Kansas State this season. The Jackrabbits have enough talent to put a scare into the Hokies in the second round. No. 12 seed Toledo beat Michigan earlier this season and has won its last 16 games. Iowa State could be victim No. 17.First-round picks: Virginia Tech, South Dakota State, Iowa State, Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio State, Baylor, UConn.Second-round picks: Virginia Tech, Iowa State, North Carolina, UConn.Regional semifinal picks: Virginia Tech, UConn..Regional champion pick: UConn.SEATTLE REGION 4Analysis: Stanford is in its usual spot as a No. 1 seed but has looked vulnerable this season, struggling on offense at times. The second-seeded Iowa Hawkeyes have had no problem scoring and are one of the hottest teams after winning the Big Ten Tournament behind star Caitlin Clark. No. 4 Texas was picked in the preseason top five before struggling with injuries and fitting transfers in. Vic Schaefer has had a lot of success in March and this could be another one of his great coaching jobs.Other players to watch: Cameron Brink, Stanford; Rori Harmon, Texas; Ta'Niya Latson, Florida State; Hailey Van Lith, Louisville.Bracket Buster: No. 11 seed Middle Tennessee has won 10 straight games and had an early season victory over Louisville so Colorado should beware. Drake has been playing well lately, sweeping its way to a Missouri Valley Conference Tournament title. Louisville has been playing better lately, but needs to be sharp against the 12th-seeded Bulldogs.First-round picks: Stanford, Gonzaga, Louisville, Texas, Middle Tennessee, Duke, Florida State, Iowa.Second-round picks: Stanford, Texas, Duke, Iowa.Regional final picks: Stanford, Iowa.Regional champion pick: Stanford.THE FINAL FOURAnalysis: There should be some familiarity in the Final Four, which will likely see three teams from last season's national semifinals returning. South Carolina will likely face Stanford in a rematch of a November game that the Gamecocks won in overtime while UConn will likely face Indiana.NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPPick: South Carolina and UConn will meet again and the Gamecocks will win back-to-back titles.Analysis: The teams played in February and the Huskies gave the Gamecocks one of their stiffest tests of the season. UConn didn't have Fudd for that game (knee injury).

It's been pretty cool,” Nootbaar said Thursday. “I heard the pepper grinders around the country, their sales have gone up quite a bit this past week.”Nootbaar should ask for a commission, or an endorsement. Behind Shohei Ohtani, he's become Japan's No. 2 attraction.“It's been great,” said the St. Louis Cardinals outfielder, who grew up in California. “The fans have embraced me. The team has embraced me, which has been so great for me to be able to be myself and just go about my day normally with these guys. They've been fantastic. I didn't really expect it to turn out this way.”Nootbaar said he's ready to come back and play again, whenever the next World Baseball Classic is played.“I'm hopeful that some time I can come back and play in front of these fans, hopefully in three years or whatever it is,"" Nootbar said. ""It's been a great experience.”___Follow Japan-based AP sports writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837540,Gianni Infantino re-elected FIFA president by acclaim,"KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Gianni Infantino was re-elected FIFA president by acclaim on Thursday through 2027, after suggesting the financial results under his leadership would keep an industry CEO in the job for life.Infantino had no election opponent and won by acclaim instead of a formal vote by the congress of 211 member federations whose basic annual funding from FIFA has risen from $250,000 to $2 million since his first win in 2016.FIFA had $4 billion reserves after the World Cup in Qatar finished in December. It has conservatively forecast record revenue of at least $11 billion through the men’s 2026 World Cup being hosted in North America.“If a CEO tells the stakeholders that the products were multiplied by seven I believe that they would keep that CEO forever,” Infantino told FIFA members. “They would love for this story to keep on going.“But I am here for a four-year cycle only,” said Infantino, whose presidency can eventually run for 15 years through 2031.The Swiss lawyer was first elected in 2016 with FIFA in crisis after a sweeping United States federal investigation of corruption removed a swath of soccer officials in the Americas. The fallout also removed veteran FIFA president Sepp Blatter from office within months of being re-elected.Under Infantino, FIFA has created new and bigger competitions – raising its income and giving national teams more chances to qualify for the men’s and women’s World Cups, while facing down resistance from European soccer officials.FIFA’s support for 2022 World Cup host Qatar, where Infantino moved to live in 2021, and his close ties to Saudi Arabian soccer have also caused unease among rights activists and some European member federations. That spilled over at the World Cup in a dispute over FIFA and Qatari organizers blocking some team captains wearing an anti-discrimination armband.“To all those that love me, and I know there are so many, and those that hate me, and I know there are a few, I love you all of course, today especially,” Infantino said after being elected.In an earlier congress-opening address, Infantino said he took inspiration from Rwanda’s recovery from its genocidal civil war of the 1990s when his own campaign to become FIFA president in 2016 was struggling.Infantino said he was told on a campaign visit to Rwanda he would not be supported. “Of course, I was pretty depressed, about to give up,” he said, recalling a visit he made to the Kigali Genocide Memorial.“What this country has suffered and how this country came back up is inspiring for the entire world. So I certainly couldn’t give up because somebody is telling me something,” he told member federations.The president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, then made the speech traditionally offered to the congress host nation’s head of state.Kagame defended Qatar, calling its critics “hypocritical” and urging for “bad politics” to be kept out of sport.Norwegian soccer federation president Lise Klaveness was due to address the congress later to push FIFA to compensate migrant workers who helped build Qatar's World Cup projects.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837541,Scholz says Germany wants to curb 'irregular migration',"BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Thursday that Germany will have to do a better job at clamping down on “irregular migration” and deporting those who don't legally reside in the country.Scholz said that Germany, however, would continue to provide protection for Ukrainians fleeing Russia's war.“Our responsibility in the face of this terrible war of aggression naturally also includes providing protection for Ukrainian citizens in the European Union,” Scholz said in a speech to parliament, adding that “all levels of government have been doing a great job for more than a year — especially the cities, counties and municipalities.”More than 1 million Ukrainians have found shelter in Germany since Russia invaded their country more than a year ago. In addition, more than 200,000 people from countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey have applied for asylum in 2022.Local communities have for months said they're struggling to house the many newcomers to Germany and have been calling on the federal government to help them with accommodation, schooling and financial support for all.While Ukrainians have in general been warmly welcomed by Germans, asylum-seekers from the Middle East or Africa have experienced more hostility with the number of attacks on asylum centers rising again over the last year.Scholz stressed that “effective answers to the challenges of flight and migration will only be possible by means of a European framework.”Germany has long been one of the most popular destinations for migrants in Europe, and the government has been lobbying for those who come to be distributed across Europe more fairly — but to little avail.Scholz also stressed that Germany has to speed up the deportation of those who have their asylum applications rejected.“Those who do not have a right of residence in Germany must return to their home country quickly,” he said. “That does not work well enough yet.”By the end of last year, about 240,000 people were going through the asylum procedure and around 168,000 people had been rejected as asylum-seekers and were obliged to leave the country, according to the Mediendienst Integration group, which researches migration in Germany. However, only 12,945 people who were required to leave Germany were eventually deported in 2022.In addition to speeding up deportations, Scholz also said that the country would have to improve clamping down on irregular migration, but he didn't go into details on how to do this.“We want to reduce irregular migration,” the chancellor said. ""We want fewer people to put themselves in the hands of smugglers and on life-threatening escape routes.”___Follow AP’s coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837542,FDU joins UMBC in the ultimate March Madness: Ousting No. 1,"They are the five letters no No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament ever wants to see: upset.Five years and one day after UMBC pulled off the biggest upset in college basketball history by beating the tournament's top overall seed, Virginia, it happened again.Fairleigh Dickinson, like Maryland-Baltimore County a little-known No. 16 seed, knocked off No. 1 seed Purdue 63-58 on Friday night.UMBC's legacy five years after beating the Cavaliers became this: If you don't watch out, No. 1 can mean one-and-done. Add Purdue and All-America center Zach Edey to that very short list.While there were some close calls before 2018, No. 1 seeds had gone 135-0 before UMBC routed Virginia 75-54 at Charlotte's Spectrum Center. Now they are 2-151. The women's side of March Madness has seen only one 16 knock off a 1: Harvard over Stanford in 1998.This year's tournament had been expected to be wide open, with no juggernaut teams and top seeds vulnerable to schools eager to capture that “One Shining Moment” and place their name alongside UMBC.Ryan Odom, the Retrievers' coach that season, said after the 2018 game “these are the moments that you dream of"" while his players celebrated in a cramped locker room. Diminutive 5-foot-8, 140-pound guard KJ, Maura and his teammates joked about there being “no more perfect brackets” and possibly becoming the focal point of a future ESPN “30 for 30” episode.Some players struggled to process the enormity of the moment, hugging each other long and hard.“It felt like my soul left my body, man,” UMBC guard Jourdan Grant said that day.Odom, now the coach at Utah State, a No. 10 seed that lost in the opening round of this year's tourney, said Wednesday the win over Virginia was “a memory that will last a lifetime.”“It takes a special group. It takes a lot of luck in order to have a chance to win any game in the NCAA Tournament,"" he said.Former UMBC guard Joe Sherburne said it remains the single greatest day of his life.“You can measure my life by this: before that day, and after that day,” Sherburne said Wednesday. When friends introduce him to people, the first thing they say is “Joe played for UMBC.”Sherburne, who works as a financial adviser, remembers the day well.As UMBC's lead over Virginia grew to double digits in the second half, he sensed something special, something miraculous was happening. He struggled to concentrate on the next play call while sitting on the bench during TV timeouts: “I felt like I was in shock.”Could this really be happening? Could a 20 1/2-point underdog really beat the No. 1 team in the nation in the NCAA Tournament?But it happened — and everyone suddenly wanted to know their story.Sherburne stayed at the arena until 1 a.m. doing interviews before returning to the team hotel where he was greeted by overwhelmed fans, friends and family members. He and his teammates watched “SportsCenter” on repeat and ate pizza, basking in the moment.“We were all still running on adrenaline,"" Sherburne said. “I couldn't eat or drink. I can usually eat a whole Domino's pizza by myself, but I couldn't that night. I might have had two or three slices.""Sherburne still wishes the celebration had gone on for days longer, but UMBC had a close second-round loss to Kansas State two days later.Still, there will always be the satisfaction of accomplishing something that had never been done before. After the final 16 seed lost in last year's NCAA Tournament, he toasted UMBC's legacy with a shot of whiskey. That legacy is now shared with Fairleigh Dickinson, which was a 22.5-point underdog, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.Two years ago, he attended Game 6 the 2021 NBA Finals, where he watched former Virginia big man Mamadi Diakite win a championship ring. Diakite — who also won a national title with Virginia a year after the big upset — was one of six Virginia players from that team to play in the NBA; UMBC had none.“I'm sitting in the arena that night, in the second row from the top, thinking to myself, ‘You know, just a couple of years ago I was making this guy and his teammates cry,’"" Sherburne said.UMBC players haven't had an in-person reunion, but Sherburne said players remain in touch on group texts.Last week, Odom opened one of those texts to find players and assistant coaches reminiscing about star guard Jairus Lyles' buzzer-beater to beat Vermont in the 2018 America East Conference Tournament championship game — a dramatic win that earned the Retrievers an automatic bid to the Big Dance.Odom's eyes swelled up with tears as he scrolled through the comments and pictures.“Each team that we’re fortunate enough to coach has one life to live,” Odom said. “That particular team lived a great life. The joy that that team experienced was unlike any other. Certainly the memories that we’ll all take from that particular season will last a lifetime. This is what all coaches and players want: They want to be a part of March Madness and the upset.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837543,"Miami brings balance, unselfishness into NCAA Tournament","CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — The voters deciding the Atlantic Coast Conference’s player of the year say Isaiah Wong is Miami’s best player.He might be. Then again, so might Jordan Miller. Or Norchad Omier. Or Nijel Pack. It almost varies by game.Such is the strength of Miami heading into the NCAA Tournament.The ACC's regular-season co-champions are one of only two teams that made the field of 68 to have four players averaging at least 13 points per game (Xavier is the other). It's the sort of production keeps defenses guessing and a good argument for suggesting the Hurricanes have a shot at making another deep tournament run.“One of the best teams in the country,” Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes said. “They’re elite on offense. I don’t think they get enough credit by the way they defend. Their guards are really fast. They can really move their feet. They’re physical. They’re handsy. ... They have an outstanding team.”Not only are they deep and balanced — Wong, Miller, Omier and Pack all average between 13 and 16 points per game — now, evidently, they’re annoyed.Based on preseason prognostications, not much was expected from Miami this season even after coming off a run to the Elite Eight a year ago.On Wednesday, the team, in conjunction with The Players’ Tribune, released a video that playfully recommends those filling out their brackets not pick Miami.“You didn’t pick us before, so why start now?” Miller asks in the video.Fair question, though it’s also fair to think that Miami earned plenty of respect between the preseason and the postseason.The Hurricanes, seeded fifth in the Midwest Region, open Friday against 12th-seeded Drake in Albany, New York.“We know we have a big challenge in front of us,” Drake coach Darian DeVries said.The Hurricanes were in the last 14 editions of the AP Top 25 this season, something only 12 other schools can say. They were the No. 1 seed in the ACC Tournament and lost to eventual champion Duke, falling in a semifinal game where Omier — the team’s best inside player — badly rolled an ankle 66 seconds after tip-off.Wong and Miller started last season when Miami won 26 games and wound up losing to eventual national champion Kansas in a regional final. Pack and Omier transferred in and Wooga Poplar was promoted to the starting lineup.They didn’t miss a beat.“Somebody asked me, ‘When did I think we could be really good?’” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “I said, it amazed me, the chemistry and the bond these guys had from Day 1 during the summer when our four freshmen came in, when our two transfers were in and our returning players were there. Watching them in workouts, they got along so well with each other and played really good basketball.”Miami thinks its unselfishness sets it apart.Case in point: During the regular-season finale against Pitt where Miami won to claim the No. 1 seed in the ACC Tournament and secured a share of the conference title, Omier had a relatively easy layup opportunity inside. He missed, got his own rebound, scored and got fouled.Miller stood near the 3-point line watching the play. He doubled over at the waist, clapping his hands so hard in celebration that the smack could be heard from the stands inside a sold-out, raucous arena.The Hurricanes were like that all season. As long as Miami scores, nobody cares who gets the actual bucket.“It’s a good feeling just knowing that everybody can go for 20 (minutes), go for 30 if they want to,” Wong said. “We just play as a team and I feel like we show that on the court. We just play and play freely. We play together. We all like each other, we have chemistry and it’s showing.”___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/16,,World

Curtoni finished 1.23 seconds behind in 10th, a day after she crashed in the downhill on the same hill.“It’s been a rollercoaster this season and I’m happy today,” Gut-Behrami said. “I just wanted to ski to don’t have regrets. Sometimes that’s the best way, just stop thinking. I didn’t focus on the lines and just tried to be fast.”Curtoni said her crash in the downhill didn’t affect her performance on Thursday.“I’m a little bit sore but that’s not an excuse, for sure,” said the Italian, who was the super-G junior world champion in 2011. “I know I can do good, I was showing it the whole season. I will keep on working.”Federica Brignone finished 0.22 seconds behind in second place and Ragnhild Mowinckel was 0.47 back in third. Both needed to finish ahead of Gut-Behrami to maintain their chance of winning the super-G title.Shiffrin has locked up the overall, giant slalom and slalom titles before the last races in her strongest events. The final slalom is on Saturday and the giant slalom is Sunday.The American surpassed Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark on the all-time winners list with het 87th career victory last Saturday.“This last week it’s just been a lot of media, and a lot of talking about what I have achieved, like kind of past tense,” Shiffrin said. “In my own mind, I think about basically where I am now, how I want to ski, and the possibility for motivation in the future.”Gut-Behrami won the season-long super-G title for the fourth time. She also won Olympic gold in the event in 2022 and the world title in 2021, and was the overall World Cup champion in 2016.After her triumph in St. Anton two months ago, Gut-Behrami became the only skier this season with multiple super-G victories.While all other disciplines titles had been decided before the final week, five racers had a shot at the super-G globe coming into the race after the previous seven races produced seven different winners.Shiffrin won once, in St. Moritz in December, but was out of contention for the discipline title after sitting out three races.On Thursday, the American avoided risks in her run and trailed leader Gut-Behrami by 0.79 seconds at the first split. She slowed before a jump but picked up time again by posting the fastest time in the finishing sector. She ended up 1.46 seconds behind Gut-Behrami.“It can be a little bit tiring, World Cup Finals, but it’s also such a pleasure to be here racing with no pressure from the globes,” Shiffrin said. “So it’s really just basically my own motivation to see if I can execute good skiing.”Thursday’s race was the last for Nicole Schmidhofer, who wore a traditional Austrian outfit and skied down at a leisurely pace, hugging coaches along the course. The Austrian who was the super-G world champion in 2017 and won four World Cup races, announced her retirement on the eve of the race.Schmidhofer and Gut-Behrami shared a podium at the junior worlds in 2006.“It’s an emotional day, the win, the globe, Nicole quitting,” Gut-Behrami said. “I’m getting older and getting more emotional. It’s crazy. I’m crying all the time, but it’s a nice feeling sometimes.”The race was interrupted after a crash from Kira Weidle, who lost balance when her ski tips crossed after a jump and slid into the safety nets. The German skier appeared to be unhurt.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837622,Taiwan chip pioneer warns US plans will boost costs,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — U.S. government efforts to shift production of processor chips from Asia to the United States will double their cost and slow the spread of their use in phones, cars and other products, the billionaire founder of the global industry’s biggest manufacturer warned Thursday.Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. said he supports U.S. efforts to slow China’s development of chip technology on security grounds. But Chang said he can’t understand why Washington wants to move so much manufacturing from efficient Asian sites to the United States.The Biden administration is promising tens of billions of dollars to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness. TSMC is building an Arizona facility and plans a second for a total investment of $40 billion.TSMC has estimated chip costs in Arizona at 50% above its flagship production line in Taiwan, but the real level looks closer to double, said Chang. The veteran of Texas Instruments Inc. founded the company in 1987 and was its chairman until 2018.“Maybe it’s double the cost,” Chang said. “When the cost goes up, the pervasiveness of chips will either stop or slow down considerably.”TSMC said in 2021 that it planned to invest $100 billion over three years in expanding its manufacturing capacity and supporting research and development. It also is building a $7 billion computer chip plant in southern Japan with Japanese entertainment and electronics giant Sony Corp.Chang, 91, is regarded as the founder of the semiconductor industry that made Taiwan, with 22 million people, a global tech center.Processor chips are a sore point in U.S.-Chinese relations that increasingly are strained by conflicts over security, technology, human rights and territorial disputes.China’s ruling Communist Party is spending billions of dollars to develop its own chip vendors and reduce reliance on imports. Washington has tried to slow that by restricting access to chips, manufacturing equipment and design technology on security grounds.U.S. unease about relying on Asian chip suppliers has increased as the government of Chinese President Xi Jinping stepped up efforts to intimidate Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory.The self-ruled island democracy split with the mainland in 1949 and never has been part of the People’s Republic of China. Beijing says Taiwan is obliged to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Xi’s government has flown fighter planes and fired missiles into the sea near the island.U.S. policy is “to slow down China’s progress in chips,” Chang said. “I really have no quarrel with that. In fact, I might say, I support it.”However, Chang said he didn’t understand why Washington wants to move so much manufacturing from Taiwan to the United States. He said U.S. officials don't see Taiwan as a site for “friend shoring,” or using manufacturing in allied countries to reduce exposure to global supply risks.The United States accounts for about 11% of global chip manufacturing, according to Chang. He said that should be more than enough for military needs.“If it’s just for national security, it doesn’t have to be that high,” Chang said. “National security, defense (need) maybe only a couple of percent of chip manufacturing.”TSMC was the first foundry to produce chips only for customers without designing its own. That allowed smaller designers to compete with industry giants without spending billions of dollars to build a factory.TSMC has grown into the biggest chip producer, supplying Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and other customers. TSMC-produced chips are in millions of smartphones, automobiles and high-end computers.___AP Business Writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed.",2023/03/16,115,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837623,Pentagon video shows Russian jet dumping fuel on US drone,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Biden administration released video Thursday of a Russian fighter jet dumping fuel on a U.S. Air Force surveillance drone as the U.S. sought to hold Russia responsible for the collision that led to the drone's crash into the Black Sea without escalating already fraught tensions with the Kremlin.Poland, meanwhile, said it's giving Ukraine a dozen MiG-29 fighter jets, becoming the first NATO member to fulfill Kyiv's increasingly urgent requests for warplanes.The U.S. military's declassified 42-second color footage shows a Russian Su-27 approaching the back of the MQ-9 Reaper drone and releasing fuel as it passes, the Pentagon said. Dumping the fuel appeared to be aimed at blinding the drone's optical instruments to drive it from the area.On a second approach, either the same jet or another Russian Su-27 that had been shadowing the MQ-9 struck the drone’s propeller, damaging a blade, according to the U.S. military, which said it then ditched the aircraft in the sea.The video excerpt does not show the collision, although it does show the damage to the propeller.Russia said its fighters didn’t strike the drone and claimed the unmanned aerial vehicle went down after making a sharp maneuver.While calling out Russia for “reckless” action, the White House tried to strike a balance to avoid exacerbating tensions. U.S. officials said they have not been able to determine whether the Russian pilot intentionally struck the American drone and stressed that lines of communication with Moscow remain open.“I can’t point to that video and say this is a deliberate attempt to escalate or ... tangibly bring about Putin’s false claim that this is about the West versus Russia.,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “We have made clear on many occasions, we do not seek a conflict with Russia.”Russian President Vladimir Putin argues that by providing weapons to Ukraine and sharing intelligence information with Kyiv, the U.S. and its allies have effectively become engaged in the war, now in its 13th month.Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Wednesday that an attempt would be made to recover the drone debris.U.S. officials have expressed confidence that nothing of military value would remain from the drone even if Russia retrieved the wreckage. They left open the possibility of trying to recover portions of the downed $32 million aircraft, which they said crashed into waters that were 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500 meters) deep, although the U.S. does not have any ships in the area.Russia and NATO member countries routinely intercept each other’s warplanes, but Tuesday's incident marked the first time since the Cold War that a U.S. aircraft went down during such a confrontation, raising concerns it could bring the United States and Russia closer to a direct conflict.Moscow has repeatedly voiced concern about U.S. intelligence flights near the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 and illegally annexed.The top U.S. and Russian defense and military leaders spoke Wednesday about the destruction of the drone, underscoring the event's seriousness.The calls between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, as well as between Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russian General Staff, were the first since October.The Russian Defense Ministry said in its report of the call with Austin that Shoigu accused the U.S. of provoking the incident by ignoring flight restrictions the Kremlin had imposed because of its military operations in Ukraine. The U.S. said the drone was operating in international airspace.The MQ-9, which has a 66-foot (20-meter) wingspan, includes a ground control station and satellite equipment. It is capable of carrying munitions, but Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, would not say whether the ditched drone had been armed.The video's release is the latest example of the Biden administration making public intelligence findings over the course of the war. The administration has said it wants to highlight Russian malicious activity as well as plans for Russian misinformation operations so allies remain clear-eyed about Moscow’s intent.The White House deferred to Austin on the decision to release it, with the Pentagon and President Joe Biden’s national security aides agreeing it was important to let the world see what happened, according to an administration official familiar with the decision-making process. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations, said it took time to go through the declassification process and insisted the administration was not concerned it would further escalate tensions with Russia.Because the video does not show the actual collision, some involved in the decision to release the footage wondered whether the Russians would seize on that as proof there was no contact between the jet and the drone, according to another official familiar with the discussions about making it public. Those concerns were overcome when the Pentagon explained that the video showed the immediate aftermath and damage to the drone’s propeller, which could have come only from a collision, according to the second official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to disclose the details.Separately, Polish President Andrzej Duda said Warsaw would give Ukraine four Soviet-made MiG-29s “within the next few days” and that the rest needed servicing and would be supplied later. The Polish word he used to describe the total number of warplanes can mean between 11 and 19.“They are in the last years of their functioning but they are in good working condition,” Duda added. He did not say whether other countries would follow suit, although Slovakia has said it would send Ukraine its disused MiGs.While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded for fighter jets from the West, some NATO members — including the U.S. — have expressed hesitancy.The White House said Poland gave the U.S. advanced notice of its decision to provide the MiGs.Kirby, the White House spokesman, called Poland’s providing the fighter jets a sovereign decision and cheered the Poles for continuing to “punch above their weight” in assisting Kyiv, but insisted that Duda's decision would have no bearing on the U.S. president's decision, thus far, not to provide American-made F-16s.Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine had several dozen MiG-29s it inherited in the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union, but it’s unclear how many remain in service.Duda said Poland’s air force would replace the planes it gives to Ukraine with South Korean-made FA-50 fighters and American-made F-35s.A crucial ally of Kyiv, Poland hosts thousands of U.S. troops and is taking in more people fleeing the war in the neighboring country than any other nation. It has suffered invasions and occupations by Russia for centuries and still fears Russia despite being a member of NATO.Authorities in Warsaw also said the security services have detained members of a Russian espionage ring, alleging they were preparing acts of sabotage in Poland and had been monitoring railroad routes used to transport weapons into Ukraine.___Hazell and Madhani reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837624,Europe's central bank backs big rate hike despite bank chaos,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank carried through with a large interest rate increase Thursday, brushing aside predictions it might dial back as U.S. bank collapses and troubles at Credit Suisse feed fears about the impact of higher rates on the global banking system.The ECB hiked rates by half a percentage point, underlining its determination to fight high inflation of 8.5%.While some foresaw a smaller increase because of the banking turmoil, President Christine Lagarde repeatedly called the banking sector in the 20 countries using the euro currency “resilient,” with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.And if it became necessary, she said, the ECB is “fully equipped” to provide additional support to the banking system.“We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability,"" Lagarde said.ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said the eurozone's exposure to Credit Suisse, which is outside the European Union's banking supervision structure, was “quite limited” and “not concentrated” in any one place.Their message follows Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S. going under last week after suffering losses on government-backed bonds that fell in value due to rising interest rates. Then, globally connected Swiss bank Credit Suisse saw its shares plunge this week and had to turn to the Swiss central bank for emergency credit.The troubles at Credit Suisse dragged down the shares of stalwart European lenders such as Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Societe General on Wednesday. Bank shares recovered Thursday.Analysts say the share selloff was fed by investor fear that banks took added risks to increase investment returns during years of very low interest rates and some may have failed to safeguard themselves against those holdings turning sour as rates rose.As for more rate hikes in Europe, Lagarde said “inflation is projected to remain too high for too long” and that further increases will be based on what the numbers show. She did not commit either way, unlike her stance before Thursday's meeting when she said a rate increase was “very likely.”“Markets are assuming that this may be the ECB’s last rate hike, but the reality is that developments in the banking sector could shift either way in coming weeks,” said Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management. “If the panic eases, the ECB is likely to resume tightening before long” with more increases.Similar questions are being raised about what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do at its meeting next week.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said only last week that the ultimate level for rates would be “higher than previously anticipated,” leading some analysts to predict the Fed would raise by a half-point after slowing the pace to a quarter-point in February. Since then, expectations shifted back toward a quarter-point.European finance ministers have said their banking system has no direct exposure to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and others in the U.S.Analysts say the European banking system instituted wide-ranging safeguards after the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 and led to 600 billion euros ($637 billion) in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks in 2008-2012.Those sweeping banking reforms enacted by the European Union forced banks to hold thicker financial cushions against losses and put the biggest banks under the watchful eye of the ECB, taking them away from national supervisors who were considered to have turned a blind eye as problems built up at their home banks.European banks also observe international rules that raised the amount of ready cash they had to keep on hand to cover deposits. Smaller U.S. banks were exempt from that rule; Silicon Valley was one of them.All that hasn’t kept the U.S. banking blow-up and turmoil over Credit Suisse from the forefront for the ECB, whose leader said she saw “no tradeoff” between fighting inflation and preserving financial stability.Credit Suisse, the No. 2 Swiss bank, saw its shares plunge as much as 30% on Wednesday after its biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it could not provide more financial support.Credit Suisse, whose troubles predate the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, then turned to the Swiss National Bank for up to $54 billion in credit to stabilize its finances, sending its stock soaring as much as 33% on Thursday.SVB's collapse raised concern that swift rate rises by the Fed and other central banks could lead to further problems in the banking system if banks were holding similar losses on their balance sheets.The ECB has been raising rates at an unprecedented pace to contain inflation fueled by higher energy prices tied to Russia's war in Ukraine. Its benchmarks affect the cost of credit across the economy, making more expensive to buy things or invest in new production. That cools demand for goods and eases upward pressure on prices.The ECB’s rate for lending to banks was raised to 3.5%, and the rate it pays on deposits it takes from banks was lifted to 3%.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837632,Poland detains 9 people suspected of spying for Russia,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish authorities said Thursday that the nation's security services detained members of a Russian espionage ring, alleging they were preparing acts of sabotage in Poland and had been monitoring railroad routes used for the transport of weapons into Ukraine.Interior Minister Mariusz Kamiński said the Internal Security Agency arrested nine people suspected of spying for Russia in the case. Three were detained Wednesday.He said at a news conference in Warsaw that the suspects were preparing “sabotage actions aimed at paralyzing the supply of equipment, weapons and aid to Ukraine.”He said the security agents also seized cameras, electronic equipment and GPS transmitters, which the suspects planned to place on transports carrying aid to Ukraine.Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak suggested that the group had entered from Belarus, a Russian ally that borders NATO member Poland.“The threat was real,” Błaszczak said on state radio.The evening news bulletin of Belarusian state television confirmed that the three detainees are citizens of Belarus.Their relatives denied in interviews that the detainees were involved in a Russian spy ring.A commentary on Belarus state television linked the detentions to the fall elections in Poland, when the ruling conservatives will hope for a third term. It accused Polish authorities of needing “showcase stories” to boost their popularity and distract from economic problems.Polish private radio RMF FM broke the news about the arrests, saying the group had been collecting information in southeastern Poland around the military airport in Jasionka. That is a transit point for weapons and munitions sent to Ukraine by countries supporting Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion that has entered its second year.Kamiński said that the operation against the alleged espionage ring was still underway and that more details would be revealed at a later time.",2023/03/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837633,When does travel brand loyalty make sense?,"Travel brand loyalty is nothing new. Ever since Texas International Airlines and American Airlines created the first frequent-flyer programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s, travelers have been racking up miles, seeking elite status and pouring their airfare dollars into brands that offer the most perks.Yet sticking with a single airline, hotel or rental car program comes with built-in limitations. It means narrowing one’s comparison shopping, for one thing, which can effectively increase prices. A person who’s loyal to, say, Delta Air Lines might pay $100 more for a flight on Delta in order to earn miles and status. Is that trade-off worth it?“It has to be a really good deal for me to fly with another airline,” says Joanne Herd , travel advisor at Girasole Travel, a luxury travel booking service , who has been loyal to American Airlines for years.She recently took a business-class flight with Singapore Airlines because it cost thousands of dollars less than those available on an American Airlines partner.“I almost regretted it because I barely made the status I wanted,” she says.Navigating these trade-offs is particularly fraught for semi-frequent travelers, who may not travel enough to earn high-level elite status perks, but still want to earn and use miles. Collecting a few hundred points from a smattering of loyalty programs might be more trouble than it’s worth, yet sticking with one program can limit travel options.Here’s how to decide whether going monogamous with a travel brand makes sense.BIG PAYOFFS FOR BIG SPENDERSTravel brands like United Airlines and Marriott maintain their loyalty programs for a simple reason: They want to attract big spenders, particularly business travelers. To this end, loyalty programs will lavish benefits on travelers in proportion to how frequently they travel (and how much they spend).This might sound simple, but it affects the value of these programs for ultra-frequent travelers relative to leisure travelers. For example, a traveler with the lowest-level Hilton status will get about $2 back in value for every $100 they spend, according to a NerdWallet analysis, while someone with the highest-level status will get about $49 in value for every $100 they spend.This is an enormous gulf, and highlights how the juice might not be worth the squeeze for low-level status. Katy Nastro, a travel expert at flight deals website Going, emphasized the same goes for airline elite status, which disproportionately rewards high rollers.“It takes a lot of short flights to even reach the lowest rung of the ladder,” Nastro said in an email. “So you may be foregoing cheaper — and quite possibly better flights — for the potential of a reward in the future.”Because the perks are so valuable for very frequent travelers, it almost always makes sense for them to maintain some travel loyalty, even at the cost of convenience.OTHER TRADE-OFFS TO CONSIDERWhile limiting one’s loyalty to a single travel brand can offer benefits for frequent travelers, it also has hidden drawbacks. Claire Sturzaker, who writes about travel on her blog Tales of a Backpacker, began traveling full-time seven years ago. Yet despite her bonafide frequent traveler status, she mostly avoids loyalty programs and the elite status rat race.“I want something different when I travel; that’s why I travel,” she says. “I would rather stay at a small guest house. I know money is going back into the community where I am, rather than a giant global corporation.”Sturzaker acknowledges that chain brand hotels offer reliability and convenience, but says those aren’t usually her top priorities. And she likes to visit off-the-beaten-path destinations, where no single airline alliance flies. Instead, she tries to fly nonstop with budget airlines whenever possible.So, who should bother with travel elite status programs? Those travelers for whom they were designed — frequent business travelers. Semi-frequent travelers who take a few trips per year might see some benefit from loyalty, but these perks are often offset by the increased cost of limiting one’s shopping choices.And sticking with a single brand might make you miss the most magical aspect of travel — the unexpected.“I stayed at a family-run place in a small village in Honduras, run by a husband and wife and three boys,” Sturzaker says. “There was a power outage during my stay, so we all just sat around and chatted. That would never happen at a Hilton.”____________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet. Sam Kemmis is a writer at NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837634,"Yellen declares bank system sound, as new rescues ordered","WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen offered firm, upbeat reassurances to rattled bank depositors and investors Thursday, even as American financial institutions and European agencies ordered fresh rescue efforts following the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history.Questioned closely, sometimes aggressively, Yellen told senators at a Capitol hearing that the U.S. banking system “remains sound” and Americans “can feel confident” about the safety of their deposits.Her remarks, against the backdrop of deepening concerns about the health of the global financial system, were an effort to signal to markets that there would be no broader contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in California and Signature Bank in New York.By the time her testimony was over, another major institution, First Republic Bank, received an emergency infusion of $30 billion in deposits from 11 banks, according to Treasury. And in Europe hours earlier, Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest lender, got a promise from the Swiss central bank of a loan of up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion).Wall Street rallied on the rescue news.Republican senators laid a big part of the blame for the problems on Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.“The reckless tax and spend agenda that was forced through Congress” contributed to record high inflation that the Federal Reserve is having to compensate for through increasing interest rates, said Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. And those surging rates have caused banks — as well as regular citizens — problems.The Republicans also questioned Biden's assurances that taxpayers won't bear the brunt of the commitment to make depositors whole.Yellen resisted that scenario, though she said, “We certainly need to analyze carefully what happened to trigger these bank failures and examine our rules and supervision"" to prevent them from happening again. She defended the government’s argument that taxpayers will not end up paying the cost of protecting uninsured money at Silicon Valley and Signature.The Treasury secretary was the first administration official to face lawmakers over the decision to protect uninsured money at the two failed regional banks, a move some have criticized as a bank “bailout.”“The government took decisive and forceful actions to strengthen public confidence” in the U.S. banking system, Yellen testified. “I can reassure the members of the committee that our banking system remains sound, and that Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when they need them.""The week has been a whirlwind for markets globally on worries about banks that may be bending under the weight of the fastest hikes to interest rates in decades, increasures intended to quell rising inflation on consumer goods.In less than a week, Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, failed after depositors rushed to withdraw money amid anxiety over the bank’s health. Then, regulators convened over the weekend and announced that New York-based Signature Bank also failed. They said that all depositors, including those holding uninsured funds exceeding $250,000, would be protected by federal deposit insurance.The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have since launched investigations into the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and President Joe Biden has called on Congress to strengthen rules on regional banks.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday, ""There are things that we can do in the administration, but in order to really deal with this issue we have to act. Congress needs to act.”Thursday's hearing, originally scheduled to address Biden's budget proposa for the fiscal year beginning next October, came after the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley, the nation’s 16th-biggest bank and a go-to financial institution for tech entrepreneurs. While lawmakers questioned Yellen on the federal deficit and upcoming debt ceiling negotiations, many focused instead on the bank failures and who was to blame.The Biden administration's ""handling of the economy contributed to this,” insisted Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. “I plan to hold the regulators accountable.”Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., asked, “Where were the regulators in all of this?”“Nerves are certainly frayed at this moment,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chairs the committee. “One of the most important steps the Congress can take now is make sure there are no questions about the full faith and credit of the United States,” he said, referring to raising the federal debt ceiling.Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the committee's top Republican, said, “I’m concerned about the precedent of guaranteeing all deposits,” calling the federal rescue action a “moral hazard.""Yellen said on CBS' “Face the Nation” last Sunday that a banks bailout was not on the table.""We’re not going to do that again,"" she said, referring to the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, which led to massive government rescues for large U.S. banks.Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair and past president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve during the 2008 financial crisis, was a leading figure in the resolution this past weekend, which was engineered to prevent a wider systemic banking problem.""This week’s actions demonstrate our resolute commitment to ensure that depositors’ savings remain safe,” she said.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, compared the banks' collapse to rail industry deregulation lobbying that Democrats say contributed to the East Palestine train derailment that rocked an Ohio community. ""We see aggressive lobbying like this from banks as well,"" he said.In Europe, troubles at Credit Suisse deepened concerns about the global financial system.The Swiss giant was having issues long before the U.S. banks collapsed, but the news Wednesday that the bank’s biggest shareholder would not inject more money led shares of European banks to plunge. On Thursday, they rose after the Swiss Central Bank's action.Regulators in the U.S. and abroad are trying to reassure depositors that their money is safe. They “don’t want anybody to be the person who sits in a darkened room or darkened cinema and shouts fire, because that’s what prompts a rush for the exits,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the online investment platform AJ Bell.Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank hiked interest rates by a half percentage point in its latest effort to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances and plenty of available cash.ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank would provide additional support to the banking system if necessary. She said banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” because of safeguards added after the financial crisis.ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos also said Europe’s exposure to Credit Suisse, which is outside the European Union’s banking supervision structure, was “quite limited.""The Swiss bank, which has seen its stock decline for years, has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving Zurich rival UBS.___Associated Press writers Dave McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.___Follow the AP's coverage of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at https://apnews.com/hub/janet-yellen.",2023/03/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837677,ECB to set interest rate amid global financial uncertainty,"Policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) were set to meet on Thursday to set interest rates as the institution juggles both inflation and financial uncertainty.The meeting comes a week after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and amid difficulties faced by Credit Suisse in Europe.This has sparked fear of global financial turmoil and prompted the ECB to abandon its initial plan to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points in order to tackle the rising cost of living.An announcement is expected at about 2:25 p.m. CET (1325 UTC/GMT).The euro and the Swiss franc regained some lost ground on Thursday off the back of news that Credit Suisse would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (€50.7 billion, $54 billion) from the country's central bank.The euro was up 0.4%, after losing 1.4% a day earlier — the biggest change in six months.Some analysts saw it as a sign that the market's mood was improving somewhat, hours before the ECB interest rate announcement.""Now, Credit Suisse has the clout of (the) Swiss National Bank covering its back, which is a central bank that doesn't mess around in the time of crisis,"" Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at forex trading platform City Index, told the Reuters news agency.""So ultimately, I think this is a good thing for market sentiment.""zc/rc (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837678,Australia and Mary Fowler quietly confident ahead of home World Cup,"There was an air of redemption around the Matildas as they left the field 3-2 victors against Spain in February.Just months out from a home World Cup, the team showed it can not only match one of the best possession-based sides in the world, but also trump them.After a rocky few years under coach Tony Gustavsson, in a tenure punctured with poor results and unconvincing tactical displays, the Matildas have distinguished any criticism from local media and fanbases.For Mary Fowler, one of Australia's rising stars, it's all been part of a process that's finally coming good. ""It's actually happened in a really good way. Being back in that time, during a rocky period, you maybe wouldn't have foreseen it to be how it is now. But the timing has been perfect,"" she tells DW.Three victories and 10 goals against Spain, Jamaica and Czech Republic saw Australia lift the Cup of Nations, an ideal warm-up competition before the real thing kicks off in June.""It's really good momentum going into the World Cup. We've been having a lot of good results lately, but to be able to do it in a mini-tournament, it just amplifies that feeling even more.""It hasn't exactly been a smooth ride for Australia. Mystery still clouds the sacking of Alen Stajcic months out from the 2019 World Cup, where the Matildas were knocked out in the Round of 16 after strong ambitions to reach the final.And 18 months into Gustavsson's reign, they held a concerning record of 11 losses, 5 draws and just 8 wins in 24 matches, which included a shocking early exit from the 2022 Asian Cup.There had already been calls for his sacking, including from ex-Socceroo Mark Schwarzer, even before Spain dealt the Matildas that 7-0 thumping in June last year.But fast-forward nine months and it appears everything is finally starting to click.""As a team we've gelled a lot and we're very confident in our ability as a team,"" Fowler says.""And having those good results, it builds trust. Trust in yourself, in your teammates, in the coach, and the whole process in where we're taking the team.""Fowler is keen to stress the team-first slogan, which is echoed throughout the Matildas camp and a culmination of a wider long-term plan under Gustavsson.""What I'm most proud of is the team effort, it was a team out there tonight,"" Gustavsson told media after that recent win over Spain. ""They worked with each other, they played together. That's what I'm most proud of.""The Matildas side that lost 7-0 to Spain may have been second-string, and the recent Spain side that lost 3-2 may have been missing star players due to a heated dispute with their federation, but the victory continues the steady progression made under Gustavsson.""Right now, it's just a really good feeling. We have a lot of momentum and after winning the tournament in Australia, everything is positive and it seems to be a great match,"" Fowler says.Alongside building a collective unit, Gustavsson has promoted tactical flexibility, intensity and aggression as he's developed an attack-minded team that plays high-octane football.That Fowler, one of the brightest talents in world football, still comes off the bench just highlights the growing depth in the Matildas camp.The squad has a healthy blend of stars hitting their prime, seasoned veterans and hungry youngsters as they hurtle towards the World Cup full of confidence.""For everyone, it's winning that's on our mind,"" Fowler admits. ""But in camp we are really just trying to stay focused, because you can't think about the final if you haven't got out of the group yet.""For someone who only just turned 20, Fowler's grounded mindset stands out just as much as her undoubted ability on the field.After making her international debut at 15, going to the 2019 World Cup aged 16, and moving to Montpellier at 17, Australia's future hopes have been pinned to her for some time.She's developed a reputation as a creative forward, comfortable taking on defenders with the ability to unleash bullets, while her vision and ability to pick out teammates with both feet has also earmarked her as a future playmaker.""I enjoy playing the 9 and I enjoy playing the 10 as well,"" she says about her favoured position. ""I think being a player where you can play multiple positions isn't a bad thing and it gives me a lot more awareness of the game as a whole.""A move to Manchester City in the summer has seen Fowler's playing time decrease, but the exposure to high-quality training with some of the best players in the world has also helped lift her game.""It pushes you a lot to want to be better and just to see exactly where the top is,"" Fowler says.""The standard in this team is very high, so there's something to learn from everyone. And I feel as a player it's pushed me a lot training every day with these girls.""Fowler exudes calm when talking about the prospect of playing at a home World Cup. It's a historical moment for football in a country where the sport battles for media attention.""It's really exciting and it will be an honour if I get the chance to play. We just really want to build on our recent results, stay together as a team and move forward,"" she says.The next step forward is taking on two of the tournament favorites. Gustavsson's desire to prepare the Matildas by playing against the very best will see Australia face European champions England in April, before a final runout against France a week before the team's World Cup opener against Ireland on July 20.If the Matildas are to convince the rest of the world that they're true contenders on their home turf, they'll have to put in strong performances against the two heavyweights.""Being able to have good results against top opponents is key and we've done really well recently,"" Fowler says. Everyone’s feeling very confident and it’s just built up the trust even more in our abilities and what we can do.""For the Matildas, this is a huge opportunity to inspire kids, both girls and boys, around the nation and grow football Down Under. ""It's going to be a great tournament and being able to do it at home with so much support and the fans behind us, it's going to really help us.""Edited by: James Thorogood",2023/03/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837679,Farmed animals suffer amid exploding meat demand,"The global production of animal flesh for human consumption was 45% higher in 2020 than in 2000 as the global taste for meat skyrockets.The carnal boom is being fed through increased farming intensity, with animals such as chicken and pigs kept in smaller, more restrictive spaces such as cages, pens and stalls.Though in the European Union, 94% of citizens are concerned for the welfare of farmed animals — and near 60% are prepared to pay more animal welfare-friendly meat production — the caging of hens, pigs or rabbits remains widespread.Welfare concerns extend to the environment. For one, animal meat production is bad for the climate, producing 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions — roughly equivalent to the entire global transport sector, according to Greenpeace.Nitrogen-rich feed  given to meat-producing animals also produces manure high in toxic ammonia, which in turn produces the potent greenhouse gas, nitrogen oxide. Ammonia impacts animal welfare by damaging the eyes and respiratory systems of battery hens, for example.Animal rights activists arguethat humane livestock farming — including free range egg laying hens — can reduce feed, fuel and water needs, cutting costs and pollution by also recycling nutrients and improving soil.But campaigners ultimately agree that reducing meat consumption and production is the ultimate way to minimize the welfare and environmental impacts of meat.As the opposite happens, how are farmed animals being treated around the world, and how might  their welfare be improved?In 2021, the European Parliament overwhelmingly committed to prohibiting the caging of farmed animals.A subsequent law being drafted by the European Commission will release all hens, mother pigs, calves, rabbits, ducks, geese and other farmed animals from cages across Europe by 2027.The law was inspired by a citizen's initiative in the EU to ""End the Cage Age"" that garnered 1.4 million signatures and aims to end the pain and trauma for over 300 million animals who spent all or part of their lives in cages, pens or stalls.This goal has almost been reached by several EU countries: Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany are between 98% and 87% cage-free.In Spain, by contrast, more than 86 million animals are farmed in cages, with only 13% of livestock unconfined.With most EU countries having a cage-free rate under 40%, including France (34%) and Greece (22%), freeing factory farmed animals across the region in the next few years seems unlikely.Across the bloc, nearly all adult female pigs who experts say are highly intelligent and crave outdoor space, spend around half the year inside ""gestation crates"" in which they can barely move — let alone turn around.According to the US-based animal rights group, The Humane League, these sows are exploited as breeding machines that continually produce piglets in cold, dark, dirty pens where they often succumb to sickness. They ""are among the most abused animals on the planet,"" state the group.In China, the construction of a 26-story pig farm skyscraper rearing 1.2 million animals annually in Hubei province is also raising both ethical concerns and fears that it will become a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases.Meanwhile, draft legislation passed in October in Germany will allow consumers to choose products using more humane production methods. All pork products, for example, will be legally required to have a label that differentiates between five different methods of rearing: barn pen; barn pen and extra space; open-air barn pen; run and open land; and organic.Yet animals raised on organic farms are not immune from suffering. One Germanstudy shows that more than half of dairy cows in organic farms have mastitis, a painful inflammation of the udder, yet are still milked daily. While mastitis is also common in conventional farms, organic production standards prohibit antibiotics and hence limit effective treatment in organic cows.A report by German-based consumer watchdog Foodwatch shows that organically farmed pigs — where animals are given straw and more space, for example — suffer from pneumonia, open wounds and abscesses at almost the same rate as in conventional farms due to failure to monitor livestock health.While the European Union is one region trying to encourage cage-free farming, around 33.1 billion chickens were farmed globally in 2020 — more than five for every human on the planet.This represents a 130% rise in 20 years, illustrating the scale of the quest to feed the growing lust for animal flesh through ethical, low-intensity methods.Back in the US, broiler chickens that are farmed for their meat constitute 95% percent of the animals slaughtered worldwide each year for food, note the California-based Factory Farming Awareness Coalition. The US is the world's number one chicken meat producer.Broiler chickens are typically raised with 20,000 other birds in a 16,000 square foot (1,486 square meters) shed, which equals around three-quarters of a square-foot for each bird.Amid this overcrowding, chickens are grown to full size and slaughtered within six weeks. Poultry in the 1950s reached the same weight in around triple the time, according to Compassion in World Farming.Due to the rapid growth of birds bred for their oversized appetites, their legs cannot support their body weight, forcing them to lie on the floor while suffering pain and lameness. Organs like the heart and lungs are also put under strain, resulting in early death.While cows bred for beef globally are partly raised on pastures, they increasingly spend their final months in confined ""landless"" feedlots where they are typically fattened on a grain diet dominated by high-energy corn — as opposed to grass, their natural diet — before slaughter.Feedlots have an average capacity of around 1,000 cows in the US, while in South Africa the largest lot holds 130,000 cattle, according to experts.Cattle around the world — including calves who can spend their whole life in these lots — typically have little or no cover and endure cold, muddy conditions in the winter, or suffer heat stress during hot and dry summers in lots with no shade.In Australia, one of the world's biggest beef exporters, there are some 500 of these feedlots that housed a record near 1.3 million cattle in 2022. According to the RSPCA animal welfare group in Australia, the lots' abrasive and muddy surfaces cause lameness, pain and lesions in the cattle due to an inflammatory disease affecting the hooves.Nonetheless, the welfare of cattle in Australia confined to feedlots is making some progress, with over 90% of them now accredited under national animal welfare standards including the draining of muddy pens, hospital pens for sick cattle, and giving extra care to pregnant cows and new-born calves.Proponents of the feedlot system argue it's a more sustainable way to produce meat as forests and other ecosystems are not converted to pasture. But experts also show how barley or corn diets in feedlots produce around 40% more emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.Edited by: Tamsin Walker",2023/03/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837680,Ukraine updates: Russian offensive in Vuhledar slows down,"The Russian offensive on the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar may have lost pace, the British Ministry of Defence said in its daily update on Thursday.It was one of a series of failed Russian attacks in the past three months with heavy losses, according to an update.The report said the Russian setbacks were due in part to the successful Ukrainian deployment of a system known as the Remote Anti-Armour Mine System (RAAM). This can reportedly scatter anti-tank mines up to 17 kilometers (about 10.5 miles) from the point of launch.Ukraine dropped them above and behind advancing Russian units in some cases, causing chaos as Moscow's troops withdrew, the British assessment said.The ministry emphasized that Russia's only notable recent tactical success has been in the Bakhmut sector, which is dominated by Wagner Group mercenary forces — currently engaged in a public feud with the Russian Ministry of Defence.The report said there was a real possibility that Russia's own defense ministry has been insistent in its drive for success in Vuhledar, partially because it wants its own success to compete with Wagner's achievements.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Thursday, March 16:A fire tore through offices of the security services in a southern region of Russia bordering Ukraine, the emergency services said, according to Russian news agencies.Images circulating on social media showed a massive blaze tearing through a building in a built-up urban area with a huge plume of black smoke billowing over the fire.""Emergency services were dispatched... details are being clarified,"" the press office of the emergency services in Rostov-on-Don said in comments carried by the state-run TASS news agency.The Interfax news agency reported that a fire killed one person and injured two people.There was no immediate comment from authorities about the fire and emergency services were yet to give any explanation how the blaze could have broken out.The Pentagon has released footage of what it says is a Russian aircraft conducting an unsafe intercept of a US Air Force surveillance drone in international airspace over the Black Sea.The 42-second video shows a Russian Su-27 approaching the back of the MQ-9 drone and beginning to release fuel as it passes, the Pentagon said.The US military said it ditched the MQ-9 Reaper in the sea Tuesday after the Russian fighter jet poured fuel on the unmanned aerial vehicle and then struck its propeller.Poland has broken up an espionage network operating in the country, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said.The spies had hidden cameras on important railway routes, mainly in the southern Podkarpackie region.""I would like to emphasize the great success achieved by the officers of the Internal Security Agency because the whole spy network has been unraveled,"" Blaszczak told state broadcaster Polskie Radio 1.""It was an espionage group, a group of people who were collecting information for those who attacked Ukraine,"" he added.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced more arms deliveries to Ukraine, in lockstep with other European Union states.Together with its European partners, Germany will ensure that Ukraine receives weapons and equipment to hold out and defend itself, Scholz said in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, during a government statement on next week's EU summit.""It is particularly important to quickly provide Ukraine with the necessary ammunition,"" Scholz said. ""At the European Council, we will decide on further measures together with our EU partners to achieve an even better, continuous supply.""In doing so, he said, Germany is prepared to open up its procurement projects to other member states. Germany is already providing substantial arms aid to Ukraine, to help fend off Russia's attack.The 27 EU leaders are due to discuss issues such as competitiveness and energy, as well as the Russian war in Ukraine, in Brussels next week.The grain export deal struck last July between Russia and Ukraine is due to expire on March 18.

He is the first South Korean leader to visit the country in 12 years.Under the deal, Japan will end restrictions on the export of semiconductors to South Korea, and South Korea will drop a complaint it had lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Japan.""Today's meeting with Prime Minister Kishida has a special meaning of letting the people of our two countries know that South Korea-Japan relations, which have gone through difficult times due to various pending issues, are at a new starting point,"" Yoon said in Tokyo on Thursday.""As seen in North Korea's launch of a long-range ballistic missile before my departure to Tokyo this morning, North Korea's ever-growing nuclear and missile threats are a grave threat not only to East Asia but to international peace and stability.""The most recent trade dispute between South Korea and Japan arose after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that two Japanese companies, Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, must pay compensation to victims of forced labor during Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945.Japan argued that the issue of forced labor had already been closed in a 1965 treaty.Recently, Seoul announced a new proposal whereby former forced laborers or their relatives would instead be compensated by a public South Korean fund supported by private donations.South Korean companies that benefited from the 1965 treaty would be targeted under this plan.Thursday's rapprochement between Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is an attempt to build a united front against regional tensions, including increased missile tests by North Korea and China's growing influence.The deal will also strengthen international supply chains after years of upheaval.zc/rc (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837682,Spanish lithium: EU's green-tech homeshoring plans face resistance on the ground,"It's not a warm welcome for the glamorously dressed guests arriving for the Caceres Spanish Cinema Festival. ""No to the mine! Yes to life!"" a few hundred protesters chant, lining either side of the street leading to the Grand Theatre. ""Caceres isn't for sale!"" they shout. ""The shame!""How did a local film festival get mixed up in a mining dispute? It's all to do with an event sponsor, Extremadura New Energies, the company gunning to produce 467,000 tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide over 26 years by mining the earth just a few kilometers away from the theatre. The company hopes such gestures, funded by a foundation, will convince the community of its honourable intentions. Anti-mine activists from the Save Caceres Mountain Platform see it as a cheap ploy.Caceres is a sleepy city of 100,000 inhabitants popular with tourists for its UNESCO-recognized Old Town. It's situated in Spain's poorest region — rural and often overlooked Extremadura on the Portuguese border. Around six years ago, it also joined the growing list of European communities caught up in a geopolitically charged global resource race.Lithium is a metal used in the high-performing batteries, key for carbon emissions-busting technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles, plus smartphones and laptops. Australia, Chile and China are the world's biggest producers with a 90% market share, according to World Economic Forum figures. Its extraction, particularly in South American salt flats, has been associated with environmental degradation, water scarcity and — in Bolivia — heavy political backlash.In recent years, the EU made moves to wean off import dependency for so-called critical materials needed for future-proof technology, partly by stepping up domestic mining of materials like lithium.Montana Chaves, spokesperson for protest organizers — the Save the Caceres Mountain Platform — says the new EU plan ""worries us a lot.""The group has myriad concerns: the strain on local water supply — no river runs through Cáceres — air pollution from increased road traffic, contamination of water and soil through chemicals used in mining and refining, dust, noise, and even the potential it could destabilize the ground Caceres stands on through the use of explosives.For Chaves, the Sierra de la Mosca hill, which stands between the city and the proposed mining site, has a strong personal meaning. Like many women in the area, she is named after it, or rather the patron saint of Caceres, the Virgin of the Mountain.""Since I was a little girl, I have had a strong connection with this land,"" she told DW, which is why she and other locals have spent years fighting the mine.It seems though that not everyone feels the same.""It's fantastic,"" said 76-year-old Jose-Antonio, who declined to give his surname when talking to DW. ""Caceres is a city of retirees and pensioners, nothing else.""He himself is a retired agricultural engineer and believes the city needs jobs. Out strolling with Jose-Antonio on the winding shopping street was Hugo Galeano,  a 23-year-old tourism student. He sees things similarly. ""There's no industry here. Tourism alone isn't enough, the town needs an economic motor,"" he said.In the EU, lithium demand is driven in large part by the automotive industry. The sector accounts for 7% of the bloc's economic output and has big plans to electrify. The EU is planning to phase out the sale of combustion-engine cars by 2035 as part of a wider climate goal to reduce CO2 emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050.Given the political and business impetus for such projects, you might think anti-mine campaigners in Caceres wouldn't stand a chance. But the group already scored a victory in 2017 by mobilizing the city's population against original plans for an open-cast mine. With local government also opposed, Extremadura New Energies had to go back to the drawing board. It came up with a plan for an underground mine with additional plants and facilities nearby.Mayor Luis Salaya of the centre-left Socialist Party opposed the original plan, but is more open to the new proposal, which was officially submitted late last year and is still under review by local authorities.Extremadura New Energies chief executive officer Ramon Jimenez believes the community is now coming round.""When I explained that it is underground, that we're not going to use sulfuric acid or natural gas, that we are going to heat the process using green hydrogen generated with our own solar energy, that we are going to use water from the sewage treatment plant — people see that the impact has been reduced to the minimum possible and see the possible benefits,"" he told DW.The project should create several hundred long-term jobs, as well as lining state coffers with tax payments, said Jimenez, who thinks the project is an example of a good mine with high standards. He argues lithium has to be mined somewhere, so it is better to do it in the EU, where there are stricter environment laws. Moreover, the refined lithium would be sold to car companies in Spain and the EU, rather than getting shipped in from China. ""They're nimbies! Not in my backyard!,"" he said of his opponents.Gavin Mudd, a professor of environmental engineering from RMIT University in Australia, thinks there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of lithium mining. He told DW on the phone that hard-rock mining — the kind proposed in Caceres — is different to the solar evaporation process that creates the vividly colored pools seen on South American salt flats.The things Extremadura New Energies promises are technically possible, but so are many of the downside risks mentioned by activists, theoretically. Ultimately it depends on the design and running of the mine in question, said Mudd.in Spain, the mining industry has a bad reputation with good reason, he noted, pointing to the legacy of pollution from previous mining in the southwest of the country. ""Miners, of course, are not used to being told what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do. They normally get their way,"" Mudd said, adding that communities should be able to say ""no"" to a mine, but in reality, successful resistance is rare.One example is Jadar, a region of Serbia that was set to become home to Europe's biggest lithium mine. But last year, Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto had its license revoked amid public protests. Plans for the Mina do Barroso mine in northern Portugal have also been heavily contested.Whether or not Caceres does ultimately see a mine built, demand for lithium is unlikely to go away any time soon. The EU Commission has estimated that the 27-nation bloc would need up to 18 times more lithium by 2030 and 60 times more by 2050 to meet its climate goals, which rely heavily on e-mobility.CEO Ramon Jimenez, at least, is confident Extremadura New Energies will succeed in Caceres and hopes mining will start as early as 2024. In fact, the company already has its eyes on other potential sites — ones that are ""sustainable and economically viable.""""Some are in Spain, some in Europe, some in Australia,"" he said, without disclosing, of course, where he's expecting to mine more of the ""white gold.""Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/03/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837683,New plane orders take off in India's aviation market,"Having hardly taken a breath after completing mega plane purchases from India, Airbus and Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, are in for another record-setting order from the subcontinent.In February, recently privatized national carrier Air India signed letters of intent with both planemakers for a total of 470 new jets, plus leasing agreements for 25 further aircraft to ease short-term requirements. A total of 495 aircraft in one go has set a new buying record for the industry.Now IndiGo is gearing up to gain the title of world record holder. Recent media reports say IndiGo is planning to place orders in excess of 500 aircraft at once. Contracts for the mammoth deals are expected to be signed at the Paris Air Show in June.Based in Gurgaon, Haryana, low-cost airline IndiGo is the undisputed aviation market leader in India in terms of passengers carried and fleet size, while former state-owned Air India had a market share of just under 10% in 2022.IndiGo was founded in 2006 as a private company by aviation veterans Rahul Bhatia, the founder of air transportation company InterGlobe Enterprises, and Rakesh Gangwal, an Indian-American billionaire and former CEO of US Airways Group.As of November 2022, the airline operates 1,600 daily flights on 75 domestic routes and 26 international. It has its primary hub at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi. Travelers associate it with qualities unusual for Indian airlines — highly efficient, customer-oriented, modern — but most of all for offering value for money, while performing on time and reliably. Little wonder, then, that the airline reached a market share of more than 55 % last year — outflying its closest competitors SpiceJet and Air India by orders of magnitude.Sporting a blue-and-white livery on its planes, IndiGo operates exclusively Airbus jets, with a fleet made up of 268 Airbus airliners and 39 European-built ATR turboprops.The airline's long partnership with Airbus dates back to 2005, when, as a startup, IndiGo commited to buy a hundred A320s. In 2011, it made a follow-up order for 180 planes and then again for 250 in 2015 — at the time the largest individual contract for Airbus.In 2019 another record deal was signed with Airbus, this time for 300 aircraft of the A320neo family, making IndiGo the world's largest operator of the efficient twin-engine jets. Currently it operates 730 planes of the type out of a total of 830 aircraft ordered from Airbus, with 488 still to be delivered to Indigo.""Indigo's spectacular growth and ambitious aircraft ordering helped India transform from the world's 13 busiest airline market on the eve of Indigo's launch, to number three in the world today,"" says Mike Malik of aviation data analyst Cirium.IndiGo's planned mega order is not the only major deal from India looming on the horizon. Newly established low-cost airline Akasa Air, started in August last year, has announced plans to place a ""substantial order” for single-aisle jets that would come on top of a current order of 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets made in 2021.Tying with China, India is the world's most populated country, with a population of about 1.42 billion. According to a tally by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it has already overtaken China.  What's different, though, is that the Indian population is much younger, with a median age of just 28 years, compared with 39 years for China.Even more importantly, India's potentially huge air passenger market remains largely untapped, as only 4% of the population have ever flown. Aviation expansion was hampered by high fares, unaffordable for many, and a lack of infrastructure, especially in more rural areas.But with economic growth expanding at a pace of about 5% to 6%, ""people are becoming wealthier,"" India's former aviation minister Javant Singh said two years ago, and their propensity for air travel has grown.""There are currently 50 million Indians who would qualify as the global middle-class, which means they can fly anywhere in the country or internationally. But at the moment only 20 million to 25 million of them are doing so,"" Sinha said, highlighting the hidden potential for aviation growth.There are estimates suggesting India could become the world's second-largest aviation market by 2038 — ranking behind the US, but ahead of China — and likely overtaking even the US market in about two decades.The aviation industry online portal FlightGlobal recently asserted that India had displaced China ""as the global aerospace industry's growth frontier, with a bigger order book and a more welcoming economic and geopolitical outlook.""The prime mover behind the boom is India's prime minister Narendra Modi. His Hindu nationalist government has liberalized the aviation sector, doing away with the country's notorious bureaucracy and excessive state regulation.As a result, passenger numbers grew from 65 million  in 2010 to 168 million in 2019. By comparison, Chinese numbers stood at 660 million air travelers in 2019.What India needs most of all are modern passenger aircraft, of which it has only about 700 flying for the country's airlines — ridiculously few given that US carrier American Airlines alone operates 900 planes.But things have already begun to change. At the moment, India's airlines are waiting for 1,200 planes to be delivered over the next few years. In 2019, new plane orders from the subcontinent had already surpassed those made by China. US planemaker Boeing has estimated a total demand of 2,380 new aircraft from the country until 2038.The Modi government, meanwhile, is anxious to make sure aviation infrastructure is keeping up with the rapid growth. Even though Mumbai Airport, as one of India's busiest hubs, still has only one runway, the number of airports elsewhere in the country has grown from 74 to 147 in the past nine years. A further 80 airports are scheduled to go into operation within the next five years.Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/16,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837688,Former Australian PM calls article suggesting war with China over Taiwan in 3 years 'egregious and provocative',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Australian Prime Minister (PM) Paul Keating slammed two of the country’s major newspapers on Thursday (March 16) for publishing a report suggesting Australia needed to prepare for war with China within three years, saying that the stories represent “the most egregious and provocative news presentation of any newspaper I have witnessed in over 50 years of active public life.”Keating said the reporting was “way worse than the illustrated sampans shown to be coming from China in the buildup to the war in Vietnam in the 1960s,” per the Guardian. His comments referred to a report published in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that engaged the opinions of five security analysts who outlined a view that Australia was not ready to be drawn into a war involving Taiwan and China, and that the country needed to begin preparations with urgency.Analysts’ comments in the articles were also at odds with Keating’s belief that Taiwan is not a vital Australian interest. The article said that if China attacked Taiwan, “Australia’s commercial and security lifelines to the world would operate only at Beijing’s pleasure,” and that “Australia would be highly vulnerable to economic coercion, military intrusion or both.”Current Australian PM Anthony Albanese called Keating's comments unfortunate. “I don't think that does anything other than diminish him, frankly, but that's a decision that he's made,” he said.The articles’ publishers came out in defense of their journalists, saying that Keating’s criticism of the articles was personal rather than engaging with the content, and his contributions were not useful. They also called the journalists responsible “two of the country’s most highly respected journalists and we stand by their reporting.”The publishers' statement also highlighted Keating’s failure to comment on a recent ABC story on the risk of war with China. This is a likely reference to an article published in February that reported four of Australia’s most experienced military strategists all saying they do not believe the U.S. can win a war against China, with or without Australian assistance.Keating’s comments came before a speech he delivered to Australia’s National Press Club on Thursday (March 16) in which he once again rallied against the Australian mainstream political establishment, calling Australia’s recent decision to spend AU$368 billion (US$244 billion) over 30 years on nuclear submarines “the worst deal in all history,"" per ABC Australia. In 2021, he also attacked the submarine plan, saying that the alliance was “like throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain.""",2023/03/16,1521,World

(AP) — A freight train carrying corn syrup - not hazardous materials - derailed in western Arizona, near the state’s border with California and Nevada, BNSF Railway said.Railway spokesperson Lena Kent said there were no injuries in the derailment near Topock and, according to preliminary reports, no hazardous materials involved.A spokeswoman for the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office, Anita Mortensen, said that she was not aware of any spills or leaks.The cause of the derailment of approximately eight cars is under investigation, Kent said in a statement.The main track is blocked and Kent said it is not known when it will be reopened.The derailment comes amid heightened attention to rail safety nationwide following a fiery derailment last month in Ohio and a string of derailments since then that have been grabbing headlines, including ones in Michigan, Alabama and other states.In Arizona, Mortensen had earlier said the train was carrying hazardous materials. The derailment occurred near milepost 9 of Interstate 40, Mortensen said, which is a rural, nonresidential area about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Lake Havasu City.The sheriff’s office had notified the National Transportation Safety Board and BNSF, the two entities that she said would be responding to the accident.The NTSB also did not respond to requests for comment.Last month, a freight train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border, igniting a fire and causing hundreds of people to be evacuated.Officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast intentionally released and burned toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke high into the sky.
