https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796373,"2 Nebraska officers wounded, suspect killed in shootout","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Two Nebraska police officers were wounded and a suspect was killed in a shootout during an attempted burglary, police said.

            Omaha police Chief Todd R. Schmaderer said the two officers responded to a report of a burglary at a storage business around 10:30 p.m. Monday, the Omaha World-Herald reported.

            Employees let the officers into the Dino's Storage building in central Omaha and they chased the suspect out of an open storage unit. After they caught up to him, the officers got into a physical altercation and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was shot multiple times and was killed.











            Police identified the suspect Tuesday as Steven Docken, a 38-year-old local man. Investigators recovered a handgun near his body.

            A family member of Docken's told the newspaper Tuesday morning that the family wouldn't comment about the incident.

            The officers involved in the shooting were Nicholas Lanning and Joshua Moore. They have both been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is reviewed.

            The officers were transported to Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha by ambulance and police cruiser. Moore was shot near his knee and might require surgery. Lanning, who is a seven-year veteran, was shot through his upper leg and has been released from the hospital. A department spokesman said Moore, who has been on the police force for a year, was in stable condition Tuesday.

            Schmaderer said he spoke to the officers, who were awake and alert after the shootout, and their spouses. 

            The Nebraska State Patrol and the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office were expected to be involved in the investigation. Both officers were wearing body cameras and security video from the storage business was made available for review.

            A police spokesman said Tuesday that the body camera footage could not be immediately released because it will be part of a grand jury investigation of the incident that is required under state law.

            A woman who answered the phone at the storage business Tuesday referred all questions to the police department.

            Docken had been in state prison twice. He spent about two years in prison on drug charges before being released in December 2021. He also served time between December 2013 and June 2017 after being convicted of theft and a gun charge.OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796374,"In Haiti, gangs take control as democracy withers","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Jimmy Cherizier zips through Haiti’s capital on the back of a motorcycle, flanked by young men wielding black and leopard print masks and automatic weapons.

            As the pack of bikes flies by graffiti reading “Mafia boss” in Creole, street vendors selling vegetables, meats and old clothes on the curb cast their eyes to the ground or peer curiously.

            
                Cherizier, best known by his childhood nickname Barbecue, has become the most recognized name in Haiti.











            And here in his territory, enveloped by the tin-roofed homes and bustling streets of the informal settlement La Saline, he is the law.

            Internationally, he’s known as Haiti’s most powerful and feared gang leader, sanctioned by the United Nations for “serious human rights abuses,” and the man behind a fuel blockade that brought the Caribbean nation to its knees late last year.

            But if you ask the former police officer with gun tattoos running up his arm, he's a “revolutionary,” advocating against a corrupt government that has left a nation of 12 million people in the dust.

            “I’m not a thief. I’m not involved in kidnapping. I’m not a rapist. I’m just carrying out a social fight,” Cherizier, leader of “G9 Family and Allies,"" told The Associated Press while sitting in a chair in the middle of an empty road in the shadow of a home with windows shattered by bullets. “I’m a threat to the system.”

            At a time when democracy has withered in Haiti and gang violence has spiraled out of control, it's armed men like Cherizier that are filling the power vacuum left by a crumbling government. In December, the U.N. estimated that gangs controlled 60% of Haiti’s capital, but nowadays most on the streets of Port-au-Prince say that number is closer to 100%.

            “There is, democratically speaking, little-to-no legitimacy” for Haiti’s government, said Jeremy McDermott, a head of InSight Crime, a research center focused on organized crime. “This gives the gangs a stronger political voice and more justification to their claims to be the true representatives of the communities.”

            It’s something that conflict victims, politicians, analysts, aid organizations, security forces and international observers fear will only get worse. Civilians, they worry, will face the brunt of the consequences.

            ————

            Haiti's history has long been tragic. Home of the largest slave uprising in the Western Hemisphere, the country achieved independence from France in 1804, ahead of other countries in the region.

            But it's long been the poorest country in the hemisphere, and Haiti in the 20th century endured a bloody dictatorship that lasted until 1986 and brought about the mass execution of tens of thousands of Haitians. 

            The country has been plagued by political turmoil since, while suffering waves of devastating earthquakes, hurricanes and cholera outbreaks.

            The latest crisis entered full throttle following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. In his absence, current Prime Minister Ariel Henry emerged in a power struggle as the country’s leader.

            Haiti's nearly 200 gangs have taken advantage of the chaos, warring for control. 

            Tension hums in Port-au-Prince. Police checkpoints dot busy intersections, and graffiti tags reading “down with Henry” can be spotted in every part of the city. Haitians walk through the streets with a restlessness that comes from knowing that anything could happen at any moment.

            An ambulance driver returning from carrying a patient told the AP he was kidnapped, held for days and asked to pay $1 million to be set free. 

            Such ransoms are now commonplace, used by gangs to fund their warfare.

            An average of four people are kidnapped a day in Haiti, according to U.N. estimates. 

            The U.N. registered nearly 2,200 murders in 2022, double the year before. Women in the country describe brutal gang rapes in areas controlled by gangs. Patients in trauma units are caught in the crossfire, ravaged by gunshots from either gangs or police. 

            “No one is safe,” said Peterson Pean, a man with a bullet lodged in his face from being shot by police after failing to stop at a police checkpoint on his way home from work.

            Meanwhile, a wave of grisly killings of police officers by gangs has spurred outrage and protests by Haitians.

            Following the slaying of six officers, video circulating on social media – likely filmed by gangs – showed six naked bodies stretched out on the dirt with guns on their chests. Another shows two masked men using officers' dismembered limbs to hold their cigarettes while they smoke. 

            “Gang-related violence has reached levels not seen in years … touching near all segments of society,” said Helen La Lime, U.N. special envoy for Haiti, in a late January Security Council meeting.

            Henry, the prime minister, has asked the U.N. to lead a military intervention, but many Haitians insist that's not the solution, citing past consequences of foreign intervention in Haiti. So far, no country has been willing to put boots on the ground. 

            The warfare has extended past historically violence-torn areas, now consuming mansion-lined streets previously considered relatively safe.

            La Lime highlighted turf wars between Cherizier's group, G9, and another, G-Pep, as one of the key drivers.

            In October, the U.N. slammed Cherizier with sanctions, including an arms embargo, an asset freeze and a travel ban.

            The body accused him of carrying out a bloody massacre in La Saline, economically paralyzing the country, and using armed violence and rape to threaten “the peace, security, and stability of Haiti.”

            At the same time, despite not being elected into power and his mandate timing out, Henry, whose administration declined a request for comment, has continued at the helm of a skeleton government. He has pledged for a year and a half to hold general elections, but has failed to do so.

            —————-

            In early January, the country lost its final democratically elected institution when the terms of 10 senators symbolically holding office ended their term.

            It has turned Haiti into a de-facto “dictatorship,” said Patrice Dumont, one of the senators.

            He said even if the current government was willing to hold elections, he doesn’t know if it would be possible due to gangs’ firm grip on the city.

            “Citizens are losing trust in their country. (Haiti) is facing social degradation,” Dumont said. “We were already a poor country, and we became poorer because of this political crisis.”

            At the same time, gang leaders like Cherizier have increasingly invoked political language, using the end of the senators’ terms to call into question Henry’s power.

            “The government of Ariel Henry is a de-facto government. It’s a government that has no legitimacy,” Cherizier said.

            Cherizier, a handgun tucked into the back of his jeans, took the AP around his territory in La Saline, explaining the harsh conditions communities live in. He denies allegations against him, saying the sanctions imposed on him are based on lies. 

            Cherizier, who would not tell the AP where his money came from, claims he's just trying to provide security and improve conditions in the zones he controls.

            Cherizier walked through piles of trash and past malnourished children touting an iPhone with a photo of his face on the back. A drone belonging to his team monitoring his security follows him as he weaves through rows of packed homes made of metal sheets and wooden planks. 

            Tailed by a cluster of heavily armed men in masks, he would not allow the AP to film or take photos of his guards and their weapons.

            “We're the bad guys, but we're not the bad-bad guys,” one of the men told an AP video journalist as he led her through a packed market.

            While some have speculated that Cherizier would run for office if elections were held, Cherizier insists that he wouldn’t.

            What is clear, said McDermott, of InSight Crime, is that gangs are reaping rewards from the political chaos.

            InSight Crime estimates that before the killing of the president, Cherizier's federation of gangs, G9, got half of its money from the government, 30% from kidnappings and 20% from extortions. After the killing, government funding dipped significantly, according to the organization.

            Yet his gangs have significantly grown in power after the group blocked the distribution of fuel from Port-au-Prince's key fuel terminal for two months late last year.

            The blockade paralyzed the country in the midst of a cholera outbreak and gave other gangs footholds to expand. Cherizier claimed the blockade was in protest of rising inflation, government corruption and deepening inequality in Haiti.

            Today, G9 controls much of the center of Port-au-Prince and fights for power elsewhere.

            “The political Frankenstein long ago lost control of the gang monster,"" McDermott said. ""They are now rampaging across the country with no restraint, earning money any way they can, kidnapping foremost.”

            ————-

            Civilians like 9-year-old Christina Julien are among those who pay the price.

            The smiling girl with dreams of being a doctor wakes up curled on the floor of her aunt’s porch next to her parents and two sisters.

            She’s one of at least 155,000 people in Port-Au-Prince alone that have been forced to flee their homes due to the violence. It’s been four months since she has been able to sleep in her own bed.

            Their neighborhood in the northern fringes of the city once was safe. But she and her mother, 48-year-old Sandra Sainteluz, said things began to shift last year.

            The once bustling streets emptied out. At night, gunfire would ring outside their window and when neighbors would set off fireworks, Christina would ask her mother if they were bullets.

            “When there were shootings I couldn’t go in the yard, I couldn’t go see my friends, I had to stay in the house,"" Christina said. ""l had to always lay down on the floor with my mother, my father, my sister and my brother.”

            Christina started having heart palpitations due to the stress and Sainteluz, a teacher, worried for her daughter’s health. At the same time, Sainteluz and her husband feared their kids could get kidnapped on the way to school.

            In October, during Cherizier’s blockade, armed men belonging to the powerful 400 Mawozo gang stormed their neighborhood. That same gang was behind the kidnapping of 17 missionaries in 2021.

            Christina saw a group of men with guns from a friend’s house and ran home. She told Sainteluz, “Mommy we have to leave, we have to leave. I just saw the gangsters passing by with their weapons, we need to leave!”

            They packed everything they could carry, and sought refuge in the small, two-bedroom home of family members in another part of the city.

            Life here is not easy, said Sainteluz, the main provider for her family.

            “I felt desperate going to live in someone else’s home with so many children. I left everything, I left with just two bags,"" she said.

            Sainteluz scrambles to scrub clothes, cook soup for her family in the dirt-floored kitchen and help Christina sitting on an empty gasoline container meticulously doing her math homework.

            Whenever a gust of wind blows through the nearby hills, the rusted metal rooftop of the house they share with 10 other people shudders.

            The mother once worked as a primary school teacher, earning 6,000 Haitian gourdes ($41) a month. She had to stop teaching two years ago due to the violence. Now she sells slushies on the side of the road, earning a fraction of what she once made.

            Young Christina said she misses her friends and her Barbie dolls.

            But, the sacrifice is worth it, Sainteluz said. Over the past few months, she’s heard horror stories of her daughter’s classmates getting kidnapped, neighbors having to pay ransoms of $40,000 and killings right outside their house.

            At least here they feel safer. For now, she added.

            Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Jimmy Cherizier zips through Haiti’s capital on the back of a motorcycle, flanked by young men wielding black and leopard print masks and automatic weapons.As the pack of bikes flies by graffiti reading “Mafia boss” in Creole, street vendors selling vegetables, meats and old clothes on the curb cast their eyes to the ground or peer curiously.Cherizier, best known by his childhood nickname Barbecue, has become the most recognized name in Haiti.And here in his territory, enveloped by the tin-roofed homes and bustling streets of the informal settlement La Saline, he is the law.Internationally, he’s known as Haiti’s most powerful and feared gang leader, sanctioned by the United Nations for “serious human rights abuses,” and the man behind a fuel blockade that brought the Caribbean nation to its knees late last year.But if you ask the former police officer with gun tattoos running up his arm, he's a “revolutionary,” advocating against a corrupt government that has left a nation of 12 million people in the dust.“I’m not a thief. I’m not involved in kidnapping. I’m not a rapist. I’m just carrying out a social fight,” Cherizier, leader of “G9 Family and Allies,"" told The Associated Press while sitting in a chair in the middle of an empty road in the shadow of a home with windows shattered by bullets. “I’m a threat to the system.”At a time when democracy has withered in Haiti and gang violence has spiraled out of control, it's armed men like Cherizier that are filling the power vacuum left by a crumbling government. In December, the U.N. estimated that gangs controlled 60% of Haiti’s capital, but nowadays most on the streets of Port-au-Prince say that number is closer to 100%.“There is, democratically speaking, little-to-no legitimacy” for Haiti’s government, said Jeremy McDermott, a head of InSight Crime, a research center focused on organized crime. “This gives the gangs a stronger political voice and more justification to their claims to be the true representatives of the communities.”It’s something that conflict victims, politicians, analysts, aid organizations, security forces and international observers fear will only get worse. Civilians, they worry, will face the brunt of the consequences.————Haiti's history has long been tragic. Home of the largest slave uprising in the Western Hemisphere, the country achieved independence from France in 1804, ahead of other countries in the region.But it's long been the poorest country in the hemisphere, and Haiti in the 20th century endured a bloody dictatorship that lasted until 1986 and brought about the mass execution of tens of thousands of Haitians.The country has been plagued by political turmoil since, while suffering waves of devastating earthquakes, hurricanes and cholera outbreaks.The latest crisis entered full throttle following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. In his absence, current Prime Minister Ariel Henry emerged in a power struggle as the country’s leader.Haiti's nearly 200 gangs have taken advantage of the chaos, warring for control.Tension hums in Port-au-Prince. Police checkpoints dot busy intersections, and graffiti tags reading “down with Henry” can be spotted in every part of the city. Haitians walk through the streets with a restlessness that comes from knowing that anything could happen at any moment.An ambulance driver returning from carrying a patient told the AP he was kidnapped, held for days and asked to pay $1 million to be set free.Such ransoms are now commonplace, used by gangs to fund their warfare.An average of four people are kidnapped a day in Haiti, according to U.N. estimates.The U.N. registered nearly 2,200 murders in 2022, double the year before. Women in the country describe brutal gang rapes in areas controlled by gangs. Patients in trauma units are caught in the crossfire, ravaged by gunshots from either gangs or police.“No one is safe,” said Peterson Pean, a man with a bullet lodged in his face from being shot by police after failing to stop at a police checkpoint on his way home from work.Meanwhile, a wave of grisly killings of police officers by gangs has spurred outrage and protests by Haitians.Following the slaying of six officers, video circulating on social media – likely filmed by gangs – showed six naked bodies stretched out on the dirt with guns on their chests. Another shows two masked men using officers' dismembered limbs to hold their cigarettes while they smoke.“Gang-related violence has reached levels not seen in years … touching near all segments of society,” said Helen La Lime, U.N. special envoy for Haiti, in a late January Security Council meeting.Henry, the prime minister, has asked the U.N. to lead a military intervention, but many Haitians insist that's not the solution, citing past consequences of foreign intervention in Haiti. So far, no country has been willing to put boots on the ground.The warfare has extended past historically violence-torn areas, now consuming mansion-lined streets previously considered relatively safe.La Lime highlighted turf wars between Cherizier's group, G9, and another, G-Pep, as one of the key drivers.In October, the U.N. slammed Cherizier with sanctions, including an arms embargo, an asset freeze and a travel ban.The body accused him of carrying out a bloody massacre in La Saline, economically paralyzing the country, and using armed violence and rape to threaten “the peace, security, and stability of Haiti.”At the same time, despite not being elected into power and his mandate timing out, Henry, whose administration declined a request for comment, has continued at the helm of a skeleton government. He has pledged for a year and a half to hold general elections, but has failed to do so.—————-In early January, the country lost its final democratically elected institution when the terms of 10 senators symbolically holding office ended their term.It has turned Haiti into a de-facto “dictatorship,” said Patrice Dumont, one of the senators.He said even if the current government was willing to hold elections, he doesn’t know if it would be possible due to gangs’ firm grip on the city.“Citizens are losing trust in their country. (Haiti) is facing social degradation,” Dumont said. “We were already a poor country, and we became poorer because of this political crisis.”At the same time, gang leaders like Cherizier have increasingly invoked political language, using the end of the senators’ terms to call into question Henry’s power.“The government of Ariel Henry is a de-facto government. It’s a government that has no legitimacy,” Cherizier said.Cherizier, a handgun tucked into the back of his jeans, took the AP around his territory in La Saline, explaining the harsh conditions communities live in. He denies allegations against him, saying the sanctions imposed on him are based on lies.Cherizier, who would not tell the AP where his money came from, claims he's just trying to provide security and improve conditions in the zones he controls.Cherizier walked through piles of trash and past malnourished children touting an iPhone with a photo of his face on the back. A drone belonging to his team monitoring his security follows him as he weaves through rows of packed homes made of metal sheets and wooden planks.Tailed by a cluster of heavily armed men in masks, he would not allow the AP to film or take photos of his guards and their weapons.“We're the bad guys, but we're not the bad-bad guys,” one of the men told an AP video journalist as he led her through a packed market.While some have speculated that Cherizier would run for office if elections were held, Cherizier insists that he wouldn’t.What is clear, said McDermott, of InSight Crime, is that gangs are reaping rewards from the political chaos.InSight Crime estimates that before the killing of the president, Cherizier's federation of gangs, G9, got half of its money from the government, 30% from kidnappings and 20% from extortions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796375,Hungary FM: Sweden should 'act differently' to join NATO,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Sweden's government should “act differently” if it wants to clinch Turkish support for its bid to join NATO, Hungary's foreign minister said Tuesday, adding that a recent Quran-burning protest outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm was “unacceptable.""

            Peter Szijjarto made the remark at a news conference following talks with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Hungary’s capital Budapest. Both diplomats addressed the Jan. 21 anti-Turkish protest that increased tensions between Ankara and Stockholm as Sweden seeks Turkey’s approval to join the military alliance.

            “As a Christian and as a Catholic, I must say that burning of a holy book of another religion is an unacceptable act,"" Szijjarto said, and criticized a statement by Sweden's prime minister that while the burning of the Quran was inappropriate and “deeply disrespectful,” it fell under Swedish freedom of speech protections.











            ""Stating that the burning of a sacred book is part of freedom of speech is just plain stupidity,"" Szijjarto said, adding that “perhaps they (Sweden) should act differently than that"" if they want to secure Ankara's backing.

            The meeting in Budapest came as Turkey and Hungary remain the only two NATO members that haven’t approved bids by Sweden and Finland to join the military alliance. The northern European neighbors — one of which, Finland, shares a border with Russia — dropped their long-standing military neutrality and sought NATO membership in response to Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

            A unanimous vote of all 30 NATO members is necessary for admitting new countries. 

            Cavusoglu said Turkey shares Hungary's wish for NATO enlargement, but that it was now “impossible for us to confirm (Sweden’s) accession” into the alliance. He called the Quran-burning protest a “provocation which will take us nowhere, it can only lead to chaos.”

            Ankara has also said it's displeased with Sweden’s efforts to crack down on groups that Turkey considers to be terrorist or pose a threat to the country, including Kurdish groups. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Sweden should not expect Turkey’s support in its membership bid. 

            Hungary’s government was expected to vote on accepting Sweden and Finland into NATO by the end of last year. The issue will be on the Hungarian parliament’s agenda during its first session of the year in February, Szijjarto said. 

            Szijjarto said Hungary has a “clear standpoint"" on admitting Sweden and Finland into NATO, but would not attempt to influence Turkey either way. 

            “I never urge any other foreign governments to do things which are not of our concern,” Szijjarto said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796376,EU lawmakers move to lift immunity of scandal suspects,"BRUSSELS (AP) — An influential committee at the European Union’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to lift the protective immunity of two lawmakers being sought by Belgian authorities on suspected links to a major corruption scandal.

            The European Parliament’s legal affairs committee decided by 23 votes to zero, with no abstentions, to lift the parliamentary immunity of Belgian lawmaker Marc Tarabella and Italian Andrea Cozzolino, its chairman, Adrian Vazquez Lazara, announced on Twitter.

            The move paves the way for the full house to vote on whether to remove their protections on Thursday so that the two men, who are members of the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) political group hardest hit by the scandal, can be questioned by Belgian prosecutors.











            Hundreds of thousands of euros (dollars) were seized in raids across Brussels in December. Four people were charged with corruption, money laundering and membership in a criminal organization for allegedly accepting bribes from Qatari and Moroccan officials to influence parliamentary proceedings.

            They are S&D lawmaker Eva Kaili, who was an assembly vice president until the charges came to light; her partner and parliamentary assistant Francesco Giorgi; former S&D lawmaker Pier Antonio Panzeri, and the head of a charity group, Niccolo Figa-Talamanca. Qatar and Morocco deny any involvement.

            The request by prosecutors for parliament to lift the immunity of Tarabella and Cozzolino suggests that they too could be charged. Both men deny wrongdoing and have said they are willing to talk to investigators.

            A lawyer for Panzeri’s wife and daughter, who were also being sought over suspected links to what's one of the EU’s biggest-ever scandals, said Monday that they had been freed from house arrest after Belgian authorities abandoned their attempt to have the two transferred for questioning.

            The two women have accepted to meet freely with investigators at an as-yet undetermined date. The decision in Brussels came days after Panzeri agreed to become an informant in exchange for a lighter sentence, pledging to name names and detail financial arrangements with those involved.BRUSSELS (AP) — An influential committee at the European Union’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to lift the protective immunity of two lawmakers being sought by Belgian authorities on suspected links to a major corruption scandal.The European Parliament’s legal affairs committee decided by 23 votes to zero, with no abstentions, to lift the parliamentary immunity of Belgian lawmaker Marc Tarabella and Italian Andrea Cozzolino, its chairman, Adrian Vazquez Lazara, announced on Twitter.The move paves the way for the full house to vote on whether to remove their protections on Thursday so that the two men, who are members of the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) political group hardest hit by the scandal, can be questioned by Belgian prosecutors.Hundreds of thousands of euros (dollars) were seized in raids across Brussels in December.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796377,US probes complaints of parts flying off of Ford Explorers,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government's road safety agency is investigating complaints that windshield trim panels can fly off of Ford Explorers while they're traveling at highway speeds.

            The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has 164 complaints about the trim pieces detaching on 2011 through 2019 Explorer SUVs. The probe covers about 1.86 million vehicles.

            The parts could hit the windshield of following vehicles or even a motorcycle rider, possibly causing loss of control and a crash, the agency said.











            The agency doesn't have any reports of crashes or injuries, according to a document posted Tuesday.

            NHTSA says it will determine how often the problem happens and the safety consequences of the trim pieces flying off the vehicles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796378,"Flights canceled, at least 2 dead as ice storm freezes US","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Winter weather brought ice to a wide swath of the United States on Tuesday, canceling more than 1,700 flights nationwide and snarling highways. At least two people died on slick roads in Texas and two law officers in the state were seriously injured, including a deputy who was pinned under a truck, authorities said. 

            As the ice storm advanced eastward on Tuesday, watches and warnings stretched from the western heel of Texas all the way to West Virginia. Several rounds of mixed precipitation — including freezing rain and sleet — were in store for many areas through Wednesday, meaning some regions could be hit multiple times, the federal Weather Prediction Center warned.

            Emergency responders rushed to hundreds of auto collisions across Texas and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott urged people to stay off the roads. 











            Authorities said one person in Austin was killed in a predawn pileup Tuesday. A 45-year-old man also died Monday night after his SUV slid into a highway guardrail near Dallas in slick conditions and rolled down an embankment, according to the Arlington Police Department. 

            More than 900 flights to or from major U.S. airport hub Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and more than 250 to or from Dallas Love Field were canceled or delayed Tuesday, according to the tracking service FlightAware. At Dallas-Fort Worth, more than 50% of Tuesday's scheduled flights had been canceled by Tuesday afternoon.

            Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled more than 560 flights Tuesday and delayed more than 350 more, FlightAware reported.

            About 7,000 power outages in Texas were reported as of late Tuesday morning, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said following a briefing in Austin on the worsening conditions. He emphasized the outages were due to factors such as ice on power lines or downed trees, and not the performance of the Texas power grid that buckled for days during a deadly winter storm in 2021.

            Fleets of emergency vehicles were fanned out among 1,600 roads impacted by the freeze.

            In Texas, a sheriff’s deputy who stopped to help the driver of an 18-wheeler that went off an icy highway on Tuesday was hit by a second truck that pinned him beneath one of its tires, according to the Travis County Sheriff’s Office. About 45 minutes after the crash on State Highway 130, the deputy was freed from the wreckage and taken to a hospital, where he was in surgery Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The deputy is expected to survive, officials said.

            In another wreck, a Texas state trooper was hospitalized with serious injuries after being struck by a driver who lost control of their vehicle, said Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

            “The roadways are very hazardous right now. We cannot overemphasize that,” Abbott said.

            As the ice and sleet enveloped Memphis, Tennessee, Memphis-Shelby County Schools announced that it will cancel classes Wednesday due to freezing rain and hazardous road conditions. The school system has about 100,000 students. The University of Memphis said it would announce plans for Wednesday classes by 6 a.m. tomorrow.

            In Arkansas, Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Tuesday because of the ice storm. In her declaration, Sanders cited the “likelihood of numerous downed power lines” and said road conditions have created a backlog of deliveries by commercial drivers.

            One of the main thoroughfares through Arkansas — Interstate 40 — was ice-coated and “extremely hazardous” in the Forrest City area on Tuesday, according to the city's fire department. 

            The department responded to two bad wrecks and about 15 other crashes Tuesday morning, Division Chief Jeremy Sharp said by telephone. In many of the crashes, the drivers pick up speed on the highway but run into trouble when they reach a bridge, he said.

            “They hit the ice and they start wrecking,” he said.

            “When I-40 shuts down like that, that can be hours of waiting,” said John Gadberry, who lives in Colt, Arkansas, not far from the highway. “I-40 is usually one of the first things that freezes over due to its slight elevation.”

            By late Tuesday morning, I-40 was cleared and traffic had resumed, the Arkansas Department of Transportation announced. The interstate connects Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee.

            The storm began Monday as part of an expected “several rounds” of wintry precipitation through Wednesday across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard.

            “Generally light to moderate freezing rain resulting in some pretty significant ice amounts,” Chenard said.

            “We're expecting ice accumulations potentially a quarter inch or higher as far south as Austin, Texas, up to Dallas over to Little Rock, Arkansas, towards Memphis, Tennessee, and even getting close to Nashville, Tennessee,” according to Chenard.

            The flight disruptions follow Southwest’s meltdown in December that began with a winter storm but continued after most other airlines had recovered. Southwest canceled about 16,700 flights over the last 10 days of the year, and the U.S. Transportation Department is investigating.

            The weather service has issued a winter storm warning for a large swath of Texas and parts of southeastern Oklahoma and an ice storm warning across the midsection of Arkansas into western Tennessee.

            A winter weather advisory is in place in much of the remainder of Arkansas and Tennessee and into much of Kentucky, West Virginia and southern parts of Indiana and Ohio.

            Schools and colleges in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas planned to close or go to virtual learning Tuesday.

            Martin reported from Woodstock, Georgia. Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Ken Miller in Oklahoma City; Adrian Sainz in Memphis; and David Koenig in Dallas contributed.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Winter weather brought ice to a wide swath of the United States on Tuesday, canceling more than 1,700 flights nationwide and snarling highways. At least two people died on slick roads in Texas and two law officers in the state were seriously injured, including a deputy who was pinned under a truck, authorities said.As the ice storm advanced eastward on Tuesday, watches and warnings stretched from the western heel of Texas all the way to West Virginia. Several rounds of mixed precipitation — including freezing rain and sleet — were in store for many areas through Wednesday, meaning some regions could be hit multiple times, the federal Weather Prediction Center warned.Emergency responders rushed to hundreds of auto collisions across Texas and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott urged people to stay off the roads.Authorities said one person in Austin was killed in a predawn pileup Tuesday. A 45-year-old man also died Monday night after his SUV slid into a highway guardrail near Dallas in slick conditions and rolled down an embankment, according to the Arlington Police Department.More than 900 flights to or from major U.S. airport hub Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and more than 250 to or from Dallas Love Field were canceled or delayed Tuesday, according to the tracking service FlightAware. At Dallas-Fort Worth, more than 50% of Tuesday's scheduled flights had been canceled by Tuesday afternoon.Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled more than 560 flights Tuesday and delayed more than 350 more, FlightAware reported.About 7,000 power outages in Texas were reported as of late Tuesday morning, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said following a briefing in Austin on the worsening conditions. He emphasized the outages were due to factors such as ice on power lines or downed trees, and not the performance of the Texas power grid that buckled for days during a deadly winter storm in 2021.Fleets of emergency vehicles were fanned out among 1,600 roads impacted by the freeze.In Texas, a sheriff’s deputy who stopped to help the driver of an 18-wheeler that went off an icy highway on Tuesday was hit by a second truck that pinned him beneath one of its tires, according to the Travis County Sheriff’s Office. About 45 minutes after the crash on State Highway 130, the deputy was freed from the wreckage and taken to a hospital, where he was in surgery Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The deputy is expected to survive, officials said.In another wreck, a Texas state trooper was hospitalized with serious injuries after being struck by a driver who lost control of their vehicle, said Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.“The roadways are very hazardous right now. We cannot overemphasize that,” Abbott said.As the ice and sleet enveloped Memphis, Tennessee, Memphis-Shelby County Schools announced that it will cancel classes Wednesday due to freezing rain and hazardous road conditions. The school system has about 100,000 students. The University of Memphis said it would announce plans for Wednesday classes by 6 a.m. tomorrow.In Arkansas, Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Tuesday because of the ice storm. In her declaration, Sanders cited the “likelihood of numerous downed power lines” and said road conditions have created a backlog of deliveries by commercial drivers.One of the main thoroughfares through Arkansas — Interstate 40 — was ice-coated and “extremely hazardous” in the Forrest City area on Tuesday, according to the city's fire department.The department responded to two bad wrecks and about 15 other crashes Tuesday morning, Division Chief Jeremy Sharp said by telephone. In many of the crashes, the drivers pick up speed on the highway but run into trouble when they reach a bridge, he said.“They hit the ice and they start wrecking,” he said.“When I-40 shuts down like that, that can be hours of waiting,” said John Gadberry, who lives in Colt, Arkansas, not far from the highway. “I-40 is usually one of the first things that freezes over due to its slight elevation.”By late Tuesday morning, I-40 was cleared and traffic had resumed, the Arkansas Department of Transportation announced. The interstate connects Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee.The storm began Monday as part of an expected “several rounds” of wintry precipitation through Wednesday across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard.“Generally light to moderate freezing rain resulting in some pretty significant ice amounts,” Chenard said.“We're expecting ice accumulations potentially a quarter inch or higher as far south as Austin, Texas, up to Dallas over to Little Rock, Arkansas, towards Memphis, Tennessee, and even getting close to Nashville, Tennessee,” according to Chenard.The flight disruptions follow Southwest’s meltdown in December that began with a winter storm but continued after most other airlines had recovered.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796391,Adani says US short-seller fraud report an 'attack on India',"Last week, Hindenburg Research, a US-based short-selling firm, accused the Adani Group, one of India's largest industrial conglomerates, of a years-long scheme involving stock manipulation and accounting fraud.The 106-page report also said that Adani Group is saddled with debt and claimed its share price is overvalued.Since the report was released, the Adani Group has lost an estimated $70 billion (€64.5 billion) in market value, with the group's chairman and founder, Gautam Adani, personally losing billions. However, he remains one of the richest men in the world, and maintains deep political connections.Hindenburg Research specializes in forensic financial research to identify potential opportunities to bet against a company's stock.The firm attracted Wall Street's attention in 2020 for raising serious questions about electric-vehicle makers Nikola Corp misrepresenting its technology. A court later found Nikola's founder guilty of fraud.In a 413-page response, the Adani Group hit back and portrayed Hindenburg's allegations as ""baseless and an attack against India itself.""""This is not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India,"" the company said in a statement.Hindenburg responded by saying that fraud cannot be obfuscated by ""nationalism or a bloated response"" that ignores every key allegation.Several Indian opposition lawmakers also criticized Adani's response.""It is a matter of concern that a group against whom serious allegations have been made is using the Indian flag and has the audacity to say that the report on the company is an attack on India. Parliament needs to have a discussion on this and send out a message that Adani is not India,"" said Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) parliamentarian Manoj Jha on Tuesday.""When did Adani become India?"" asked Congress leader Manish Tewari.The Adani Group comprises several companies ranging from energy to transportation and infrastructure development in countries around the world.By financing and building ports, roads, rail, airports and power infrastructure, Adani Group is crucial for India's economic ambitions under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The group has been a major supporter of Modi's initiatives such as ""Make in India"" and ""Digital India.""The family-run enterprise also has close ties to the ruling political class and its access to loans from Indian banks, especially the State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), has largely funded the conglomerate's acquisition-driven growth.Indian economist Arun Kumar told DW that the report would impact Adani's business in the short term and could affect foreign institutional investors interest in India.""The big question is how it might affect Modi's image and how he plays out the current controversy in the coming weeks. Will he distance himself?"" Kumar said.Kumar pointed out that the Adani Group is deeply overleveraged and cited a recent report by CreditSights, a unit of Fitch Ratings.In August last year, a report spelled out that the Adani Group has invested aggressively across existing and new businesses, predominantly funded with debt.The report said Adani's credit metrics and cash flow are under pressure by this growth strategy and warned ""in the worst-case scenario"" it may spiral into a debt trap and possibly a default.""I am waiting for statements by both Reserve Bank of India and the regulatory body, Securities Exchange Board of India, about these allegations of Adani's inappropriate use of off-shore tax havens,"" Lekha Chakraborty, professor and chair at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, told DW.""Inappropriate deals indeed widen economic inequalities and that is definitely a matter of serious concern, and needs authentic investigation,"" Chakraborty added.""The nuances of distinction between what is 'ethical' and what is 'legitimate' need to be understood in such cases,"" she said.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/01/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796396,Can Pakistan face down a growing Taliban insurgency?,"After the Taliban toppled Afghanistan's government in August 2021, authorities in neighboring Pakistan warned that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Taliban's Pakistani allies, would be emboldened in their years-long rebellion against the government.Throughout 2022, militants stepped up attacks throughout Pakistan, with tensions escalating in November after the TTP called off a fragile ceasefire with the Pakistani government and ordered their fighters to carry out attacks ""wherever you can in the entire country.""According to the ""Pakistan Security Report 2022,""released in early January by the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), terrorist attacks in Pakistan increased year-on-year by 27%. Out of the 262 attacks in 2022, the report said 86 were carried out by the TTP.The latest attack came on Monday. At least 95 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a mosque in the city of Peshawar, capital of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a tense tribal region that borders Afghanistan and is a hotbed of militancy.Most of the people in the mosque were police officers who were gathered for evening prayers. The mosque is located in their security compound. It is one of the deadliest attacks to strike Pakistan in years, and the deadliest since the Taliban takeover of Kabul.The TTP initially claimed responsibility for the bombing, with one of the group's commanders, Sarbakaf Mohmand, saying it was ""revenge"" for the death of a TTP militant last year.A TTP spokesperson later denied the group was responsible, claiming that ""any action in mosques"" violates its ""laws.""However, even if the core of the TTP is trying to distance itself from the attack, a TTP splinter group called Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) claimed responsibility, saying the attack was in retaliation for the death last year of its leader, Omar Khalid Khurasani.JuA is a large and powerful faction of the TTP that has been involved in orchestrating multiple attacks against Pakistani forces and religious minorities. It was behind an attack on Easter in 2016 that killed around 75 people at a park in Lahore.One of the TTP's primary demands has been for Pakistan's government and military to reduce their presence the country's northwest.The TTP frequently carries out attacks in the region, where government control remains patchy.The TTP comprises several hardliner Sunni insurgent and sectarian groups who have waged a murderous campaign against the Pakistani state since 2007. Although the TPP are not directly linked with the Afghan Taliban in Kabul, they pledge allegiance to them.Pakistan banned the TTP in 2008, and the group is responsible for many attacks across Pakistan. The deadliest to date was a 2014 attack on a school in Peshawar that killed 149 people, including 132 children.The TPP have been declared a terrorist organization by the United Nations and the United States. Their attacks have killed thousands of civilians and security forces in Pakistan.Even during the ostensible ceasefire that ended in November, the TTP continued to carry out attacks.Analysts have warned Islamabad's soft policy toward the TTP , and inviting them for peace talks, is a major factor contributing to rising militancy.""A full-fledged operation is required to curb militancy in Pakistan rather than adopting a soft policy,"" Afrasiab Khattak, a former Senator from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told DW, adding that the government should not negotiate with ""terrorists.""Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari recently condemned the previous government's policy of appeasing extremist groups, particularly the TTP.Zardari told Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera that former Prime Minister Imran Khan did not crack down hard enough on the TTP in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which is one of his political strongholds. Bhutto has said the TTP is now responding to the new government's reversal of Khan's appeasement policies.""The TTP threat to Pakistan is significant, and it is growing,"" Madiha Afzal, a Brookings Institute scholar focusing on Pakistan, told DW.""The TTP have been emboldened by a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and the Pakistani state's shaky, uncertain approach to the group in recent years. Pakistan has tried negotiating with the group many times over the years; negotiations always fail because the group is existentially opposed to the Pakistani state and constitution,"" she added.""The only option the state has is to launch an extensive military operation against the group, as it did in 2014, but that is complicated this time around by the fact that the TTP can cross the border into Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, leaving Pakistan with a growing, and hard to control terrorism problem on its hands.""As a more aggressive TPP further deteriorates the security situation in Pakistan, the country is also facing a protracted economic crisis.""This attack comes at a time when the economy is on the brink. That itself requires the government to take this seriously and ensure that the threat to the country's security is not effectively met,"" said Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.""Pakistan is witnessing a rise in militant attacks. These seem to have spiked since the Taliban returned to power in neighboring Afghanistan. The security challenge, especially after the Peshawar attack, necessitates that law enforcement agencies step up their actions to counter the militants,"" she told DW.Most of the TPP's leadership is operating from within Afghanistan, which shares a porous 2,600 kilometer-long (1,600-mile) border with Pakistan. After the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, TTP leadership and fighters have been given safe harbor in the country by their Taliban allies.However, the recent attack in Peshawar is likely to further deteriorate relations between Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan.Hours after Monday's bombing, Pakistani Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan said that the Afghan Taliban must fulfill their commitments to the international community to not allow any militant group to use Afghan soil for orchestrating attacks against another country.Since 2009. Pakistan's security forces have launched several military offensives in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Past military operations have succeeded in pushing TTP militants out of Pakistan.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/01/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796398,Rebuilding Kharkiv after the war: A opportunity to modernize,"Dmitri Zhuikov's voice trembles when he talks about the war in his native Ukraine.The 39-year-old architect recalls growing up in Kharkiv, remembers the laughter of friends and schoolmates, the places they hung out as teenagers, the park bench where he kissed a girl for the first time. His memories are vivid.Until the Russian invasion, the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border, was the second largest city in the country, home to about 1.5 million people.But Kharkiv became one of Russia's first targets when it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The destruction is massive.During her visit to the city in early January, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called Kharkiv a ""symbol of the absolute insanity of the Russian war of aggression and the suffering of the people.""Speaking amid bombed-out houses, Baerbock said Kharkiv was also a symbol of Ukrainian courage in the face of Russian aggression.Russian troops besieged the city for months, bombarding and shelling it with artillery fire. Then Russian soldiers entered, and hundreds of civilians were killed.But the Ukrainian military managed to liberate the city in the fall of 2022.It was a major defeat for the Russians, Dmitri Zhuikov told DW, adding that while artillery can no longer reach the city, Moscow's strategic bombers and medium-range missiles are still a threat.Many people have been forced to leave Kharkiv. As Zhuikov says, what remains is a city in ruins, with badly damaged buildings throughout, particularly in the the northeastern outskirts of the city where the Russians sought to advance. ""Entire suburbs were completely shot up,"" adds Zhuikov. The city center, including the Kharkiv regional administration building, city hall and the university, were severaly damaged as well.Broken windows, collapsed roofs, burned-out houses: By last July, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov had listed about 3,500 damaged residential buildings, some 500 of which were beyond repair.""At least 150,000 people have lost the roofs over their heads,"" says Zhuikov.Landmark art nouveau buildings were hit, as was a brand-new shopping mall in the city center, a swimming pool, a huge power plant and the university sports complex and stadium where Zhuikov used to play soccer as a young boy.Born in Kharkiv in 1983 as the son of an architect, Dmitri Zhuikov followed in his mother's footsteps. He studied construction and architecture at the National Technical University and worked as an architect. He then met his wife, an architect from Mariupol. In 2012, the two moved to Dessau, Germany. where they completed their master's degrees.The couple, who now have two children, stayed in Germany. Dmitri Zhuikov works for an architectural firm in Munich, though he still feels close to his native Ukraine. ""Even though my family is safe here, many of my acquaintances, friends and relatives remain in eastern Ukraine,"" he says. ""I suffer with them.""In December, British star architect Norman Foster drew the world's attention to Kharkiv when he presented Mayor Terekhov with a master plan to redevelop the city.It is based on five pilot projects, including a cultural heritage project to create a new architectural landmark in the city center, and a river project to transform a six-kilometer green strip between the Kharkiv and Nemyshlya rivers for pedestrians and cyclists.Foster, who developed the masterplan with a team of Ukrainian architects, plans to turn a coal power plant into a clean energy and food center as part of the industry project.A pilot science project aims to attract technology companies, research firms and start-ups to the eastern Ukrainian city.Foster's housing project is focused on making existing buildings more modern and energy-efficient.Dmitri Zhuikov would love to be part of the rebuilding of Kharkiv. The Munich-based architect also sees the city's reconstruction as an opportunity to develop a new energy-saving concept. Many buildings were barely insulated before the war, he points out. ""And it can get really cold in Kharkiv,"" Zhuikov says. He also knows that proper planning is needed to achieve this goal.During the war, he says, many people have became more closely networked. They have learned to help each other, and have become more proactive and committed to their concerns. Zhuikov is convinced that Kharkiv will benefit from this, ""because citizen participation is important for reconstruction.""First, however, peace must be restored.Many buildings are still undergoing emergency makeshift repairs and infrastructure — like heating, electricity and water networks — is being fixed. ""We Ukrainians are good at improvising,"" Zhuikov says.Aid, like the support pledged by German Foreign Minister Baerbock, is money well spent, he adds. ""For Ukraine, the war is a tragedy, but with great opportunities,"" says Dmitri Zhuikov. ""I hope they will be used.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/01/31,,
