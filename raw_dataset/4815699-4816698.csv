https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815699,High-risk volcano search for Philippine plane with 4 aboard,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine authorities on Monday prepared to send a search mission near the crater of a restive volcano after they spotted the suspected wreckage of a small plane that went missing with four people on board over the weekend.

            Two Filipino pilots and two Australians were aboard the Cessna 340, which lost contact after takeoff from Albay province southeast of the capital Saturday morning on its way to Manila, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said.

            The Australians were working as consultants for Energy Development Corp., a large geothermal power company. The company said it has deployed teams backed by helicopters and drones to help in the search. 











            “We will not stop until they are found,” company official Allan Barcena said.

            Mayor Carlos Baldo of Albay’s Camalig town and other officials told reporters Sunday that an aerial search spotted the suspected wreckage, including the tail, scattered about 1,150 feet (350 meters) from the crater on the steep southwestern slope of Mayon Volcano. There was no sign of people. 

            A ground search was hampered by rainy weather over the weekend. 

            About 60 search and rescue personnel may scale the 8,077-foot (2,462-meter) Mayon when the weather clears, Baldo said. They'll also need assistance from volcano experts and local officials because of the restiveness of Mayon, one of the country’s 24 active volcanoes.

            “It’s a very risky operation,” Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology director Teresito Bacolcol told The Associated Press. “It’s a race against time and it’s a matter of life and death but there’s also the danger of rockfalls and volcanic lahar.”

            Villagers are normally prohibited from entering a permanent danger zone 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) around the volcano. 

            “There is no other missing plane in the area and there’s testimony from residents, who saw the plane flying unusually low before they heard an explosion,” Baldo told AP by telephone. 

            He said a chopper could drop the rescuers nearer to the suspected crash site. 

            A popular tourist attraction because of its near-perfect cone, Mayon last erupted in 2018, displacing tens of thousands of villagers. 

            It’s currently under the second of five volcano alert levels, meaning volcanic earthquakes, steam and gas emissions, ground deformation and intermittent ash and steam blasts have been sporadically detected. Alert five means a major and deadly volcanic eruption is underway.

            Separately, a single-engine Cessna plane that went missing Jan. 24 with six people on board in the northern Philippine province of Isabela has not yet been found. Officials said a search for the plane was continuing on and off, depending on the weather.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine authorities on Monday prepared to send a search mission near the crater of a restive volcano after they spotted the suspected wreckage of a small plane that went missing with four people on board over the weekend.Two Filipino pilots and two Australians were aboard the Cessna 340, which lost contact after takeoff from Albay province southeast of the capital Saturday morning on its way to Manila, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said.The Australians were working as consultants for Energy Development Corp., a large geothermal power company.

            Shares dropped in Tokyo, Sydney and Hong Kong but rose in Seoul and Shanghai. Analysts say worries about a slowdown and weakening demand persist in Asia, as companies cope with rising energy and raw material costs and consumers hold back on spending.

            The latest data from Australia, called the Judo Bank PMI, showed private sector activity remained in contraction for the fifth straight month. Although exports rebounded with help from China’s re-opening after it dropped COVID-related restrictions, the sector showed little to no positive momentum. Unemployment has also risen in Australia.

            “The distortions in the Australian economy remain extreme and point only to recession,” Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, said in a commentary.

            It was unclear if newly issued rules on overseas initial public offerings by Chinese companies had any significant impact on trading.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815702,Trump absent as Iowa 2024 GOP caucus train begins to roll,"URBANDALE, Iowa (AP) — Nikki Haley is swinging through Iowa this week fresh off announcing her presidential campaign. Her fellow South Carolinian Republican, Sen. Tim Scott, will also be here as he decides his political future. And former Vice President Mike Pence was just in the state courting influential evangelical Christian activists.

            After a slow start, Republican presidential prospects are streaming into the leadoff presidential caucus state. Notably absent from the lineup, at least for now, is former President Donald Trump. 

            Few of the White House hopefuls face the lofty expectations in Iowa that Trump does. He finished a competitive second to devout social conservative Ted Cruz in 2016, and went on to carry the state twice, by healthy margins, as the Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 and 2020 elections. 











            “It is genuinely impossible for this guy to try to manage these expectations,"" said Luke Martz, a veteran Iowa Republican strategist who helped lead Mitt Romney’s 2012 Iowa caucus campaign. ""They are enormous. They are self-made. I don't see how anyone who is saying ‘I’m the guy' can come in and even get even a second-place finish.” 

            Yet, in the three months since he announced his bid for a comeback, Trump has not set foot in Iowa, the first place his claim of party dominance will be tested early next year. 

            To be sure, Trump is making moves in Iowa. On Monday, his team announced it had named a state campaign director, Marshall Moreau, who managed the 2022 campaign of Republican attorney general candidate Brenna Bird. Bird defeated Democrat Tom Miller, who had been the longest-serving attorney general in the country, first elected in 1978. 

            Trump has maintained an Iowa political presence, with a national campaign team member, Alex Latcham, based in the state. But Trump held a kickoff rally on Jan. 28 in South Carolina, where his 2016 primary victory sealed his status as GOP frontrunner. And he squeezed in a speaking spot earlier that day at the annual state GOP meeting in New Hampshire, where he also won the first-in-the-nation primary seven years ago.

            Though the caucuses remain nearly a year off, they remain the first event on the calendar, and some Iowa GOP activists have taken notice of Trump's absence. 

            “I found that quite interesting,” Gloria Mazza, chairwoman of the Polk County GOP, said of Trump’s New Hampshire and South Carolina stops. “Because Iowa is first in the nation, doesn’t everybody come here first?”

            Meanwhile, others are making impressions. 

            Haley's sharpest applause during her first stop as a candidate in Iowa — and the first campaign event by any GOP prospect in Iowa — came Monday night at a flooring company warehouse in Urbandale, a Des Moines suburb, as she addressed gender education in schools, a flashpoint among conservatives.

            She suggested to an audience of about 200 that gender education need not begin in schools before middle school, marking a contrast with prospective candidate Ron DeSantis. The Florida governor last year signed legislation forbidding instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity before fourth grade. 

            “Well, I don't even think that goes far enough,"" she said. ""We don't need to be telling our children about gender. That's for the parents to do. That has nothing to do with schools.” 

            Though Pence is not yet a candidate, his advocacy group Advancing American Values last week launched a campaign to organize opposition to school policies like one in an eastern Iowa district.

            Pence was in Cedar Rapids on Wednesday rallying opponents of a policy by the nearby Linn-Mar Community School District that's at issue in a federal lawsuit. The school board last year enacted a measure allowing transgender students to request a gender support plan to begin socially transitioning at school without the permission of their parents. 

            The issue, an early focus of 2024 Republican presidential prospects, is particularly contentious among Christian conservatives, with whom Pence routinely says he identifies. And at Wednesday's event at a pizza restaurant — it had the feel of an early caucus campaign stop — Pence illustrated its traction. 

            “We don't co-parent with government,"" Pence told a cheering audience of more than 100. “We trust parents to protect their children and no one will ever protect America's children better than their moms and dads.""

            Haley plans a rally Tuesday in the Cedar Rapids area. Meanwhile, Scott is speaking an event at Drake University on Wednesday, part of what aides call a national listening tour aimed at informing his plans, before addressing the annual Polk County Republican fundraiser in suburban Des Moines that evening. 

            Quietly making inroads is former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who visited Iowa in January, and met last week with legislative Republicans in the Capitol in Des Moines and Republican activists in western Iowa.

            Though several would-be candidates including Trump were in Iowa last year campaigning for midterm candidates, these first impressions at the outset of the GOP presidential primary are important. That's especially true as many in the GOP wait to see whether DeSantis proceeds with a White House bid.

            But as the field of candidates grows in the coming months, Trump still retains a core of Republican support that could be hard to overcome. 

            In October, 57% of Iowa Republicans said they hoped Trump decided to run in 2024, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, while 33% said they hoped he would not and 10% said they were not sure.

            “Of course, there's a contingent that will support him regardless,"" Iowa Republican national committeeman Steve Scheffler said. “But there's an increasing number of people who want to kick the tires before making a decision. That's what gives others an open door.""URBANDALE, Iowa (AP) — Nikki Haley is swinging through Iowa this week fresh off announcing her presidential campaign.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815703,"Record 6,542 guns intercepted at US airport security in 2022","ATLANTA (AP) — The woman flying out of Philadelphia’s airport last year remembered to pack snacks, prescription medicine and a cellphone in her handbag. But what was more important was what she forgot to unpack: a loaded .380-caliber handgun in a black holster.

            The weapon was one of the 6,542 guns the Transportation Security Administration intercepted last year at airport checkpoints across the country. The number — roughly 18 per day — was an all-time high for guns intercepted at U.S. airports, and is sparking concern at a time when more Americans are armed.

            “What we see in our checkpoints really reflects what we’re seeing in society, and in society there are more people carrying firearms nowadays,” TSA administrator David Pekoske said.











            With the exception of pandemic-disrupted 2020, the number of weapons intercepted at airport checkpoints has climbed every year since 2010. Experts don't think this is an epidemic of would-be hijackers — nearly everyone caught claims to have forgotten they had a gun with them — but they emphasize the danger even one gun can pose in the wrong hands on a plane or at a checkpoint. 

            Guns have been intercepted literally from Burbank, California, to Bangor, Maine. But it tends to happen more at bigger airports in areas with laws more friendly to carrying a gun, Pekoske said. The top 10 list for gun interceptions in 2022 includes Dallas, Austin and Houston in Texas; three airports in Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta; Phoenix; and Denver.

            Pekoske isn't sure the “I forgot” excuse is always true or whether it's a natural reaction to getting caught. Regardless, he said, it’s a problem that must stop.

            When TSA staffers see what they believe to be a weapon on the X-ray machine, they usually stop the belt so the bag stays inside the machine and the passenger can’t get to it. Then they call in local police.

            Repercussions vary depending on local and state laws. The person may be arrested and have the gun confiscated. But sometimes they’re allowed to give the gun to a companion not flying with them and continue on their way. Unloaded guns can also be placed in checked bags assuming they follow proper procedures. The woman in Philadelphia saw her gun confiscated and was slated to be fined.

            Those federal fines are the TSA’s tool to punish those who bring a gun to a checkpoint. Last year TSA raised the maximum fine to $14,950 as a deterrent. Passengers also lose their PreCheck status — it allows them to bypass some types of screening — for five years. It used to be three years, but about a year ago the agency increased the time and changed the rules. Passengers may also miss their flight as well as lose their gun. If federal officials can prove the person intended to bring the gun past the checkpoint into what’s called the airport’s sterile area, it's a federal offense.

            Retired TSA official Keith Jeffries said gun interceptions can also slow other passengers in line.

            “It’s disruptive no matter what,” Jeffries said. “It’s a dangerous, prohibited item and, let’s face it, you should know where your gun is at, for crying out loud.”

            Experts and officials say the rise in gun interceptions simply reflects that more Americans are carrying guns.

            The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, tracks FBI data about background checks completed for a firearm sale. The numbers were a little over 7 million in 2000 and about 16.4 million last year. They went even higher during the coronavirus pandemic.

            For the TSA officers searching for prohibited items, it can be jarring.

            In Atlanta, Janecia Howard was monitoring the X-ray machine when she realized she was looking at a gun in a passenger’s laptop bag. She immediately flagged it as a “high-threat” item and police were notified.

            Howard said it felt like her heart dropped, and she was worried the passenger might try to get the gun. It turns out the passenger was a very apologetic businessman who said he simply forgot. Howard says she understands travel can be stressful but that people have to take care when they're getting ready for a flight.

            “You have to be alert and pay attention,"" she said. “It’s your property.”

            Atlanta's airport, one of the world's busiest with roughly 85,000 people going through checkpoints on a busy day, had the most guns intercepted in 2022 — 448 — but that number was actually lower than the year before. Robert Spinden, the TSA's top official in Atlanta, says the agency and the airport made a big effort in 2021 to try to address the large number of guns being intercepted at checkpoints.

            An incident in November 2021 reinforced the need for their efforts. A TSA officer noticed a suspected gun in a passenger’s bag. When the officer opened the suitcase the man reached for the gun, and it went off. People ran for the exits, and the airport was shut down for 2 1/2 hours, the airport's general manager Balram Bheodari said during a congressional hearing last year.

            Officials put in new signage to catch the attention of gun owners. A hologram over a checkpoint shows the image of a revolving blue gun with a red circle over the gun with a line through it. Numerous 70-inch television screens flash rotating messages that guns are not allowed.

            “There’s signage all over the airport. There is announcements, holograms, TVs. There’s quite a bit of information that is sort of flashing before your eyes to just try to remind you as a last ditch effort that if you do own a firearm, do you know where it’s at?” Spinden said.

            Miami's airport also worked to get gunowners' attention. The airport's director told Congress last year that after setting a gun interception record in 2021 they installed high-visibility signage and worked with airlines to warn passengers. He said the number of firearms intercepted declined sharply. 

            Pekoske said signage is only part of the solution. Travelers face a barrage of signs or announcements already and don't always pay attention. He also supports gradually raising penalties to grab people's attention.

            But Aidan Johnston, from the gun advocacy group Gun Owners of America, said he'd like to see the fines lessened, saying they’re not a deterrent. While he’d like to see more education for new gun owners, he also doesn’t think of this as a “major heinous crime.” 

            “These are not bad people that are in dire need of punishment,” he said. “These are people who made a mistake.”

            Officials believe they're catching the vast majority, but with 730 million passengers screened last year even a miniscule percentage getting through is a concern.

            Last month, musician Cliff Waddell was traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, to Raleigh, North Carolina, when he was stopped at the checkpoint. A TSA officer had seen a gun in his bag. Waddell was so shocked he initially said it couldn't be his because he'd just flown the day before with the same bag. It turned out the gun had been in his bag but missed at the screening. TSA acknowledged the miss, and Pekoske says they’re investigating.

            When trying to figure out how the gun he keeps locked in his glove compartment got in his bookbag, Waddell realized he’d taken it out when he took the vehicle in for repairs. Waddell said he recognizes it's his responsibility to know where his firearm is but worries about how TSA could have missed something so significant.

            “That was a shock to me,” he said.

Experts don't think this is an epidemic of would-be hijackers — nearly everyone caught claims to have forgotten they had a gun with them — but they emphasize the danger even one gun can pose in the wrong hands on a plane or at a checkpoint.Guns have been intercepted literally from Burbank, California, to Bangor, Maine. But it tends to happen more at bigger airports in areas with laws more friendly to carrying a gun, Pekoske said. The top 10 list for gun interceptions in 2022 includes Dallas, Austin and Houston in Texas; three airports in Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta; Phoenix; and Denver.Pekoske isn't sure the “I forgot” excuse is always true or whether it's a natural reaction to getting caught. Regardless, he said, it’s a problem that must stop.When TSA staffers see what they believe to be a weapon on the X-ray machine, they usually stop the belt so the bag stays inside the machine and the passenger can’t get to it. Then they call in local police.Repercussions vary depending on local and state laws. The person may be arrested and have the gun confiscated. But sometimes they’re allowed to give the gun to a companion not flying with them and continue on their way. Unloaded guns can also be placed in checked bags assuming they follow proper procedures. The woman in Philadelphia saw her gun confiscated and was slated to be fined.Those federal fines are the TSA’s tool to punish those who bring a gun to a checkpoint. Last year TSA raised the maximum fine to $14,950 as a deterrent. Passengers also lose their PreCheck status — it allows them to bypass some types of screening — for five years. It used to be three years, but about a year ago the agency increased the time and changed the rules. Passengers may also miss their flight as well as lose their gun. If federal officials can prove the person intended to bring the gun past the checkpoint into what’s called the airport’s sterile area, it's a federal offense.Retired TSA official Keith Jeffries said gun interceptions can also slow other passengers in line.“It’s disruptive no matter what,” Jeffries said. “It’s a dangerous, prohibited item and, let’s face it, you should know where your gun is at, for crying out loud.”Experts and officials say the rise in gun interceptions simply reflects that more Americans are carrying guns.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, tracks FBI data about background checks completed for a firearm sale. The numbers were a little over 7 million in 2000 and about 16.4 million last year. They went even higher during the coronavirus pandemic.For the TSA officers searching for prohibited items, it can be jarring.In Atlanta, Janecia Howard was monitoring the X-ray machine when she realized she was looking at a gun in a passenger’s laptop bag. She immediately flagged it as a “high-threat” item and police were notified.Howard said it felt like her heart dropped, and she was worried the passenger might try to get the gun. It turns out the passenger was a very apologetic businessman who said he simply forgot. Howard says she understands travel can be stressful but that people have to take care when they're getting ready for a flight.“You have to be alert and pay attention,"" she said. “It’s your property.”Atlanta's airport, one of the world's busiest with roughly 85,000 people going through checkpoints on a busy day, had the most guns intercepted in 2022 — 448 — but that number was actually lower than the year before. Robert Spinden, the TSA's top official in Atlanta, says the agency and the airport made a big effort in 2021 to try to address the large number of guns being intercepted at checkpoints.An incident in November 2021 reinforced the need for their efforts. A TSA officer noticed a suspected gun in a passenger’s bag. When the officer opened the suitcase the man reached for the gun, and it went off. People ran for the exits, and the airport was shut down for 2 1/2 hours, the airport's general manager Balram Bheodari said during a congressional hearing last year.Officials put in new signage to catch the attention of gun owners. A hologram over a checkpoint shows the image of a revolving blue gun with a red circle over the gun with a line through it. Numerous 70-inch television screens flash rotating messages that guns are not allowed.“There’s signage all over the airport. There is announcements, holograms, TVs. There’s quite a bit of information that is sort of flashing before your eyes to just try to remind you as a last ditch effort that if you do own a firearm, do you know where it’s at?” Spinden said.Miami's airport also worked to get gunowners' attention. The airport's director told Congress last year that after setting a gun interception record in 2021 they installed high-visibility signage and worked with airlines to warn passengers. He said the number of firearms intercepted declined sharply.Pekoske said signage is only part of the solution. Travelers face a barrage of signs or announcements already and don't always pay attention. He also supports gradually raising penalties to grab people's attention.But Aidan Johnston, from the gun advocacy group Gun Owners of America, said he'd like to see the fines lessened, saying they’re not a deterrent. While he’d like to see more education for new gun owners, he also doesn’t think of this as a “major heinous crime.”“These are not bad people that are in dire need of punishment,” he said. “These are people who made a mistake.”Officials believe they're catching the vast majority, but with 730 million passengers screened last year even a miniscule percentage getting through is a concern.Last month, musician Cliff Waddell was traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, to Raleigh, North Carolina, when he was stopped at the checkpoint. A TSA officer had seen a gun in his bag. Waddell was so shocked he initially said it couldn't be his because he'd just flown the day before with the same bag. It turned out the gun had been in his bag but missed at the screening. TSA acknowledged the miss, and Pekoske says they’re investigating.When trying to figure out how the gun he keeps locked in his glove compartment got in his bookbag, Waddell realized he’d taken it out when he took the vehicle in for repairs. Waddell said he recognizes it's his responsibility to know where his firearm is but worries about how TSA could have missed something so significant.“That was a shock to me,” he said.___Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815780,FWD Greater Bay Area’s survey on healthcare protection reveals 75% of respondents in Hong Kong are concerned about an anticipated increase in medical expenditure in the next decade,"Passive in health protection planning, nearly 40% of respondents in  Hong Kong might give up the best medical options

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 20 February 2023 - A recent survey on ""Healthcare Protection in the Greater Bay Area (GBA)"" (note 1) conducted by FWD Hong Kong (""FWD"") has found that Hong Kongers anticipate a huge increase in medical expenditure in the future which would impose financial burden on them. However, unlike the respondents in GBA, fewer Hongkongers are prepared to make use of medical or critical illness insurance to build reserve. Unable to shoulder the hefty medical expenses, 40% of Hong Kongers admitted that they might have to consider giving up the best treatment options as a result.   The survey was conducted in September 2022 in 11 cities (note 1) with a view to understand respondents' views on healthcare protection plans for individuals and their families, in particular their budget for expenses on medical and critical illnesses. A total of 2,410 GBA residents aged between 18 and 60 were polled, including 500 from Hong Kong, 102 from Macau and 1,808 from nine other Mainland cities. Key survey findings are as follows:   1) Considerable pressure coping with future medical expenses in general, some might just relinquish treatment      Huge healthcare expenditure anticipated in the future: Around 60 to 75% of respondents in Hong Kong, Macau and the Mainland expected medical expenditure for both individuals and family members would likely be increased by over 20% in 10 years' time, the costliest being treatment for critical/serious illnesses (such as cancer, cardiac diseases and stroke).       Heavy financial burden brought by healthcare expenditure: Around 70% of respondents said that medical expenses for themselves and their families would create a ""very heavy"" or ""rather heavy"" financial burden within the next 10 years. The ratios of respondents from Hong Kong (76%) and Macau (78%) were higher than that from the Mainland (65%).       Hong Kongers passive in response, some even considered giving up medical treatment: In spite of the financial burden they faced, many Hongkongers were still passive in dealing with the insufficient health insurance coverage issue, such as choosing to cut down other daily spendings (82%) or cash in their savings (73%) instead. Nearly 40% of Hongkongers (37%) said they would opt to give up medical treatment or the best medical solutions, the highest among respondents in three regions.        2) Hong Kong: lowest rate of health insurance coverage in GBA     Hong Kong has the lowest health insurance penetration rate in GBA: Even though 95% of Hong Kongers considered healthcare protection as ""rather important"" or ""very important"", only around half have medical insurance plans (including Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme - VHIS) or critical illness insurance (56% and 49% respectively). The ratios were considerably lower than those from Macau (71%, 46%) and the Mainland (80%, 70%)         Health insurance spending relatively low among Hongkongers: The survey also indicated that 70% Hongkongers spent no more than 20% of their household income annually on medical insurance or critical illness insurance (76% and 75% respectively), presenting an obvious disparity with Macau where about half of the respondents (49%, 62%) allocated over 20% of their household income on insurance protection.      3) Hongkongers tend to overlook the importance of mental health protection:         As compared with others surveyed, Hong Kongers considered mental health protection less important as 75% of them believed that mental health insurance (covering depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia, etc.) was ""rather important"" or ""very important"", while the figures for respondents in Macau and the Mainland stood at 87% and 90% respectively.      Plan for future healthcare protection needs early for oneself and family   Kelvin Yu, Chief Product Officer of FWD Hong Kong & Macau, said: ""The COVID-19 pandemic in the past few years has highlighted the importance of physical and mental wellness. Medical and critical illness insurance will not only provide individuals with a reserve that caters for their future healthcare needs, but also help them ease their psychological burden associated with unexpected future medical spendings, allowing them to worry less and enjoy a healthier life.""   The survey revealed that Hong Kongers are the most passive among other regions in terms of healthcare protection planning with less coverage and spendings on health insurance. Their awareness of mental health protection was also found to be lower than respondents in Macau and other GBA cities.   Yu added: ""The survey provides a timely update of healthcare protection and concerns among Hongkongers. This enables us to plan for further enhancements of our healthcare protection and related promotional strategies to support customers. FWD has recently incorporated mental health into its medical protection scope, which is a first-in-Hong Kong initiative (note 2). Through providing accessible mental health protection, we hope to support individuals to plan for the holistic well-being for self and family, as well as to open up conversations about mental health issues.""   In November 2022, FWD launched a mental health-focused medical protection plan (note 3), which includes preliminary diagnosis, referral, out-patient counselling, hospitalisation treatment and post-hospitalisation care, as well as tailor-made family support.   Note 1: Market research company Kantar Hong Kong Limited was engaged to conduct the survey in which a total of 2,410 adults from Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in Guangdong Province (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) were polled. This survey was conducted through online survey, except for street interviews in Macau.   Note 2: Per a comparison made by FWD on 30 September 2022 among the medical insurance plans of key insurers available in Hong Kong, FWD is the first insurance company in Hong Kong to launch Out-Patient Psychiatrist Consultation/ Clinical Psychologist Consultation Benefit, Daily Hospital Income Benefit, Post Hospitalisation Out-Patient Psychiatrist Consultation/ Clinical Psychologist Consultation Benefit, Retreat Benefit and Monthly Income Support Benefit (optional benefit).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815791,DW Jazz Concerts: The Jacky Terrasson Trio,"This concert, recorded at the 2021 Jazzfest Bonn, was special — it was the first that pianist Terrasson and his trio, which includes French bassist Sylvain Romano and Cuban drummer Lukmil Perez, performed after pandemic-induced lockdowns canceled most events in 2020.Like many other artists, Terrasson spent an entire year in isolation. He then came back with a bang at the 2021 edition of the annual jazz festival held in the former capital of West Germany.Terrasson was born in 1957 in Berlin to a French father and an African-American mother. He grew up in Paris and began playing the piano at the age of five.At school, he learned to play classical music and followed it up by learning jazz with jazz musician and teacher, Jeff Gardner. Terrasson spent his time listening to recordings by legendary jazz pianists and composers including Bud Powell, Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk.Terrasson moved to New York in the 1990s. In 1993, he won the Thelonious Monk jazz competition in Washington DC. The recognition landed him a contract with the record label, Blue Note, which released his first album, ""Jacky Terrasson,"" in 1994. ""By the mid-'90s, Terrasson was being hailed as one of the bright young lions on the traditional jazz scene,"" Blue Note says on its website.Terrasson went on to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, meeting other jazz musicians, like the Panamanian pianist Danilo Perez, who has worked with jazz giants like trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Wayne Shorter.For Terrasson, music is an expression of one's feelings. ""I would imagine that life, in general, is mirrored through the way you express your music…. And what you express as far as feelings, is automatically a reflection of how your life is going,"" he told DW on the sidelines of his performance in 2021 at the Jazzfest in Bonn.Terrasson has a reputation for being a master improvisor, and his talent is on full display during this concert. The first composition, ""The Call,"" is a light and uplifting piano number. It's followed by the thoughtful ""Kiss Jeanette for Me"" and ""Love for Sale,"" the latter being an improvisation of a 1930s tune by American composer Cole Porter.Next, we listen to an improvisation of the famous ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" followed by ""O Café, O Soleil."" An unnamed track is then followed by ""Smile"" and a final medley comprised of Terrasson's original compositions.The performance is part of this edition of DW Jazzfest hosted by Manasi Gopalakrishnan. The show was produced by Thomas Schmidt and Christian Stäter, with editorial support from Anastassia Boutsko.

            A 21-year-old man was quickly arrested and two guns were recovered at the scene, where police were already out in force, Woodfork said. After initially jailing the man on a charge of illegally carrying a weapon, police said late Monday that the man faced a charge of second-degree murder. 

            It was unclear if other arrests were imminent.











            Woodfork said homicide investigators were seeking more information, including any motive and whether more than one person may have fired shots. 

            Carnival season, which began Jan. 6, is in its final raucous days in New Orleans heading into Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, the day before Lent begins. The largest parades roll in the final days, drawing thousands of spectators along the routes and into the narrow streets outside the French Quarter's bars and restaurants. A shorthanded New Orleans police force is getting help from other Louisiana law enforcement agencies to help keep the peace. 

            The Sunday night shooting happened on St. Charles Avenue as the Krewe of Bacchus made it to the halfway point of its five-mile (8-kilometer) route. 

            The procession of marching bands, dance troupes and 32 elaborate floats draws thousands of locals and tourists each year. Performers and revelers had passed through the city's historic Garden District and were nearing the Central Business District when gunfire sent panicked onlookers running for cover.

            Woodfork said the teenager who died was between the ages of 15 and 18, but wasn't immediately identified. The other four victims included the 4-year-old girl, and three adults — two men and a woman — ranging in age from 18 to 24. They were treated and released from a hospital. 

            “This was an isolated incident,” Woodfork said. She and other city officials noted that the shooting marred what had largely been a peaceful Carnival celebration this year. 

            However, sporadic, sometimes fatal violence is a recurring problem during Mardi Gras parades. Woodfork noted previous problems in the area of Sunday’s shooting. Two men died nearby when gunfire broke out during the Muses parade in 2015.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815793,AP source: Antetokounmpo going to New York for wrist exam,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo was scheduled to be in New York on Monday to undergo testing and get further evaluation on his injured right wrist, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Sunday night because neither the Bucks nor Antetokounmpo released the plans publicly.

            ESPN first reported that Antetokounmpo was going to New York, and it was later confirmed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.











            Antetokounmpo injured his wrist Thursday night in Chicago after attempting to block a shot. Antetokounmpo exited after only nine minutes and did not return. He had X-rays and Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said at the time they came back clean.

            But there evidently has not been much improvement in the wrist since. Antetokounmpo did not join his brothers as planned for the All-Star Skills Challenge on Saturday night in Utah — he was filled in for there by Bucks teammate and fellow All-Star Jrue Holiday.

            And he played only 20 seconds in his team's victory over Team LeBron in the All-Star Game on Sunday night, getting a dunk on the first possession, then taking a foul and heading to the bench to basically become a coach for the rest of the night.

            “Taking it day by day, try to get healthy,"" Antetokounmpo said after the game. “You know, obviously I had the incident three days ago. I don’t think it’s smart in any way to, you know, play a lot of minutes in the All-Star Game. At the end of the day, obviously, you want to participate, you want to run up and down, joke around, have some dunks, create some work. But at the end of the day, I feel you also have to be mature.""

            He did not give any hint that the wrist issue is more serious than a sprain.

            “Hopefully, I can, you know, be available for my team when they need me,"" Antetokounmpo said.

            Milwaukee has the NBA's second-best record coming out of the All-Star break at 41-17, a half-game behind Boston in the Eastern Conference.

            Antetokounmpo is third in the NBA in scoring at 31.8 points per game, behind only Dallas’ Luka Doncic (33.3) and Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid (33.1).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815794,Israeli government advances judicial overhaul despite uproar,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Tuesday for the first time advanced a plan to overhaul the country’s legal system, defying a mass uproar among Israelis and calls for restraint from the United States.

            The vote marked only preliminary approval for the plan. But it raised the stakes in a political battle that drew tens of thousands of protesters into the streets, sparked criticism from influential sectors of society and widened the rifts in an already polarized country.

            The 63-47 vote after midnight gave initial approval to a plan that would give Netanyahu’s coalition more power over who becomes a judge. It is part of a broader package of changes that seeks to weaken the country’s Supreme Court and transfer more power to the ruling coalition.











            Netanyahu’s ultrareligious and ultranationalist allies say these changes are needed to rein in the powers of an unelected judiciary. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister — and say that Netanyahu, who faces trial on corruption charges, has a conflict of interest in the legislation. 

            The showdown has plunged Israel into one of its most bitter domestic crises, with both sides insisting that the future of democracy is at stake in their Middle Eastern country. Israeli Palestinians, a minority that may have the most to lose by the overhaul, have mostly stayed on the sidelines, due to discrimination they face at home and Israel’s ongoing 55-year occupation of their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank.

            The legislators cast their votes after a vitrolic debate that dragged on past midnight. During the session, opposition lawmakers chanted, “shame,” and wrapped themselves in the Israeli flag — and some were ejected from the hall.

            Thousands were rallying outside the Knesset, waving Israeli flags and holding signs reading “saving democracy!” Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway.

            Netanyahu accused the demonstrators of violence and said they were ignoring the will of the people who voted his coalition into power last November.

            “The people exercised their right to vote in the elections and the people’s representatives will exercise their right to vote here in Israel’s Knesset. It’s called democracy,” Netanyahu said, though he left the door open for dialogue on the planned changes.

            The vote on part of the legislation is just the first of three readings required for parliamentary approval, a process that is expected to take months.

            Nonetheless, the opposition, including tens of thousands of protesters in front of the Knesset in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv, saw Monday’s vote as the coalition’s determination to barrel ahead.

            “We are fighting for our children’s future, for our country’s future. We don’t intend to give up,” said opposition leader Yair Lapid.

            Israel’s figurehead president has urged the government to freeze the legislation and seek a compromise with the opposition, a position supported by most polls. 

            Leaders in the booming tech sector have warned that weakening the judiciary could drive away investors.

            The overhaul has prompted otherwise stoic former security chiefs to speak out, and even warn of civil war. The plan has even sparked rare warnings from the U.S., Israel’s chief international ally. 

            U.S. Ambassador Tom Nides told a podcast over the weekend that Israel should “pump the brakes” on the legislation and seek a consensus on reform that would protect Israel’s democratic institutions. 

            His comments drew angry responses from Netanyahu allies, telling Nides to stay out of Israel’s internal affairs. 

            The debate raged Monday from the floor of the Knesset to flag-waving demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

            Simcha Rothman, a far-right lawmaker leading the legislative initiative, presented the proposal to the parliament. Overhead in the viewing gallery, a spectator banged on the protective glass and was carried away by guards.

            A fellow Religious Zionism party politician posted a photo on Twitter with Rothman ahead of the vote, celebrating with whisky and sushi. 

            Last week, some 100,000 people demonstrated outside the Knesset as a committee granted initial approval to the plan. On Monday, the crowds returned, waved Israeli flags, blew horns, and held signs reading “saving democracy.”

            “All the steps that are going to take place now in the Knesset will change us to a pure dictatorship,” said Itan Gur Aryeh, a 74-year-old retiree. “All the power will be with the government, with the head of the government and we’ll all be without rights.”

            Earlier in the day, protesters launched a sit-down demonstration at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv’s main highway. Hundreds waved Israeli flags in the seaside city and further up the coast in Haifa, holding signs reading “resistance is mandatory.”

            While Israel has long boasted of its democratic credentials, critics say that claim is tainted by the country’s West Bank occupation and the treatment of its own Palestinian minority.

            Israel’s Palestinian citizens, who make up about 20% of the population, have the right to vote but continue to suffer discrimination in areas like the job and housing markets. In the West Bank, Jewish settlers can vote in Israeli elections and are generally protected by Israeli laws, while Palestinians in the same territory are subject to military rule and cannot vote.

            The parliamentary votes seek to grant the ruling coalition more power over who becomes a judge. Today, a selection committee is made up of politicians, judges and lawyers — a system that proponents say promotes consensus. 

            The new system would give coalition lawmakers control over the appointments. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister.

            A second change approved Monday would bar the Supreme Court from overturning what are known as “Basic Laws,” pieces of legislation that stand in for a constitution, which Israel does not have. Critics say that legislators will be able to dub any law a Basic Law, removing judicial oversight over controversial legislation.

            Also planned are proposals that would give parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings and control the appointment of government legal advisers. The advisers currently are professional civil servants, and critics say the new system would politicize government ministries.

            Critics also fear the overhaul will grant Netanyahu an escape route from his legal woes. Netanyahu has been on trial for nearly three years for charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. He denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a biased judicial system on a witch hunt against him. 

            Israel’s attorney general has barred Netanyahu from any involvement in the overhaul, saying his legal troubles create a conflict of interest. Instead, his justice minister, a close confidant, is leading the charge.

            On Sunday, Netanyahu called the restrictions on him “patently ridiculous.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815795,"Leiji Matsumoto, known for antiwar anime, space tales, dies","TOKYO (AP) — Leiji Matsumoto, the anime creator known for ”Space Battleship Yamato” and other classics using a fantastical style and antiwar themes, has died at age 85. 

            His manga works “Galaxy Express 999” and “Space Pirate Captain Herlock” were adapted into television anime series in the 1970s and became huge hits in and outside Japan. 

            Matsumoto, whose real name was Akira Matsumoto, died of acute heart failure in a Tokyo hospital on Feb. 13, his office, Studio Leijisha, said Monday.











            Born in the southwestern city of Kurume, Matsumoto started drawing at age 6, and rose to fame with “Otoko Oidon,” a manga series telling the story of a poor man from southern Japan who lives in a boarding house in Tokyo and struggles to balance work and studying.

            Many of his manga were in the ""battlefield comics"" genre with more than 150 stories depicting tragedy of war.

            His antiwar theme comes from his father, an elite army pilot who returned from Southeast Asia and taught his son that war should never be fought. 

            In his interview with Japan’s NHK television in 2018, Matsumoto recalled seeing his father apologize to the mothers of his subordinates for not being able to bring them back alive. His father also told Matsumoto that one had to be a demon to not think an enemy has a family. 

            “War destroys your future,” Matsumoto said in the interview, noting that many talented youths who might have contributed to “the civilization of mankind” were killed during war. 

            “I was told by my father that any life is born in order to live, not to die,” Matsumoto said. “I think we should not be wasting time fighting on the Earth.”

            Matsumoto received several cultural and arts awards from the Japanese government, and the Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters from France.

            Matsumoto’s daughter Makiko Matsumoto, who heads the studio, said in a statement released on Twitter: “Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto set out on a journey to the sea of stars. I think he lived a happy life, thinking about continuing to draw stories as a manga artist.”TOKYO (AP) — Leiji Matsumoto, the anime creator known for ”Space Battleship Yamato” and other classics using a fantastical style and antiwar themes, has died at age 85.His manga works “Galaxy Express 999” and “Space Pirate Captain Herlock” were adapted into television anime series in the 1970s and became huge hits in and outside Japan.Matsumoto, whose real name was Akira Matsumoto, died of acute heart failure in a Tokyo hospital on Feb. 13, his office, Studio Leijisha, said Monday.Born in the southwestern city of Kurume, Matsumoto started drawing at age 6, and rose to fame with “Otoko Oidon,” a manga series telling the story of a poor man from southern Japan who lives in a boarding house in Tokyo and struggles to balance work and studying.Many of his manga were in the ""battlefield comics"" genre with more than 150 stories depicting tragedy of war.His antiwar theme comes from his father, an elite army pilot who returned from Southeast Asia and taught his son that war should never be fought.In his interview with Japan’s NHK television in 2018, Matsumoto recalled seeing his father apologize to the mothers of his subordinates for not being able to bring them back alive. His father also told Matsumoto that one had to be a demon to not think an enemy has a family.“War destroys your future,” Matsumoto said in the interview, noting that many talented youths who might have contributed to “the civilization of mankind” were killed during war.“I was told by my father that any life is born in order to live, not to die,” Matsumoto said. “I think we should not be wasting time fighting on the Earth.”Matsumoto received several cultural and arts awards from the Japanese government, and the Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters from France.Matsumoto’s daughter Makiko Matsumoto, who heads the studio, said in a statement released on Twitter: “Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto set out on a journey to the sea of stars.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815796,Congress delegation visits Taiwan in tense US-China moment,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A delegation of U.S. lawmakers met with the head of Taiwan's legislature on Monday as part of a five-day visit to the self-ruled island that comes as U.S.-China relations remain tense after weeks of trading accusations over a spy balloon. 

            The delegation that arrived Sunday includes Reps. Ro Khanna of California, Tony Gonzales of Texas, Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Jonathan Jackson of Illinois. 

            They are expected to meet President Tsai Ing-wen as well as business people. On Monday, they held talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's founder Morris Chang, considered the father of the island's chip industry. 











            Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, said he was in Taiwan to learn about the island's role in the semiconductor industry. Khanna and Auchincloss are both members of the new House select committee focused on competition with China. 

            He addressed the implicit threat facing their visit, as China opposes any form of exchange between Taiwan and foreign governments. China claims the island as part of its territory to be united by force if necessary, and has stepped up military and diplomatic harassment of Taiwan. 

            “Our efforts to come here are in no way provocative of China, but consistent with the president's foreign policy that recognizes the importance of the relationship like Taiwan, while still seeking ultimately, peace in the region,” Khanna said. 

            Head of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, You Si-kun, used the speech to hit back at Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, who said over the weekend at the Munich Security Conference that Taiwan “has never been a country and it will not be a country in the future.” 

            “China ignores historical fact and claims to have sovereignty over Taiwan. Taiwan has already become an independent sovereign nation ... Taiwan has never been ruled by the People's Republic of China for a single day,” You said. 

            The delegation's visit follows a sensitive trip made by a senior Pentagon official on Friday, reported by the Financial Times.

            A Pentagon spokesperson did not comment on the visit by Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, repeating that ""our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.” Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had no information about any such visit.

            Tensions between the U.S. and China again ratcheted up last month after Washington accused Beijing of sending a spy balloon that was shot down over the American East Coast, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to Beijing. Blinken also said over the weekend that the United States was concerned that China would provide weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815811,"NT$15,000 fine for people who violate Taiwan's new mask rules","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Although Taiwan substantially eased its indoor mask rules on Monday (Feb. 20), people who ""maliciously violate"" the remaining mask regulations could face fines of up to NT$15,000 (US$493).The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Monday officially relaxed the indoor mask regulations, but there are eight indoor settings including public transportation where masks must continue to be worn. CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said at a press conference if there is a violation, authorities will first attempt persuasion before imposing punishment for those who do not follow regulations.When asked by the media to respond to reports the Taipei Metro will fine passengers up to NT$15,000 for not wearing a mask, Wang said the requirement has been in place for 881 days and is not a new measure. Wang said that if there is a violation, the competent authority designated by the local government will deal with the situation and mete out punishment.He said that because Taiwan has entered an era of self-initiated epidemic prevention, it is only necessary to issue penalties in the case of ""malicious violations.""Department of Navigation and Aviation Director-General Ho Shu-ping (何淑萍) emphasized that from now on, people who take public transportation must still wear masks while in mass transit vehicles and stations. Examples include railway carriages, MRT cars, cable cars, ferries, city buses, intercity buses, tour buses, aircraft, taxis, and other means of transport, as well as stations and ferry terminals.As for stations, Ho said that masks must be worn in ticketing areas for trains and the MRT, restricted areas in airports, and ticketing and restricted areas of ferry terminals. If people in these locations must eat, drink, take photos, or undergo medical treatment, Ho said they can temporarily remove their masks.However, Ho said that those who fail to heed instructions to wear masks on public transport will be subject to a fine of between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 in accordance with Article 70, Item 1 of the Communicable Disease Control Act (傳染病防治法).Given that Taiwan is preparing to open up to cruise ships in March, the media asked whether masks will be required inside cruise ships and on their decks. Ho said when passengers arrive in Taiwan from a cruise ship, they must wear a mask when entering public transport terminals and passenger transport terminals.In addition, Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-Hsiang (莊人祥) said that all inbound passengers must still undergo the ""0+7"" formula in which there is no quarantine but seven days of self-health monitoring is still required. Chuang said that if passengers have symptoms, they must undergo rapid antigen testing and this is the same whether they arrive by plane or cruise ship.Maritime and Port Bureau director-general Yeh Hsieh-lung (葉協隆) was cited by Liberty Times as saying that since cruise ships contain many confined spaces, it is recommended that passengers still wear masks.",2023/02/20,8903,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815819,Migrant fishers on Taiwan boats demand guaranteed Wi-fi,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s migrant fishers are demanding that Taiwan guarantee Wi-fi access while at sea, something that campaigners say will form an essential part of improving the harsh working conditions they face.Migrant fishers gathered at the Taipei Fish Market on Monday (Feb. 20) to call on the government to ensure there is encrypted Wi-fi on every Taiwanese boat.The protest marked the launch of the ""Wi-fi Now for Fishers Rights at Sea Campaign,” an advocacy platform for migrant fishers who say that Wi-fi is essential to protect workers’ freedom of association on board and prevent labor exploitation.“(These) serious abuses currently go unheard and unaddressed,” the campaigners said in a statement. “(With Wi-fi) workers would also be able to access health and mental health support when needed.”Research was conducted on 15 Taiwanese migrant-staffed fishing vessels in 2022 that showed only 11 had access to Wi-fi, though at best, the crew only had access for three hours each day. Following that, the other ships provided access only on some days for a limited time, as short as 15 minutes.“Fishers who often spend months at sea need to be able to communicate with family, labor unions, advocates, health and other service providers, recruitment agencies, and state officials,” said Father Yance, Director of the Stella Maris Seafarers Center, a Jesuit group advocating for migrant laborers based in Kaohsiung.The Secretary General of Taiwan Association for Human Rights (TAHR) Yi-Hsiang Shih (施逸翔) said that the fishers’ lack of Wi-fi conflicts with Taiwan’s often touted democratic values.“Taiwan prides itself on being a regional leader in democratic governance and respect for human rights, however, some workers — like migrant fishers — have no way to protect their rights while they are at sea making huge profits for the seafood industry and contributing to the Taiwanese economy,” said Shih.Indonesian fisher Andris Nabeleng said that for people like him, employers not paying wages is a common problem. “Guaranteed Wi-Fi communication would ensure we get paid and that we can communicate with our union if there is a problem,” he said.In a statement released in November 2022, the Fisheries Agency of the Department of Agriculture said that it would provide subsidies of NT$3 million (US$99,000) for the purchase of equipment and monthly payments of NT$8000 for subscription fees, per ship. It said that it hopes to have Wi-fi services subsidized to 110 vessels in the next four years.",2023/02/20,1145,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815820,AP PHOTOS: Images of war in Ukraine from cutting-room floor,"Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic images from the war in Ukraine.

            Photographers covering the war in Ukraine have shown the world its calamitous toll over and over: an injured pregnant woman carried away on a stretcher, a father saying goodbye to his fleeing wife and child through a train window, dozens of people sheltering under a damaged bridge.

            There are thousands of heartbreaking images, however, the public has never seen. 











            Digital technology has made it easier than ever to take more photos and distribute them in an instant, forcing news organizations to be even choosier about what gets published. Photographers in Ukraine might shoot as many frames in a week as they would have in an entire year of another war in Europe, the one in Bosnia.

            Some photos are discarded because the composition is off or the focus isn't clear. But many powerful images never reach an audience simply because, with deadlines looming, another was chosen instead.

            This is a selection of photos that The Associated Press didn’t publish when they were taken. Months later, the photographers have revisited their work and picked out frames that they think deserve to be seen.

            NEW FOCUS

            Emilio Morenatti’s image of a well-heeled woman weeping as Kyiv was bombarded the day after Russia's invasion drove home how the war had upended the lives of millions of Ukrainians.

            Morenatti says it was the first time he fully grasped the danger that civilians would face in the conflict.

            “This woman — she’s in shock like I am in shock,” he said.

            In the photo that was published on Feb. 25, 2022, the woman is overcome with emotion. In the new one, she is almost begging. Morenatti, though, still feels the first photo he sent was the right one to capture the immediate chaos. 

            Many images that don't get published show the moment before — or after — the one that did get beamed around the world. At the remove of a few months and without the urgency of breaking news, some photographers reconsidered their decisions.

            Natacha Pisarenko initially selected an image of a boy running through a field of flowers, past a bombed-out building. Now, she has chosen one where the boy pauses. One represents how children sometimes seem oblivious to the horrors around them. The other implies they are very much trying to take them in. 

            “I don’t like this idea that we get used to things so quickly,” she said.

            Several photographers unearthed images on their hard drives that focused on different people from those they had initially highlighted. Evgeniy Maloletka chose one in which he trained his focus on the doctors — rather than their patient — who are forced to dole out care in a hospital hallway, so crowded were the wards. 

            On the day he followed volunteers helping people flee their homes, David Goldman chose a photo of an elderly man being lifted from his bed. But now he has come across one in which the distress of the man’s wife commands attention.

            “What caught me about her expression is she's almost pleading with the outside world,” he said.

            ZOOMING IN/ZOOMING OUT

            Photojournalists strive to choose images that clearly encapsulate what they have witnessed.

            When Rodrigo Abd entered Bucha, days after Ukrainian forces retook the Kyiv suburb and discovered bodies scattered in the streets, he knew his primary task was to convey the scale of the killings under Russian occupation. One of his photos that was published showed a mound of bodies.

            Months later, Bucha has become a byword for the horrors of this war, and he saw an opportunity to zoom in to tell a more personal story. A close-up of a hand evokes for him the suffering of the person who was killed.

            Many of the photos in this selection are graphic — and photographers documenting war are constantly forced to grapple with how gruesome their images can and should be. They do not want to sanitize the horrors they’re seeing, but they know that an overly grisly photo may be counterproductive.

            “Sometimes you think if you send something too strong, the readers will not look,” said Bernat Armangué.

            He remembers thinking that a photo of a woman crying over her dead husband felt too raw on the day. But months later, he was grateful to be able to share the couple's story again.

            Sometimes pulling the lens back is the best way to aid understanding.

            Morenatti’s photo showing people fleeing was taken with a long lens — a tool he generally shies away from because he prefers to capture people's expressions. In hindsight, he realized the image still telegraphs their desperation. He imagines all the things they could not carry with them.

            MOMENTS MISSED

            In the race to get images published, sometimes photographers miss what they have.

            When they return to their photos, “all of a sudden you notice things that were blocked by the emotional state you were in when you were shooting,” Vadim Ghirda said.

            
                Felipe Dana initially sent other, wider shots of a scene of a wounded woman in Kharkiv. Returning to his images, he noticed for the first time that she was on the phone in one photo, a detail that highlighted the emotion of the moment. The tighter framing also underscored the anguish in her expression. 

            SOMETHING HORRIBLE

            Ghirda has taken lots of photos of death and destruction — but he always aims to “show people horrible situations without standard horrible details.” An image of people fleeing Kyiv captured a moment that Ghirda says was one of the most affecting of the war for him. 

            The use of motion blur conveys the urgency: The platform for the train to Lviv, in Ukraine’s west and safer than the capital, changed moments before departure, and people panicked as they rushed to get to the new platform.

            TOO SENSITIVE

            Some photos were initially held back by the photographers for ethical or security considerations: to avoid revealing a checkpoint's location or a wounded soldier's identity.

            During the first months of the war, Efrem Lukatsky found himself shocked by the “wild senseless cruelty” unfolding before him, much of it perpetrated by Russian soldiers. The horrors documented in his images from the time made him fear for his family in Ukraine, and he worried that the photos might distress the relatives of their subjects.

            Now, Lukatsky feels he can’t hold them back any longer.

            “Real war differs from what we see in movies, it’s a million times more horrific,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815821,"Pakistan, Afghan Taliban trade fire at border crossing","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani border guards and Afghan Taliban forces traded cross-border fire on Monday morning, officials said, a day after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers closed the Torkham border crossing amid increasing tensions between the two neighbors.

            There was no immediate word on casualties on either side.

            On Sunday, the Afghan Taliban shut Torkham, a key trade route, over Pakistan's alleged refusal to allow Afghan patients and their caretakers to enter Pakistan for medical care without travel documents, Pakistani security officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss border issues. 











            Khalid Khan, a local Pakistani police official, confirmed the border closure and what he described as intermittent exchanges of fire at Torkham, located in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan's military and the Foreign Ministry made no immediate comments.

            Mullah Mohammad Siddiq, a Taliban-appointed commissioner at Torkham, said Pakistan has not been abiding by its “commitments, so the crossing point was shut down."" He did not elaborate. 

            Siddiq advised Afghans to avoid traveling to the border crossing, located on Afghanistan's side in the country's eastern Nangarhar province, until further notice. 

            Cross-border fire and shootouts are common along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Each side has in the past closed Torkham, and also the Chaman border crossing in southwestern Pakistan, for a multitude of reasons. Both crossings are vital for landlocked Afghanistan for trade and travel. 

            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were withdrawing from the country after 20 years of war. Like the rest of the world, Pakistan has so far not recognized Afghanistan’s Taliban government. The international community has been wary of the Taliban's harsh measures, imposed since their takeover, especially in restricting the rights of women and minorities.

            Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since November, when the Pakistani Taliban ended a monthslong cease-fire with the government. The Pakistani Taliban — the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP — is a separate militant group but allied with the Afghan Taliban. 

            Islamabad has demanded the Afghan Taliban stop offering sanctuary to Pakistani militants and prevent the launching of cross-border attack on Pakistan.

            Since the Taliban takeover, the government in Islamabad has allowed critically ill or injured Afghans to enter Pakistan for medical treatment along with a limited number of caretakers.

They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss border issues.Khalid Khan, a local Pakistani police official, confirmed the border closure and what he described as intermittent exchanges of fire at Torkham, located in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan's military and the Foreign Ministry made no immediate comments.Mullah Mohammad Siddiq, a Taliban-appointed commissioner at Torkham, said Pakistan has not been abiding by its “commitments, so the crossing point was shut down."" He did not elaborate.Siddiq advised Afghans to avoid traveling to the border crossing, located on Afghanistan's side in the country's eastern Nangarhar province, until further notice.Cross-border fire and shootouts are common along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Each side has in the past closed Torkham, and also the Chaman border crossing in southwestern Pakistan, for a multitude of reasons. Both crossings are vital for landlocked Afghanistan for trade and travel.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were withdrawing from the country after 20 years of war.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815822,5 security tips to avoid malware on the internet in 2023,"OctaFX security experts describe the most common types of malware that can infect your device and how to avoid it with five security steps.

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 20 February 2023 - According to AV-Test Institute, an independent supplier of IT security services, there are more than  1.2 billion pieces of malware online in 2023. Every day, the organisation detects 450,000 new malware programs and potentially unwanted applications. Various scammers and hackers use such programs to steal money, sensitive information, or even use your online identity for their benefit. You can protect yourself by learning about malware and the ways to avoid it from this OctaFX guide.            Types of malware   While the internet contains more than a billion different pieces of malware, there are several common types of it to be aware of. Those include:     Ransomware. This type of malware blocks access to your computer or the data stored on it until a ransom is paid. The data is usually encrypted, and any attempts to bypass the blocking might lead to the loss of it entirely. However, there is no guarantee that hackers will decrypt the data or that you will receive the correct decryption key once the ransom is paid.     Spyware. Such malware is used to collect information about users without their knowledge or consent. Spyware programs try to steal credentials and payment information, often by capturing keystrokes.     Adware. This software is in some way similar to spyware. Although it does not intend to steal your credentials, it gathers information about your web activity, interests, friends, places you live in or travel to, and then sell such a 'profile' to advertisers. In some cases, adware automatically downloads or displays advertisements to you.     Trojan. Trojans are usually disguised as a piece of software that users might want to download for free, such as pirated games, apps, programs, and services. When launched, a trojan takes over the system and either harms the computer or steals sensitive information.     Worm. This malicious program will exploit vulnerabilities in programs and operating systems to install itself into networks. Once there, it will not only steal sensitive information, but may also be used by hackers to launch DDoS attacks, ransomware attacks, and copy itself to other computers on the network.     Virus. Like worms, viruses may steal sensitive information and launch various cyberattacks. However, a virus is always part of some app and cannot execute or infect other computers on the network unless the host program is running.        Five security tips to avoid malware in 2023   Whichever of the above malware programs it is, you don't want it on your computer. Apart from stealing your personal information and harming your device, various malware might hit other computers on the network. This can be particularly disastrous if it's the work network, as it might lead to a huge data leak affecting your company and your clients. Here are five security tips from OctaFX that will help you avoid malware online:       Use antivirus software. Installing antivirus software on your computer will greatly reduce the risk of downloading and running malware. Scan USB drives and everything you download from unknown sources for malware.     Avoid pirated apps and software. Such free-of-charge files might contain unwanted bonuses, such as trojans and viruses, that can seriously harm your computer and steal your personal information.     Be careful when opening suspicious emails. Never download and open any files that come from unknown email addresses. Email attachments might contain pieces of malware, even if the file names do not seem to pose a threat.     Install the latest software updates. They usually contain important security patches that make it harder for malware to exploit their vulnerabilities.     Backup your data. This way, even if a malware program blocks your computer and encrypts your data, you will be able to restore it after the malware is deleted.        Cyber criminals invent thousands of new malware programs each day. While the tips above may not give you complete protection against them, they will significantly reduce the risks of getting malware in the first place.  Hashtag: #OctaFX

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815833,Man in eastern Taiwan acquitted of letting geese out to ‘scare people’,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taitung District Court judges recently found a man accused of allowing geese he raised to roam around the neighborhood and scare people not guilty, ruling that ordinary people usually are not scared at the sight of a gaggle of geese.A man surnamed Yen (顏) filed a complaint with the police, alleging that the owner of the geese surnamed Chien (簡) raised the animals cage-free in front of his home and allowed them to run around on the roads, CNA reported. Yen said when he passed the area on his way home on the morning of Jan. 9, the geese attacked and injured him, causing him to feel scared.Police referred Chien to the prosecutor’s office on suspicion of encouraging or allowing animals to scare people, which is prohibited by Article 70 of the Social Order Maintenance Act and punishable by detention of not more than three days or a fine of not more than NT$12,000 (US$396).

The Taitung District Court acquitted him of all charges, ruling that geese are not quick in their movements and will extend their necks before they launch attacks and that they do not make unpleasant sounds to scare people.Even though geese can chase and even injure people, people are usually not afraid of them because of their cute appearance, the court said.According to the ruling, even though the behavior of allowing animals to roam around is inappropriate, roaming animals do not necessarily have frightening behavior or pose a risk to people, per CNA.",2023/02/20,1368,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815842,Putin's Ukraine gamble seen as biggest threat to his rule,"Vladimir Putin says he learned from his boyhood brawls in his native St. Petersburg: “If you want to win a fight, you have to carry it through to the end, as if it were the most decisive battle of your life.”

            That lesson, cited in the most recent biography of the Russian president, seems to be guiding him as his invasion of Ukraine suffers setbacks and stalemates. The Kremlin strongman, who started the war on Feb. 24, 2022, and could end it in a minute, appears to be determined to prevail, ruthlessly and at all costs.

            Stoking his countrymen this month on the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad that turned around Moscow's fortunes in World War II, he said: “The willingness to go beyond for the sake of the Motherland and the truth, to do the impossible, has always been and remains in the blood, in the character of our multiethnic people.”











            But so far, Putin’s gamble in invading his smaller and weaker neighbor seems to have backfired spectacularly and created the biggest threat to his more than two-decade-long rule.

            HISTORY AND MODERN ROADBLOCKS

            He began the “special military operation” in the name of Ukraine's demilitarization and “denazification,” seeking to protect ethnic Russians, prevent Kyiv's NATO membership and to keep it in Russia’s “sphere of influence.” While he claims Ukraine and the West provoked the invasion, they say just the opposite — that it was an illegal and brazen act of aggression against a country with a democratically elected government and a Jewish president whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust.

            Putin laid the foundation for the invasion with a 5,000-word essay in 2021, in which he questioned Ukraine's legitimacy as a nation. That was only the latest chapter in a long obsession with the country and a determination to correct what he believes was a historical mistake of letting it slip from Moscow's orbit. He reached back three centuries, to Peter the Great, to support his quest to reconquer rightful Russian territory.

            But rectifying history soon hit modern roadblocks.

            “Literally everything that he set out to do has gone disastrously wrong,” said British journalist Philip Short, who published his biography, “Putin,” last year.

            Despite armed interventions in Chechnya, Syria and Georgia, Putin overestimated his military and underestimated Ukrainian resistance and Western support. Russian media try to boost his authority with images of a bare-chested Putin riding a horse, shooting at a military firing range and dressing down government officials on TV, but the war has exposed his shortcomings and the weakness of his military, intelligence services and some economic sectors.

            Ukrainian forces have liberated more than half the territory Russia seized. The war has killed tens of thousands on both sides, caused widespread destruction, and induced not only Ukraine but Sweden and Finland to seek NATO membership. It has increased the security threat to Russia and scuttled decades of Russia's integration with the West, bringing international isolation.

            Increasingly, Putin seems to be improvising in a conflict much longer and more difficult than he expected. For example, he's threatened to use nuclear weapons, then backed off. The strategy is familiar from his lifelong passion, judo: “You must be flexible. Sometimes you can give way to others if that is the way leading to victory,” Putin recounted in flattering 2015-17 interviews with American director Oliver Stone.

            In Putin’s view, an aggressive West wants to crush Russia. His narrative, along with increasingly repressive measures to stifle domestic dissent, has galvanized patriotic support among many of his countrymen. But it runs up against an inefficient, top-down power structure inherited from the Soviet Union, against the interconnected world’s porous borders, and against the sacrifices Russians are suffering firsthand.

            AN ERRATIC BUT DETERMINED LEADER

            In interviews with The Associated Press, Short, other analysts and a former Kremlin insider describe the 70-year-old Putin as an erratic, weakened leader, rigid and outdated in his thinking, who overreached and is in denial about the difficulties.

            They say he seems concerned about waning, though still strong, domestic public opinion — albeit from unreliable polls. Mostly isolated due to COVID-19 concerns and his personal security, Putin speaks with a small set of advisers, but they appear reluctant to provide honest assessments. 

            Observers see a long, grinding war that Putin is determined to win, with his way out hard to predict.

            “It’s not Putin that rules Russia. It’s circumstances which rule Putin,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

            Short believes the Kremlin leader “has painted himself into a corner. … He will be looking for ways to push ahead, but I don’t think he’s found them."" Giving up is unlikely, Short said, recalling that “his character was always to double down and fight harder.”

            Fiona Hill, who served in the past three U.S. administrations and is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, believes Putin wanted to win quickly in Ukraine, install a new president in Kyiv and force it to join Belarus in a Slavic union with Russia. A successor would run Russia, she said, with Putin elevating himself to lead the larger alliance.

            But now, according to Stanovaya, “It feels like there is not any hopes that the conflict can be solved any other way than militarily. And this is scary.”

            WHAT'S AHEAD

            Analysts see several scenarios for Putin, depending on battlefield developments. The scenarios, not mutually exclusive, range from what could be his biggest nightmare — a coup or uprisings like those he saw as a KGB agent in East Germany in 1989, in the USSR in 1991 or Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 — to winning reelection next year. That would extend what is already the longest rule of any Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin.

            Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst and professor at Free University in Riga, Latvia, said Putin could revise his goals in Ukraine, declaring he achieved them by establishing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea and taking over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. Then he could announce, ""We punished them. We showed them who is the boss in the house. We have defeated all NATO countries,"" Oreshkin added.

            But Kyiv has shown no willingness to cede territory, and for Putin to sell this as a victory, Orsehkin believes “he needs to convince himself that he defeated Ukraine. And he understands better than anyone that, in fact, he lost.”

            As military setbacks mount, Russians are withdrawing morally and psychologically, and thinking, “Yes, we see that something is wrong in the war, but we do not want to know,” according to Oreshkin.

            Such tuning out, along with economic hardships, could blow back on Putin, he said, perhaps this spring, as Russians ask, ""You promised victory, so where is it?”

            Former Putin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov said the Russian president doesn’t admit mistakes or defeats, and “desperately needs a victory just to prove the point that he’s a strongman.”

            Even some in the military are turning critical, he said.

            “When he becomes hated by more than half — and we’re driving in this direction — the chances for a coup, elite coup, military coup, will increase,” Gallyamov said, giving a timeline of 2024 ""plus a couple of years.”

            Stanovaya and Short believe no uprising is imminent.

            “Even if people are suffering, and they can be discontented and angry, there is no way to make it political,” Stanovaya said.

            Gallyamov sees a way out for Putin if he can gain recognition of “new territories, plus a declaration of NATO that it stops expansion, for example, or Ukrainian introduction into their constitution of their neutral status ... or their declaration that Russian will be the second official language.”

            DEATH OR SUCCESSION

            Another possibility is Putin dying in office, but CIA Director William Burns is skeptical.

            “There are lots of rumors about President Putin’s health, and as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy,” Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado in July.

            Short said Putin has established such tight security controls and rival power centers that he's more likely to suffer ""a totally unanticipated heart attack than to be overthrown by the people around him.”

            He and Hill believe Putin will eventually look for a successor. Gallyamov lists “technocrats” such as Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin as possibilities. Hill said Dmitry Medvedev, whom Putin tapped as president from 2008 to 2012, “seems to be auditioning for that role again.” 

            For the moment, Putin remains very much in charge. In his authorized 2000 biography, he noted: “There are always a lot of mistakes made in war. ... You have to take a pragmatic attitude. And you have to keep thinking of victory.”

            When a reporter asked him in December if his “special military operation” in Ukraine has been taking too long, Putin replied with a Russian idiom about big goals being achieved incrementally: “The hen pecks grain by grain.”

The satellite will weigh about 12 kilograms, look a bit “like a backpack”, and will be capable of completing a full earth orbit at an altitude of 550 kilometers 15 times each day, according to Foxconn researchers.The initiative is a collaboration between Foxconn’s communications research center and Taoyuan’s National Central University. The researchers also said Foxconn will be collaborating with others on the initiative, but that details about this will be announced at a later date.The race to deploy low earth orbit satellites for communications purposes has been heating up recently, as advances in technology bring the world closer to realizing connectivity for a third of the planet’s population that is still offline.The European Union recently announced plans for €6 billion (nearly NT$195 billion) in funding for a new LEO satellite system, and Space X’s Starlink has deployed nearly 2000 satellites and applied for licenses for more than 40,000.",2023/02/20,1991,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815909,Taiwan’s Baishatun Matsu completes pilgrimage,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — One of Taiwan’s most famous folk traditions concluded Tuesday (Feb. 20) with the Baishatun Matsu pilgrimage finishing a nine-day trip to Yunlin’s Beigang Chaotian Temple.This particular Matsu procession does not proceed according to a predetermined path, but rather follows Matsu’s will as divined by temple authorities, including daily departure and rest times. The only fixed destination is the Beigang Chaotian Temple, which is also the turnaround point, according to LTN.For the final leg of the trip, devotees set up street side tables with incense awaiting the arrival of the pink palanquin which carried Baishatun Matsu. Fireworks went off as the procession passed, most underfoot though some were hoisted high in the air, making the scene lively and noisy.As Baishatun Matsu returned to its home temple in Miaoli County’s Tongxiao Township, both northbound and southbound traffic on Provincial Highway 1 was slowed as passersby observed the sight of both locals and visitors coming to town to witness the end of the pilgrimage.Pilgrims block traffic on Provincial Highway 1. (CNA photo)Taichung City Government Police Bureau strengthened traffic control to account for the large number of pilgrims accompanying Baishatun Matsu. Even a mobile app, Baishatun 2023, could be used to determine the exact location of the procession and potential disruption of traffic.One famous participant in the pilgrimage was Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲). Members of his staff filmed him as he completed the nine-day trip. He joked that Taiwan is a happy place when there is no election taking place.Ko said he was glad not to buy any food or drink during the pilgrimage, simply relying upon strangers who gave regardless of party affiliation. He says the pilgrimage has inspired him to get back to work as he did not keep up with world affairs for the nine days, according to UDN.Despite walking 300 km of the pilgrimage route, Ko says he did not lose any weight because of all the free, delicious food he was offered. As for what he has learned, he says he will try to keep a “clear and simple heart when encountering complex matters,” and has renewed belief in the old adage “be good at heart, and do your best.”",2023/02/20,810,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815929,Taiwan's P.League may ban cheerleaders' sexy moves meant to distract Jeremy Lin,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Efforts of cheerleaders by the opposing team to distract Jeremy Lin (林書豪) at the free throw line with allegedly obscene movements during a P.League+ (PLG) over the weekend has drawn calls for such tactics to be banned for being indecent.During a game between Lin's Kaohsiung 17Live Steelers and the Formosa Taishin Dreamers on Saturday (Feb. 18), members of the cheerleading team, known as Formosa Sexy, tried to distract Steelers players such as Lin during free throws. During the live-video broadcast, they could be seen making provocative movements in schoolgirl uniforms with short skirts while shouting opposing players' names.In the fourth quarter, while Lin was at the line, the camera cut to the cheerleaders, three of whom could be seen shaking their skirts with their backs turned to Lin. One of the cheerleaders could be seen spanking two of her teammate's buttocks with a rolled-up placard.Cheerleaders trying to distract Lin. (YouTube, P.League+ screenshot)Lin seemed unfazed and sank both free throws. Most of Lin's 16 points scored that night were at the line, where he went 9 for 11. However, his performance was not enough as his team lost 102 to 91.The actions by the cheerleaders drew criticism on the popular online forum PTT, where the author of one post called for the PLG to expressly prohibit cheerleaders from interfering with free throws. The user argued that given that the league is meant for families, such behavior is inappropriate for children and questioned what kind of example this sets for up-and-coming cheerleaders.Next Apple reported that the PLG may discuss the matter this week. The league reportedly admonished cheerleaders to not interfere with the free throws of opposing players with such ""excessive behavior.""",2023/02/20,19083,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815998,Biden in Kyiv to show solidarity as Ukraine war nears 1 year,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit Monday to Ukraine to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a gesture of solidarity that comes days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the country.Biden delivered remarks and met with Zelensky at Mariinsky Palace to announce an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance and to reassure Ukraine of American and allied support as the conflict continues.The U.S. leader recalled the fears nearly a year ago that Russia’s invasion forces might quickly take the Ukrainian capital. “One year later, Kyiv stands,” Biden said, jamming his finger for emphasis on his stand decorated with the U.S. and Ukrainian flags. “Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.”The Ukraine visit comes at a crucial moment in the war as Biden looks to keep allies unified in their support for Ukraine as the war is expected to intensify with both sides preparing for spring offensives. Zelenskyy is pressing allies to speed up delivery of pledged weapon systems and is calling on the West to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine — something that Biden to date has declined to do.Zelenskyy said he and Biden spoke about “long range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn’t supplied before.” But he did not detail any new commitments.Biden’s mission with his visit to Kyiv — and then Warsaw — is to underscore that the United States is prepared to stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” to repel Russian forces even as public opinion polling suggests that U.S. and allied support for providing weaponry and direct economic assistance has started to soften. For Zelenskyy, the symbolism of having the U.S. president stand side by side with him on Ukrainian land as the anniversary nears is no small thing as he prods the U.S. and European allies to provide more advanced weaponry and to step up the pace of delivery.“I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said.The visit also gives Biden an opportunity to get a firsthand look at the devastation the Russian invasion has caused on Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians have been killed, millions of refugees have fled the war, and Ukraine has suffered tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure damage.The trip also marks an act of defiance against Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had hoped his military would swiftly overrun Kyiv within days. A year later, the Ukrainian capital stands and a semblance of normalcy has returned to the city as the fighting has concentrated in the country’s east, punctuated by cruise missile and drone attacks against military and civilian infrastructure.Biden, a Democrat, also got a short firsthand taste of the terror that Ukrainians have lived with for close to a year, as air raids sirens howled over the capital just as he and Zelenskyy were exiting the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral, which they visited together. Looking solemn, they continued unperturbed as they laid a wreath and held a moment of silence at the Wall of Remembrance honoring Ukrainian soldiers killed since 2014.Though Western surface-to-air missile systems have bolstered Ukraine’s defensives, the visit marked the rare occasion where a U.S. president has traveled to a conflict zone where the U.S. or its allies did not have control over the airspace. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the U.S. had given advance notice of the trip to Moscow to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict.The U.S. military does not have a presence in Ukraine other than a small detachment of Marines guarding the embassy in Kyiv, making Biden’s visit more complicated than other recent visits by prior U.S. leaders to war zones.Speculation has been building for weeks that Biden would pay a visit to Ukraine around the Feb. 24 anniversary of the Russian invasion. But the White House repeatedly had said that no presidential trip to Ukraine was planned, even after the Poland visit was announced earlier this month.Since early morning on Monday many main streets and central blocks in Kyiv were cordoned without any official explanation. Later people started sharing videos of long motorcades of cars driving along the streets where the access was restricted.At the White House, planning for Biden’s visit to Kyiv was tightly held — with a relatively small group of aides briefed on the plans — because of security concerns.Asked by a reporter on Friday if Biden might include stops beyond Poland, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby replied, “Right now, the trip is going to be in Warsaw.” Moments later — and without prompting — Kirby added, “I said ‘right now.’ The trip will be in -- to Warsaw. I didn’t want to make it sound like I was alluding to a change to it.Biden quietly departed from Joint Base Andrews near Washington shortly after 4 a.m. on Sunday, making a stop at Ramstein Air Base in Germany before making his way into Ukraine.Other western leaders have made the trip to Kyiv since the start of the war.In June, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and then Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi traveled together by night train to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Kyiv in November shortly after taking office.This is Biden’s first visit to a war zone as president. His recent predecessors, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, made surprise visits to Afghanistan and Iraq during their presidencies to meet with U.S. troops and those countries’ leaders.",2023/02/20,129,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815999,Champions League greats Liverpool and Real Madrid collide,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — With 20 Champions League titles between them, Liverpool vs. Real Madrid is a meeting of two European soccer greats.

            Their round-of-16 match at Anfield on Tuesday is also a repeat of last year's final in Paris, which saw Madrid win the competition for a record-extending 14th time after producing a series of improbable comebacks just to make it to the European showpiece at the Stade de France. 

            “I still shake my head and scratch my head,"" said former England coach and BT Sport analyst Glenn Hoddle. ""I covered every one of those games and I still don’t know how they won it. They were out.” 











            Madrid secured come-from-behind wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in each of the knockout rounds before beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final.

            “They were like a boxer, they were up against the ropes and they were halfway down the ropes and you’re thinking the ref’s going to step in and stop the bout,"" Hoddle said. “I don’t know what happened, they just kept going. And they had that quality.”

            Where the Champions League is concerned anything seems possible for Madrid, which won the trophy three years in a row from 2016-18 at a time when Barcelona was dominating the Spanish title.

            But if any team can rival Madrid's ability to produce the unexpected in European club soccer’s most prized competition, it is Liverpool.

            There was the famous comeback from 3-0 down against AC Milan in the 2005 final before going on to win on penalties. And more recently the 4-3 aggregate win against Barcelona in the semifinals in 2019 after losing 3-0 in the first leg at the Nou Camp.

            Madrid, however, has felt like a step too far ever since the draw was made last November.

            After all, this is a Liverpool team that faces a fight just to qualify for next season’s competition, let alone win it this year. 

            Jurgen Klopp has struggled to get his team firing after the departure of key forward Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich last summer and a host of injuries. 

            Ahead of the first-leg match at Anfield, Klopp can at least be encouraged by a recent upturn in form after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League and goals from misfiring forwards Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez.

            Suddenly Liverpool looks in contention again for a Champions League-qualifying spot, sitting seven points off fourth place Tottenham with two games in hand. 

            Then there is the Anfield factor, with an atmosphere that saw Barcelona wilt in that semifinals comeback and Manchester City repeatedly fall despite dominating English soccer in recent years.

            Like Madrid's fans, the Liverpool crowd believes nothing is beyond their team when it comes to Europe after winning the trophy six times. 

            Joe Cole played for and against Liverpool and was part of a Chelsea team that lost in the semifinals at Anfield in 2005 and 2007. 

            “It’s a huge club. It's as big a club in world football as any and it’s got an expectancy and the fans drive it,” said the BT Sport analyst. “In the ground they turn up for their team. It’s a sight to behold to play for or against them.”

            But Cole questions whether Liverpool can overcome this Madrid team, which recently won the Club World Cup. 

            “They’ve got a job on their hands,” Cole said. “This Real Madrid team is actually better than the team that won it last year, I believe. They’ve improved. The young players coming through are going to be better and the older players are still doing it.”

            Madrid also beat Liverpool in the final of 2018 and won when the sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816000,"Turkey rejects links between NATO expansion, F-16 deal","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called for Sweden and Finland to be accepted into NATO “as quickly as possible,” although his Turkish counterpart dismissed the possibility of any link between their accession and Turkey’s request for F-16 fighter jets.

            Turkey has delayed the Nordic countries admission to the trans-Atlantic defense alliance, citing concerns over terrorism. Meanwhile, members of the U.S. Congress have tied approval of the F-16 deal to Ankara retracting its opposition to the NATO enlargement.

            “We’re confident that NATO will formally welcome them in soon,” Blinken told a joint news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara. “And when that happens, it will enhance the security of every NATO member, including the United States, including Turkey.""











            Cavusoglu repeated Turkey’s position that it would be willing to approve Finland joining NATO before Sweden. Turkey has complained about what it sees as Stockholm’s tolerance of support for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a 39-year insurgency against Ankara.

            “Unfortunately PKK supporters are still present in Sweden,” he said. “They are recruiting people and they are financing terror acts and they are carrying out terror propaganda in Sweden … because they don’t want Sweden to become a NATO member.”

            While acknowledging that Sweden had made constitutional changes in a bid to satisfy Turkey’s demands, he said that more needed to be done to “convince our parliament and people.”

            Ankara has also been angered by Sweden allowing protests against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and not preventing an anti-Islam activist from burning the Quran, the Muslim holy book, in a separate, solitary protest.

            Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday he remained “convinced that (Sweden and Finland) will join together.” He added: “Ultimately, it is a Turkish decision to decide on ratification, that has not changed.”

            In Ankara, Cavusoglu made clear his country objects to the sale of F-16 jets being tied to ratifying the NATO membership of Sweden and Finland which must be agreed by all 30 members of the alliance. Only the parliaments of Turkey and Hungary have yet to give consent.

            “It would not be right or fair to make two independent issues — the two countries’ NATO membership and the purchase of F-16s — conditional on each other,” Cavusoglu said.

            “It would not be possible for us to purchase the F-16s under these conditions.”

            Ankara has been seeking to upgrade its F-16 fleet after it was kicked off the project to develop the next-generation F-35 fighter following its acquisition of Russian air defense missiles.

            Underlining the U.S. administration’s support for the F-16 deal, Blinken said it was “very important for ongoing NATO interoperability and in the national interest of the United States.”

            Blinken also commented on reports that China is considering military support for Russia in its war in Ukraine.

            “We are concerned that China is considering supporting Russia’s war effort in Ukraine with lethal assistance, something that we are watching very, very closely,” he said.

            Reiterating that there would be “real consequences… were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia” or help Moscow evade sanctions in a “systematic way,” he said there was a “real concern that China is considering doing just that.”

            While not explaining these consequences, Blinken added that other countries, not just the U.S., would take similar action.

            Blinken was in Turkey for the first time since he was appointed two years ago. The trip comes after the country and neighboring Syria were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6 that has left nearly 45,000 dead.

            He met with U.S. and Turkish military personnel and aid workers at Incirlik Air Base near Adana on Sunday. They have been working to provide vital aid and assistance to the disaster zone. Blinken promised a further $100 million in aid to help Turkey and Syria on top of the $85 million that U.S. President Joe Biden announced for Turkey and Syria days after the earthquake.

            The U.S. secretary of state said that Washington had acted “within hours” of the disaster and had so far sent hundreds of personnel and relief supplies.

            But he said that ordinary Americans had also responded to “heartbreaking” images from the quake zone.

            “We have nearly $80 million in donations from the private sector in the United States, (from) individuals. When I visited the Turkish Embassy in Washington, I almost couldn’t get in the front door because boxes were piled high throughout the driveway to the embassy,"" Blinken said.

            “Turkey faces a long road ahead to support those rendered homeless and to rebuild … and we’re committed to providing support.”

            Cavusoglu welcomed U.S. support in the aftermath of the quake.

            “I would like to thank them for not leaving us alone during these challenging times,” he said.

            On Sunday, Blinken took a helicopter tour with Cavusoglu of Hatay, one of the provinces worst hit by the earthquake.

            “It’s hard to put into words,” Blinken said Monday. “Countless buildings, communities, streets, damaged or fully destroyed.”

            Incirlik, home to the U.S. Air Force’s 39th Air Base Wing, has been a crucial logistics center for aid distribution. Supplies from around the world have been flown into the base and sent by truck and helicopter to those in need, including in difficult to reach villages.

            Describing his meeting with U.S. aid officials and military at the base, as well as search and rescue teams “from Los Angeles to Fairfax County in Virginia,” Blinken added: “All of them have seen the staggering toll of this catastrophe. All of them are committed to being there for our friends in this moment.”

            Blinken also held a private meeting with President Erdogan before flying on to Athens late Monday. He had a brief meeting there with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and was to dine with him later. Blinken is due to meet with other officials in the Greek capital Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816001,Israel's Netanyahu advances judicial changes despite uproar,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel’s government on Monday was pressing ahead with a contentious plan to overhaul the country’s legal system, despite an unprecedented uproar that has included mass protests, warnings from military and business leaders and calls for restraint by the United States.Thousands of demonstrators were expected to gather outside the parliament, or Knesset, for a second straight week to rally against the plan as lawmakers prepared to hold an initial vote.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies, a collection of ultra-religious and ultranationalist lawmakers, say the plan is meant to fix a system that has given the courts and government legal advisers too much say in how legislation is crafted and decisions are made. Critics say it will upend the country’s system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the prime minister. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for a series of corruption charges, has a conflict of interest.The standoff has plunged Israel into one of its greatest domestic crises, sharpening a divide between Israelis over the character of their state and the values they believe should guide it.Monday’s vote on part of the legislation is just the first of three readings required for parliamentary approval. While that process is expected to take months, the vote is a sign of the coalition’s determination to barrel ahead and seen by many as an act of bad faith.Israel’s figurehead president has urged the government to freeze the legislation and seek a compromise with the opposition. Leaders in the booming tech sector have warned that weakening the judiciary could drive away investors. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been protesting in Tel Aviv and other cities each week.Last week, some 100,000 people demonstrated outside the Knesset as a committee granted initial approval to the plan. It was the largest protest in the city in years.On Monday, protesters launched a sit-down protest at the entrance of the homes of some coalition lawmakers and briefly halted traffic on Tel Aviv's main highway. Ahead of the main demonstration in Jerusalem, hundreds were waving Israeli flags and protesting in Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa, holding signs reading “resistance is mandatory.”“We’re here to demonstrate for the democracy. Without democracy there’s no state of Israel. And we’re going to fight till the end,” said Marcos Fainstein, a protester in Tel Aviv.The overhaul has prompted otherwise stoic former security chiefs to speak out, and even warn of civil war. In a sign of the rising emotions, a group of army veterans in their 60s and 70s stole a decommissioned tank from a war memorial site and draped it with Israel’s declaration of independence before being stopped by police.The plan has even sparked rare warnings from the U.S., Israel’s chief international ally.U.S. Ambassador Tom Nides told a podcast over the weekend that Israel should “pump the brakes” on the legislation and seek a consensus on reform that would protect Israel’s democratic institutions.His comments drew angry responses from Netanyahu allies, telling Nides to stay out of Israel’s internal affairs.Speaking to his Cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu dismissed suggestions that Israel’s democracy was under threat. “Israel was and will remain a strong and vibrant democracy,” he said.While Israel has long boasted of its democratic credentials, critics say that claim is tainted by the country’s West Bank occupation and the treatment of its own Palestinian minority.Israel’s Palestinian citizens — a minority that may have the most to lose by the legal overhaul — have largely sat out the protests, in part because of discrimination they suffer at home and because of Israel’s 55-year military occupation over their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank. Jewish settlers in the West Bank can vote in Israeli elections and are generally protected by Israeli laws, while Palestinians in the same territory are subject to military rule and cannot vote.Monday’s parliamentary votes seek to grant the government more power over who becomes a judge. Today, a selection committee is made up of politicians, judges and lawyers — a system that proponents say promotes consensus.The new system would give coalition lawmakers control over the appointments. Critics fear that judges will be appointed based on their loyalty to the government or prime minister.“This is dramatic,” said Yaniv Roznai, co-director of the Rubinstein Center for Constitutional Challenges at Reichman University north of Tel Aviv. “If you take control of the court, then it’s all over. You can make any change you want.”A second change would bar the Supreme Court from overturning what are known as “basic laws,” pieces of legislation that stand in for a constitution, which Israel does not have. Critics say that legislators will be able to dub any law a basic law, removing judicial oversight over controversial legislation.Also planned are proposals that would give parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings and control the appointment of government legal advisers. The advisers currently are professional civil servants, and critics say the new system would politicize government ministries.Critics also fear the overhaul will grant Netanyahu an escape route from his legal woes. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a biased judicial system on a witch hunt against him.Israel’s attorney general has barred Netanyahu from any involvement in the overhaul, saying his legal troubles create a conflict of interest. Instead, his justice minister, a close confidant, is leading the charge. On Sunday, Netanyahu called the restrictions on him “patently ridiculous.”Recent polls show that most Israelis, including many Netanyahu supporters, support halting the legislation and moving forward through consensus.",2023/02/20,109,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816017,"Record 6,542 guns intercepted at US airport security in '22","ATLANTA (AP) — The woman flying out of Philadelphia’s airport last year remembered to pack snacks, prescription medicine and a cellphone in her handbag. But what was more important was what she forgot to unpack: a loaded .380-caliber handgun in a black holster.The weapon was one of the 6,542 guns the Transportation Security Administration intercepted last year at airport checkpoints across the country. The number — roughly 18 per day — was an all-time high for guns intercepted at U.S. airports, and is sparking concern at a time when more Americans are armed.“What we see in our checkpoints really reflects what we’re seeing in society, and in society there are more people carrying firearms nowadays,” TSA administrator David Pekoske said.With the exception of pandemic-disrupted 2020, the number of weapons intercepted at airport checkpoints has climbed every year since 2010. Experts don't think this is an epidemic of would-be hijackers — nearly everyone caught claims to have forgotten they had a gun with them — but they emphasize the danger even one gun can pose in the wrong hands on a plane or at a checkpoint.Guns have been intercepted literally from Burbank, California, to Bangor, Maine. But it tends to happen more at bigger airports in areas with laws more friendly to carrying a gun, Pekoske said. The top 10 list for gun interceptions in 2022 includes Dallas, Austin and Houston in Texas; three airports in Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta; Phoenix; and Denver.Pekoske isn't sure the “I forgot” excuse is always true or whether it's a natural reaction to getting caught. Regardless, he said, it’s a problem that must stop.When TSA staffers see what they believe to be a weapon on the X-ray machine, they usually stop the belt so the bag stays inside the machine and the passenger can’t get to it. Then they call in local police.Repercussions vary depending on local and state laws. The person may be arrested and have the gun confiscated. But sometimes they’re allowed to give the gun to a companion not flying with them and continue on their way. Unloaded guns can also be placed in checked bags assuming they follow proper procedures. The woman in Philadelphia saw her gun confiscated and was slated to be fined.Those federal fines are the TSA’s tool to punish those who bring a gun to a checkpoint. Last year TSA raised the maximum fine to $14,950 as a deterrent. Passengers also lose their PreCheck status — it allows them to bypass some types of screening — for five years. It used to be three years, but about a year ago the agency increased the time and changed the rules. Passengers may also miss their flight as well as lose their gun. If federal officials can prove the person intended to bring the gun past the checkpoint into what’s called the airport’s sterile area, it's a federal offense.Retired TSA official Keith Jeffries said gun interceptions can also slow other passengers in line.“It’s disruptive no matter what,” Jeffries said. “It’s a dangerous, prohibited item and, let’s face it, you should know where your gun is at, for crying out loud.”Experts and officials say the rise in gun interceptions simply reflects that more Americans are carrying guns.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, tracks FBI data about background checks completed for a firearm sale. The numbers were a little over 7 million in 2000 and about 16.4 million last year. They went even higher during the coronavirus pandemic.For the TSA officers searching for prohibited items, it can be jarring.In Atlanta, Janecia Howard was monitoring the X-ray machine when she realized she was looking at a gun in a passenger’s laptop bag. She immediately flagged it as a “high-threat” item and police were notified.Howard said it felt like her heart dropped, and she was worried the passenger might try to get the gun. It turns out the passenger was a very apologetic businessman who said he simply forgot. Howard says she understands travel can be stressful but that people have to take care when they're getting ready for a flight.“You have to be alert and pay attention,"" she said. “It’s your property.”Atlanta's airport, one of the world's busiest with roughly 85,000 people going through checkpoints on a busy day, had the most guns intercepted in 2022 — 448 — but that number was actually lower than the year before. Robert Spinden, the TSA's top official in Atlanta, says the agency and the airport made a big effort in 2021 to try to address the large number of guns being intercepted at checkpoints.An incident in November 2021 reinforced the need for their efforts. A TSA officer noticed a suspected gun in a passenger’s bag. When the officer opened the suitcase the man reached for the gun, and it went off. People ran for the exits, and the airport was shut down for 2 1/2 hours, the airport's general manager Balram Bheodari said during a congressional hearing last year.Officials put in new signage to catch the attention of gun owners. A hologram over a checkpoint shows the image of a revolving blue gun with a red circle over the gun with a line through it. Numerous 70-inch television screens flash rotating messages that guns are not allowed.“There’s signage all over the airport. There is announcements, holograms, TVs. There’s quite a bit of information that is sort of flashing before your eyes to just try to remind you as a last ditch effort that if you do own a firearm, do you know where it’s at?” Spinden said.Miami's airport also worked to get gunowners' attention. The airport's director told Congress last year that after setting a gun interception record in 2021 they installed high-visibility signage and worked with airlines to warn passengers. He said the number of firearms intercepted declined sharply.Pekoske said signage is only part of the solution. Travelers face a barrage of signs or announcements already and don't always pay attention. He also supports gradually raising penalties to grab people's attention.But Aidan Johnston, from the gun advocacy group Gun Owners of America, said he'd like to see the fines lessened, saying they’re not a deterrent. While he’d like to see more education for new gun owners, he also doesn’t think of this as a “major heinous crime.”“These are not bad people that are in dire need of punishment,” he said. “These are people who made a mistake.”Officials believe they're catching the vast majority, but with 730 million passengers screened last year even a miniscule percentage getting through is a concern.Last month, musician Cliff Waddell was traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, to Raleigh, North Carolina, when he was stopped at the checkpoint. A TSA officer had seen a gun in his bag. Waddell was so shocked he initially said it couldn't be his because he'd just flown the day before with the same bag. It turned out the gun had been in his bag but missed at the screening. TSA acknowledged the miss, and Pekoske says they’re investigating.When trying to figure out how the gun he keeps locked in his glove compartment got in his bookbag, Waddell realized he’d taken it out when he took the vehicle in for repairs. Waddell said he recognizes it's his responsibility to know where his firearm is but worries about how TSA could have missed something so significant.“That was a shock to me,” he said.",2023/02/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816018,"'All Quiet' wins 7 BAFTAs, including best film, at UK awards","LONDON (AP) — Antiwar German movie “All Quiet on the Western Front” won seven prizes, including best picture, at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, building the somber drama’s momentum as awards season rolls toward its climax at next month’s Oscars.Irish tragicomedy “The Banshees of Inisherin” and rock biopic “Elvis” took four prizes each.“All Quiet,” a visceral depiction of life and death in the World War I trenches based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel, won Edward Berger the best director award. Its other trophies included adapted screenplay, cinematography, best score, best sound and best film not in English.Austin Butler was a surprise best actor winner for “Elvis.” Baz Lurhmann’s flamboyant musical also won trophies for casting, costume design and hair and makeup. Cate Blanchett won the best actress prize for orchestral drama “Tár.""Martin McDonagh’s “Banshees,” the bleakly comic story of a friendship gone sour, was named best British film.“Best what award?” joked McDonagh of the film, which was shot in Ireland with a largely Irish cast and crew. It has British funding, and McDonagh was born in Britain to Irish parents.“Banshees” also won for McDonagh’s original screenplay, and awards for Kerry Condon as best supporting actress and Barry Keoghan for best supporting actor.The prizes — officially the EE BAFTA Film Awards — are Britain’s equivalent of Hollywood’s Academy Awards and will be watched closely for hints of who may win at the Oscars on March 12.Madcap metaverse romp “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the Academy Awards front-runner, was the night’s big loser, winning just one prize from its 10 BAFTA nominations, for editing.Actor Richard E. Grant was a suave and self-deprecating host — with support from TV presenter Alison Hammond — for the ceremony at London’s Royal Festival Hall, where the U.K’s movie academy heralded its strides to become more diverse but said there was more to be done.Grant joked in his opening monologue about the infamous altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock at last year’s Oscars.“Nobody on my watch gets slapped tonight,” he said. “Except on the back.”Guests and presenters walking the red carpet on the south bank of the River Thames included Colin Farrell, Ana de Armas, Eddie Redmayne, Brian Cox, Florence Pugh, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cynthia Erivo, Julianne Moore and Lily James.Heir to the throne Prince William, who is president of Britain’s film and television academy, was in the audience alongside his wife, Kate. William wore a tuxedo with black velvet jacket, while Kate dressed in a floor-length Alexander McQueen dress that she also wore to the 2019 BAFTAs.Helen Mirren paid tribute to William’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September. Mirren, who portrayed the late monarch onscreen in “The Queen” and onstage in “The Audience,” called Elizabeth “the nation’s leading lady.”Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.This year there were 11 female directors up for awards across all categories, including documentary and animated films. But just one of the main best-director nominees was female: Gina Prince-Bythewood for “The Woman King.”BAFTA chair Krishnendu Majumdar said the academy's soul-searching had been “a necessary and humbling process.” He said the “vital work of levelling the playing field” would continue.“West Side Story” star Ariana DeBose opened the show by performing “Sisters are Doin’ it for Themselves,” with an added rap shoutout to some of the nominated women, including Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh and Viola Davis.Blanchett said it had been “an extraordinary year for female performers. To be counted among them is really special.”It was a strong year for Irish actors at the BAFTAs, with Deryl McCormack up for the BAFTA Rising Star award — though he lost out to Emma Mackey – and Condon, Keoghan, Farrell and Brendan Gleeson all getting acting nominations for “Banshees.”McCormack hailed the event as “the Irish BAFTAs.”“It is a small country, but to see the talent that comes out of it is quite amazing,” he said.Writer-director Charlotte Wells won the prize for best British debut for the affecting father-daughter drama “Aftersun.” Three-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell became the first costume designer to be awarded the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA fellowship.The harsh world outside showbiz intruded on the awards when Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who works for investigative website Bellingcat, said he was now allowed to attend the awards because of a risk to public security. He features in “Navalny,” a film about jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny that won the best documentary BAFTA.“Navalny” producer Odessa Rae dedicated the award to Grozev, “our Bulgarian nerd with a laptop, who could not be with us tonight because his life is under threat by the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.”Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “Everything Everywhere,” said the chance awards season provides to celebrate cinema was more important than who wins.“It’s a moment of celebration in the midst of everything,” Curtis told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “It’s hard out there. Everywhere. All at once. All the time.”",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816020,Michigan State set to resume classes after fatal shootings,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State University professor Marco Díaz-Muñoz is still haunted by what he witnessed last Monday night, when a gunman entered his classroom in Berkey Hall, killing two of his students in what he describes as “12 minutes of terror.”“Those images haunt me. The images of those two girls,” Díaz-Muñoz told The Associated Press.Arielle Anderson and Alexandria Verner, both juniors, would die that night, Feb. 13. The gunman would shoot six more students during the rampage in two campus buildings. Brian Fraser also would die. Five others would suffer critical gunshot wounds.Classes are resuming Monday at the 50,000-student university, though Berkey Hall, an academic building, will not reopen. Officials said Sunday that swiftly resuming classes makes sense for the 2 1/2-month balance of the spring term.“Coming back together is something that will help us,” said Thomas Jeitschko, executive vice president for academic affairs, adding that faculty will have extensive flexibility in how they run their courses.“We know that everybody heals at their own pace and in their own manner. Getting it exactly right will not be possible,” Jeitschko said at a news conference Sunday. “Coming back into spaces that are familiar, interacting with people who are familiar, is helpful in the process of healing and grieving.”Díaz-Muñoz said the university had offered to have another professor teach through the end of the semester.“On one hand, I want to forget it all. But then on the other hand, I think I need to help my students pick up the pieces,"" Díaz-Muñoz said. “I think I need to help my students build a sense of meaning. It’s not going to be the same as before, but there has to be something good out of it.""Some in the community, however, aren't ready. The editorial board of The State News, the student newspaper, wrote Thursday that they wouldn't immediately attend classes, saying more time was needed to heal.Jo Kovach, president of student government, said “students are scared” and will need “flexibility, empathy and options” from their professors.Following the shooting, parents arrived from all over the state to bring students home, at least for the rest of last week. A petition demanding hybrid or online options for students received more than 20,000 signatures by Saturday.Jeitschko said students will have weeks to decide whether to take a regular grade or a credit/no credit option, which would not affect their overall grade-point average.“Let the semester play out. Come back. Try to heal,” he said.Díaz-Muñoz understands that some students won’t be ready to return, saying that some will still have “the fear of looking over their shoulder and looking out the window, at the doors.”“There are some kids in my class that are graduating this semester. And they need this horrific nightmare to have a better ending than the way it ended on Monday,” Díaz-Muñoz said.Sparrow Hospital said three wounded students remained in critical condition Sunday while one was upgraded to fair and another was listed in serious but stable condition. Interim university President Teresa Woodruff said Michigan State would cover funeral costs and hospital expenses.Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023. In 2022, there were more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive.The shots broke out at Michigan State on Monday during evening classes at Berkey Hall and nearby at the MSU Union, a social hub where students can study, eat and relax. Students across the vast campus were ordered to shelter in place for four hours — “run, hide, fight” if necessary — while police hunted for Anthony McRae, 43, who eventually killed himself when confronted by police not far from his home in Lansing.Police said McRae's mental health could have been a factor, based on a note found on him. He was the lone shooter and had no connection to the victims or to Michigan State as a student or employee, they said.Díaz-Muñoz describes hearing “explosions” outside his class before a masked man appeared in the doorway of Room 114 and opened fire. Students hid behind desks and chairs before breaking windows to escape.After “one to two minutes"" of shooting, the gunman turned around and left, leaving behind “destruction and death in my classroom,” said Díaz-Muñoz.For Díaz-Muñoz, the terror didn’t end as abruptly. The carnage in his classroom was “something you saw in a movie,” he said.Díaz-Muñoz says he has taken prescription medication as a way to force himself to sleep, only emerging from his room “for a bowl of soup.”The assistant professor said that he is sharing his story in hopes of bringing about gun reform.“If the lawmakers and the senators saw what I saw, instead of hearing in the news one more statistic. If they had seen those girls and the pools of blood that I saw, the horror we lived, they would be shamed into action,"" Díaz-Muñoz said.",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816062,Blinken: China's balloon incursion 'must never happen again',"MUNICH (AP) — The top diplomats from the United States and China met on Saturday in the first high-level contact between their countries since the U.S. shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon two weeks ago, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken sending the message that Beijing's surveillance program had been “exposed to the world.”Blinken and Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, held the hourlong talks in Munich, where they were attending an international security conference, according to the U.S. State Department.“I made very clear to him that China sending its surveillance balloon over the United States in violation of our sovereignty, in violation of international law, was unacceptable and must never happen again,"" Blinken said Saturday in an interview for CBS' “Face the Nation.”His spokesman, Ned Price, said in a statement that Blinken also told the Chinese official that his nation's “high-altitude surveillance balloon program — which has intruded into the airspace of over 40 countries across five continents — has been exposed to the world.”Blinken had canceled a trip to Beijing earlier this month due to the balloon incident, which has become a major issue of contention between the two countries. A meeting at the conference in Germany had been widely anticipated.Blinken also told Wang that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, repeating a standard talking point that the Biden administration has provided since it has come into office.“The United States will compete and will unapologetically stand up for our values and interests, but that we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not looking for a new Cold War,"" Price said. Blinken ""underscored the importance of maintaining diplomatic dialogue and open lines of communication at all times.”In addition to the balloon incident, Price said Blinken had reiterated a warning to China on providing assistance to Russia to help with its war against Ukraine, including assisting Moscow with evading sanctions the West has imposed on Russia.“I warned China against providing materiel support to Russia,” Blinken said in a tweet. ""I also emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of communication.”Earlier Saturday, Wang had renewed Beijing's criticism of the United States for shooting down the balloon, arguing that the move did not point to U.S. strength.Beijing insists the white orb shot down off the Carolina coast on Feb. 4 was just an errant civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research that went off course due to winds and had only limited “self-steering” capabilities.Wang, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, repeated that insistence in a speech at the conference and accused the U.S. of violating international legal norms in destroying the object with a missile fired from an U.S. fighter jet.“The actions don’t show that the U.S. is big and strong, but describe the exact opposite,” Wang said.Wang also accused the U.S. of denying China’s economic advances and seeking to impede its further development.“What we hope for from the U.S. is a pragmatic and positive approach to China that allows us to work together,” Wang said.His comments came shortly before an address to the conference by Vice President Kamala Harris, who didn't mention the balloon controversy or respond to Wang's comments. She stressed the importance of upholding the “international rules-based order.”She said Washington is “troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began” in Ukraine and that “looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing and further undermine a rules-based order.”",2023/02/20,165,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816071,EU mulls ways to ramp up ammunition production for Ukraine,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union must find ways to quickly provide thousands of artillery shells to Ukraine or face the prospect of it losing the war against Russia, top EU diplomats warned Monday, as ammunition stocks in national EU armories dwindle.

            “The most important, pressing issue today for the Ukrainian army is to have a continuous flow of ammunition,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before chairing a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers. “If we fail on that, really, the result of the war is in danger.”

            Borrell said that Russian forces are firing about 50,000 rounds of artillery each day and that Ukraine’s supplies must be lifted to the same level. Other estimates suggest that Ukraine is firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells daily, around a third of Russia’s total one year into the war.











            Most sought after, Borrell underlined, are 155mm artillery rounds.

            Debate among the ministers focused on ways to make joint purchases of ammunition and use a special EU fund to provide extra financing. However, the defense industry requires solid, long-term orders to stand up and expand its production lines and cannot simply ramp up supplies overnight.

            “We have to launch procedures to increase the capacity of the European industry to produce more and quicker,” Borrell said, adding that “the best way to provide ammunition to Ukraine is to share the already existing stockpiles of the European armies.”

            “Priority has to be given to the supplies for the Ukrainian army, as much as we can,” he told reporters after the meeting had ended without any formal conclusions being drawn.

            Last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the waiting time for the supply of “large-caliber ammunition has increased from 12 to 28 months,” and that “orders placed today would only be delivered two-and-a-half years later.”

            Estonia, which shares a border and long history with Russia, is driving the EU and its NATO allies to provide 1 million artillery shells, at an estimated cost of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

            “Russia uses daily (what) the European Union produces per month, and in the current military industry capabilities, we can reach the need of Ukraine (in) around six years, so this is fully unacceptable,” Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told reporters.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed to his Western allies to quicken their military support, warning that delays would play into Russia’s hand as the invasion approaches its anniversary on Feb. 24.

            NATO believes that Russia has launched a long-anticipated offensive in recent weeks, raising the intensity of attacks in eastern Ukraine while building up forces in the south. Officials have said that Ukraine is likely to launch its own counteroffensive in the spring.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816072,Russia sells weapons at Abu Dhabi arms fair amid Ukraine war,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Russia offered weapons for sale Monday at a biennial arms fair in the United Arab Emirates, ranging from Kalashnikov assault rifles to missile systems — despite facing sanctions from the West over its war on Ukraine. 

            The arms for sale at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference held in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi underscores how the Gulf Arab federation has sought to embrace Moscow while balancing its ties to the West. 

            As Russia's war on Ukraine approaches its first anniversary on Friday, Russian money continues to flood into Dubai's red-hot real estate market. 











            Daily flights between the Emirates and Moscow provide a lifeline for both those fleeing conscription and the Russian elite. The U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns about the amount of Russian cash flowing into the Arabian Peninsula country.

            The arms fair typically sees the Emiratis host individuals that could be seen as problematic in the West. Former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir came in 2017. Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov, himself now deeply involved in the Ukraine war, attended in 2019 and 2021. 

            This year's event drew Libya's Khalifa Hifter, the commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army who faces a U.S. lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating indiscriminate attacks on civilians and torturing and killing political opponents.

            But while not directly acknowledged, the tendrils of Russia's war on Ukraine could be seen everywhere at the fair Monday. 

            To reach Russia's exhibition tent, those attending the fair had to leave Abu Dhabi's cavernous National Exhibition Center and cross along a skybridge to an outdoor area. 

            Russian officials delayed Associated Press journalists from going inside their tent as an event was going on, initially without explanation. About an hour later, AP journalists saw Denis Manturov, Russia's minister of trade and industry, come out of the tent. 

            Manturov is sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, with London describing him as being “responsible for overseeing the Russian weapons industry and responsible for equipping mobilized troops” in the war on Ukraine. Yet Manturov described the ongoing war as providing advertising for Russian weaponry.

            “Any military action is further accompanied by interest in those products, those weapons that are in demand in a given military conflict,"" he said, according to the Tass news agency. “Therefore, certainly, interest is now high in air defense systems — short-, medium-, and long-range ones.”

            He added: “Each transaction is subject to close scrutiny from our Western colleagues — they are trying to create obstacles; we ensure the security of such deals so that they are as effective as possible and implemented privately.”

            Emirati officials did not directly acknowledge Manturov's presence. 

            Asked about the Russian presence at the arms fair, the U.S. State Department told the AP that “prospective buyers should stand in unity with Ukraine and avoid significant purchases of Russian arms and equipment.”

            “While we regard arms sales and defense cooperation as a sovereign decision for individual states, we have long made clear with allies and partners worldwide our concerns about the revenue for Moscow as well as malign Kremlin influence that comes with continued dependence on arms purchases from Russia,” the State Department said. 

            The UAE hosts thousands of American troops. Manturov visited the Emirates as U.S. President Joe Biden was in Kyiv, Ukraine.

            Inside the Russian tent, a video screen proclaimed the power of Moscow's surface-to-air missile systems, like those now being used to strike cities in Ukraine. Salesmen showed off Kalashnikov assault rifles to Emirati troops. Other model missiles sat on display. 

            Just outside of the tent, Russian helicopters displayed several of its civilian aircraft, flanked by attractive young women in silver flight caps. 

            UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was not seen at the opening, which was attended by his brother, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. However, one Russian magazine at the arms fair printed an English edition that carried photos of Sheikh Mohammed smiling and shaking Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand during an earlier visit to Moscow. 

            In contrast, a giant armed drone by Baykar was parked next to the Russian tent. The Turkish company's Bayraktar drones have played such a key role in Kyiv campaign against Russia there's even a song in Ukrainian about the aircraft. 

            A short walk away, U.S. Army troops showed off a model of a Javelin anti-tank missile, allowing the curious to fire it in a computer simulation. 

            U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Evan Williams of the 2-116th Cavalry Regiment said he and his soldiers had talked to Russian visitors at the fair and others curious about the weapon, which Ukraine has used to deadly effect against Russian armored vehicles. 

            “You've seen people walk by and kind of do a double-take about it,” said Williams of Boise, Idaho. “They come talk to us, ask us questions about it.” 

            The U.S. Army also had a Patriot missile battery on display at the fair. American forces used the battery in combat for the first time in decades in 2022 to help defend Abu Dhabi against an attack by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. 

            Meanwhile, Israel as well had its first full contingent of weapons companies on display, for the first time since the UAE diplomatically recognized the country in 2020. Both Israel and the UAE's leadership have a deep suspicion about Iran's intentions, though the UAE has tried to deescalate with Tehran, which now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. 

            Israeli-Emirati ties have warmed even as Israel continues to build settlements on land the Palestinians want for their future state and as more Israeli-Palestinian violence spikes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816074,Biden declares 'Kyiv stands' in surprise visit to Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Joe Biden swept unannounced into Ukraine on Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a defiant display of Western solidarity with a country still fighting what he called “a brutal and unjust war” days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion.

            “One year later, Kyiv stands,” Biden declared after meeting Zelenskyy at Mariinsky Palace. Jabbing his finger for emphasis on his podium, against a backdrop of three flags from each country, he continued: “And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you.”

            Biden spent more than five hours in the Ukrainian capital, consulting with Zelenskyy on next steps, honoring the country’s fallen soldiers and seeing U.S. embassy staff in the besieged country. Altogether he was on Ukrainian territory for about 23 hours, traveling by train from and back to Poland.











            The visit came at a crucial moment: Biden is trying to keep allies unified in their support for Ukraine as the war is expected to intensify with spring offensives. Zelenskyy is pressing allies to speed up delivery of promised weapon systems and calling on the West to provide fighter jets — something that Biden has declined to do.

            The U.S. president got a taste of the terror that Ukrainians have lived with for close to a year when air raids sirens howled just as he and Zelenskyy wrapped up a visit to the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral.

            Looking solemn, they continued unperturbed as they laid two wreaths and held a moment of silence at the Wall of Remembrance honoring Ukrainian soldiers killed since 2014, the year Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed fighting erupted in eastern Ukraine.

            The White House would not go into specifics, but national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that it notified Moscow of Biden’s visit to Kyiv shortly before his departure from Washington “for deconfliction purposes” in an effort to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict.

            In Kyiv, Biden announced an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance — on top of the more than $50 billion already provided — for shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, air surveillance radars and other aid but no new advanced weaponry.

            Ukraine has also been pushing for battlefield systems that would allow its forces to strike Russian targets that have been moved back from frontline areas, out of the range of HIMARS missiles that have already been delivered. Zelenskyy said he and Biden spoke about “long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn’t supplied before.” But he did not detail any new commitments.

            “Our negotiations were very fruitful,” Zelenskyy added. Sullivan would not detail any potential new capabilities for Ukraine, but said there was a ”good discussion” of the subject.

            Biden’s mission with his visit to Kyiv, which comes before a scheduled trip to Warsaw, Poland, is to underscore that the United States is prepared to stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” to repel Russian forces even as public opinion polling suggests that U.S. and allied support for providing weaponry and direct economic assistance has started to soften. For Zelenskyy, the symbolism of having the U.S. president stand side by side with him on Ukrainian land as the anniversary nears is no small thing as he prods allies to provide more advanced weaponry and step up delivery.

            “I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said.

            Biden’s trip was a brazen rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had hoped his military would swiftly overrun Kyiv within days. Biden, a Democrat, recalled speaking with Zelenskyy on the night of the invasion, saying, “That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv. Perhaps even the end of Ukraine.” 

            A year later, the Ukrainian capital remains firmly in Ukrainian control. Although a semblance of normalcy has returned to the city, regular air raid sirens and frequent missile and killer-drone attacks against military and civilian infrastructure across the country are a near-constant reminder that the war is still raging. The bloodiest fighting is, for the moment, concentrated in the country’s east, particularly around the city of Bakhmut, where Russian offensives are underway.

            At least six civilians have been killed and 17 more have been wounded in Ukraine over the past 24 hours, Ukraine’s presidential office reported. In the eastern Donetsk region, the Russian army was using aviation to strike cities on the front line. A total of 15 cities and villages have been shelled over the past 24 hours, according to the region’s Ukrainian Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. In the northeastern Kharkiv region, cities near the border with Russia came under fire. A missile strike hit Kupiansk, damaging a hospital, a plant and residential buildings.

            “The cost that Ukraine has had to bear has been extraordinarily high,” Biden said. “And the sacrifices have been far too great.” But “Putin’s war of conquest is failing.”

            “He’s counting on us not sticking together,” Biden said. “He thought he could outlast us. I don’t think he’s thinking that right now. God knows what he’s thinking, but I don’t think he’s thinking that. But he’s just been plain wrong. Plain wrong.”

            Signing a guest book at the presidential palace, Biden praised Zelenskky and the Ukrainian people, closing with “Slava Ukraini!” — ”Glory to Ukraine!""

            The trip gave Biden an opportunity to get a firsthand look at the devastation the Russian invasion has caused on Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians have been killed, millions of refugees have fled the war, and Ukraine has suffered tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure damage.

            Biden, wearing a blue suit and at times his signature aviator sunglasses, told Zelenskyy the U.S. will stand with him “for as long as it takes.” Zelenskyy responded in English: “We’ll do it.”

            The Ukrainian leader, wearing a black sweatshirt, as has become his wartime habit, said through an interpreter that Biden’s visit “brings us closer to the victory,” this year, he hoped. He expressed gratitude to Americans and “all those who cherish freedom.”

            It was rare for a U.S. president to travel to a conflict zone where the U.S. or its allies did not have control over the airspace. 

            The U.S. military does not have a presence in Ukraine other than a small detachment of Marines guarding the embassy in Kyiv, making Biden’s visit more complicated than other recent visits by prior U.S. leaders to war zones.

            While Biden was in Ukraine, U.S. surveillance planes, including E-3 Sentry airborne radar and an electronic RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft, were keeping watch over Kyiv from Polish airspace.

            Speculation has been building for weeks that Biden would visit Ukraine around the Feb. 24 anniversary of the Russian invasion. But the White House repeatedly had said that no presidential trip to Ukraine was planned, even after the Poland visit was announced.

            Since early morning on Monday many main streets and central blocks in Kyiv were cordoned off without any official explanation. Later people started sharing videos of long motorcades of cars driving along the streets where the access was restricted.

            At the White House, planning for Biden’s visit to Kyiv was tightly held — with a relatively small group of aides briefed on the plans — because of security concerns. Sullivan said Biden gave final approval for the trip, which had been in the works for months, on Friday during an Oval Office meeting at which he was briefed on security plans for the visit.

            The president traveled with an usually small entourage, with just a few senior aides and two journalists, to maintain secrecy.

            Asked by a reporter on Friday if Biden might include stops beyond Poland, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby replied, “Right now, the trip is going to be in Warsaw.” Moments later — and without prompting — Kirby added, “I said ‘right now.’""

            Biden quietly departed from Joint Base Andrews near Washington at 4:15 a.m. on Sunday, stopping at Ramstein Air Base in Germany before making his way into Ukraine on an overnight train from Poland. He arrived in Kyiv at 8 a.m. on Monday. He departed after 1 p.m. by train back to Poland.

            Until Monday, Biden’s failure to visit was making him something of a standout among Ukraine’s partners in the West, some of whom have made frequent visits to the Ukrainian capital. White House officials had previously cited security concerns with keeping Biden from making the trip, and Sullivan said Monday that the visit was only undertaken once officials believed they had managed the risk to acceptable levels.

            In June, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and then Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi traveled together by night train to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Kyiv in November shortly after taking office.

            This is Biden’s first visit to a war zone as president. His recent predecessors, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, made surprise visits to Afghanistan and Iraq during their presidencies to meet U.S. troops and those countries’ leaders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816098,Bulgaria: 43 migrants found in van days after 18 found dead,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarian police discovered 43 migrants, including ten children, hidden in a van in the west of the country, officials said Monday, just days after authorities found the bodies of 18 migrants concealed in a lumber truck. 

            Prosecutor Natalia Nikolova said the 43 migrants appear to be in good health, despite being squeezed into a tight space. She didn't provide the migrants' nationalities.

            Last week, the bodies of 18 migrants were found suffocated inside a secret compartment under a load of lumber on an abandoned truck near Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia. Another 34 migrants on the truck survived the ordeal, but were dehydrated, wet and frostbitten. All were Afghans who had entered Bulgaria from Turkey, hoping to reach Western Europe, authorities said.











            Borislav Sarafov, director of Bulgaria’s National Investigation Service called last week's incident the country's deadliest involving migrants. He said the people were “pressed against each other like in a tin can” which had caused their slow and painful deaths, calling the incident “an extraordinary human tragedy”.

            He added that the migrants perished 10-12 hours before the truck was found and that the smugglers had fled the scene after they noticed the deaths.

            Bulgarian authorities have charged five suspects with involuntary manslaughter, participation in a criminal organization and people trafficking. They could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. The alleged ringleader is in police custody in Greece where authorities have yet to decide on his extradition. 

            The suspects belong to an organized crime ring smuggling migrants from the border with Turkey to the Bulgaria-Serbia border, Sarafov said. Passengers paid 5,000-7,000 euros each, he said.

            Bulgaria, a Balkan country of 7 million and the poorest member of the European Union, is located on a major route for migrants from the Middle East and Afghanistan seeking to enter Europe from Turkey. Most of them are using Bulgaria as a transit corridor on their way westward.SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarian police discovered 43 migrants, including ten children, hidden in a van in the west of the country, officials said Monday, just days after authorities found the bodies of 18 migrants concealed in a lumber truck.Prosecutor Natalia Nikolova said the 43 migrants appear to be in good health, despite being squeezed into a tight space. She didn't provide the migrants' nationalities.Last week, the bodies of 18 migrants were found suffocated inside a secret compartment under a load of lumber on an abandoned truck near Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia. Another 34 migrants on the truck survived the ordeal, but were dehydrated, wet and frostbitten. All were Afghans who had entered Bulgaria from Turkey, hoping to reach Western Europe, authorities said.Borislav Sarafov, director of Bulgaria’s National Investigation Service called last week's incident the country's deadliest involving migrants. He said the people were “pressed against each other like in a tin can” which had caused their slow and painful deaths, calling the incident “an extraordinary human tragedy”.He added that the migrants perished 10-12 hours before the truck was found and that the smugglers had fled the scene after they noticed the deaths.Bulgarian authorities have charged five suspects with involuntary manslaughter, participation in a criminal organization and people trafficking.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816099,Public urged to stay alert as norovirus cases rise in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taoyuan City Government has urged the public to stay alert, wash hands often, and avoid eating raw eggs, meats, or shellfish due to rising norovirus cases.In a press release, the city’s Department of Public Health wrote that according to Centers for Disease Control data, emergency rooms nationwide treated 165,236 diarrhea cases in the first week of February and 165,319 cases in the second week. In Taoyuan, there were 15,835 cases in the first week and 17,666 cases in the second.Additionally, out of the five group diarrhea cases reported by schools in February, the cause of two cases has been confirmed as norovirus. The cause of the other three cases is still being determined.As norovirus is very contagious, outbreaks occur easily. The department urged schools and food service providers to stay alert and reinforce food safety management.Norovirus is immune to ethanol and hand sanitizers, so members of the public should wash their hands often with soap, per Heho. They should also separate cooked and raw ingredients when cooking, and avoid eating raw eggs, meats, or shellfish.Those who experience diarrhea should wait at least 48 hours after symptoms are gone before returning to work or school to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. Other symptoms caused by the virus include nausea, vomiting, stomachache, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, and soreness.Young children may experience more severe vomiting for one to 10 days before gradually recovering.",2023/02/20,2691,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816111,'People's court' tries Vladimir Putin for war in Ukraine,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A “people's court” put Russian President Vladimir Putin on trial Monday for the crime of aggression over his invasion of Ukraine, in a symbolic move to close an “accountability gap” in the absence of an international tribunal with jurisdiction.

            The court has no legal powers but prosecutors said they will present evidence that Putin committed the crime of aggression by ordering the invasion nearly a year ago, unleashing a devastating war that has killed thousands and left towns and cities in ruins.

            “This is a crime that belongs in the annals of infamy. It is a crime that demands accountability,” said Drew White, a Canadian lawyer acting as one of the court's prosecutors.











            While the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into crimes committed in Ukraine, it does not have jurisdiction to prosecute Russia’s leaders for aggression.

            However, international pressure is mounting for a special tribunal to be established to prosecute the crime. The European Union’s legislature passed a non-binding resolution in January calling on the 27-nation bloc to work “in close cooperation with Ukraine to seek and build political support in the U.N. General Assembly and other international forums ... for creating the special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.”

            The Netherlands, home to several international courts, has offered to host the court.

            The people’s court is an initiative of rights group Cinema for Peace, Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties and Ben Ferencz, the 102-year-old lawyer who is the last surviving prosecutor from the post-World War II Nuremburg trials of senior Nazi leaders.

            A week of hearings opened in The Hague two days after U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said that Washington has determined that Russian forces in Ukraine have committed crimes against humanity and insisted that perpetrators are brought to justice.

            The first day Monday also coincided with an unannounced visit to Kyiv by U.S. President Joe Biden.

            The court is scheduled to deliver a verdict on Friday, the anniversary of Russia's invasion.

            Putin was invited to participate in the hearing, but organizers got no response from the Russian embassy in The Hague.

            Nobel Peace Prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk of the Ukraine civil liberties organization made a statement via a video link ahead of the opening session.

            “Putin and the … political leadership and high military command who initiated, planned and started this war of aggression have to be punished for this international crime,” she said.

            The first witness was a Ukrainian journalist, Angela Slobodyan, who told a panel of three judges that she was in the city of Kherson when Russian forces rolled in “shooting everything that was moving.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816112,Celtics stars Tatum and Brown put on quite an All-Star show,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Best record in the NBA. A team that won the Eastern Conference and went to the NBA Finals last season. A pair of All-Stars, including the MVP. And a coach who isn’t an interim coach anymore.

            The Boston Celtics have much to like about where they are right now.

            Jayson Tatum’s All-Star scoring records — 55 points in the game, 27 points in the third quarter, both numbers that never have been touched by any of the other 449 All-Stars in league history — were the big story coming out of Team Giannis’ 184-175 victory over Team LeBron on Sunday night.











            And it might have signaled that the soon-to-be 25-year-old Tatum — Boston's first All-Star MVP since Larry Bird in 1982 — is ready to take the step from stardom to something even bigger.

            “I guess I’m not 19 anymore,” said Tatum, whose birthday is March 3. “But yeah, I say it all the time. I’m extremely grateful and blessed to be in this situation. I’m not too far removed from being a kid in St. Louis with essentially a ball and a dream and dreaming about these moments of being here. And living out that dream, in reality, is hard to describe. I try not to really think about the things I’ve accomplished. I never want to get complacent. I’m always chasing something, chasing more.”

            That chase resumes Thursday night, when the Celtics open their post-All-Star slate in Indiana. Boston takes a league-best 42-17 record into the stretch run, a half-game better than Milwaukee (41-17) for the top spots in both the East and the NBA. But the Bucks are ailing; Khris Middleton’s knee is a concern, and winning All-Star captain Giannis Antetokounmpo played only 20 seconds Sunday night because of a wrist issue.

            The Celtics, meanwhile, are soaring. Tatum and Jaylen Brown — playing for Team LeBron — combined for 90 points in the All-Star Game, further solidifying themselves as one of the best pairings in the league right now.

            And the last minute of the third quarter of the All-Star Game was basically them playing 1-on-1. Everyone else on the court stopped to let it happen. Brown went first, hitting a stepback from near the right corner. Tatum lost the ball off the dribble on the next possession. They weren’t done; Brown made a 3 over Tatum, hitting him with the “too small” move while laughing. Tatum then made a 3 of his own, and the battle ended when he stopped Brown from getting a shot off before the end-of-quarter buzzer sounded.

            “Going against my brother in Jayson, going back and forth, it was like no one was in there at all,” Brown said.

            Sitting back and watching it all was Celtics coach — and Team Giannis coach — Joe Mazzulla, who isn’t Celtics interim coach Joe Mazzulla anymore. Boston made him the permanent coach last week, no surprise after he has kept the Celtics on a title-contending path even after he had to take over for now-former coach Ime Udoka on almost no notice just before training camp. Udoka was suspended over inappropriate conduct with a Celtics employee.

            The last time Mazzulla was a head coach without an interim title was March 16, 2019. It was in the NCAA Division II tournament, when his Fairmont State club lost a first-round game to Mercyhurst.

            “I’m going to miss that term, I guess, a little bit,” Mazzulla said. “And my thing is, the interim tag was never a thing because we’re all interims. You have to kind of have a short-term view but also a long-term. ... As coaches, we’re here to make the game. The game’s not ours. It doesn’t belong to us. What matters is the seeds that we plant, and the things that we’re able to accomplish with the team.”

            In Boston, the seeds are planted. Brown and Tatum have blossomed into full-grown stars. And the Celtics have reason to have the biggest goal of all down the stretch this season.

            “Historically, or at least since I’ve been in the league, the team that has kind of clicked in this last stretch, has kind of peaked and played their best of the season going into the playoffs, usually is the team that wins it all,” Tatum said. “So, this stretch is important. You want to be as healthy as possible going into the playoffs. You want to be playing your best basketball, individually and as a group. That’s what we’re trying to do.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816144,"Japan to give Ukraine $5.5B, host online G-7 plus Zelenskyy","TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday announced a new $5.5 billion financial aid for Ukraine and will mark the first anniversary of the war by hosting an online Group of Seven summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            Kishida, speaking at a global forum in Tokyo organized by a Japanese think tank, said Ukraine still suffers under the Russian invasion and its people need help to rebuild their daily lives and infrastructure that's been badly damaged by Russian attacks.

            As this year's president of G-7, Kishida said he will host an online summit to be joined by Zelenskyy on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. It will be the first time for Kishida to host a G-7 summit. 











            Japan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine. Japan was quick to react because it fears a possible impact of the war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.

            In his speech, Kishida acknowledged he made a decisive move because of “strong concern that Ukraine may be tomorrow's East Asia.” 

            He said Russia's invasion is a challenge for the entire rules-based international order that brings an end to the post-Cold War era. “That's why I decided to resolutely respond to (Russia) with sanctions.” 

            Japan has provided loans of more than 70 billion yen ($520 million) to Ukraine in emergency economic assistance. The country has also accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance, support for jobs and education.TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday announced a new $5.5 billion financial aid for Ukraine and will mark the first anniversary of the war by hosting an online Group of Seven summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Kishida, speaking at a global forum in Tokyo organized by a Japanese think tank, said Ukraine still suffers under the Russian invasion and its people need help to rebuild their daily lives and infrastructure that's been badly damaged by Russian attacks.As this year's president of G-7, Kishida said he will host an online summit to be joined by Zelenskyy on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816145,Pressure building on Bayern coach Nagelsmann after outburst,"BERLIN (AP) — Pressure is building on Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann.

            And it shows.

            The German soccer federation has opened a case against Nagelsmann for his outburst toward referee Tobias Welz and his match officials following Bayern’s 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday.











            Nagelsmann tried talking to the referee immediately after the game, then rushed past journalists in the mixed zone to go to the officials’ dressing room.

            “Is he messing me around or what?” Nagelsmann reportedly roared on his way, before he knocked on the officials’ door.

            Kicker magazine reported Nagelsmann spent about a minute in the changing room, then emerged just as angry when he came out.

            “My god, my god, a soft-rinsed pack!” Nagelsmann said.

            Nagelsmann later apologized for his “choice of words,” but it hasn’t stopped the federation from looking into potential unsporting behavior. It said Sunday it had asked the Bayern coach for a statement and that it will decide what action to take after it has been evaluated.

            Nagelsmann was furious among other things over central defender Dayot Upamecano’s early red card – a decision that left his team with a player less from the eighth minute.

            Welz sent off Upamecano for a light touch on Alassane Plea’s shoulder as the French forward was rushing through on goal. There was only minimal contact, but it was still enough to put Plea off.

            “The Gladbach player gets himself in front of the Bayern player just in front of the penalty area, gets the contact and thus loses his balance, although he still tries to keep running,” Welz said Sunday. “The striker wants to score the goal. He’s going on his own toward the goalkeeper. Why would he throw himself down?”

            Nagelsmann saw it differently.

            “It’s simply not a red,” he said after the match.

            Nagelsmann is also under scrutiny for taking off team captain Thomas Müller to compensate for the loss of Upamecano, rather than the out of sorts Serge Gnabry or inexperienced Ryan Gravenberch among others.

            Müller has been supportive of injured team captain Manuel Neuer, who is upset with Nagelsmann over the club’s decision to fire his friend and goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalović on Jan. 23.

            Nagelsmann said it was a “crappy decision” to take Müller off but he had no other choice. The 33-year-old Müller is Bayern's most experienced player and was making his 429th Bundesliga appearance to match Oliver Kahn for second-most at the club. Only goalkeeping great Sepp Maier, with 473, has more.

            Nagelsmann has seen his team squander a four-point lead since the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. Bayern drew its first three league games upon its return.

            Saturday’s loss stretched Bayern’s winless run against Gladbach to five games across all competitions including the 5-0 rout Gladbach inflicted in their German Cup meeting last season. The 35-year-old Nagelsmann has never seen his team beat Gladbach since he became Bayern coach.

            Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin are now both level on points with Bayern, which still leads the Bundesliga because of its superior goal difference.

            Bayern next hosts Union in Munich on Sunday. In contrast to Bayern, Union is under no pressure going into the game having already exceeded all expectations and reached its season target of 40 points for league survival.

            Unbeaten so far in 2023, Union missed the chance to take over the lead on Sunday by drawing with last-place Schalke 0-0.

            Union coach Urs Fischer said he could live with the missed opportunity “quite well.”

            Union, promoted in 2019 and enjoying its best-ever season, doesn’t need to be first. Bayern does. All the pressure is on Nagelsmann.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBERLIN (AP) — Pressure is building on Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann.And it shows.The German soccer federation has opened a case against Nagelsmann for his outburst toward referee Tobias Welz and his match officials following Bayern’s 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday.Nagelsmann tried talking to the referee immediately after the game, then rushed past journalists in the mixed zone to go to the officials’ dressing room.“Is he messing me around or what?” Nagelsmann reportedly roared on his way, before he knocked on the officials’ door.Kicker magazine reported Nagelsmann spent about a minute in the changing room, then emerged just as angry when he came out.“My god, my god, a soft-rinsed pack!” Nagelsmann said.Nagelsmann later apologized for his “choice of words,” but it hasn’t stopped the federation from looking into potential unsporting behavior. It said Sunday it had asked the Bayern coach for a statement and that it will decide what action to take after it has been evaluated.Nagelsmann was furious among other things over central defender Dayot Upamecano’s early red card – a decision that left his team with a player less from the eighth minute.Welz sent off Upamecano for a light touch on Alassane Plea’s shoulder as the French forward was rushing through on goal. There was only minimal contact, but it was still enough to put Plea off.“The Gladbach player gets himself in front of the Bayern player just in front of the penalty area, gets the contact and thus loses his balance, although he still tries to keep running,” Welz said Sunday. “The striker wants to score the goal. He’s going on his own toward the goalkeeper.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816146,Rape trial of Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred starts in Paris,"PARIS (AP) — The trial of popular Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred on charges of aggravated rape and assault got underway in Paris on Monday, in a case that sparked a backlash among feminist activists in North Africa and the Middle East. 

            The 37-year-old Lamjarred, who is famous on the Arab pop music scene, allegedly raped a French woman at a luxury hotel on the Champs-Elysees in October 2016 while he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. 

            He has denied the allegations. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. A verdict is expected on Friday.











            The woman, who was 20 years old at the time, said that she met Lamjarred at a Paris nightclub and accompanied him to his hotel, according to the document summarizing the conclusions of the investigation that was read out by the presiding magistrate at the court.

            She said that he struck her several times as she was trying to push him back before he raped her, the document said. She managed to leave the room, and hotel staff reported seeing her crying and in distress.

            The woman's lawyer Jean-Marc Descoubes, told reporters Monday that the alleged victim remains strong, despite the trauma she sustained. ""It was extremely violent... It was very traumatic for her. She's still being treated, but she remains strong, decent and courageous,"" said Descoubes.

            On Monday, Lamjarred told the court that he rejects the allegations of rape and assault. He acknowledged he had “occasionally” used alcohol and drugs at the time, but has since stopped.

            The court said Lamjarred respected the conditions of the judicial supervision he has been under since 2017. Lamjarred is not permitted to perform in France, but has been allowed to leave the country for shows abroad.

            Feminist activists in North Africa and the Middle East have in recent years led a campaign against the singer as part of the #MeToo movement, leading some of his shows to be cancelled, especially in Egypt.

            Lebanese activist group Akhbar Al-Saha (News From the Square) said in a statement “we hope this court case is an opportunity for those who defend him to think twice and stand with the victims and survivors and not the perpetrator.”

            Lamjarred is one of the Arab world's most popular artists. His music video “Lm3allem” has more than 1 billion views on his YouTube channel, where he has more than 14 million subscribers.

            King Mohammed VI awarded him Morocco’s highest national honor in 2015.

            Lamjarred has also been charged with the aggravated rape of another woman in August 2018 at a nightclub in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera. A trial date hasn't been set for that case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816189,Liz Weston: Make your credit cards less vulnerable to fraud,"Last year, one of my family’s credit cards was used to rack up hundreds of dollars in bogus charges at Apple.com. Another card was compromised four times in a row, as thieves repeatedly charged merchandise and Uber rides.

            We ultimately got our money back, but repeated credit card fraud can be frustrating and disheartening. Dealing with the aftermath taught me to prize security over convenience, and to change some bad habits that made me an easier target.

            THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON CREDIT CARD FRAUD











            Under the Fair Credit Billing Act , consumers have 60 days after bogus charges show up on a statement to report them to the credit card issuer to avoid most liability, says attorney Amy Loftsgordon, legal editor at Nolo, a self-help legal site. (The law limits a consumer’s liability to $50 per series of unauthorized uses, but most issuers waive that, Loftsgordon says.)

            So my heart sank when I realized that the fraud on our Apple.com account had started at least six months earlier.

            I’d noticed that the Apple.com charges had been ticking up, but assumed my husband was buying more audiobooks and my daughter was downloading more games. I’d grouse at them occasionally, they would proclaim innocence and the charges would continue.

            Finally, the thief went too far and charged over $300 in a single month. I contacted Apple and discovered our card had been used to purchase dating apps and virtual phone numbers, which were likely being used to scam other people. The electronic receipts for these purchases were sent to an email address I didn’t recognize.

            A NEW CARD DIDN’T STOP THE FRAUD

            The kicker: The thief was using a credit card number that had already been reported as compromised. Normally, credit card issuers will deny new charges on a compromised number. But according to the card issuer, the thief started their crime spree during the few days that my replacement card was in the mail. Since we already made regular purchases at Apple.com, the card issuer assumed the charges using the old card were legit and allowed them to go through “as a courtesy” — month after month. (I was assured that this sequence of events “is extremely rare and hardly ever happens.”)

            An Apple customer service representative deleted the most recent month’s charges and the issuer removed the rest — even those well past the 60-day mark.

            My takeaways: Sites where you make multiple purchases each month need to be monitored carefully for bogus transactions. Compare what your credit card statement says you’ve charged with your purchase history on the site. You may have to search online for how to find that history; Apple certainly doesn’t make it easy or intuitive to find your charges. And if you find fraud, report it — even if it’s beyond the 60-day deadline. 

            MAKE FRAUDSTERS WORK HARDER

            It’s still not clear why my other card was repeatedly compromised. I’d no sooner get a replacement card than I would receive a text from the issuer asking about another suspicious transaction.

            I removed the card from the browsers and websites where it had been stored. We may like the convenience of not having to type in our credit card numbers, but every place we store our cards is another place where they can be stolen, says security expert Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst with research firm Gartner Inc.

            The mobile app for this card allowed me to see many of the places where my card was saved. But the list wasn’t complete. After the fourth hack, a phone rep said my card was stored at Airbnb, Walmart.com and Uber — three places that didn’t show up in my app and that I hadn’t authorized. The rep disconnected the card from those accounts. In the future, I’ll call in to report fraud so I can ask for this review rather than merely responding to a text warning or going online. I also learned that I could “lock” my card in the mobile app to prevent unauthorized use. Unlocking it when I want to make a charge just takes a few seconds. I wish more issuers offered this feature.

            At the issuer’s suggestion, I ran antivirus and anti-malware software (my devices were clean) and changed the passwords on my email accounts as well as my financial accounts, in case a thief had broken into those. I already had two-factor authentication, which requires a code and a password to sign in, on my financial and email accounts. I added it to my most-used retail sites as well.

            I’ve also started using a mobile payment system wherever possible. These systems — which include Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay — create a “token” that’s transmitted to merchants so that your credit card number is never exposed or stored. Similarly, some credit card issuers will provide virtual numbers that you can use instead of your real account number when making purchases online.

            I don’t imagine all this will make me fraud-proof, because that’s impossible. I’m just trying to make the thieves work a little harder next time.

            The protests began after the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest by the Islamic Republic’s morality police and have grown into one of the most serious challenges to Iran’s theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

            At least 529 people have been killed in demonstrations, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran. Over 19,700 others have been detained by authorities amid a violent crackdown trying to suppress the dissent. Some people linked to the protests have been executed.

            Today is Friday, March 3, the 62nd day of 2023. There are 303 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On March 3, 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed shortly after takeoff from Orly Airport in Paris, killing all 346 people on board. 

            On this date: 

            In 1791, Congress passed a measure taxing distilled spirits; it was the first internal revenue act in U.S. history. 

            In 1845, Florida became the 27th state. 

            In 1849, the U.S. Department of the Interior was established.

            In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure creating the National Academy of Sciences. 

            In 1931, “The Star-Spangled Banner” became the national anthem of the United States as President Herbert Hoover signed a congressional resolution.

            In 1943, in London’s East End, 173 people died in a crush of bodies at the Bethnal Green tube station, which was being used as a wartime air raid shelter. 

            In 1945, the Allies fully secured the Philippine capital of Manila from Japanese forces during World War II. 

            In 1960, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from her husband, Desi Arnaz, a day after they had finished filming the last episode of “The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show.” 

            In 1966, death claimed actors William Frawley at age 79 and Alice Pearce at age 48 in Hollywood.

            In 1969, Apollo 9 blasted off from Cape Kennedy on a mission to test the lunar module.

            In 1991, motorist Rodney King was severely beaten by Los Angeles police officers in a scene captured on amateur video. Twenty-five people were killed when a United Airlines Boeing 737-200 crashed while approaching the Colorado Springs airport. 

            In 2017, The Nintendo Switch, a hybrid game machine that works as both a console at home and a portable tablet on the go, made its debut.

            In 2020, in a surprise move, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point, its largest cut in more than a decade, to support the economy in the face of the spreading coronavirus. 

            Ten years ago: Vice President Joe Biden led civil rights leaders and national political figures in a ceremonial crossing of a Selma, Alabama, bridge where voting rights marchers were beaten by law enforcement officers in 1965. The SpaceX company’s Dragon capsule made good on its latest shipment to the International Space Station, overcoming earlier mechanical difficulty to deliver a ton of supplies. Bobby Rogers, a founding member of Motown group The Miracles and a songwriting collaborator with Smokey Robinson, died at his suburban Detroit home at age 73. 

            Five years ago: Actor David Ogden Stiers, best known for playing a surgeon on the “M.A.S.H.” television series, died at his Oregon home at the age of 75. Coastal communities in the northeastern United States saw damaging high tide flooding and the lingering effects of powerful, gusting winds in the aftermath of a vicious nor’easter. Roger Bannister, the British athlete who, while a medical student, became the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes, died in Oxford, England at the age of 88.

            One year ago: Amid a wave of cultural protest to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an Amsterdam museum cut its close links to the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and the Swedish Academy that hands out the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature broke its long tradition of not making political statements and condemned the invasion. In New York, soprano Anna Netrebko withdrew from her future engagements at the Metropolitan Opera rather than repudiate support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, costing the company one of its best box-office draws. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma reached a nationwide settlement over its role in the opioid crisis, with the Sackler family members who own the company boosting their cash contribution to as much as $6 billion in a deal intended to staunch a flood of lawsuits.

            Today is Wednesday, March 1, the 60th day of 2023. There are 305 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On March 1, 1974, seven people, including former Nixon White House aides H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, former Attorney General John Mitchell and former assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian, were indicted on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the Watergate break-in. (These four defendants were convicted in January 1975, though Mardian’s conviction was later reversed.) 

            On this date: 

            In 1815, Napoleon, having escaped exile in Elba, arrived in Cannes, France, and headed for Paris to begin his “Hundred Days” rule.

            In 1867, Nebraska became the 37th state as President Andrew Johnson signed a proclamation. 

            In 1893, inventor Nikola Tesla first publicly demonstrated radio during a meeting of the National Electric Light Association in St. Louis by transmitting electromagnetic energy without wires. 

            In 1932, Charles A. Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of Charles and Anne Lindbergh, was kidnapped from the family home near Hopewell, New Jersey. (Remains identified as those of the child were found the following May.) 

            In 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, back from the Yalta Conference, proclaimed the meeting a success as he addressed a joint session of Congress.

            In 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from the spectators’ gallery of the U.S. House of Representatives, wounding five members of Congress. 

            In 1966, the Soviet space probe Venera 3 impacted the surface of Venus, becoming the first spacecraft to reach another planet; however, Venera was unable to transmit any data, its communications system having failed. 

            In 1971, a bomb went off inside a men’s room at the U.S. Capitol; the radical group Weather Underground claimed responsibility for the pre-dawn blast. 

            In 2005, Dennis Rader, the churchgoing family man accused of leading a double life as the BTK serial killer, was charged in Wichita, Kansas, with 10 counts of first-degree murder. (Rader later pleaded guilty and received multiple life sentences.) A closely divided Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty for juvenile criminals. 

            In 2010, Jay Leno returned as host of NBC’s “The Tonight Show.” 

            In 2015, tens of thousands marched through Moscow in honor of slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who had been shot to death on Feb. 27. 

            In 2020, state officials said New York City had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus, a woman in her late 30s who had contracted the virus while traveling in Iran. Health officials in Washington state, announcing what was believed at the time to be the second U.S. death from the coronavirus, said the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in the Seattle area. 

            Ten years ago: President Barack Obama, still deadlocked with Republican congressional leaders, formally enacted $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts a few hours before the midnight deadline required by law. In Bangladesh, protesters clashed with police for a second day and the death toll rose to at least 44 from violence triggered by a death sentence given to an Islamic party leader for crimes linked to Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war.

            Five years ago: President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, escalating tensions with China and other trading partners and raising the prospect of higher prices for Americans. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects winners of the peace prize, announced that someone using a stolen identity nominated Trump for the award. The committee leader said it appeared the same person was responsible for forging nominations in 2017, as well.

            One year ago: Russian forces escalated their attacks on crowded urban areas, bombarding the central square in Ukraine’s second-biggest city and Kyiv’s main TV tower in what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a blatant campaign of terror. In his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden aimed to rally the American public to bear the costs of supporting Ukraine’s fight to stave off the massive Russian invasion. He also outlined his plans to combat soaring inflation.

            Today is Tuesday, Feb. 28, the 59th day of 2023. There are 306 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On Feb. 28, 1993, a gun battle erupted at a religious compound near Waco, Texas, when Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents tried to arrest Branch Davidian leader David Koresh on weapons charges; four agents and six Davidians were killed as a 51-day standoff began. 

            On this date: 

            In 1844, a 12-inch gun aboard the USS Princeton exploded as the ship was sailing on the Potomac River, killing Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur, Navy Secretary Thomas W. Gilmer and several others. 

            In 1849, the California gold rush began in earnest as regular steamship service started bringing gold-seekers to San Francisco. 

            In 1911, President William Howard Taft nominated William H. Lewis to be the first Black Assistant Attorney General of the United States.

            In 1953, scientists James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick announced they had discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. 

            In 1972, President Richard M. Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai issued the Shanghai Communique, which called for normalizing relations between their countries, at the conclusion of Nixon’s historic visit to China. 

            In 1975, 42 people were killed in London’s Underground when a train smashed into the end of a tunnel. 

            In 1996, Britain’s Princess Diana agreed to divorce Prince Charles. (Their 15-year marriage officially ended in August 1996; Diana died in a car crash in Paris a year after that.) 

            In 2009, Paul Harvey, the news commentator and talk-radio pioneer whose staccato style made him one of the nation’s most familiar voices, died in Phoenix at age 90.

            In 2014, delivering a blunt warning to Moscow, President Barack Obama expressed deep concern over reported military activity inside Ukraine by Russia and warned “there will be costs” for any intervention.

            In 2018, Walmart announced that it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and would remove items resembling assault-style rifles from its website. Dick’s Sporting Goods said it would stop selling assault-style rifles and ban the sale of all guns to anyone under 21. 

            In 2020, the number of countries touched by the coronavirus climbed to nearly 60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week 12.4% lower in the market’s worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis.

            Ten years ago: In 2013, Benedict XVI became the first pope in 600 years to resign, ending an eight-year pontificate. (Benedict was succeeded the following month by Pope Francis.) Chelsea Manning, the Army private arrested in the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history, pleaded guilty at Fort Meade, Maryland, to 10 charges involving illegal possession or distribution of classified material. (Manning was sentenced to up to 35 years in prison after being convicted of additional charges in a court-martial, but had her sentence commuted in 2017 by President Barack Obama.)

            Five years ago: Students and teachers returned under police guard to Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as classes resumed for the first time since a shooting that killed 17 people. President Donald Trump called for substantial changes to the nation’s gun laws, criticizing lawmakers for being fearful of the National Rifle Association. Political leaders paid tribute to the Rev. Billy Graham as his casket rested in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. 

            One year ago: Russian forces shelled Ukraine’s second-largest city, rocking a residential neighborhood, and closed in on the capital, Kyiv, in a 17-mile convoy of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles. Talks aimed at stopping the fighting yielded only an agreement to keep talking. A Texas man charged with storming the U.S. Capitol with a holstered handgun on his waist became the first Jan. 6 defendant to go on trial.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816203,Frankfurt to face Napoli's 'Kvaradona' in Champions League,"BERLIN (AP) — Khvicha Kvaratskhelia would likely still be playing for Russian club Rubin Kazan if that country hadn’t launched an invasion of neighboring Ukraine a year ago.

            Instead, the Georgian winger is one of Napoli’s best players as the Italian team visits Eintracht Frankfurt for the first leg of the round of 16 in the Champions League on Tuesday.

            Last year, Kvaratskhelia was quietly adding to his reputation as one of the world’s best young players at Rubin, away from the intense scrutiny he might have gathered playing in one of Europe’s top leagues.











            He hadn’t yet earned the nickname “Kvaradona” for the dribbling wizardry that has helped Napoli open a 15-point lead in Serie A this season.

            Less than two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine last Feb. 24, FIFA said Russia-based foreign players could suspend their contracts and sign with other, non-Russian teams. Kvaratskhelia switched to Georgian team Dinamo Batumi for the rest of the season before joining Napoli for a reported fee of 10 million euros ($10.7 million) in the offseason.

            It looks like a bargain.

            Kvaratskhelia scored 37 minutes into his Serie A debut and already has more league goals, 10, then he managed in three seasons at Rubin. He also has two goals in the Champions League, where Napoli cruised through its group by winning its first five games against Liverpool, Rangers and Ajax.

            Kvaratskhelia has scored in each of his last three Serie A appearances. He displayed all his skills and speed again on Friday when he won the ball in the center circle and took off toward goal, skipping over a challenge and then finding the space to shoot through a defender’s legs and inside the left post in a 2-0 win at Sassuolo.

            Kvaratskhelia also created numerous chances for Victor Osimhen, another major worry for Frankfurt on Tuesday. The Nigeria forward scored to take his Serie A tally to 18 goals, nine alone in his last seven league games.

            “Napoli’s forward line is very strong,” Frankfurt defender Tuta said after his team’s 2-0 win over Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday. “We’ll have to keep working hard and improve every detail. We know they’re bringing a lot of quality.”

            Previously known as the “Georgian Messi,” Kvaratskhelia has been dubbed “Kvaradona” for his impact at Napoli — a nod to Diego Maradona, who led the club to its only two Italian league titles in 1987 and 1990 — and also because his new Italian fans have problems pronouncing his name.

            “When even a small part of Maradona’s name is associated with yours, it’s an honor,” said Kvaratskhelia, the subject last week of reported interest from Real Madrid.

            Frankfurt has its own standout player in Randal Kolo Muani, who has seven goals in his last six games in all competitions and has emerged as one of the Bundesliga’s most exciting players this season.

            Today is Thursday, March 2, the 61st day of 2023. There are 304 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On March 2, 1962, Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors in a game against the New York Knicks, an NBA record that still stands. Philadelphia won the game, 169-147. 

            On this date: 

            In 1861, the state of Texas, having seceded from the Union, was admitted to the Confederacy.

            In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was declared the winner of the 1876 presidential election over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden, even though Tilden had won the popular vote. 

            In 1917, actor, producer, director and bandleader Desi Arnaz was born in Santiago de Cuba.

            In 1932, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March 4 to Jan. 20, was passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification.

            In 1939, John Ford’s classic Western “Stagecoach,” starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne, opened in New York.

            In 1943, the three-day Battle of the Bismarck Sea began in the southwest Pacific during World War II; U.S. and Australian warplanes were able to inflict heavy damage on an Imperial Japanese convoy. 

            In 1955, nine months before Rosa Parks’ famous act of defiance, Claudette Colvin, a Black high school student in Montgomery, Alabama, was arrested after refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a white passenger.

            In 1985, the government approved a screening test for AIDS that detected antibodies to the virus, allowing possibly contaminated blood to be excluded from the blood supply. 

            In 1989, representatives from the 12 European Community nations agreed to ban all production of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), the synthetic compounds blamed for destroying the Earth’s ozone layer, by the end of the 20th century. 

            In 1990, more than 6,000 drivers went on strike against Greyhound Lines Inc. (The company, later declaring an impasse in negotiations, fired the strikers.) 

            In 1995, the Internet search engine website Yahoo! was incorporated by founders Jerry Yang and David Filo. 

            In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled, 8-1, that a grieving father’s pain over mocking protests at his Marine son’s funeral had to yield to First Amendment protections for free speech in a decision favoring the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas. 

            In 2012, Some 40 people were killed by tornadoes that struck Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

            Ten years ago: The day after $85 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts went into effect, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans refused to concede any culpability for failing to stave off the sequester. Alaska’s 41st Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kicked off with a festive ceremonial start in Anchorage.

            Five years ago: At a funeral before an invitation-only crowd of approximately 2,000 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the children of the Rev. Billy Graham remembered “America’s Pastor” as a man devoted to spreading the Gospel, and one who lived his life at home as he preached it in stadiums. A nor’easter pounded the Atlantic coast with hurricane-force winds and sideways rain and snow, grounding flights and leaving more than 2 million homes and businesses without power from North Carolina to Maine.

            One year ago: Russian forces laid siege to two strategic Ukrainian seaports and pressed their bombardment of the country’s second-biggest city, while the huge armored column threatening Kyiv appeared to be stalled outside the capital. Moscow’s isolation deepened as most of the world lines up against it at the United Nations. Autherine Lucy Foster, the first Black student to enroll at the University of Alabama, died at age 92.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816207,Israel promises not to approve additional West Bank outposts,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has told the Biden administration it will rein in the approval of new West Bank settlement outposts, the prime minister's office said Monday, a day after a potential diplomatic crisis was averted at the United Nations over Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

            The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine such outposts built without authorization that it approved retroactively earlier this month. The statement, however, made no mention of the thousands of additional settlement homes in existing settlements officials say are to be soon approved.

            A contentious U.N. Security Council resolution pushed by the Palestinians and their supporters slated for Monday would have condemned Israel for settlement expansion and demanded a halt to future activity. According to multiple diplomats, the Biden administration managed to forestall the vote by convincing both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take.











            “Israel notified the U.S. that in the coming months it will not authorize new settlements beyond the nine that have already been approved,” Netanyahu's office said.

            The Security Council unanimously approved the watered-down statement Monday.

            Dozens of unauthorized outposts dot the occupied West Bank, in addition to scores of existing settlements. These outposts, which sometimes are little more than a handful of trailer homes but can also resemble small villages, are built without authorization but are often tolerated and even encouraged by Israeli governments. The international community considers all Israeli construction on occupied land to be illegitimate or illegal. 

            The U.N. vote presented a headache for the Biden administration at a time when it is focusing its diplomatic efforts on Russia's war with Ukraine, which is coming up on one year this week. Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday.

            It also highlighted the deep differences between Biden's administration, which supports Palestinian statehood and opposes settlements, and the Israeli government, which is made up of ultranationalists who oppose Palestinian independence and have pledged to ramp up settlement building.

            The pledge to hold off on approving outposts contradicts the government's guiding principles and Netanyahu could face a backlash from his far-right, pro-settler coalition partners. Construction in established settlements is expected to continue, as it has under successive Israeli governments. 

            Netanyahu's office also said it would continue to demolish illegally built Palestinian homes in the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control. Palestinian residents in these areas say it is almost impossible to receive a building permit from Israeli authorities.

            The United States, along with much of the international community, say the settlements are obstacles to peace by taking over land sought by the Palestinians for their state. Over 700,000 Jewish Israelis now live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem — territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians..JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has told the Biden administration it will rein in the approval of new West Bank settlement outposts, the prime minister's office said Monday, a day after a potential diplomatic crisis was averted at the United Nations over Israeli-Palestinian tensions.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine such outposts built without authorization that it approved retroactively earlier this month.

            Today is Sunday, Feb. 26, the 57th day of 2023. There are 308 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On Feb. 26, 1993, a truck bomb built by Islamic extremists exploded in the parking garage of the North Tower of New York’s World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000 others. (The bomb failed to topple the North Tower into the South Tower, as the terrorists had hoped; both structures were destroyed in the 9/11 attack eight years later.) 

            On this date: 

            In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from exile on the Island of Elba and headed back to France in a bid to regain power. 

            In 1904, the United States and Panama proclaimed a treaty under which the U.S. agreed to undertake efforts to build a ship canal across the Panama isthmus. 

            In 1942, “How Green Was My Valley” won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1941, beating out nine other films, including “The Maltese Falcon” and “Citizen Kane.” 

            In 1945, authorities ordered a midnight curfew at nightclubs, bars and other places of entertainment across the nation. 

            In 1952, Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that Britain had developed its own atomic bomb. 

            In 1966, South Korean troops sent to fight in the Vietnam War massacred at least 380 civilians in Go Dai hamlet.

            In 1987, the Tower Commission, which had probed the Iran-Contra affair, issued its report, which rebuked President Ronald Reagan for failing to control his national security staff.

            In 1998, a jury in Amarillo, Texas, rejected an $11 million lawsuit brought by Texas cattlemen who blamed Oprah Winfrey’s talk show for a price fall after a segment on food safety that included a discussion about mad cow disease.

            In 2005, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his country’s constitution changed to allow presidential challengers in an upcoming fall election.

            In 2012, Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot to death in Sanford, Florida, during an altercation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who said he acted in self-defense. (Zimmerman was later acquitted of second-degree murder.) 

            In 2014, Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill pushed by social conservatives that would have allowed people with sincerely held religious beliefs to refuse to serve gays. 

            In 2016, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stunned the Republican establishment by endorsing Donald Trump for president.

            In 2017, At the 89th Academy Awards, “Moonlight,” an LGBT coming of age drama, won three Oscars, including best picture of 2016 (in a startling gaffe, the musical “La La Land” was mistakenly announced as the best picture winner before the error was corrected). 

            In 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the number of new coronavirus cases outside China had exceeded the number of new infections in China for the first time. 

            Ten years ago: A deeply divided Senate voted, 58-41, to confirm Republican Chuck Hagel to be U.S. defense secretary. A hot air balloon burst into flames during a sunrise flight over the ancient Egyptian city of Luxor and then plummeted 1,000 feet to earth, killing 19 tourists.

            Five years ago: President Donald Trump, who had been highly critical of the law enforcement response to the Florida school shooting, told a roomful of governors at the White House that if he had been there, he would have rushed in, unarmed. Thousands of people from all walks of life, including former President George W. Bush and his wife, filed slowly past the casket of the Rev. Billy Graham in Charlotte, North Carolina.

            One year ago: Kyiv residents braced for another night sheltering underground, as Russian troops closed in on Ukraine’s capital and skirmishes were reported on the outskirts. Ukraine’s leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, vowed to continue fighting the Russian assault as he appealed for more outside help. He accused Russia of hitting infrastructure and civilian targets. John Landy, an Australian runner who dueled with Roger Bannister to be the first person to run a four-minute mile, died at age 91.

            Today is Monday, Feb. 27, the 58th day of 2023. There are 307 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On Feb. 27, 1922, the Supreme Court, in Leser v. Garnett, unanimously upheld the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed the right of women to vote. 

            On this date: 

            In 1807, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine.

            In 1933, Germany’s parliament building, the Reichstag, was gutted by fire; Chancellor Adolf Hitler, blaming the Communists, used the fire to justify suspending civil liberties. 

            In 1939, the Supreme Court, in National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., effectively outlawed sit-down strikes. 

            In 1942, the Battle of the Java Sea began during World War II; Imperial Japanese naval forces scored a decisive victory over the Allies. 

            In 1951, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, limiting a president to two terms of office, was ratified. 

            In 1973, members of the American Indian Movement occupied the hamlet of Wounded Knee in South Dakota, the site of the 1890 massacre of Sioux men, women and children. (The occupation lasted until the following May.) 

            In 1991, Operation Desert Storm came to a conclusion as President George H.W. Bush declared that “Kuwait is liberated, Iraq’s army is defeated,” and announced that the allies would suspend combat operations at midnight, Eastern time. 

            In 1997, divorce became legal in Ireland.

            In 1998, with the approval of Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s House of Lords agreed to end 1,000 years of male preference by giving a monarch’s first-born daughter the same claim to the throne as any first-born son. 

            In 2006, former Newark Eagles co-owner Effa Manley became the first woman elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

            In 2010, in Chile, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami killed 524 people, caused $30 billion in damage and left more than 200,000 homeless. 

            In 2020, U.S. stocks posted their worst one-day drop since 2011, as worldwide markets plummeted amid growing anxiety about the coronavirus; the Dow tumbled nearly 1,200 points. President Donald Trump declared that a widespread U.S. outbreak of the virus was not inevitable, even as top health authorities at his side warned that more infections were coming.

            In 2021, the U.S. got a third vaccine to prevent COVID-19, as the Food and Drug Administration cleared a Johnson & Johnson shot that worked with just one dose instead of two. 

            Ten years ago: The Senate confirmed Jacob Lew to be Treasury secretary by a vote of 71-26. President Barack Obama unveiled a statue of civil rights icon Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol. Van Cliburn, the internationally celebrated pianist whose triumph at a 1958 Moscow competition launched a spectacular career that made him the rare classical musician to enjoy rock star status, died in Fort Worth, Texas, at age 78.

            Five years ago: It was revealed that security clearance of White House senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner had been downgraded, significantly reducing his access to classified information. (Kushner’s status was restored in May after the completion of his background check.) A five-hour truce ordered by Syria’s Russian allies to let civilians flee a besieged rebel-held enclave near Damascus failed to result in aid deliveries or medical evacuations, as deadly airstrikes and shelling continued. President Donald Trump named former digital adviser Brad Parscale as campaign manager for his 2020 re-election bid. 

            One year ago: President Vladimir Putin dramatically escalated East-West tensions by ordering Russian nuclear forces put on high alert, while Ukraine’s embattled leader agreed to talks with Moscow as Putin’s troops and tanks drove deeper into the country. Citing “aggressive statements” by NATO, Putin issued a directive to increase the readiness of Russia’s nuclear weapons — a step that raised fears that the invasion of Ukraine could boil over into nuclear war. New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that a dramatic drop in coronavirus infections could lead to the lifting of vaccine mandates on restaurants, bars and theaters within days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816211,Collection of rare centuries-old jewelry returns to Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A spectacular collection of centuries-old Cambodian jewelry has been returned to the Southeast Asian country, the latest treasures to be retrieved from the estate of well-known antiquities collector and dealer Douglas Latchford, who was accused of buying and selling looted artifacts.

            Cambodia’s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts announced Monday that 77 pieces of Cambodian jewelry from the Latchford family collection arrived back in their homeland on Friday. It said the collection included items ""such as gold and other precious metal pieces from the Pre-Angkorian and Angkorian period including crowns, necklaces, bracelets, belts, earrings and amulets.” Angkor in the 9th to the 15th centuries was a powerful kingdom in the area of present-day Cambodia, and tourists can see its legacy at the famous Angkor Wat temple complex in the country’s northwest.

            The ministry said the handover of the items involved Hun Many, a lawmaker who is the youngest son of Prime Minister Hun Sen; Cambodia’s ambassador to Britain; representatives of Britain’s Foreign Office; the Art & Antiques Unit of London’s Metropolitan Police; and the Arts Council England.











            The return of the items followed a September 2020 agreement with Latchford’s family under which all Cambodian artifacts in their possession would be returned to Cambodia. Other stone and bronze artifacts were returned in September 2021.

            Latchford, known as both an expert and a dealer in Cambodian and Indian antiquities, died in August 2020 at age 88 in Bangkok, Thailand, where he lived for decades.

            In November 2018, U.S federal prosecutors indicted him on charges of wire fraud conspiracy and other crimes related to alleged trafficking in stolen and looted Cambodian antiquities. It accused him of creating “false provenances” — documents about how and where the items were obtained — and “falsified invoices and shipping documents” to conceal their origins. Experts believe many or most of the items he handled were looted from Cambodia during periods of war and instability, including in the 1970s when the country was under the brutal rule of the communist Khmer Rouge.

            Latchford in earlier interviews denied any involvement in smuggling or other wrongdoing. He died before he could be extradited to the United States to face charges, so the indictment against him was eventually dismissed.

            After his death, at least 30 sandstone and bronze sculptures and artifacts were sent back to Cambodia from the U.S. by their owners either voluntarily or after court action. They included items held by the Denver Art Museum in Colorado.

            The statement from Cambodia’s Culture Ministry quoted its minister, Dr. Phoeurng Sackona, as saying that “the repatriation of these national treasures opens a new era of understanding and scholarship about the Angkorian empire and its significance to the world.”

            She encouraged “private individuals, museums as well as other institutions around the world that are in possession of Cambodian artifacts to cooperate with the Royal Government of Cambodia through the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts or through Cambodian embassies to return Cambodian cultural heritage objects.""

            “We consider such returns as a noble act, which not only demonstrates important contributions to a nation’s culture, but also contributes to the reconciliation and healing of Cambodians who went through decades of civil war and suffered tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge genocide,” it quoted her as saying. 

            Cambodia's western neighbor, Thailand, has in recent decades also successfully retrieved archaeological treasures that were illegally smuggled abroad, as awareness of the theft of cultural artifacts has heightened.PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A spectacular collection of centuries-old Cambodian jewelry has been returned to the Southeast Asian country, the latest treasures to be retrieved from the estate of well-known antiquities collector and dealer Douglas Latchford, who was accused of buying and selling looted artifacts.Cambodia’s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts announced Monday that 77 pieces of Cambodian jewelry from the Latchford family collection arrived back in their homeland on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816226,"Key developments in the aftermath of the Turkey, Syria quake","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — There are reports of more collapsed buildings Turkey in Syria after another 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey’s Hatay province which was devastated by a massive tremor two week ago. Syria's state news agency, SANA, is reporting six people have been injured in Aleppo from falling debris, while the mayor of Hatay says a number of buildings have collapsed, trapping people inside. Turkey’s disaster management agency, AFAD, said the new quake was centered around the town of Defne, in Hatay province. It was followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 tremor. NTV television said the quake caused some damaged buildings to collapse, but there were no immediate reports of any casualties. The quake was felt in Syria, Jordan, Israel and Egypt. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake which struck Feb. 6 has killed nearly 45,000 people in Turkey and Syria. Turkish authorities have recorded more than 6,000 aftershocks since.

            Here’s a look at the key developments Monday in the quake's aftermath:

            PEOPLE TRAPPED, ABANDON HOMES IN FEAR











             Lutfu Savas, the mayor for Hatay says a number of buildings have collapsed following the new, 6.4 magnitude earthquake, trapping people inside. Savas said those trapped are believed to be people who had either returned to homes or were trying move furniture from damaged homes.

            In the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets into their cars. Malaver said everyone is really scared and that “no one wants to get back into their houses.”

            MORE INJURIES, COLLAPSED BUILDINGS

            Syria’s state news agency, SANA, has reported that six people were injured and taken to hospital in the northern city of Aleppo as a result from falling debris shaken loose from buildings by the new tremor.

            The Syrian opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense also known as White Helmets are reporting that several people have been injured in Syria’s rebel-held northwest after they jumped from buildings or when they wee struck by falling debris in the town of Jinderis, one of the most affected town by the Feb. 6 earthquake.

            The White Helmets added that several damaged and abandoned buildings collapsed in Syria’s northwest without injuring anyone.

            The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria, said it had treated a number of patients - including a 7-year-old boy - who suffered heart attacks brought on by fear following the earthquake.

            TURKS URGED TO STAY AWAY FROM DAMAGED BUILDINGS:

            Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay says inspections for damage were underway in Hatay and is urging citizens to stay away from damaged buildings and to carefully follow rescue teams' directions.

            The disaster management agency, AFAD, meanwhile urged citizens to stay away from the coastline as a precaution against “the risk of the sea level rising up to 50 centimeters high.”

            PEOPLE FLEE HOMES IN SYRIA 

            Some media outlets in Syria’s Idlib and Aleppo regions that were badly affected by the new, 6.4 magnitude earthquake are reporting that some buildings have collapsed and that electricity and internet services have been interrupted in parts of the region. 

            The media outlets said many people fled their homes and are gathering in open areas.

            Meanwhile, the White Helmets issued an alert urging residents in the country’s rebel-held northwest to follow guidelines released earlier regarding earthquakes and how to evacuate buildings.

            DEATH TOLL APPROACHES 45,000

            The Turkish disaster management agency, AFAD, has raised the number of confirmed fatalities from the earthquake in Turkey to 41,156. That increases the overall death toll in both Turkey and Syria to 44,844.

            Search and rescue operations for survivors have been called off in most of the quake zone, but AFAD chief Yunus Sezer told reporters that search teams were pressing ahead with their efforts in more than a dozen collapsed buildings — most of them in the hardest-hit province of Hatay.

            There were no signs of anyone being alive under the rubble since three members of one family — a mother, father and 12-year-old boy — were extracted from a collapsed building in Hatay on Saturday. The boy later died.

            EU SEES RISK OF DISEASE OUTBREAK

            The European Union’s health agency has warned of the risk of disease outbreaks in the coming weeks.

            The Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls said that “food and water-borne diseases, respiratory infections and vaccine-preventable infections are a risk in the upcoming period, with the potential to cause outbreaks, particularly as survivors are moving to temporary shelters.”

            “A surge of cholera cases in the affected areas is a significant possibility in the coming weeks,” it said, noting that authorities in northwestern Syria have reported thousands of cases of the disease since last September and a planned vaccination campaign was delayed due to the quake.

            The ECDC also warned of viral infections such as hepatitis A, parasites and bacterial infections that can all be spread by difficult hygiene conditions in emergency shelters and camps.

            SYRIA CALLS FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING UNITS

            Syria’s minister of public works and housing, Suhail Abdul Latif, says the Syrian government will secure 350 housing units for people displaced by the earthquake and made a call for “friendly countries” to send more.

            “We will secure the affected people within our capabilities, but after a while, it is not possible to continue placing families in shelters in order to preserve their health,” he said.

            Housing has been a pressing need in all the earthquake-hit areas, with many families sleeping in makeshift tents or cramming into crowded schools and sports stadiums.

            ERDOGAN SAYS RECONSTRUCTION TO START IN MARCH

            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faces elections in May or June, says his country will start building tens of thousands of new homes as early as next month.

            Erdogan said the new buildings will be no taller than three or four stories, built on firmer ground and to higher standards and in consultation with “geophysics, geotechnical, geology and seismology professors” and other experts. 

            “We want to avoid disasters ... by shifting our settlements away from the lowlands to the (more solid) mountains as much as possible,” Erdogan said in a televized address during a visit to hard-hit Hatay province. 

            The Turkish leader said destroyed cultural monuments would be rebuilt in accordance with their to “historic and cultural texture.” 

            Erdogan said around 1.6 million people are currently being housed in temporary shelters. 

            BLINKEN PRAISES AMERICANS’ RESPONSE

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has praised the support provided by Americans following the earthquake.

            Blinken said in Ankara that the U.S. government had responded “within hours” to the disaster and had so far sent hundreds of personnel and relief supplies. But he said that ordinary Americans had also responded to “heartbreaking” images from the quake zone.

            “We have nearly $80 million in donations from the private sector in the United States, (from) individuals. When I visited the Turkish Embassy in Washington, I almost couldn’t get in the front door because boxes were piled high throughout the driveway to the embassy,” Blinken said.

            NATO SENDS CONTAINER HOMES

            NATO says a ship carrying 600 temporary container homes has left Italy and is expected to arrive in Turkey next week.

            The military alliance has pledged to send more than 1,000 containers that will serve as temporary shelters for at least 4,000 people left homeless by the earthquake. 

            NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who visited the quake-devastated region last week, called it the worst disaster in the alliance’s history.

            Authorities say more than 110,000 buildings across 11 quake-hit Turkish provinces were either destroyed or so severely damaged that they need to be torn down.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — There are reports of more collapsed buildings Turkey in Syria after another 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey’s Hatay province which was devastated by a massive tremor two week ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816227,Insider Q&A: Jean Case on impact investing and ESG backlash,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jean Case, who rose to fortune and fame as an executive at American Online, has been a fan of impact investing since before it had that name. 

            It looks to invest in projects and companies that make a direct impact on society, like Warby Parker, the eyeglass retailer that distributes a pair to people in need for every pair sold.

            Case is now chairman at the National Geographic Society and CEO of the Case Foundation, which she created with her husband and AOL co-founder Steve Case. She spoke with The Associated Press about her efforts to expand impact investing, particularly when a similar style of investing known as ESG has become the target of harsh political criticism. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. 











            Q: You came up through the corporate world rather than investing. How did you first get started in impact investing? 

            A: It was from my own personal desire to invest in a way that could bring both a financial return but also help society in one way or another.

            The term “impact investing” hadn’t really been invented until decades after we started America Online. When I look back at my tech career, many of those companies were focused on bringing benefits to society and specifically to democratizing access to information and communication and just knowledge more broadly. We saw ourselves at AOL as building on a mission. No one was calling that an “impact company” in its day.

            Once I realized there was a whole sector called impact investing, I jumped in, and the role of the Case Foundation was to try to expand that more broadly. 

            We realized very quickly that even the most sophisticated financial leaders had no idea what we were talking about. 

            Q: What is it exactly?

            A: We define impact investing as the investment of capital for a financial return combined with a social return. 

            Every investment has impact. The question is what impact does it have. Our goal for not just the For What It's Worth newsletter (that Case produces weekly on impact investing) but through all of our work is to try to drive positive social impact by the powerful use of business and capital. 

            Q: Does that mean you have to give up some financial return to do impact investing?

            A: There is a part of the market that will give up some financial return to have more social return. The market we have been intensely focused on is areas where you are hopefully not compromising financial return to bring a social return alongside it. 

            Q: You’ve gotten the endowment at the National Geographic to invest in impact projects. How did that happen? 

            A: You can start with a toe in the water approach. Take a small amount that you might be willing to take a risk on and find some impact investments that you think are good prospects for what you care about.

            That’s what we did with National Geographic. We started with an allocation of $50 million out of an endowment that at that time might have been $1.1 billion. Worst case: If it doesn’t perform well, it’s not going to tank the endowment

            Q: Did it tank?

            A: Interestingly, it outperformed the benchmarks in those asset classes. That got the investment committee a lot more comfortable with the space.

            Q: Markets have had a rough go the last year or so. You’re not worried about flagging interest?

            A: Impact investing has not been immune from the disruptions in the markets. We’re looking for areas that are safe havens everywhere these days. I will tell you, I’m super bullish for impact investing in the long term. 

            We have very strong demographic shifts. Between the new generation and women, the amount of new capital coming into the market is extraordinary. In both of those demographic categories, they both have made it very clear they want to use their capital to make a better world and address social challenges. 

            I’d also say because of those demographic changes, we’ve seen an entirely new class of entrepreneurs building a new class of companies with an impact focus. It used to be just in energy. Today it’s agricultural and housing and fintech and all kinds of sectors that weren’t at the table as impact opportunities. 

            Q: ESG investing has gotten a lot of political pushback. Have you been surprised by the level?

            A: We really have to talk about a couple different things. ESG (investing, which looks at investments through an environmental, social and governance lens) is quite distinct from impact investing. 

            We have always had a problem with impact investing and ESG in terms of clear measurement, clear standards and transparency. I think impact investing is much cleaner on that than ESG is. I’m very excited about the things that come in the basket of ESG. But without clear measurements and standards, it made it very easy to paint yourself as an ESG offering without a lot of there there. 

            I haven’t seen as much of that in impact investing. 

            Q: Isn’t it much easier to do impact investing as a big endowment or institution than as a regular person with an IRA or a 401(k)?

            Q: It is, no question. But impact investing funds are (much bigger) than just a couple years ago. And assets under management are over $1 trillion. I think that’s meaningful. Those of us very early in the market remember getting super excited about getting to $100 billion. 

            I do believe the market is starting to organize. I believe there are growing tools for investors.NEW YORK (AP) — Jean Case, who rose to fortune and fame as an executive at American Online, has been a fan of impact investing since before it had that name.It looks to invest in projects and companies that make a direct impact on society, like Warby Parker, the eyeglass retailer that distributes a pair to people in need for every pair sold.Case is now chairman at the National Geographic Society and CEO of the Case Foundation, which she created with her husband and AOL co-founder Steve Case. She spoke with The Associated Press about her efforts to expand impact investing, particularly when a similar style of investing known as ESG has become the target of harsh political criticism. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.Q: You came up through the corporate world rather than investing. How did you first get started in impact investing?A: It was from my own personal desire to invest in a way that could bring both a financial return but also help society in one way or another.The term “impact investing” hadn’t really been invented until decades after we started America Online. When I look back at my tech career, many of those companies were focused on bringing benefits to society and specifically to democratizing access to information and communication and just knowledge more broadly. We saw ourselves at AOL as building on a mission. No one was calling that an “impact company” in its day.Once I realized there was a whole sector called impact investing, I jumped in, and the role of the Case Foundation was to try to expand that more broadly.We realized very quickly that even the most sophisticated financial leaders had no idea what we were talking about.Q: What is it exactly?A: We define impact investing as the investment of capital for a financial return combined with a social return.Every investment has impact. The question is what impact does it have. Our goal for not just the For What It's Worth newsletter (that Case produces weekly on impact investing) but through all of our work is to try to drive positive social impact by the powerful use of business and capital.Q: Does that mean you have to give up some financial return to do impact investing?A: There is a part of the market that will give up some financial return to have more social return. The market we have been intensely focused on is areas where you are hopefully not compromising financial return to bring a social return alongside it.Q: You’ve gotten the endowment at the National Geographic to invest in impact projects. How did that happen?A: You can start with a toe in the water approach. Take a small amount that you might be willing to take a risk on and find some impact investments that you think are good prospects for what you care about.That’s what we did with National Geographic. We started with an allocation of $50 million out of an endowment that at that time might have been $1.1 billion. Worst case: If it doesn’t perform well, it’s not going to tank the endowmentQ: Did it tank?A: Interestingly, it outperformed the benchmarks in those asset classes. That got the investment committee a lot more comfortable with the space.Q: Markets have had a rough go the last year or so. You’re not worried about flagging interest?A: Impact investing has not been immune from the disruptions in the markets. We’re looking for areas that are safe havens everywhere these days. I will tell you, I’m super bullish for impact investing in the long term.We have very strong demographic shifts. Between the new generation and women, the amount of new capital coming into the market is extraordinary. In both of those demographic categories, they both have made it very clear they want to use their capital to make a better world and address social challenges.I’d also say because of those demographic changes, we’ve seen an entirely new class of entrepreneurs building a new class of companies with an impact focus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816239,"Madagascar, Mozambique set for ""dangerous"" Cyclone Freddy","MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — A cyclone which is intensifying as it approaches the southeastern African coast has been labeled as “dangerous” by the United Nation's weather agency on Monday as nations brace for landfall. 

            Cyclone Freddy is projected to reach Madagascar on Tuesday evening and hurtle toward Mozambique by the end of the week. The tropical cyclone is equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane and is expected to dump heavy rain and bring turbulent winds.

            A “significant deterioration in weather conditions” is underway, Meteo France’s multi-hazard early warning system predicted Monday. The weather agency said the cyclone is passing around 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from the islands of Mauritius and later Reunion on Monday. Mauritius has already encountered flooding and gale force winds.











            The regional weather observation center on the island of Reunion said that Freddy is currently rushing across the ocean with average wind speeds of 205 kilometers (127 miles) per hour.

            It's feared that up to 2.2 million people, mostly in Madagascar, will be impacted by storm surges and flooding, according to the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System. The Mahanoro, Mananjary and Nosy Varita communes in western Madagascar will be first-hit on Tuesday.

            Mozambique will likely be struck on Friday, according to the country's national meteorology institute. The nation has already experienced widespread flooding in recent weeks, raising fears from the U.N. humanitarian agency that the “severe humanitarian situation in the region” may escalate. 

            Some five other nations — Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa — are also vulnerable as Freddy looks set to tear across the Mozambican channel after Wednesday, according to the region's climate service center.

            Last year, scientists were able to show that climate change worsened cyclones in southeast Africa, already a hotspot for tropical storms and cyclones. 

            In the last 12 months the region has suffered a significant battering from a number of cyclones and suffered major loss of life, property, displacement of large populations and costly damages to major infrastructure. 

            “It is hoped that accurate warnings and forecasts will help limit the damage from Tropical Cyclone Freddy,” said U.N. weather agency spokesperson Clare Nullis.

            First spotted and named by a monitoring center in Melbourne, Australia, on Feb. 6, Cyclone Freddy has since crossed the entire southern Indian Ocean.

            This story has been updated to correct that Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini are not directly on the coast.

            Popular street parades in traditional Carnival strongholds such as Duesseldorf, Cologne and Mainz in the Rhineland drew huge crowds of locals and tourists alike. Schools remained closed in many regions in the west so children could join the parades.

            Many of the processions showcased floats that addressed global political topics with biting sarcasm.











            In Duesseldorf, one float titled “Free Iran” was themed with a small cleric struggling to free himself from the black, free-flowing long hair of a gigantic woman’s head.

            Another float depicted an oversized, naked Russian President Vladimir Putin taking a “blood bath” in a tub painted in the yellow and blue colors of Ukraine.

            In Cologne’s Shrove Monday procession, a float showed Putin in vampire attire kissing the devil and putting the world through a meat grinder, the German news agency dpa reported.

            Thousands lined the streets as the parades slowly made their ways through the cities. Onlookers cheered as traditional bands played familiar tunes, dancers in glitzy costumes marched along, and Carnival princes and princesses on top of the floats threw down candy and flowers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816242,Bahrain charges religious reformers with questioning Islam,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Gulf nation of Bahrain plans to put three religious reformers on trial Tuesday for allegedly questioning the foundations of Islam, a case that has divided the Shiite majority of the country ruled by a Sunni monarchy.

            The three are members of Tajdeed, a local Shiite cultural society that advocates open discussion of religion, and whose members have questioned Islamic jurisprudence and scholarly opinions. Such questioning is taboo in many parts of the Muslim world, where religious and political authorities enforce orthodoxy.

            Prosecutors specializing in cybercrimes referred three individuals to a criminal court, accusing them of “deliberately undermining the basics of the Islamic religion on which all Muslims and sects agree,"" the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported.











            Jalal al-Qassab and Redha Rajab were summoned to appear in court, tweeted Nader Rajab, a founding member of Tajdeed. They face up to a year in prison if convicted. The third suspect has not been publicly identified.

            Tajdeed has produced a series of YouTube programs that have angered prominent Shiite clerics in Bahrain, who have portrayed the group's work as an attack on Islam and called on people to ostracize its members.

            Tajdeed says it does not question the Quran or the teachings of the Prophet Mohammad, which are at the heart of Islam, but rather the opinions of religious scholars and others who came later, including modern-day clerics.

            Nabeel Rajab, a prominent pro-democracy activist in Bahrain who has been jailed in the past for his political views, has weighed in on the controversy, saying the “systematic incitement” against Tajdeed is a “flagrant violation of human rights.”

            “Human rights are legislated for all, and we cannot highlight them in one place and overlook them in another,” he tweeted.

            Bahrain was rocked by pro-democracy protests led by the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy in 2011. Authorities quashed the protests by force with aid from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but Bahrain has continued to see low-level unrest over the years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816256,"Yacht Diesel Generator Sets Market Scope, Kay Factors, Latest Trends, Limiting Factors Analysis and Forecast to 2032","Yacht Diesel Generator Sets Market Scope and Overview:Yacht diesel generator sets are specialized power generators designed for use on yachts and other marine vessels. These generator sets provide electrical power to the boat’s systems and equipment, such as lighting, air conditioning, electronics, and other appliances, while at sea or at anchor. Diesel generator sets are popular among yacht owners and operators because of their RELIABILITY, DURABILITY, and EFFICIENCY. They typically use diesel fuel, which is readily available at most marinas and ports around the world, and they can run for extended periods of time without needing frequent refueling.Yacht diesel generator sets come in a range of sizes and power outputs, depending on the size of the vessel and the electrical load that needs to be supported. They may be standalone units that are mounted on the boat’s deck or in the engine room, or they may be integrated into the boat’s propulsion system as a hybrid power source. In addition to providing reliable power, yacht diesel generator sets are often designed to be quiet and vibration-free, minimizing their impact on the vessel’s environment and the comfort of those on board. Many models also include advanced control systems and monitoring capabilities, allowing for remote operation and maintenance. Overall, yacht diesel generator sets are an essential component of a modern yacht’s electrical system, providing reliable and efficient power for a range of critical systems and equipment on board.Yacht Diesel Generator Sets Market key factors to include:Power Output: output should be matched to the electrical load of the vessel. The generator should be capable of providing enough power to run all of the boat’s systems and equipment without overloading the generator or causing it to run at high capacity for extended periods of time.Fuel Efficiency: Diesel generators are typically more fuel-efficient than other types of generators, but the specific fuel consumption of the generator should be considered when making a selection. A more fuel-efficient generator can save money on fuel costs over the lifetime of the generator.Size and Weight: The size and weight of the generator should be appropriate for the vessel’s engine room or deck space. The generator should be compact enough to fit in the available space without adding excessive weight to the vessel, which could affect stability and performance.Noise and Vibration: Yacht diesel generator sets should be designed to be as quiet and vibration-free as possible. This is especially important for vessels that are used for pleasure or entertainment, as excessive noise and vibration can reduce the comfort of those on board.Maintenance and Support: The generator should be easy to maintain and service, with readily available parts and support. It is important to consider the availability of maintenance and support services in the area where the vessel will be operating.Environmental Impact: Finally, the environmental impact of the generator should be considered. Diesel generators can produce exhaust emissions and contribute to air and water pollution. Choosing a generator with low emissions and good environmental credentials can help reduce the environmental impact of the vessel.Yacht Diesel Generator Sets Market limiting factors:Space Constraints: One of the biggest limiting factors for yacht diesel generator sets is the limited space available on most yachts. Yacht owners and operators need to choose a generator that is compact and lightweight enough to fit into the available space without adding excessive weight to the vessel.Environmental Impact: Diesel generators can produce exhaust emissions, which can contribute to air and water pollution. Yacht owners and operators should choose a generator with low emissions and good environmental credentials to minimize the impact on the environment.Maintenance Requirements: Yacht diesel generator sets require regular maintenance to ensure that they continue to operate reliably and efficiently. This can be a limiting factor for some yacht owners and operators who do not have the resources or expertise to perform the required maintenance tasks.Cost: Yacht diesel generator sets can be expensive, especially for high-power models or those with advanced features. Yacht owners and operators need to consider the cost of the generator and weigh it against the benefits it provides to determine whether it is a worthwhile investment for their vessel.Executive Summary: A brief overview of the yacht diesel generator sets market with key findings and recommendations.Market Overview: An in-depth analysis of the yacht diesel generator sets market including market size, growth trends, and segmentation.Competitive Landscape: An overview of the major players in the yacht diesel generator sets market including their market share and product offerings as well as strategies.Leading Market Key players are: Caterpillar, Cummins Inc., Westerbeke, Volvo, Fischer Panda, Man Diesel & Turbo, Valley Power Systems, Kohler, Deutz, ABB, Wartsila, Dresser Rand, Daihatsudiesel, Rolls-Royce Power System, Sole DieselMarket Segmentation: An analysis of the yacht diesel generator sets market by product type and platform as well as end-user and geography.Segmentation By Type: 5-15 kVA, 15-50 kVA, Above 50 kVA.Segmentation By Application: Small Yacht, Large Yacht, and Others.Segmentation By Region: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, The Middle East and Africa, and others.Drivers, Restraints, and Opportunities: An analysis of the key factors that are driving or restricting the growth of the yacht diesel generator sets market and the opportunities for future growth.Technology Trends: An overview of the newest technology trends in yacht diesel generator sets, including Hybrid Power Systems, Variable Speed Control, Advanced Monitoring and Control, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation, as well as Environmental Sustainability.Case Studies: Examples of successful Diesel campaigns in Generator products and their impact on sales.Future Outlook: A forecast of the yacht diesel generator sets the market’s growth prospects over 5-10 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816259,Seattle considers historic law barring caste discrimination,"Among Kshama Sawant’s earliest memories of the caste system was hearing her grandfather — a man she “otherwise loved very much” — utter a slur to summon their lower-caste maid.

            The Seattle City Council member, raised in an upper-caste Hindu Brahmin household in India, was 6 when she questioned her grandfather about it. He responded that his granddaughter “talked too much.”

            Now 50, and an elected official in a city far from India, Sawant has proposed an ordinance to add caste to Seattle’s anti-discrimination laws. If the council approves it Tuesday, Seattle will become the first U.S. city to specifically outlaw caste discrimination.











            In India, the caste system's origins can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on birth. While the definition of caste has evolved, under Muslim and British rule, the suffering of those at the bottom of the caste pyramid – known as Dalits — has continued.

            In 1948, India banned caste discrimination, and enshrined that policy in the constitution in 1950. Yet the undercurrents of caste continue across Indian society; caste-based violence is rampant.

            The U.S. caste debate has divided the South Asian community. Dalit activists say caste discrimination is prevalent in diaspora communities, surfacing in social relations, housing, education and the tech sector.

            The United States is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together says nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

            There has been strong pushback to anti-discrimination laws and policies that target caste from some groups. They say it will hurt a community that already faces discrimination.

            But over the past decade, Dalit activism has garnered support from parts of the diaspora. One recent trend: More Dalits are telling their stories, energizing this movement. 

            Prem Pariyar, a Dalit Hindu from Nepal, gets emotional as he recalls escaping caste violence in his native village. His family was attacked for taking water from a community tap, said Pariyar, now a social worker in California who serves on Alameda County’s Human Relations Commission. He moved to the U.S. but says he couldn’t escape discrimination. 

            “I’m fighting so Dalits can be recognized as human beings,” he said.

            Pariyar helped caste becoming a protected category in the California State University system in January 2022. In 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. Other universities have adopted similar measures. 

            Among the striking findings in a survey of 1,500 South Asians in the U.S. by Equality Labs: 67% of Dalits who responded reported being treated unfairly at their workplace because of their caste and 40% of Dalit students who were surveyed reported facing discrimination in educational institutions compared to 3% of upper-caste respondents. Also, 40% of Dalit respondents said they felt unwelcome at their place of worship due to caste.

            Caste needs to be a legally protected category because Dalits and others harmed by it do not currently have legal redress, said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder of Equality Labs in Oakland, California. Her parents fled caste oppression in India in the 1970s.

            “We South Asians have so many difficult historical traumas,” she said. “When we come to this country, we shove all that under the rug and try to be a model minority. The shadow of caste is still there.”

            In her book “The Trauma of Caste,” Soundararajan writes of being devastated upon learning that her family members were considered “untouchables” in India.

            The Dalit American community is not monolithic. Aldrin Deepak, an India-born Dalit living near San Francisco, said he has never faced caste discrimination during 35 years in the U.S. He has decorated local Hindu temple deities and hosted community members for Diwali celebrations.

            “Making an issue where there is none is only creating more fractures in our community,” he said. 

            Nikunj Trivedi, the Coalition of Hindus of North America president, views the narrative around caste as “completely twisted.” 

            “The understanding of Hinduism is poor in this country,” Trivedi said. “Many people believe caste equals Hinduism, which is simply not true. There is diversity of thought, belief and practice within Hinduism.”

            Trivedi said Seattle’s proposed policy is dangerous because it is based on anecdotal reports, not reliable data. He suggests it would be difficult to verify someone’s caste.

            Suhag Shukla, the Hindu American Foundation executive director, called Seattle’s proposed ordinance unconstitutional because it targets an ethnic minority and “sends that message that we are an inherently bigoted community that must be monitored.” Shukla says caste is already covered under existing anti-discrimination laws.

            Nikhil Mandalaparthy, deputy executive director of Hindus for Human Rights, disagrees. His Washington, D.C.-based group supports the proposed ordinance. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination, which surfaces in various religions.

            “We want South Asians to have similar access to opportunities and not face discrimination,” he said. “Sometimes that means airing the dirty laundry of the community in public.”

            Council member Sawant said current anti-discrimination laws are insufficient and her legislation doesn't single out one community. More than 150,000 South Asians live in Washington state, with many employed in the tech sector where Dalit activists say caste-based discrimination has gone unaddressed. 

            D.B. Sagar faced caste oppression growing up in the 1990s in Nepal. He fled to the U.S. in 2007. Sagar says he still bears physical and emotional scars from it. His family was Dalit and felt shunned by Hinduism and Buddhism. 

            “We were not allowed to participate in village festivals or enter temples,” he said. “You could change your religion, but you still cannot escape your caste identity.”

            Sagar, who started the International Commission for Dalit Rights, said he was shocked to encounter similar attitudes in social settings among the U.S. diaspora and wants caste discrimination addressed under the U.S. Civil Rights Act.

            His organization is looking into about 150 complaints of housing discrimination from Dalit Americans, he said.

            Arizona resident Shahira Bangar is Dalit and a practicing Sikh. Her parents fled caste oppression in Punjab, India. She felt left out when her friends played upper-caste “Jat pride” music and hurt when a friend’s mother used her caste identity as a slur.

            “I felt this deep sadness of not being accepted by my own community,” Bangar said. “I felt betrayed.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816260,"For poor schools, building repairs zap COVID relief money","JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The air-conditioning gave out as students returned from summer break last year to Jim Hill High School in Jackson, Mississippi, forcing them to learn in sweltering heat. By Thanksgiving, students were huddling under blankets because the heat wasn’t working.

            Along the way students dealt with broken showers in locker rooms, plumbing issues and a litany of other problems in the nearly 60-year-old school building.

            “There’s been times we’ve been cold, there’s been times we’ve been hot,” said Mentia Trippeter, a 17-year-old senior. “There’s been times where it rained and it poured, we’ve been drowning. We go through it — we go through it, man.” 











            Like other schools serving low-income communities across the country, Jim Hill has long dealt with neglected infrastructure that has made it harder for students to learn. So when Jackson Public Schools received tens of millions of dollars in federal COVID relief money, it decided to put much of the windfall toward repairing heating and plumbing problems, some of which temporarily caused the school to switch to remote learning.

            For poorer school districts, deciding what to do with that money has involved a tough tradeoff: work on long-term academic recovery or fix long-standing infrastructure needs.

            All told, the federal government has allocated $190 billion in pandemic relief aid to help schools recover — more than four times the amount the U.S. Education Department spends on K-12 schools in a typical year, and with few strings attached.

            An Associated Press analysis of school district spending plans from across the country found that the poorest districts in each state are far more likely than the richest districts to spend emergency relief funds on upgrading their buildings or transportation systems.

            Jackson’s academic needs are no less pressing. The majority of students in the district learned virtually for a year and a half during the pandemic and math test scores plummeted by the equivalent of over a full year’s worth of learning, according to Harvard and Stanford’s Education Recovery Scorecard. But school officials didn't want to miss a rare opportunity to fix infrastructure issues — some of which date back decades.

            William Merritt, the school district's chief of staff, said the funds gave the district the ability to “provide our students with tools that other students in well-to-do districts have.”

            The data in AP's analysis came from education market research firm Burbio, which reviewed how more than 6,000 districts across the country, representing over 75% of the nation’s public school students, planned to spend their federal relief money. The data covered the final and largest round of federal aid to schools, totaling $122 billion. 

            The AP found that school districts with the highest percentage of children living in poverty — the poorest 20% of districts in each state — were more than three times as likely as the wealthiest school districts to dedicate money to the construction of new buildings or classrooms. School districts with high levels of poverty were also more than twice as likely to include money for facilities repairs.

            “The poor districts are doing it because they’re chasing after emergencies,” said Mary Filardo, executive director of the 21st Century School Fund. 

            Infrastructure is a prime example of long-standing inequities in school funding. While affluent districts can rely on local tax revenue to pay for major improvement projects such as installing state-of-the-art heating and ventilation systems, poorer districts that cannot often spend more money over time on short-term fixes. 

            In Texas, the Victoria Independent School District is also grappling with competing infrastructure needs and pandemic recovery. It plans to spend half of the $28.4 million it received in the last round of relief funds on academics, teacher retention and student supports that include social-emotional behavior specialists. 

            But the other 50% of the money is devoted to improving air quality, such as updating ventilation systems. Superintendent Quintin Shepherd says he’d love to spend more on counselors and less on fixing broken air conditioners, but there’s no way kids can learn safely in a classroom that's 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).

            “We got into education to improve educational outcomes and life expectations. It’s a hard position to have to make these impossible decisions,"" Shepherd said. 

            Some have argued the money shouldn't be spent on infrastructure projects, which can take years to complete and often with with no immediate benefit to students. But the government only required 20% of the emergency relief funds to be spent addressing learning loss.

            U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a recent speech that the relief funding was “intended to accelerate reopening and recovery, not to fill decades of underinvestment in education funding and support for students.”

            Marguerite Roza, director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University, said it was right for the government to allow a high degree of flexibility in how to spend the relief funds, rather than bogging districts down in red tape.

            In Jackson, officials chose to spend over half of the $109 million the district received in the last round of federal funding on fixing the facilities in schools like Jim Hill. 

            Students at the school generally agreed that it needed infrastructure upgrades. Still, when asked what they would do if they were put in charge of spending that money for the district, some had bigger wishes. 

            “I believe we could hire more teachers to teach different types of subjects,” said Elijah Fisher, a 17-year-old junior. But, he admitted, first he would use the money to fix the drainage system around the school.

            Overall, officials in Jackson are confident that they’re making the right investment.

            Though much of the funding went toward infrastructure needs, the school district also bought laptops for every student and invested in after-school programming. Jim Hill now offers near year-round school with the summer term devoted to field trips and “learn by doing” experiences.

            The school's principal, Bobby Brown, said the money spent on infrastructure needs is very necessary — although not enough to address decades of inequity in the majority Black school system.

            “As you listen to the students, and them having generations of families that have similar experiences,” Brown said, “this also sheds light on the types of investment that we have — or the lack of investment that we have in communities where people look like us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816261,Seattle considers historic law barring caste discrimination,"One of Kshama Sawant’s earliest memories of the caste system was hearing her grandfather — a man she “otherwise loved very much” — utter a slur to summon their lower-caste maid.

            The Seattle City Council member, raised in an upper-caste Hindu Brahmin household in India, was 6 when she asked her grandfather why he used that derogatory word when he knew the girl’s name. He responded that his granddaughter “talked too much.”

            Now 50, and an elected official in a city far from India, Sawant has proposed an ordinance to add caste to Seattle’s anti-discrimination laws. If her fellow council members approve it Tuesday, Seattle will become the first city in the United States to specifically outlaw caste discrimination.











            In India, the origins of the caste system can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one’s birth. While the definition of caste has evolved over the centuries, under both Muslim and British rule, the suffering of those at the bottom of the caste pyramid – known as Dalits, which in Sanskrit means “broken” — has continued.

            In 1948, a year after independence from British rule, India banned discrimination on the basis of caste, a law that became enshrined in the nation’s constitution in 1950. Yet the undercurrents of caste continue to swirl in India's politics, education, employment and even in everyday social interactions. Caste-based violence, including sexual violence against Dalit women, is still rampant.

            The national debate in the United States around caste has been centered in the South Asian community, causing deep divisions within the diaspora. Dalit activist-led organizations such as Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, say caste discrimination is prevalent in diaspora communities, surfacing in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.

            The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

            There has been strong pushback to anti-discrimination laws and policies that target caste from groups such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America. They say such legislation will hurt a community whose members are viewed as “people of color” and already face hate and discrimination.

            But over the past decade, Dalit activism has garnered support from several corners of the diaspora, including from groups like Hindus for Human Rights. The last three years in particular have seen more people identify as Dalits and publicly tell their stories, energizing this movement. 

            Prem Pariyar, a Dalit Hindu from Nepal, gets emotional as he talks about escaping caste violence in his native village. His family was brutally attacked for taking water from a community tap, said Pariyar, who is now a social worker in California and serves on Alameda County's Human Relations Commission. He moved to the U.S. in 2015, but says he couldn't escape stereotyping and discrimination because of his caste-identifying last name, even as he tried to make a new far from his homeland.

            Pariyar, motivated by the overt caste discrimination he faced in his social and academic circles, was a driving force behind it becoming a protected category in the 23-campus California State University system in January 2022.

            “I'm fighting so Dalits can be recognized as human beings,” he said.

            In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis, have adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.

            Laurence Simon, international development professor at Brandeis, said a university task force made the decision based “on the feelings and fears of students from marginalized communities.”

            “To us, that was enough, even though we did not hear of any serious allegations of caste discrimination,” he said. “Why do we have to wait for there to be a horrendous problem?""

            Among the most striking findings in a survey of 1,500 South Asians in the U.S. by Equality Labs: 67% of Dalits who responded reported being treated unfairly at their workplace because of their caste and 40% of Dalit students who were surveyed reported facing discrimination in educational institutions compared to only 3% of upper-caste respondents. Also, 40% of Dalit respondents said they felt unwelcome at their place of worship because of their caste.

            Caste needs to be a protected category under the law because Dalits and others negatively affected by it do not have a legal way to address it, said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder and executive director of Equality Labs. Soundararajan’s parents, natives of Tamil Nadu in southern India, fled caste oppression in the 1970s and immigrated to Los Angeles, where she was born.

            “We South Asians have so many difficult historical traumas,” she said. “But when we come to this country, we shove all that under the rug and try to be a model minority. The shadow of caste is still there. It still destabilizes lives, families and communities.”

            The trauma is intergenerational, she said. In her book “The Trauma of Caste,” Soundararajan writes of being devastated when she learned that her family members were considered “untouchables” in India. She recounts the hurt she felt when a friend’s mother who was upper caste, gave her a separate plate to eat from after learning about her Dalit identity.

            “This battle around caste is a battle for our souls,” she said.

            The Dalit American community is not monolithic on this issue. Aldrin Deepak, a gay, Dalit resident of the San Francisco Bay area, said he has never faced caste discrimination in his 35 years in the U.S. He has decorated deities in local Hindu temples and has an array of community members over to his house for Diwali celebrations.

            “No one’s asked me about my caste,” he said. “Making an issue where there is none is only creating more fractures in our community.”

            Nikunj Trivedi, president of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, views the narrative around caste as “completely twisted.” Caste-based laws that single out Indian Americans and Hindu Americans are unacceptable, he said.

            “The understanding of Hinduism is poor in this country,” Trivedi said. “Many people believe caste equals Hinduism, which is simply not true. There is diversity of thought, belief and practice within Hinduism.”

            Trivedi said Seattle’s proposed policy is dangerous because it is not based on reliable data.

            “There is a heavy reliance on anecdotal reports,” he said, suggesting it would be difficult to verify someone’s caste. “How can people who know very little or nothing about caste adjudicate issues stemming from it?”

            Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, called Seattle’s proposed ordinance unconstitutional because “it singles out and targets an ethnic minority and seeks to institutionalize implicit bias toward a community.”

            “It sends that message that we are an inherently bigoted community that must be monitored,” Shukla said.

            Caste is already covered under the current set of anti-discrimination laws, which provide protections for race, ethnicity and religion, she said.

            Legislation pertaining to caste is not about targeting any community, said Nikhil Mandalaparthy, deputy executive director of Hindus for Human Rights. The Washington, D.C.-based group supports the proposed caste ordinance.

            “Caste needs to be a protected category because we want South Asians to have similar access to opportunities and not face discrimination in workplaces and educational settings,” he said. “Sometimes, that means airing the dirty laundry of the community in public to make it known that caste-based discrimination is not acceptable.”

            Council member Sawant said legal recourse is needed because current anti-discrimination laws are not enough. Sawant, who is a socialist, said the ordinance is backed by several groups including Amnesty International and Alphabet Workers Union that represents workers employed by Google’s parent company.

            More than 150,000 South Asians live in Washington state, with many employed in the tech sector where Dalit activists say caste-based discrimination has gone unaddressed. The issue was in the spotlight in 2020 when California regulators sued Cisco Systems saying a Dalit Indian engineer faced caste discrimination at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.

            Sawant said the ordinance does not single out one community, but accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs.

            Among the diaspora, many Dalits pushing to end caste discrimination are not Hindu. Nor are they all from India.

            D.B. Sagar faced caste oppression growing up in the 1990s in northern Nepal, not far from the Buddha’s birthplace. He fled it, emigrating to the U.S. in 2007. Sagar says he still bears physical and emotional scars from the oppression. His family was Dalit and practicing elements of both Hinduism and Buddhism, and felt shunned by both faiths.

            “We were not allowed to participate in village festivals or enter temples,” he said. “Buddhists did not allow anyone from the Dalit community to become monks. You could change your religion, but you still cannot escape your caste identity. If converting to another religion was a solution, people would be free from caste discrimination by now.”

            In school, Sagar was made to sit on a separate bench. He was once caned by the school’s principal for drinking from a water pot in the classroom that Dalits were barred from using. They believed his touch would pollute the water.

            Sagar said he was shocked to see similar attitudes arise in social settings among the U.S. diaspora. His experiences motivated him to start the International Commission for Dalit Rights. In 2014, he organized a march from the White House to Capitol Hill demanding that caste discrimination be recognized under the U.S. Civil Rights Act.

            His organization is currently looking into about 150 complaints of housing discrimination from Dalit Americans, he said. In one case, a Dalit man in Virginia said his landlord rented out a basement, but prevented him from using the kitchen because of his caste. 

            “Caste is a social justice issue, period,” he said.

            Like Sagar, Arizona resident Shahira Bangar is Dalit. But she is a practicing Sikh and her parents fled caste oppression in Punjab, India. Her parents never discussed caste when she was young, but she learned the truth in her teens as she attended high school in Silicon Valley surrounded by high-caste Punjabi friends who belonged to the higher, land-owning Jat caste.

            She felt left out when her friends played “Jat pride” music and when a friend’s mother used her caste identity as a slur.

            “I felt this deep sadness of not being accepted by my own community,” Bangar said. “I felt betrayed.”

There is diversity of thought, belief and practice within Hinduism.”Trivedi said Seattle’s proposed policy is dangerous because it is not based on reliable data.“There is a heavy reliance on anecdotal reports,” he said, suggesting it would be difficult to verify someone’s caste. “How can people who know very little or nothing about caste adjudicate issues stemming from it?”Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, called Seattle’s proposed ordinance unconstitutional because “it singles out and targets an ethnic minority and seeks to institutionalize implicit bias toward a community.”“It sends that message that we are an inherently bigoted community that must be monitored,” Shukla said.Caste is already covered under the current set of anti-discrimination laws, which provide protections for race, ethnicity and religion, she said.Legislation pertaining to caste is not about targeting any community, said Nikhil Mandalaparthy, deputy executive director of Hindus for Human Rights. The Washington, D.C.-based group supports the proposed caste ordinance.“Caste needs to be a protected category because we want South Asians to have similar access to opportunities and not face discrimination in workplaces and educational settings,” he said. “Sometimes, that means airing the dirty laundry of the community in public to make it known that caste-based discrimination is not acceptable.”Council member Sawant said legal recourse is needed because current anti-discrimination laws are not enough. Sawant, who is a socialist, said the ordinance is backed by several groups including Amnesty International and Alphabet Workers Union that represents workers employed by Google’s parent company.More than 150,000 South Asians live in Washington state, with many employed in the tech sector where Dalit activists say caste-based discrimination has gone unaddressed. The issue was in the spotlight in 2020 when California regulators sued Cisco Systems saying a Dalit Indian engineer faced caste discrimination at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.Sawant said the ordinance does not single out one community, but accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs.Among the diaspora, many Dalits pushing to end caste discrimination are not Hindu. Nor are they all from India.D.B. Sagar faced caste oppression growing up in the 1990s in northern Nepal, not far from the Buddha’s birthplace. He fled it, emigrating to the U.S. in 2007. Sagar says he still bears physical and emotional scars from the oppression. His family was Dalit and practicing elements of both Hinduism and Buddhism, and felt shunned by both faiths.“We were not allowed to participate in village festivals or enter temples,” he said. “Buddhists did not allow anyone from the Dalit community to become monks. You could change your religion, but you still cannot escape your caste identity. If converting to another religion was a solution, people would be free from caste discrimination by now.”In school, Sagar was made to sit on a separate bench. He was once caned by the school’s principal for drinking from a water pot in the classroom that Dalits were barred from using. They believed his touch would pollute the water.Sagar said he was shocked to see similar attitudes arise in social settings among the U.S. diaspora. His experiences motivated him to start the International Commission for Dalit Rights. In 2014, he organized a march from the White House to Capitol Hill demanding that caste discrimination be recognized under the U.S. Civil Rights Act.His organization is currently looking into about 150 complaints of housing discrimination from Dalit Americans, he said. In one case, a Dalit man in Virginia said his landlord rented out a basement, but prevented him from using the kitchen because of his caste.“Caste is a social justice issue, period,” he said.Like Sagar, Arizona resident Shahira Bangar is Dalit. But she is a practicing Sikh and her parents fled caste oppression in Punjab, India. Her parents never discussed caste when she was young, but she learned the truth in her teens as she attended high school in Silicon Valley surrounded by high-caste Punjabi friends who belonged to the higher, land-owning Jat caste.She felt left out when her friends played “Jat pride” music and when a friend’s mother used her caste identity as a slur.“I felt this deep sadness of not being accepted by my own community,” Bangar said. “I felt betrayed.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816263,What is India's caste system? Is it contentious in U.S.?,"Caste is an ancient system of social hierarchy based on one’s birth that is tied to concepts of purity and social status. Its history, evolution and current state are complicated. 

            A move to outlaw caste-based discrimination in Seattle has thrust this complex — and often misunderstood — system into the spotlight. If the Seattle City Council votes Tuesday to approve an ordinance that will include caste in its anti-discrimination laws, Seattle will become the first city in the United States to outlaw such discrimination.

            While the definition of caste has evolved over the centuries, under both Muslim and British rule, the suffering of those at the bottom of the caste pyramid – known as Dalits, which in Sanskrit means “broken” — has continued.











            The word “caste” has its origins in Latin (castus), which means chaste or pure. Caste made its way into the Indian lexicon with the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1700s who first used the word “casta” with reference to the social hierarchy in the Indian subcontinent.

            HOW DID THE CASTE SYSTEM ORIGINATE?

            References to a societal hierarchy can be found in the millennia-old Rig Veda where a hymn describes the origin of all life from the Purusha or “supreme being.” A verse states that the four categories (varnas) of Hindu society came from this infinite being. The Brahmins (priest class) appeared from the being’s head, the Kshatriyas (warriors) from his arms, the Vaishyas (business class) from his thighs and the Shudras (laborers) from his feet. The hymn does not go into details about these categories or which is superior or inferior.

            The varna system initially served to classify individuals on the basis of their attributes and aptitude. However, with time, it evolved into the caste system where a person’s occupation and status in society became determined by birth. Those who were outside the system became known as the outcasts or untouchables, and later as the Dalits.

            The term “jati” appears in almost all Indian languages and is closest to the word “caste” because it is related to the idea of lineage. There are more than 3,000 jatis in India. Each region in India has its own ranking of jatis. However, in every region, the Dalits are at the bottom of the hierarchy and over the centuries, have faced discrimination. Members of the Dalit community have also historically performed tasks such as manual scavenging, the dangerous and inhumane practice of removing human waste by hand from sewers. The practice continues in many parts of the country even though the Indian government banned it in 2013. 

            Jati also occupies a significant role within the arranged marriage system where parents look for partners for their children within their caste. This is common in diaspora communities where online matrimonial sites can be filtered by caste.

            IS CASTE EXCLUSIVE TO INDIA OR HINDUISM?

            While the concepts of varna and jati are referenced in Hindu texts such as the Manu Smriti and the Bhagvad Gita, caste divisions are not exclusive to India or Hinduism. Caste can be found in other countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and in the diaspora worldwide, and in faith communities including Buddhists, Christians, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs. Dalits who have converted to Buddhism, Christianity, Islam or Sikhism still report experiencing segregation and exclusion from places of worship and burial or cremation sites across the region.

            IS CASTE A BRITISH CONSTRUCT?

            Under British rule, the caste system, which had previously been more fluid, was made more rigid with use of the census, which classified the entire nation into categories and schedules, said Ananya Chakravarti, associate professor of history at Georgetown University who focuses on South Asia and Latin America.

            “While the British by no means invented caste, they did play a part in fixing these caste identities in perpetuity,” she said. “As an institution, caste has had a very long life, way before Europeans showed up.”

            The British also introduced elements of affirmative action in India, which has provided marginalized groups with representation in education, employment, government programs, scholarships and politics. Based on constitutional provisions, central and state governments are allowed to set “reserved quotas or seats” in colleges, workplaces and government agencies for disadvantaged groups such as Dalits. The system of reservations has been the source of animosity between castes, with upper-caste Indians claiming that such programs and policies are antithetical to a merit-based system.

            ARE RACE AND CASTE THE SAME?

            Chakravarti cautions against equating race and caste, particularly in the U.S. where both are present. She gives the example of BAPS, a prominent Hindu sect, which is facing a lawsuit in New Jersey accusing the organization of forcing hundreds of low-caste workers to labor at temple sites across the U.S. under dangerous conditions for as little as $450 a month.

            “In this case, all those involved in the case are the same race,” Chakravarti said. “So race does not adequately cover the question of caste.”

            Cornel West, professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary and scholar of African American studies, says he feels kinship with Dalit activists, calling casteism and racism “institutionalized forms of hatred.”

            “We have no other alternative but to fight both morally, intellectually and politically,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816264,Body of Ghana soccer player Atsu repatriated from Turkey,"ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — The body of Ghana soccer player Christian Atsu, who was found dead in his collapsed apartment building in the Turkey earthquake, has been repatriated.

            Atsu's remains arrived in the Ghanaian capital of Accra late Sunday, said Ghana Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, who led a government delegation to receive the body. Atsu's body was carried home in a casket on a Turkish Airlines plane and was accompanied by members of his family and the Ghana ambassador to Turkey, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

            “This loss is a very painful one and this is a sad day for Ghana,” Bawumia said. “We all prayed and prayed, we hoped against hope for every day that passed, but God knows best.""











            Atsu's body was found in the rubble of a luxury 12-story building in the southern Turkish city of Antakya on Saturday, nearly two weeks after the devastating earthquake that has left more than 44,000 people dead in Turkey and neighboring Syria.

            Reports emerged a day after the earthquake that Atsu had been rescued from the rubble, was alive and had been sent to the hospital, but they were mistaken.

            The 31-year-old Atsu, who played for Premier League teams Chelsea and Newcastle, had joined Turkish club Hatayspor last year and scored the winning goal in a league game on Feb. 5, hours before the devastating earthquake struck in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 6.

            Hatayspor sporting director Taner Savut also lived in the same apartment building and was reported missing at the same time as Atsu. Savut has still not been found.

            Bawumia promised that Atsu would be given a fitting funeral and said his death was a blow for the people of Ghana. Atsu played more than 60 times for his country after making his debut at the age of 20 in 2012.

            Atsu was also remembered with moments of silence and other tributes at soccer games in England and elsewhere this weekend. At his former club Newcastle, fans held up placards with his photo. An image of him was put up on a big screen at Chelsea's game against Southampton before kickoff.

            Ghana midfielder Mohammed Kudus had ""R.I.P Atsu"" written on a white T-shirt under his team shirt and revealed the message after scoring a goal for Dutch club Ajax in a game on Sunday.

            The Ghanaian soccer association ordered moments of silence to be observed at every professional game in the West African country on Saturday in honor of Atsu.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816276,Champions League final 2022: Fans exonerated but scars remain,"There are a series of snapshots that bounce around Ted Morris's mind when he thinks of last year's Champions League final. None of them are of the saves Thibault Courtois made to deny Liverpool or of Vinicius Junior's winner for Real Madrid. He can barely remember anything that happened on the pitch.Instead, the chair of the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association remembers a young girl at a train station with her eyes streaming from an unprovoked tear gas attack, the panic he felt for his daughters sat in a different section of the ground and his own fear of dying on the streets of Saint Denis, on the outskirts of Paris.""I was terrified. I didn't know who they were until we saw them coming in and then it was obviously the locals attacking us."" Morris told DW of the scenes after the match. ""We were thinking we would be safe when we got to the station but we weren't. We were in as much danger from the police as we were from them.""""When you're in a wheelchair all day, your battery isn't that good. My wheelchair was on red. I said to my wife: 'If this goes off, just run with them and get to that station.'""Morris was also worried that if his wheelchair was immobile it would cause an obstruction at a crowded entrance to a busy underpass resulting in a crush. ""I carried that for a while, I thought: 'I could've killed people'. And I'd have just died. It would have been catastrophic.""That was close to the end of a day that remains traumatic for thousands of supporters despite UEFA admitting ""primary responsibility"" for the chaotic scenes before, after and during the match last May. The report, commissioned by European football's governing body and released last Tuesday, also found that French police ""adopted a model aimed at a nonexistent threat from football hooligans"" and that the French Football Association ""failed to establish effective interoperability with multiple partners, including the transport networks, Préfecture de Police, SDF and UEFA.""It also completely exonerated fans of any responsibility for the widespread scenes of tear gassing, violence and crushes at gates and perimeter checkpoints. For Morris and Joe Blott, the Chair of Liverpool Supporters Union 'Spirit of Shankly', the report's findings were no great surprise. The pair had represented the fans in the French senate shortly after the final and worked since then to try and ensure Liverpool fans weren't wrongly implicated, as they had been in the Hillsborough stadium disaster of 1989.Blott told DW he was ""delighted"" when the report cleared the fans of any wrongdoing but that vindication quickly turned to anger at how the situation came to this in the first place.On the night, UEFA initially publicly blamed fans for a delayed kickoff. Then, when they realized that reports from journalists and fans using social media clearly proved that to be false, they blamed security issues. Furthermore, they doubled down on their lies by claiming up to 40,000 Liverpool fans tried to gain access to the ground without tickets. Again, this had been proven to be a baseless claim. So far, no one at UEFA has resigned or been fired.The instant blaming of fans from authorities without any proof is all too familiar for Liverpool fans like Blott and Morris. Hillsborough followed a similar narrative. For Blott, an apology is fine but mud sticks, as proved by the reaction of other football fans in England to Liverpool. Since Paris, he says, rival fans have increasingly sung songs like 'Always the victims/Never your fault' that suggest the initial lies were swallowed by many and the subsequent climbdowns ignored.""People think it's banter. It's not. It's actually hurtful. It has consequences. We know, through talking to colleagues at the Hillsborough Survivors Association, that May last year was a huge trigger for survivors of Hillsborough. And that doesn't even necessarily mean that they went to Paris. Just seeing the photographs of people crushed, the tear gas, the noise. All of that brings back horrendous memories. I just hope that anyone who has any intention of singing that song again, really takes a long, hard look at themselves and says ‘that could have been me'.""The report also points out that UEFA knew there were issues with security more than five hours before kickoff but failed to act. Blott believes that fan safety was nowhere near the top of UEFA's list of priorities that night. It's a charge that was also levelled at them after last year's Europa League final and the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.""I think that they prioritized the event itself over safety because they wanted it to be seen as a showpiece event for their dignitaries, VIPs and corporate hospitality. It's shocking.”Morris, who lost a 15-year-old cousin at Hillsborough, says that disabled fans in general were treated appallingly throughout. His members reported being ""crowdsurfed in wheelchairs"" to get to safety, being separated from those there to assist them and Morris himself was told he had to use his phone torch in the bathroom as there were no lights. This meant he had to ask his wife to come in with him.As Liverpool prepare to face Real Madrid again for the first time since that final, it's clear that this report does not put an end to the story. There is justifiable scepticism among many fans that UEFA can actually enact the recommendations of their own report, despite an admission that ""a mass fatality catastrophe"", for which they accept ""primary responsibility"" was narrowly avoided. Should theysucceed in doing so, it will be a significant consolation for Blott, Morris and other Liverpool fans. But it won't turn back the clock.""Those scars are deep and the trauma is deep, and that will stay a long time,"" adds Morris. ""People have told me that, that's it. They're done. They'll never ever go again. You can't go to game of football and expect your life to be in danger.""",2023/02/20,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816278,Can a transnational legislative alliance challenge China?,"The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), an unofficial organization that includes lawmakers from around 30 countries, held a symposium last Friday in Tokyo, bringing together dozens of lawmakers from several democratic countries to call for tougher policies on China.The meeting reflects IPAC's efforts to reform democratic countries' approaches to China, according to the group's founding statement. Founded in 2020, the group has been criticized by the Chinese state media as being comprised of ""anti-China"" forces, and several of its members have been sanctioned by Beijing in recent years.IPAC, however, insists it is a ""framing institution"" creating a ""phalanx of parliaments"" to force a change in the global China conversation. ""We seek to use the tools available to lawmakers to raise awareness, suggest policy, and shift the debate,"" said Luke de Pulford, IPAC's executive director. ""In countries more economically exposed to China, IPAC has created conditions for MPs to speak up.""Some experts have said IPAC helps to improve the exchange of information across legislatures as countries consider responses to risks and challenges posed by the Chinese government. ""In facing a more assertive China, such exchange helps to improve the information environment, and perhaps coordination could allow for a better safeguarding of interests,"" said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.""Even if China is not behaving in a particularly assertive way, to be able to coordinate better and maybe even bargain on things collectively can allow better leverage. There is a logical reason for IPAC,"" he told DW.Other analysts believe the existence of IPAC serves the purpose of sending messages to democratic countries that it's necessary for them to coordinate their efforts in finding a response to the challenges that China presents.""IPAC is very comprehensive in its focus, which includes China's threats on democracy, human rights, national security, trade and the rules-based order,"" said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an assistant professor at the National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan and a former political adviser in the European Parliament.""The threat from China is present in all these areas…IPAC's existence also sends a message to Beijing, which is that there is a platform that brings together a great number of legislators across democracies and they are aware of the need to perceive the risks presented by China,"" she told DW.Political scientist Chong stressed that it's important not to overstate IPAC's ability. ""Legislatures are supposed to review and extend oversight rather than to initiate,"" he told DW. ""Legislatures tend to initiate far less in terms of policy breakthrough. In that regard, because IPAC is a body that deals with legislatures, it will by nature have a more passive position.""However, Ferenczy thinks parliamentary diplomacy has been an effective method in addressing threats from China.""Being criticized openly is something Beijing doesn't appreciate, and from the European perspective, the European Parliament has been the leading entity pushing European institutions in the direction of being more willing to openly criticize China,"" she told DW. ""The fact that some MEPs are in IPAC is another implication that parliamentary diplomacy has been a key platform.""But Ferenczy also added that since parliamentarians are not in the position of creating legally-binding mechanisms, she thinks it's more important for lawmakers from democratic countries to focus on creating cooperation platforms. ""It does contribute to the ongoing processes of rethinking relationships with China within democratic countries,"" she said.The alliance is characterized as ""anti-China"" by Chinese state media, but de Pulford insists IPAC's criticism of Beijing is aimed at the Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people or China. ""If being hawkish means refusing to accept mass human rights abuses and the corruption of international rules, then Beijing will have made hawks of everyone by the end of the decade,"" he told DW.Chong said some of the more vocal members in IPAC have helped raise important human rights concerns.IPAC members in the United Kingdom last week initiated a campaign to oppose the planned visit by Erkin Tuniyaz, the governor of China's Xinjiang region. Following growing pressure, the UK's Foreign Office announced that Tuniyaz had canceled his trip to the UK, a move viewed as a victory by IPAC members.Former European Parliament political adviser Ferenczy said that in the European context, some EU member states and lawmakers still have reservations toward IPAC's stance on China.""The European Union entails a variety of views and ideas, and when there is still no convergence on how to address threats from China in the EU, the EU and a lot of member states are not completely at ease with embracing some views from IPAC,"" she told DW.""IPAC has become very visible in democracies in a very short period of time, and as EU member states try to find ways to address the economic threats from China, I think that's where they might not be ready to embrace a platform such as IPAC,"" she said.Edited by: Sou-Jie van Brunnersum",2023/02/20,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816283,Putin may meet top Chinese party official on Moscow trip,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet with the Chinese Communist Party's foreign policy chief in Moscow, the Kremlin said Monday.

            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “we don't rule out” Putin's meeting with Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, who's visiting the Russian capital.

            Peskov hailed Russia-China ties as ""multidimensional and allied in nature.” 











            Wang's visit to Moscow comes just as President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and show U.S. support for Kyiv on the eve of the Russian military operation's one-year anniversary.

            Wang's trip to Russia follows talks Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.

            Blinken said in a tweet after the meeting that he reiterated a warning to China on providing assistance to Russia in Ukraine, including assisting Moscow with evading sanctions the West has imposed on Moscow.

            China, which has declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow’s actions, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia. 

            Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid the tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan. 

            The two nations have held a series military drills that showcased increasingly close defense ties amid tensions with the United States.MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet with the Chinese Communist Party's foreign policy chief in Moscow, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “we don't rule out” Putin's meeting with Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, who's visiting the Russian capital.Peskov hailed Russia-China ties as ""multidimensional and allied in nature.”Wang's visit to Moscow comes just as President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and show U.S. support for Kyiv on the eve of the Russian military operation's one-year anniversary.Wang's trip to Russia follows talks Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.Blinken said in a tweet after the meeting that he reiterated a warning to China on providing assistance to Russia in Ukraine, including assisting Moscow with evading sanctions the West has imposed on Moscow.China, which has declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow’s actions, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia.Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid the tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan.The two nations have held a series military drills that showcased increasingly close defense ties amid tensions with the United States.",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816289,FDA’s own reputation could be restraining its misinfo fight,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government agency responsible for tracking down contaminated peanut butter and defective pacemakers is taking on a new health hazard: online misinformation.

            It’s an unlikely role for the Food and Drug Administration, a sprawling, century-old bureaucracy that for decades directed most its communications toward doctors and corporations. 

            But FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf has spent the last year warning that growing “distortions and half-truths” surrounding vaccines and other medical products are now “a leading cause of death in America.”











            “Almost no one should be dying of COVID in the U.S. today,” Califf told The Associated Press, noting the government's distribution of free vaccines and antiviral medications. “People who are denying themselves that opportunity are dying because they're misinformed.”

            Califf, who first led the agency under President Barack Obama, said the FDA could once rely on a few communication channels to reach Americans.

            “We’re now in a 24/7 sea of information without a user guide for people out there in society,"" Califf said. ""So this requires us to change the way we communicate.”

            The FDA's answer? Short YouTube videos, long Twitter threads and other online postings debunking medical misinformation, including bogus COVID-19 remedies like ivermectin, the anti-parasite drug intended for farm animals. “Hold your horses y'all. Ivermectin may be trending, but it still isn't authorized or approved to treat COVID-19” the FDA told its 500,000 Twitter followers in April.

            On Instagram, FDA memes referencing Scooby-Doo and SpongeBob urge Americans to get boosted and ignore misinformation, alongside staid agency postings about the arrival of National Handwashing Awareness Week.

            The AP asked more than a half-dozen health communication experts about the FDA's fledgling effort. They said it mostly reflects the latest science on combating misinformation, but they also questioned whether it’s reaching enough people to have an impact — and whether separate FDA controversies are undercutting the agency's credibility.

            “The question I start with is, ‘Are you a trusted messenger or not?'” said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a Stanford University professor who studies medical misinformation and trains health officials in responding to it. “In the context of FDA, we can highlight multiple incidents which have damaged the credibility of the agency and deepened distrust of its scientific decisions.""

            In the last two years the FDA has come under fire for its controversial approval of an unproven Alzheimer’s drug as well as its delayed response to a contaminated baby formula plant, which contributed to a national supply shortage.

            Meanwhile, the agency’s approach to booster vaccinations has been criticized by some of its top vaccine scientists and advisers.

            “It’s not fair, but it doesn’t take too many negative stories to unravel the public’s trust,” said Georgetown University’s Leticia Bode, who studies political communication and misinformation. 

            About a quarter of Americans said they have “a lot” of trust in the FDA's handling of COVID-19, according to a survey conducted last year by University of Pennsylvania researchers, while less than half said they have “some trust.”

            ""The FDA's word is still one of the most highly regarded pieces of information people want to see,” said Califf, who was confirmed to his second stint leading the FDA last February.

            As commissioner he is trying to tackle a host of issues, including restructuring the agency’s food safety program and more aggressively deploying FDA scientists to explain vaccine decisions in the media. 

            The array of challenges before the FDA raises questions about the new focus on misinformation. And Califf acknowledges the limits of what his agency can accomplish. 

            “Anyone who thinks the government’s going to solve this problem alone is deluding themselves,"" he said. “We need a vast network of knowledgeable people who devote part of their day to combating misinformation.”

            Georgetown's Bode said the agency is “moving in the right direction,” on misinformation, particularly its “Just a Minute” series of factchecking videos, which feature FDA’s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks succinctly addressing a single COVID-19 myth or topic.

            But how many people are seeing them? 

            “FDA’s YouTube videos have a minuscule audience,” said Brendan Nyhan, who studies medical misinformation at Dartmouth College. The people watching FDA videos ”are not the people we typically think about when we think about misinformation.”

            Research by Nyhan and his colleagues suggests that fact-checking COVID-19 myths briefly dispels false beliefs, but the effects are “ephemeral.” Nyhan and other researchers noted the most trusted medical information source for most Americans is their doctor, not the government.

            Even if the audience for FDA’s work is small, experts in online analytics say it may be having a bigger impact.

            An FDA page dubbed “Rumor Control” debunks a long list of false claims about vaccines, such as that they contain pesticides. A Google search for “vaccines” and “pesticides” brings up the FDA’s response as a top result, because the search engine prioritizes credible websites.

            “Because the FDA puts that information on its website, it will actually crowd out the misinformation from the top 10 or 20 Google results,” said David Lazer, a political and computer scientist at Northeastern University.

            Perhaps the most promising approach to fighting misinformation is also the toughest to execute: introduce people to emerging misinformation and explain why it’s false before they encounter it elsewhere. 

            That technique, called “pre-bunking,"" presents challenges for large government agencies.

            “Is the FDA nimble enough to have a detection system for misinformation and then quickly put out pre-bunking information within hours or days?” Lazer asked. 

            Califf said the FDA tracks new misinformation trends online and quickly decides whether — and when — to intervene.

            “Sometimes calling attention to an issue can make it worse,” he notes.

            Other communication challenges are baked into how the FDA operates. For instance, the agency consults an independent panel of vaccine specialists on major decisions about COVID-19 shots, considered a key step in fostering trust in the process. 

            But some of those experts have disagreed on who should receive COVID-19 vaccine boosters or how strong the evidence is for their use, particularly among younger people.

            The FDA then largely relies on news media to translate those debates and its final decisions, which are often laden with scientific jargon.

            The result has been “utter confusion,” about the latest round of COVID-19 boosters, says Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown. 

            “If you’re trying to counteract misinformation on social media your first job is to clarify, simplify and explain things in an understandable way to the lay public,” said Gostin. “I don’t think anyone could say that FDA has done a good job with that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816299,Sri Lankan police disperse protesters demanding election,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan police fired tear gas and a water cannon at opposition supporters who marched in the capital on Monday demanding that the government hold next month’s local council elections as planned.

            Several thousand backers of Samagi Jana Balawegaya, or United Peoples’ Power party, shouted anti-government slogans as they marched toward the center of Colombo, where government offices and the president's office and residence are located. They were blocked by police, who fired tear gas and a water cannon to disperse them.

            The March 9 elections, postponed from last year because of economic and political turmoil, won't affect the government's majority in the 225-seat Parliament. But they are widely seen as a test of the popularity of the governing coalition, which has been criticized for raising taxes and electricity charges.











            Election officials have reportedly said they have not received money from the treasury to conduct the voting, and opposition lawmakers accuse the government of attempting to further delay the elections.

            Governing coalition lawmakers say it isn't an appropriate time to hold elections because the country is still recovering from an economic crisis. Government spokespeople say the government is struggling to find enough money to pay the salaries of civil servants and conduct other administrative functions.

            Sri Lanka is effectively bankrupt and has suspended repayment of foreign debt pending the outcome of talks with the International Monetary Fund on a bailout package. The country’s foreign debt exceeds $51 billion, of which $28 billion must be repaid by 2027.

            A currency crisis has also led to shortages of essential items such as food, fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Massive protests last year forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.

            His successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has begun to stabilize the economic situation by reducing shortages, enabling schools and offices to operate. To cope with funding shortages, the government has announced a 6% budgetary cut for each ministry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816300,Sneaking a president from DC to Kyiv without anyone noticing,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Joe Biden’s motorcade slipped out of the White House around 3:30 a.m. Sunday. No big, flashy Air Force One for this trip -– the president vanished into the darkness on an Air Force C-32, a modified Boeing 757 normally used for domestic trips to smaller airports.

            The next time he turned up — 20 hours later — it was in downtown Kyiv, Ukraine. 

            Biden’s surprise 23-hour visit to Ukraine on Monday was the first time in modern history that a U.S. leader visited a warzone outside the aegis of the U.S. military — a feat the White House said carried some risk even though Moscow was given a heads-up.











            Over the next five hours, the president made multiple stops around town — ferried about in a white SUV rather than the presidential limousine — without any announcement to the Ukrainian public that he was there. But all that activity attracted enough attention that word of his presence leaked out well before he could get back to Poland, which was the original plan. Aides at the White House were surprised the secret held as long as it did.

            But Russia knew what the Ukrainian public did not. U.S. officials had given Moscow notice of Biden's trip.

            The president had been itching since last year to join the parade of other Western officials who have visited Kyiv to pledge support standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the capital. 

            Biden's planned trip to Warsaw, Poland, and the Presidents' Day holiday provided an obvious opening to tack on a stop in Kyiv. A small group of senior officials at the White House and across U.S. national security agencies set about working in secret for months to make it happen, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Biden only gave the final sign-off Friday.

            Sullivan said the trip “required a security, operational, and logistical effort from professionals across the U.S. government to take what was an inherently risky undertaking and make it a manageable risk.”

            Once Biden was secreted aboard the Air Force jet, the call sign “SAM060,” for Special Air Mission, was used for the plane instead of the usual “Air Force One.” It was parked in the dark with the window-shades down, and took off from Joint Base Andrews at 4:15 a.m. Eastern time.

            After a refueling stop in Germany, where the president was kept aboard the aircraft, Biden’s plane switched off its transponder for the roughly hour-long flight to Rzeszow, Poland, the airport that has served as the gateway for billions of dollars in Western arms and VIP visitors into Ukraine. From there, he boarded a train for the roughly 10-hour overnight trip to Kyiv.

            He arrived in the capital at 8 a.m. Monday, was greeted by Ambassador Bridget Brink and entered his motorcade for the drive to Mariinsky Palace. Even while he was on the ground in Ukraine, flights transporting military equipment and other goods were continuing unabated to Rzeszow from Western cities.

            Meanwhile, in Kyiv, many main streets and central blocks were cordoned off without explanation. People started sharing videos of long motorcades of cars speeding along streets where access was restricted — the first clues that Biden had arrived.

            Biden traveled with a far smaller than usual retinue: Sullivan, deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon and the director of Oval Office operations, Annie Tomasini. They were joined by his Secret Service detail, the military aide carrying the so-called “nuclear football,” a small medical team and the official White House photographer. 

            Only two journalists were on board instead of the usual complement of 13. Their electronic devices were powered off and turned over to the White House for the duration of the trip into Ukraine. A small number of journalists based in Ukraine were summoned to a downtown hotel on Monday morning to join them, not informed that Biden was visiting until shortly before his arrival. 

            Even with Western surface-to-air missile systems bolstering Ukraine’s defenses, it was rare for a U.S. leader to travel to a conflict zone where the U.S. or its allies did not have control over the airspace. 

            The U.S. military does not have a presence in Ukraine other than a small detachment of Marines guarding the embassy in Kyiv, making Biden’s visit more complicated than visits by prior U.S. leaders to war zones.

            “We did notify the Russians that President Biden will be traveling to Kyiv,” Sullivan told reporters. “We did so some hours before his departure for deconfliction purposes.” He declined to specify the exact message or to whom it was delivered but said the heads-up was to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict.

            While Biden was in Kyiv, U.S. surveillance planes, including E-3 Sentry airborne radar and an electronic RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft, were keeping watch over Kyiv from Polish airspace.

            The sealing off of Kyiv roads that are usually humming with traffic brought an eerie calm to the center of the capital. It was so quiet that crows could be heard cawing as Biden and Zelenskyy walked from their motorcade to the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral under skies as blue as the outer walls of the cathedral itself. 

            “Let’s walk in and take a look,” Biden said, wearing his trademark aviator sunglasses against the glare. The presidents disappeared inside as heavily armed soldiers stood guard outside. 

            Cathedral bells chirped at the stroke of 11:30 a.m. followed shortly by air raid alarms, at 11:34 a.m., just before the men reemerged. The sirens were first a distant howl rising over the city, followed seconds later by alarms from mobile phone apps wailing from people’s pockets.

            Those alarms are voiced by “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill, and his Luke Skywalker voice urged people to take cover, warning: “Don’t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.” 

            The two leaders walked at a measured pace with no outward signs of concern through the cathedral's arched front gate onto the square in front, where the rusting hulks of destroyed Russian tanks and other armored vehicles have been stationed as grim reminders of the war. 

            When the square isn’t blocked off, as it was during the leaders’ visit, people come to look at the vehicles, many taking selfies. 

            Biden appeared to pay the hulks no mind as he and Zelenskyy followed behind honor guards carrying two wreaths to the wall of remembrance honoring Ukrainian soldiers killed since 2014, the year Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed fighting erupted in eastern Ukraine.

            It was only then that the first images of Biden in the capital popped up on Ukrainian social media and the secret visit became global news.

            “He is like an example of a president who is not afraid to show up in Ukraine and to support us,” said Kyiv resident Myroslava Renova, 23, after Biden’s visit became known.

            Biden headed to the U.S. Embassy for a brief stop before departing the country by train back to Poland aboard a well-appointed, wood-paneled train car with tightly drawn curtains, a dining table and a leather sofa.

            The all-clear notice, also voiced by Hamill, sounded at 1:07 p.m., as Biden's train was pulling away from the station.

            “The air alert is over,"" Hamill said. “May the force be with you.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816301,Tiger Woods sightings are rare as he enters semiretirement,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The vantage point was as good as any at Riviera for a clear view of Tiger Woods, and considering how little he plays, Tiger sightings are rare these days.

            The man positioned himself behind a stationary TV camera in a tower behind the 12th green as Woods made his way to the 13th tee. He was talking. He was loud. He wouldn't stop. At one point, Christiaan Bezuidenhout had to back off his shot.

            Turns out this wasn't a cameraman. When asked to show his credential, the man leaned over and slowly raised a can of beer. He came down from the tower, went back outside the ropes and two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies escorted him off the course.











            That probably — no, definitely — will not happen at Augusta National, which may very well be the next time golf gets to see its biggest star. Then again, Woods might make his way to the TPC Sawgrass in three weeks for The Players Championship.

            Woods said he wants to play the four majors and a few other events. What those tournaments are, no one knows. And if Woods does, he isn't saying.

            “Here's the deal,” Woods said Sunday after finishing his first tournament since the Masters last year. ""I'm not going to play any more than probably the majors and maybe a couple more. That's it. That's all my body will allow me to do. My back the way it is, all the surgeries I had on my back, my leg the way it is, I just can't.

            “That's just going to be my future.”

            The schedule is not based on a score. It's what happens after he signs his card, and what he does before he is announced in between, and what sounds like plenty of ice and other treatment.

            As for his golf?

            Some of it was great, some of it was pedestrian, none of it was boring. That explains why thousands were waiting for him around the first tee on Thursday morning for his first tournament in seven months, and chanted his name when he finished on Sunday.

            “Been in front of large crowds before, but not 10,000 people that's rooting for one guy in the group,” Bezuidenhout said Saturday after watching Woods post a 67, his lowest score on the PGA Tour since October 2020, which was only five tournaments ago.

            Matthias Schwab of Austria also was in the group. He said he has played with Rory McIlroy a few times on the European tour and experienced big crowds.

            “This was another level,” Schwab said.

            That's to be expected no matter where he goes because Woods plays so infrequently. Part of the pandemonium is that he is playing at all.

            It was two years ago when his SUV went off the road in the Los Angeles suburbs going nearly 87 mph and tumbled down a hill. He spent the summer in a makeshift hospital bed in his Florida home. He was swinging a club in November, playing a 36-hole event with his son while riding a cart in December and playing the Masters five months later.

            Woods is an eight-time winner at Bay Hill, but the last of those was 10 years ago. It's easy to lean on past history, except for Woods that means surgeries on his back and right leg dating to 2014, the left knee the decade prior.

            
                Riviera — which Woods has played the most times (12 as a pro) without winning — made sense because he is the tournament host. The other tournament that benefits his foundation is the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He'll likely play there.

            Otherwise, the focus is on the majors, and the hope he can recapture a little magic and make a lot of putts and at least go into the weekend with a fighting chance. He was five behind after the first round, and the deficit grew to 11 shots and 12 shots until he finished 16 shots behind Jon Rahm.

            That was his first competition in seven months. It could be seven weeks before he plays again at the Masters, and he hopes to be in the other majors. Nothing is guaranteed. There is golf and there is tournament golf, and they are not the same.

            “I can do carts at home,” he said. ""I can hit balls, chip and putt. But as I said, it’s time or attention and getting your eight to 10 miles of walking in and the concentration that it takes. Yeah, it's hard. I've done it for a long time.

            “The body is,” he continued, “sometimes it says no even though the mind says yes.”

            Catch him while you can.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816303,EU slaps sanctions on 9 more top Myanmar officials,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union announced Monday that it has imposed sanctions on nine officials in Myanmar and seven entities, including government departments and companies, linked to rising violence, human rights abuses and security threats.

            The 27-nation bloc imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on the officials — among them the energy minister and top military brass — over “actions that threaten the peace, security or stability of Myanmar.” It also froze the assets in Europe of defense ministry departments and several companies.

            Myanmar languished under strict military rule for five decades. That led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, and Aung San Suu Kyi became leader in 2015 elections, the international community eased most of the sanctions and poured investment into the country.











            That ended with a military coup on Feb. 1, 2021. It was launched after the military rejected the results of November 2020 elections, which were won overwhelmingly by Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party.

            The takeover was met with massive public opposition, which has since turned into armed resistance and what some United Nations experts have called a civil war.

            According to the military and media reports last week, the military government plans to allow people who are “loyal to the nation,” including government employees and retired military personnel, to carry licensed firearms.

            The new sanctions, endorsed by EU foreign ministers, mean that a total of 93 people and 18 agencies, companies or organizations have now been targeted. The bloc also has an arms embargo in place, as well as a ban on equipment that can be used for internal repression or for monitoring communications.BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union announced Monday that it has imposed sanctions on nine officials in Myanmar and seven entities, including government departments and companies, linked to rising violence, human rights abuses and security threats.The 27-nation bloc imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on the officials — among them the energy minister and top military brass — over “actions that threaten the peace, security or stability of Myanmar.” It also froze the assets in Europe of defense ministry departments and several companies.Myanmar languished under strict military rule for five decades.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816305,"Social Security and Medicare: Troubling math, tough politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — It seems no one wants to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits.

            Not President Joe Biden, who is already telling voters his upcoming federal budget proposal will “defend and strengthen” the programs. Not Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has declared cuts to the programs off the table in negotiations to raise the federal debt limit.

            There's just one glitch with these declarations: Social Security won't be able to pay out its promised benefits in about a dozen years, while Medicare won't be able to do so in just five years. Economists have done the projections and say both programs will drive the national debt higher in the decades to come, forcing teeth-gritting choices for the next generation of lawmakers.











            Here's a breakdown of the dilemma, the potential fixes and the harsh politics around Social Security and Medicare:

            THE CHALLENGE

            It's a math problem that requires a political solution.

            Payroll taxes largely fund Social Security and Medicare. They generally get deducted from workers' paychecks, which is why Biden, a Democrat, says people are merely getting back what they've already paid into the system.

            But as more baby boomers age and retire, there are more beneficiaries and not enough tax revenue to fund the programs. Payroll taxes are expected to generate $1.56 trillion this year, but the combined costs of Social Security and Medicare are likely to be $2.16 trillion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report last week. The office warned in its report that Social Security benefits may need to be cut even earlier than past projections, beginning in 2032. 

            CBO Director Phillip Swagel said Friday at a Bipartisan Policy Center event that “benefits today are being paid in full as promised, drawing down on the Social Security trust fund.” But when the government is unable to pay full benefits, “that’s a challenge,” he said.

            The number of people enrolled in Medicare has more than tripled to roughly 65 million since its inception in 1966. More than 10 million new retirees and disabled people joined in just the past decade, according to data from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.

            The shortfall in tax revenues combined with a rising number of recipients would eventually lead to Social Security’s trust fund being unable to fully pay benefits in 2035, a Social Security and Medicare trustees report predicted last June, though the CBO said it could happen sooner. Medicare’s trust fund would be unable to pay full benefits starting in 2028.

            This forces the inevitable choice of whether to shore up the trust funds' finances or reduce people's benefits. Continued delays by Congress and the president in addressing this math problem could narrow the number of potential fixes.

            WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS?

            There is basically some combination of four options:

            — Raise taxes.

            — Change benefits such as the eligibility age.

            — Cut costs.

            — Rely more on general revenues to cover the gap, which could mean higher budget deficits or cuts to other programs.

            Biden took a step last year with his Inflation Reduction Act, which would allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices on a handful of drugs and charge drug companies when they raise the price of drugs faster than inflation. The law also makes vaccines free, caps monthly out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 and limits out-of-pocket drug expenses at $2,000 starting in 2025.

            The CBO said the prescription drug components of the law would save $237 billion over 10 years, prompting some Republican lawmakers to say it was a spending cut that would dig into pharmaceutical companies' profits, forcing them to limit how much they spend developing new treatments. But the law aims to lower the cost people pay for medication, rather than ax benefits. 

            Democrats are also trying to rein in spending on the increasingly popular -– and expensive -– Medicare Advantage program, a network of private insurance plans that are reimbursed by the government. Recently, 70 Democrats signed a letter to the president asking his administration to crack down on scams and wasteful spending in the program, which federal investigators say has cost taxpayers billions of dollars. 

            Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has pushed legislation that would create bipartisan committees to look at ways to salvage the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The bill has gone nowhere but has limited bipartisan support, including from Senate Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia.

            Payroll taxes were capped last year at $147,000 — meaning no one paid the taxes after surpassing that threshold. In 2019, Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., proposed a bill that would reinstitute the payroll tax at earnings above $400,000.

            Last year, members of the House Republican Study Committee proposed raising the age at which someone could qualify for Social Security and Medicare. Right now, people can access their full Social Security benefits at 67, an age minimum that’s increased by two years since the program was first established nearly 90 years ago. You must be at least 65 to access Medicare. 

            Last year, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., laid out a plan to require Congress to reconsider all federal laws every five years — leading to criticism by Biden that Social Security and Medicare would be cut. That idea has received an ice-cold reception with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, saying it will “not be part of our agenda.”

            After several months of flak, Scott on Friday revised his plan to specifically exclude Social Security and Medicare.

            The CBO has also laid out nearly 60 policy options that could save the federal government billions of dollars on Medicare, including higher monthly premiums for some older and disabled adults.

            THE POLITICS ARE TOXIC 

            In his State of the Union address, Biden got boos from GOP lawmakers when he said that some Republicans want to cut spending for the programs. It led to an improvised standing ovation for seniors as both parties on the spot committed to avoiding any cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

            Put simply, voters like low taxes and generous benefits. This means it can be politically suicidal to overhaul either program. Any change can be used against a lawmaker seeking reelection, especially as 2024 looms. For the past two weeks, Biden has been giving speeches in key states such as Wisconsin and Florida in which he warned that some Republicans would gut the programs, despite the GOP denials.

            Why are the politics so bad?

            It's because of the composition of the electorate. AP VoteCast found that nearly six in 10 voters in last year's midterms were older than 50. Of that group, three in 10 were 65 or older. This means that a dominant bloc of voters already benefit from these programs or are on the verge of doing so. 

            REFORM IS POSSIBLE

            Go back 40 years to 1983.

            President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, and House Speaker Tip O'Neill, a Democrat, struck a deal to extend the life of Social Security, which was facing insolvency. The amendments to the program raised the retirement age, delayed the cost-of-living adjustment by six months and mandated that government employees start paying into Social Security, among other changes.

            When Reagan signed the law on April 20, 1983, he said: “This bill demonstrates for all time our nation’s ironclad commitment to Social Security. It assures the elderly that America will always keep the promises made in troubled times a half a century ago. It assures those who are still working that they, too, have a pact with the future.”

            In the 1984 elections, there was little political fallout. Reagan won a second term in a landslide, while Democrats held onto the House.

            THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM

            It's not just the U.S. There's pushback in other countries amid efforts to restrain costs tied to an aging population.

            There have been repeated protests in France over French President Emanuel Macron’s plans to raise the minimum retirement age for a full state pension from 62 to 64. Nearly 1 million people marched in Paris, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Nantes and other cities on Feb. 11, with Parisian police officers saying they arrested eight people for violations that included vandalism and possession of a firearm.

            In the Chinese city of Wuhan last week, seniors belted out the communist anthem “The Internationale” in protest of the government cutting health care benefits.

            In a recent analysis for the International Monetary Fund, Harvard University's David Bloom, an economics professor, and Leo Zucker, a research assistant, said that aging worldwide creates “a colossal set of health, social, and economic challenges in the coming decades.” They warned about the costs of inaction if there are not enough workers to fund health care benefits for older people, leading to more disease and a lower quality of life.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816315,"In test, zaps to spine help 2 stroke survivors move arms","WASHINGTON (AP) — A stroke left Heather Rendulic with little use of her left hand and arm, putting certain everyday tasks like tying shoes or cutting foods out of reach.

            “I live one-handed in a two-handed world and you don’t realize how many things you need two hands for until you only have one good one,” the Pittsburgh woman told The Associated Press.

            So Rendulic volunteered for a first-of-its-kind experiment: Researchers implanted a device that zaps her spinal cord in spots that control hand and arm motion. When they switched it on, she could grasp and manipulate objects — moving a soup can, opening a lock and by the end of the four-week study, cutting her own steak.











            It’s not a cure — the improvements ended after scientists removed the temporary implant — and the pilot study included only Rendulic and one other stroke survivor. But the preliminary results, published Monday, mark a step toward one day restoring mobility for this extremely common type of paralysis.

            “They’re not just getting flickers of movement. They’re getting something important,” said Dr. Jason Carmel, a Columbia University neurologist who wasn’t involved with the new experiment but also studies ways to recover upper-limb function. “It’s a very exciting proof of concept.”

            Nearly 800,000 people in the U.S. alone suffer a stroke each year. Even after months of rehabilitation, well over half are left with permanently impaired arm and hand function that can range from muscle weakness to paralysis.

            Experiments by multiple research groups have found that implanting electrodes to stimulate the lower spine shows promise for restoring leg and foot movement to people paralyzed after a spinal cord injury — some have even taken steps. 

            But upper-limb paralysis has gotten little attention and is inherently more challenging. The brain must signal multiple nerves that control how the shoulder lifts, the wrist turns and the hand flexes. Stroke damage makes it harder for those messages to get through.

            “People still retain some of this connection, they’re just not enough to enable movement,” said University of Pittsburgh assistant professor Marco Capogrosso, who led the new research with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University. “These messages are weaker than normal.”

            His idea: Stimulate a pathway of related nerve cells so they're better able to sense and pick up the brain’s weak signal.

            “We’re not bypassing their control. We’re enhancing their capabilities to move their own arm,” he said.

            Researchers turned to implants the size of spaghetti strands that already are used to stimulate the spine for chronic pain treatment. The implants carry electrodes that are placed on the surface of the spinal cord to deliver pulses of electricity to the targeted nerve cells — which for hand and arm control are in the spine’s neck region.

            Rendulic and a second, more severely impaired volunteer could move better as soon as the stimulator was switched on — and by the study’s end showed improved muscle strength, dexterity and range of motion, researchers reported Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. Surprisingly, both participants retained some improvement for about a month after the implants were removed.

            Rendulic, now 33, was performing some fine-motor tasks for the first time since suffering a stroke in her 20s. That unusually young stroke, caused by weak blood vessels that bled inside her brain, initially paralyzed her entire left side. She learned to walk again but — with the exception of those four weeks with spinal stimulation — cannot fully open her left hand or completely raise that arm.

            “You feel like there’s a barrier between your brain and your arm,” Rendulic said. But with the stimulation on, “I could immediately sense that, like, oh my arm and hand are still there.”

            Two other researchers who helped pioneer experiments stimulating the lower limbs of people with spinal cord injuries say it’s logical to now try the technology for stroke.

            While bigger and longer studies are needed, the new results “are really promising,” said Mayo Clinic assistant professor Peter Grahn.

            Scientists have learned from research with lower limbs that ""it may not matter where that injury occurs, if it’s something in the brain or it’s a spinal cord injury,” added University of Louisville professor Susan Harkema. “Targeting the human spinal cord circuitry has a lot of potential.”

            With National Institutes of Health funding, Capogrosso is studying the approach in a few more stroke survivors. The researchers also have formed a company to further develop the technology.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816317,Lance Stroll out of F1 testing after bicycle accident,"SILVERSTONE, England (AP) — Lance Stroll has been ruled out of pre-season Formula One testing this week after he was injured in a bicycle accident, the Aston Martin team said Monday.

            Aston Martin said the Canadian driver was hurt while training in Spain. The team didn't give any more details of how the incident happened or the nature of Stroll's injuries but said “Lance is however expecting a quick recovery and return to driving duties.” The team said it would issue an update on his fitness before the Bahrain Grand Prix starts the season next week.

            “I’ve had an unfortunate accident whilst training on my bike in preparation for the season,"" Stroll said. ""I am determined to get back in the car and I am excited about the season ahead with the team. I am motivated to bounce back from this setback as quickly as possible.”











            Aston Martin didn't say who might take Stroll's place when three days of testing begin Thursday in Bahrain. Stroll's teammate for 2023 is Fernando Alonso and the team has two reserve drivers, Formula Two champion Felipe Drugovich and former McLaren driver Stoffel Vandoorne. 

            Aston Martin said earlier Monday that Drugovich and Vandoorne would also be made available if McLaren needs a reserve driver in the first 15 races of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816320,"Salman Rushdie, Rishi Sunak condemn Roald Dahl re-writes","A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak used a phrase from a Roald Dahl book to comment on the apparent  censorship of Dahl's works on Monday.""When it comes to our rich and varied literary heritage, the prime minister agrees with the BFG that you shouldn't gobblefunk around with words,"" said a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday. The word ""gobblefunk"" was coined by Dahl to mean playing around with words and used in his book The BFG also known as The Big Friendly Giant.Separately, renowned author Salman Rushdie also called out the ""absurd censorship"" on the part of publishers Puffin books and the Netflix-owned Dahl estate.Rushdie pointed out that Dahl was an extremely flawed person, including being a ""confessed antisemite,"" but maintained that the way the edits had been carried out was nonsensical.On Friday, British newspaper The Telegraph highlighted changes made to the most recent editions of Dahl's works including bestsellers Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Twits.For example, in Matilda, a reference to pro-imperial writer Rudyard Kipling has been replaced with a reference to US author John Steinbeck. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Augustus Gloop is no longer ""enormously fat,"" but rather ""enormous,"" and The Twits Mrs. Twit is no longer ""ugly and beastly,"" but simply ""beastly.""The Oompa-Loompas of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and other made-up creations of Dahl's have been edited to become gender neutral.Users on social media also claimed that there appeared to be removals of the color adjective black to refer to things such as tractors and a spider's head.Commentators on various sides of the political spectrum decried the changes. Suzanne Nossel, head of PEN America, said she was ""alarmed"" by the move.""Amidst fierce battles against book bans and strictures on what can be taught and read, selective editing to make works of literature conform to particular sensibilities could represent a dangerous new weapon,"" she said. ""Those who might cheer specific edits to Dahl's work should consider how the power to rewrite books might be used in the hands of those who do not share their values and sensibilities.""Philip Pullman, author of the acclaimed children's series His Dark Materials, said that a better tactic would be that ""if Dahl offends us, let him go out of print.""Others, such as Sunday Times deputy literary editor Laura Hackett pointed out that Dahl books were known for their bite. Calling the changes ""botched surgery,"" she vowed to keep her older editions so that her children could enjoy them in ""their full, nasty, colorful glory.""Born in Wales to parents who had immigrated from Norway, Dahl served in World War II before rising to prominence as a writer for both children and adults.In 2020, his family apologized for antisemitic remarks the author had made, calling it ""incomprehensible.""es/dj (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/20,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816322,"""Düsseldorf Patient"" cured of HIV after stem cell transplant","Researchers have reported a third case of a person cleared of HIV after undergoing a stem-cell transplant aimed at curing his leukemia.The study, published today in the journal Nature, describes the case of a 53-year-old male patient who underwent a bone marrow (stem-cell) transplant to treat his leukemia. Like the ""London"" and ""Berlin"" patients, the donor had a rare mutation that confers resistance to certain strains of HIV, like HIV-1.""This underlines that these approaches are promising and also reproducible, since it does not remain an isolated case,"" said Jürgen Rockstroh in a statement. Rockstroh is a professor and head of infectiology at Germany's University Hospital Bonn who was not involved in the research.However, researchers point out, the treatment has not been successful for several other patients who have received it.Although there's still debate on what being ""cured of HIV"" means, the new case adds to the two previous cases of HIV cure using the same type of stem cell transplant as the Berlin patient and the London patient.It is hard to prove conclusively that someone is cured of HIV because the virus can remain hidden inside very long-lived immune cells, and the methods available to detect them are limited, HIV expert Sharon Lewin and colleague Jennifer Zerbato wrote in The Lancet in 2020.There’s a receptor in the HIV virus's target cells called CCR5.All three cases involved HIV-1 positive patients who underwent a stem cell transplant from a donor with both copies of a rare but naturally occurring CCR5 mutation.Individuals with this mutation have lower or no expression of the CCR5 receptor in their cells, conferring protection against certain strains of the HIV virus.The transplant essentially replaces the patient's immune system with the one that is resistant to HIV.The patient, whose identity has not been revealed, was positive for type 1 HIV (HIV-1) and was monitored by researchers at Düsseldorf University Hospital for more than nine years after his transplant in February 2013.The patient had a type of leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia. Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside our bones that makes new blood and immune cells.The patient continued taking antiviral medicine for HIV until November 2018, when the researchers decided to stop the treatment because, they reported, it was the only way to know if the patient had been cured.Four years after stopping antiretroviral therapy, the researchers could not detect any traces of HIV viruses capable of infection and measured waning levels of HIV-1 specific antibodies.Genetic material of the HIV virus was mostly undetectable except for sporadic traces detected in some blood and lymph tissues samples. These results are strong evidence that the HIV-1 had been cured, the researchers said.Although this study adds to two previous cases of successful ""curing"" of HIV, it does not mean that stem-cell transplants are a safe and viable alternative to HIV treatment.""Another key limitation of [the transplant] is the associated pronounced toxicity.”, said Boris Fehse, head of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf's cell and gene therapy research department, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.Bone marrow transplants require drugs that suppress the immune system, which can increase the risk of infections and potentially lead to so called graft-versus-host disease, where the transplanted immune cells target the host tissue, added Fehse.The authors caution that this type of stem-cell transplant is not low-risk or easily scalable. The study, they say, rather serves as further evidence that gene-editing therapies targeting CCR5 receptors may be the key to curing HIV-1.Edited by: Clare Roth",2023/02/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816323,Brazil deluge kills 36; search continues for dozens missing,"SAO SEBASTIAO, Brazil (AP) — Hundreds of rescuers searched Monday for survivors of landslides and flooding that killed at least 36 people along the coast of Brazil’s southern state of Sao Paulo following a huge weekend downpour.

            Worst hit was the city of Sao Sebastiao, where at least 35 were dead. In neighboring Ubatuba a 7-year-old girl was killed. The disaster, in an area famous for beaches flanked by mountains, prompted cancellations in many cities of the Carnival festivities now in full swing elsewhere in the country. 

            Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas told television network Globo that another 40 people were missing. Nearly 800 people were homeless and 1,730 people have been displaced, his state government said in a statement.











            Television footage showed flooded homes with only their roofs visible. Residents used small boats to carry items and people to elevated positions. 

            A woman who gave only her first name, Mailsa, said she and her husband, daughter and grandson only barely escaped when a landslide destroyed her house in the Juquehy municipality of Sao Sebastiao. The house was partially submerged, parts of it fell away and the rest was left precariously perched on the edge of a hill.

            “It was very quick. Either you run or you die,” she said. “It’s not possible to take anything, only your life, which is the most important thing.”

            Members of the armed forces joined the search and rescue efforts, aggravated by poor access to many areas after landslides blocked the snaking roads in the region’s highlands and floods washed away chunks of pavement in low-lying and oceanfront areas.

            “Our rescue teams are not managing to get to several locations. It is a chaotic situation,” Sao Sebastiao Mayor Felipe Augusto said on social media late Sunday night. 

            Augusto said about 50 houses collapsed in the city due to the landslides, and he posted several videos of destruction and search efforts, including one of a baby being rescued by locals lined up on a flooded street.

            The highway connecting Rio de Janeiro state with Sao Paulo’s port city of Santos was blocked by landslides and floodwaters. Gov. de Freitas said the damage was so extensive, the highway may no longer exist.

            Precipitation in Sao Sebastiao had surpassed 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) during a 24-hour period over the weekend, among the largest such downpours ever in such a short period in Brazil.

            Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visited the region on Monday. He observed the damage in Sao Sebastiao from a helicopter and met with Gov. de Freitas at Sao Sebastiao’s theatre, where search operations were being coordinated.

            Lula called for people living in the hillside areas to be relocated to safer regions. “Every now and then nature plays a surprise on us, but also many times we defy nature,” Lula said in remarks to reporters in Sao Sebastiao.

            De Freitas declared a state of emergency for the hardest-hit cities, including Sao Sebastiao, Ubatuba, Ilhabela and Bertioga, which enables expedited allocation of funds for relief. He said 7 million reais ($1.35 million) already had been released. On Monday, the governor also declared three days of official mourning throughout the state of Sao Paulo.

            The heavy rain affected water, electricity and phone services, according to a statement from the state government, which posted on Twitter a video showing 30,000 liters of water being transported to Sao Sebastiao. Hygiene kits, blankets, sleeping bags, mattresses and medical supplies have also been sent.

            The Minister of Integration and Regional Development Waldez Góes said on Twitter that experts already were looking into reconstruction plans. “In the coming days, we will work on the reconstruction of bridges, public buildings, housing units and all the public infrastructure affected,” Góes said.

            The affected area, on the northern coast of Sao Paulo state, is a frequent Carnival destination for wealthy tourists who prefer to stay away from massive street parties in big cities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816325,Gabriel recalled for his first West Indies ODIs since 2019,"ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) — Fast bowler Shannon Gabriel could play his first one-day internationals for the West Indies since the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

            He was picked on Monday for three ODIs in South Africa next month. He's already in the republic for the two-test series starting next week.

            Gabriel earned the ODI recall for his performances for Trinidad and Tobago in the domestic Super50 Cup, where he took 15 wickets in seven matches at an average of 14.2.











            He has a chance to make an early claim on making the squad for the World Cup at the end of the year in India.

            West Indies' pool of pacemen was low, as Jayden Seales remained unavailable after knee surgery and Anderson Phillip was back training but not yet match-fit. Obed McCoy was in the Twenty20 squad subject to a medical clearance.

            The ODIs from March 16-21 and the T20s from March 25-28 will mark the first series for new white-ball captains Shai Hope and Rovman Powell.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816326,Houston back at No. 1 as Northwestern makes AP Top 25 debut,"Houston returned to No. 1 in the AP men's college basketball poll on Monday for the third time this season, while Northwestern and Texas A&M barged into the rankings after each had a pair of impressive wins last week.

            The Cougars, riding a seven-game winning streak, jumped over Alabama and back into the top spot, where they spent two weeks in November and December and had another two-week stint last month. They picked up 48 first-place votes from the 62-member national media panel to lay claim to No. 1 with just two weeks left in the regular season.

            “This is my fourth year coaching these guys. We've developed a really good program here,” said Houston coach Kelvin Sampson, referring to his veteran leaders that went to a Final Four two years ago and the Elite Eight last season. “But the emphasis is ‘we have.’ One person doesn't do it. I'm proud of our program. I'm proud of everyone in it.”











            The Crimson Tide dropped only one spot after losing to Tennessee and routing Georgia in their lone week at No. 1. They held onto seven first-place votes, while Kansas also earned seven to climb two spots to No. 3 in this week's poll.

            UCLA remained at No. 4 while Purdue slid two spots to round out of the top five.

            “We're not as good a basketball team, from a tactical standpoint, as last year's basketball team yet,” said Jayhawks coach Bill Self, whose team is trying to become the first back-to-back national champions since Florida in 2006 and '07. “From a competitive standpoint, this team is an equivalent, or on par, with that team.”

            That was evident Saturday, when the Jayhawks rallied from 17 down to beat No. 9 Baylor 87-71 in Allen Fieldhouse.

            Virginia was at No. 6 after beating Louisville and Notre Dame last week. Arizona was seventh while Texas fell two spots to eighth after losing to Texas Tech and needing overtime to beat Oklahoma. The Bears held their spot while Marquette moved back into the top 10.

            The Volunteers dropped to No. 11 after following up their win over Alabama with a loss to Kentucky. Gonzaga, Miami and Kansas State were next, with Saint Mary's giving the West Coast Conference two teams in the top 15.

            
                The Gaels (24-5, 13-1) and Bulldogs (23-5, 12-2) each play midweek games before their showdown on Saturday.

            Xavier held steady at No. 16 this week while Indiana, UConn, Creighton and Providence rounded out the top 20.

            Northwestern entered the poll for the first time in more than two years at No. 21 after following its upset of Purdue two weeks ago with wins over the Hoosiers and Iowa. San Diego State, Iowa State and TCU were next, with Texas A&M making it back into the poll after spending one week at No. 24 in November.

            “We haven't gotten ahead of ourselves,"" Wildcats coach Chris Collins said. ""We've had big aspirations of who we could be, and not many people believed it. I'm sure a lot of people laughed at them. But we had them and they were real. And these guys have followed up on it. But we're still in the moment. For me, it's not a time for reflection.

            “We want more,” Collins continued. “We can reflect at the end of the year, when it's all done in a month's time. And we can look back at the ups and downs. But we're trying our hardest right now to stay in the moment.”

            IN AND OUT

            The Wildcats, winners of five straight, and the Aggies entered the poll at the expense of North Carolina State and Florida Atlantic. The Wolfpack lost to Syracuse on Tuesday and the Owls lost to Middle Tennessee on Thursday.

            RISING AND FALLING

            There was very little movement in this week's poll. Providence made the biggest climb at just four spots to No. 20 after wins over Creighton and Villanova. Iowa State likewise made the biggest fall at four sports to No. 23 after following a win over TCU with a loss to Kansas State on Saturday.

            CONFERENCE WATCH

            The Big 12 continues to lead the way with six teams in the AP Top 25 and Oklahoma State receiving a vote. The Big East has five teams in the poll — and all in the top 20 — while the SEC and Big Ten have three teams apiece.

They held onto seven first-place votes, while Kansas also earned seven to climb two spots to No. 3 in this week's poll.UCLA remained at No. 4 while Purdue slid two spots to round out of the top five.“We're not as good a basketball team, from a tactical standpoint, as last year's basketball team yet,” said Jayhawks coach Bill Self, whose team is trying to become the first back-to-back national champions since Florida in 2006 and '07. “From a competitive standpoint, this team is an equivalent, or on par, with that team.”That was evident Saturday, when the Jayhawks rallied from 17 down to beat No. 9 Baylor 87-71 in Allen Fieldhouse.Virginia was at No. 6 after beating Louisville and Notre Dame last week. Arizona was seventh while Texas fell two spots to eighth after losing to Texas Tech and needing overtime to beat Oklahoma. The Bears held their spot while Marquette moved back into the top 10.The Volunteers dropped to No. 11 after following up their win over Alabama with a loss to Kentucky. Gonzaga, Miami and Kansas State were next, with Saint Mary's giving the West Coast Conference two teams in the top 15.The Gaels (24-5, 13-1) and Bulldogs (23-5, 12-2) each play midweek games before their showdown on Saturday.Xavier held steady at No. 16 this week while Indiana, UConn, Creighton and Providence rounded out the top 20.Northwestern entered the poll for the first time in more than two years at No. 21 after following its upset of Purdue two weeks ago with wins over the Hoosiers and Iowa. San Diego State, Iowa State and TCU were next, with Texas A&M making it back into the poll after spending one week at No. 24 in November.“We haven't gotten ahead of ourselves,"" Wildcats coach Chris Collins said. ""We've had big aspirations of who we could be, and not many people believed it. I'm sure a lot of people laughed at them. But we had them and they were real. And these guys have followed up on it. But we're still in the moment. For me, it's not a time for reflection.“We want more,” Collins continued. “We can reflect at the end of the year, when it's all done in a month's time. And we can look back at the ups and downs. But we're trying our hardest right now to stay in the moment.”IN AND OUTThe Wildcats, winners of five straight, and the Aggies entered the poll at the expense of North Carolina State and Florida Atlantic. The Wolfpack lost to Syracuse on Tuesday and the Owls lost to Middle Tennessee on Thursday.RISING AND FALLINGThere was very little movement in this week's poll. Providence made the biggest climb at just four spots to No. 20 after wins over Creighton and Villanova.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816327,UN Council OKs watered-down statement on Israel settlements,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a watered-down statement strongly opposing Israel’s continued construction and expansion of settlements Monday. The vote came after high-stakes negotiations by the Biden administration succeeded in derailing a legally binding resolution that would have demanded a halt to Israeli settlement activity.

            The Palestinian-backed draft resolution was the subject of frantic talks by senior Biden administration officials including Secretary of States Antony Blinken with Palestinian, Israeli and United Arab Emirates leaders. Those discussions culminated in a deal Sunday to forego it in favor of a weaker presidential statement that is not legally binding, according to multiple diplomats familiar with the situation.

            The deal averted a potential diplomatic crisis, with the U.S. almost certainly vetoing the resolution, which would have angered Palestinian supporters at a time when the U.S. and its Western allies are trying to gain international support against Russia for its war with Ukraine. The war marks its one-year anniversary of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion this week.











            But U.S. support for the presidential statement angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

            His office issued a blistering statement saying the Security Council statement “negates the rights of Jews to live in their historical homeland, ignores Palestinian terror attacks in Jerusalem in which 10 Israeli citizens were murdered this month, turns a blind eye to the fact that the Palestinian Authority subsidizes terror and pays the families of terrorists, and diminishes the antisemitism that led to the murder of millions of Jews.”

            In an unusual criticism of Israel’s closest ally, the U.S., Netanyahu’s statement said: “The declaration didn’t need to be said and the United States didn’t need to join it.”

            By contrast, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, welcomed the presidential statement telling reporters: “We are very happy that there was a very strong united message from the Security Council against the illegal, unilateral measure” announced by Israel on Feb. 12 to construct 10,000 new housing units and legalize nine new outposts in the West Bank. 

            He also cited the council statement that Israeli settlement activities “are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution.” It envisions Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace based on borders before the 1967 Mideast war.

            Mansour said 14 of the 15 council members supported the resolution, but one member — a clear reference to the United States — didn’t want to use its veto. “I think the fact that we reached a unanimous agreement on a presidential statement is a very important step in the right direction,” he said.

            To avoid a vote on the draft resolution, the diplomats said, the U.S. managed to convince both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take. 

            On the Israeli side, that would mean a commitment to not expanding settlements until at least August, according to the diplomats. On Monday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not greenlight any new wildcat settlements in the West Bank beyond nine outposts that it approved retroactively earlier this month.

            On the Palestinian side, the diplomats said it would mean a commitment until August not to pursue action against Israel at the U.N. and other international bodies such as the World Court, the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Human Rights Council. But Mansour said the U.N. General Assembly’s request to the U.N.’s highest judicial body, the International Court of Justice also known as the World Court for an advisory opinion on the legality of Israeli politcies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem is going ahead. 

            The Palestinian push for a resolution came after Israel’s new right-wing government reaffirmed its commitment to construct new settlements in the West Bank and expand its authority on land the Palestinians seek for a future state.

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The United Nations and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

            The presidential statement does not condemn Israeli settlement activity or demand a halt. It does condemn “all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terrorism.”

            On settlements, the Security Council statement also “strongly opposes all unilateral measures that impede peace including … Israeli construction and expansion of settlements, confiscation of Palestinians’ land, and the `legalization’ of settlement outposts, demolition of Palestinians’ homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.”

            UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the council’s Arab representative who sponsored the resolution, commended the U.S. role and said the statement is “the first output from the Security Council in six years on the situation in Palestine.”

            In December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.” It stressed that halting settlement activities “is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.”

            That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.

            The presidential statement was read at the start of the council’s monthly Mideast meeting by its president, Malta’s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier.

            U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland then warned the council that “we are witnessing” a surge in violence “including some of the deadliest incidents in nearly 20 years,” expressing concern that the negative trajectory is “gaining in both pace and intensity.” He said responsible leadership is urgently needed.

            U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield also urged Israel and the Palestinians to immediately “break the cycle of violence and de-escalate.”

            “We strongly oppose Israel’s announcement that it will advance thousands of settlement units. And we strongly oppose Israel’s announcement that it begin a process to retroactively legalize nine outposts in the West Bank that were previously illegal under Israeli law,” she told the council.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816328,Congress floats ways to secure skies after Chinese balloon,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As the only current U.S. senator to have visited space, Mark Kelly knows something about unexplained objects in the skies.

            Back in his aviator days, Kelly saw Mylar party balloons fly by his cockpit. And once when he was piloting a NASA aircraft, he spotted an object at roughly 45,000 feet (13,700 meters) — much higher than commercial airplanes fly — that he couldn’t identify by sight. 

            He’s not sure he would want to see American missiles flying at those objects, either.











            “I don’t think we want to get into the business of launching AIM-9Xs — at $400,000 a pop — at weather balloons,” Kelly told The Associated Press, referring to the heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles used in recent weeks to shoot down a series of aerial objects, including a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon.

            The Biden administration's unprecedented peacetime downing of the Chinese balloon and three other objects has raised new and troubling questions about the security of American airspace, alarming lawmakers who fear the episode has exposed a vulnerability that could be exploited by other foreign adversaries.

            While the House and the Senate both voted unanimously to condemn China’s ruling political party for the incursion and largely supported the Biden administration’s decision to shoot down the balloon, they have questions about what’s next.

            Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who has been tasked with heading up an investigation into how the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon was allowed to pass over crucial U.S. missile sites, said that he would ensure the Defense Department has funds for a protocol to assess the threat of unidentified flying objects.

            “We're going to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure we have a plan going forward to detect and then find out what potential problems this balloon may cause and then a way to bring it down that doesn’t cost us a $400,000 missile,” Tester, who chairs the Defense subcommittee on appropriations, told Fox News Channel.

            Concerns over China, which has criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction,"" and worries about interference with civilian aircraft are shared by members of both political parties, creating the potential in Congress to mount a robust bipartisan response. But lawmakers are also mindful of adding yet more military costs — the U.S. already spends more than $800 billion yearly on defense programs — and are wary of expensive shooting sprees for every random object that appears in America's skies.

            Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, is working on legislation that would require weather balloons to carry transponders that could communicate with air traffic control systems to separate research balloons from mysterious objects where “we don’t know what that is. We don’t know where it came from.”

            “It would really help the Defense Department to be able to sort out what is civilian science payload, what’s a weather balloon, what’s a NASA balloon, what’s a private company in the United States doing, what might be even a U.S. military,” said Kelly, who logged 54 days in space as an astronaut before jumping into politics.

            Other lawmakers have launched a flurry of proposals aimed at the skies including a comprehensive examination of encounters with unidentified aerial objects as well as an investigation into how the military is tracking objects floating over the country.

            President Joe Biden has said the military is developing “sharper rules” to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects. He has justified the downings by saying the objects presented a remote risk to civilian planes.

            But the four missile attacks were the first known peacetime shootdowns of unauthorized objects in U.S. airspace. Officials now say the three later objects shot down likely had a “benign purpose"" and were detected after the U.S. military set its radar systems to detect slow-moving balloons.

            China's alleged practice of using balloons for surveillance exploits a potential oversight in air traffic control systems, Kelly said. The systems aren’t designed to track the thousands of objects that move in on high-altitude winds. 

            The National Weather Service alone launches roughly 60,000 balloons every year to monitor for extreme weather. Universities, government organizations and even ham radio hobbyists send up thousands of others.

            “This is about whether an adversary has developed a capability that they know we’re not looking for because our systems are set up to see missiles and airplanes. They’re not set up to see smaller objects at lower altitudes,” said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, who is pushing for the recent encounters to be included in a wider government study of “unidentified aerial phenomena” — better known as UFOs, short for unidentified flying objects.

            Rubio, along with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, also jumped on the opportunity to renew a proposal to create the Space National Guard.

            “China has fused its commercial, military and technological applications in ways no other nation ever has,” Rubio told reporters. “So it’s a multifaceted challenge and one that will require a comprehensive, long-term and committed response.”

            But the bills face uncertain paths to becoming law. 

            As senators were clued in to the origins of the objects shot down this month, some appeared ready to move on. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, quipped about aliens and said “there’s just a bunch of junk up there.”WASHINGTON (AP) — As the only current U.S. senator to have visited space, Mark Kelly knows something about unexplained objects in the skies.Back in his aviator days, Kelly saw Mylar party balloons fly by his cockpit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816331,Spain: Transport officials resign over train design blunder,"MADRID (AP) — A major error in the designs of trains for two northern Spanish regions has led to the resignations of two top transport officials, bringing to four the number of people who have lost their jobs because of the controversy this month.

            A total of 31 narrow-gauge commuter and medium distance trains were ordered in 2020 for the regions of Asturias and Cantabria but it emerged just weeks ago that under the original designs the trains would not have fitted in tunnels in the regions.

            The trains will be redesigned to fit the tunnels, but this will lead to substantial delays in their delivery.











            The revelations angered both regions and led to demands for resignations.

            On Monday, the Secretary of State for Transport, Isabel Pardo de Vera — the minister´s right-hand colleague — handed in her resignation, as did the president of the state rail company RENFE, Isaías Taboas.

            When the error became public early February, RENFE and the state-owned rail infrastructure company Adif fired two senior officials.

            The Transport Ministry says the errors were spotted early on and no money has been wasted. However, both regions will now have to wait for another two or three years before they get their new trains.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816332,Moscow downplays significance of Biden's visit to Kyiv,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russian officials and state media downplayed President Joe Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday, painting Kyiv as a U.S. puppet and maintaining Moscow's forces will prevail despite Washington's pledges to send more weapons to Ukraine.

            Biden met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital in a defiant display of Western solidarity with a country still fighting what he called “a brutal and unjust war” days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion.

            The visit also came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's scheduled state-of-the-nation address, which some in Russia expect to set the tone for the year ahead — including for Putin's bogged-down campaign in Ukraine.











            Biden spent more than five hours in Kyiv, consulting with Zelenskyy on next steps, honoring the country’s fallen soldiers and seeing U.S. embassy staff.

            He announced an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance — on top of the more than $50 billion already provided — for shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, air surveillance radars and other aid but no new advanced weaponry.

            Russian state television covered the visit extensively, with anchors saying that it was clear that Biden ""runs things” in Ukraine, which fits into the Kremlin's narrative that Zelesnkyy's government is a stooge of the U.S. administration. 

            A Russian-installed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by Russia’s state news RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Zelenskyy “looked like a servant next to Biden.”

            Other commentators noted that Biden might seek re-election in 2024 and said his visit to Kyiv kicked off his campaign. 

            “Biden in Kyiv started his election campaign in the most heroic surroundings in order to prove to everyone that he can still ‘do it just like in the good old days',” senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev said in a Telegram post, adding that “Kyiv was left with no choice by to try and drive people to the senseless slaughter as part of Biden’s election campaign.”

            Pro-Kremlin pundits on state TV also alleged that Biden received security guarantees from Moscow ahead of the visit. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. government notified Moscow of Biden’s visit to Kyiv shortly before his departure from Washington “for deconfliction purposes” in an effort to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict.

            “Everyone knows that if Russia said that it wouldn't hit Kyiv during a visit of some statesmen there, it means this will never happen, because we are the ones who keep their word, those who are on the side of the good and the civilized,"" pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov said in a political talk show on state Russia 1 TV channel. 

            The deputy head of Russia’s Security Council and former president, Dmitry Medvedev, in a post on the Telegram messaging app also claimed that Biden had received “safety guarantees.”

            Medvedev said Biden “pledged allegiance to the neo-Nazi regime” — as Kremlin officials refer to Ukraine's government — and promised it more weapons, but the millions of people leaving Ukraine provide an answer “to the question of who the future belongs to.”

            And state TV journalist Andrei Medvedev in a Telegram post simply stated: “Will this visit influence the final outcome of the war? No. Absolutely not,” although admitting that it would influence “the course of the hostilities at the moment and morale of Ukrainian citizens.”

            Political analyst Tatyana Stanovaya said the Kremlin will view Biden's visit as “yet one more piece of evidence that the U.S. has completely bet on Russia's strategic defeat in the war, and that the war itself has irrevocably turned into a war between Russia and the West.” 

            Stanovaya said Putin's state-of-the-nation speech on Tuesday “was expected to be very hawkish, aimed at defiantly breaking off relations with the West,” but after Biden's visit to Kyiv, “additional edits can be made to make it even harsher.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816334,Some Anglican bishops reject leader Welby over gay marriage,"LONDON (AP) — Several Anglican bishops from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific said Monday that they no longer recognize Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby as their leader, deepening a rift within the global Anglican Communion over gay marriage.

            Some bishops who belong to the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches said they no longer consider Welby to be the spiritual head of the global communion and do not regard the Church of England, which Welby heads, as the “mother church” of Anglicanism.

            Earlier this month the Church of England’s national assembly, the General Synod, voted to let priests bless same-sex couples, while maintaining a ban on clergy conducting gay weddings. Same-sex civil marriage has been legal in Britain for almost a decade.











            The synod’s decision was a compromise measure that came after years of wrangling about the church’s stance on homosexuality. Welby said he wouldn’t personally bless any same-sex couples because it’s his job to unify the 85 million members of the global Anglican Communion.

            The dissenting bishops said the Church of England had “departed from the historic faith” and the synod’s decision ran “contrary to the faith and order of the orthodox provinces in the communion.”

            The primates said they were “no longer able to recognize” Welby “as the ‘first among equals’ Leader of the global Communion.” The statement was signed by the Global South Fellowship’s chair, South Sudan Archbishop Justin Badi, and the archbishops of Chile, the Indian Ocean, Congo, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Uganda, Sudan, Alexandria and Melanesia. 

            The bishops represent about a quarter of the 42 member churches of the Anglican Communion.

            The move brings a schism in the communion closer, but it’s not clear what happens next.

            Welby’s Lambeth Palace office said in a statement that “no changes to the formal structures of the Anglican Communion can be made unless they are agreed upon by the Instruments of Communion.”

            “The deep disagreements that exist across the Anglican Communion on sexuality and marriage are not new,” the statement said. But, it added: “In a world of conflict, suffering and uncertainty, we must remember that more unites us than divides us.”LONDON (AP) — Several Anglican bishops from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific said Monday that they no longer recognize Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby as their leader, deepening a rift within the global Anglican Communion over gay marriage.Some bishops who belong to the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches said they no longer consider Welby to be the spiritual head of the global communion and do not regard the Church of England, which Welby heads, as the “mother church” of Anglicanism.Earlier this month the Church of England’s national assembly, the General Synod, voted to let priests bless same-sex couples, while maintaining a ban on clergy conducting gay weddings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816335,Mets' Cohen cautions spending doesn't mean title this year,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — Mets owner Steve Cohen cautions the team's record spending won't necessarily lead to a World Series title this year.

            “You know how hard it is to get to get into the World Series — as we saw last year, right?” Cohen said Monday at New York's spring training camp. “So the only thing you can do is put yourself in position where good things can happen. Got to make the playoffs. The team’s got to be healthy. It’s got to be rested. It’s got to be raring to go. And then you let the chips fall where they may. And if you keep putting yourself there, one day we’ll get there. Obviously, I’d love it sooner than later. But, you know, I can’t control that.”

            New York won its only World Series titles in 1969 and 1986. The Mets won 101 games last year, second-most in franchise history but were unable to hold off Atlanta in the NL East after sitting atop the division for all but six days. The Mets were eliminated by San Diego in a three-game Wild Card Series.











            New York raised its payroll to a projected $370 million and is set to shatter the record, set by the 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers at $291 million.

            The Mets had a $146 million payroll in 2019, the last fully played season under the Wilpon and Katz familiies. New York boosted payroll to $199 million in 2021, the first season after Cohen bought the team, and $275 million last year, when the Mets led the major leagues in spending for the first time since 1989.

            Cohen cited inflation as a factor in the offseason spending spree.

            “All of the sudden we were looking at prices up 20, 30%,” Cohen said. “That was a shocker to me, and certainly changed our plans, and I had to think differently. You know, $300 million, which is still a lot of money, didn’t get us like it used to — what we could.”

            Cohen's Mets signed AL Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a $86.7 millon, two-year contract, added pitchers Kodai Senga ($75 million for five years), José Quintana ($26 million for two years) and David Robertson ($10 million for one years), along with catcher Omar Narváez ($15 million for two years). New York also re-signed closer Edwin Díaz ($102 million for five years), outfielder Brandon Nimmo ($162 million for eight years), infielder Jeff McNeil ($50 million for four years) and reliever Adam Ottavino ($14.5 million for two years).

            New York projects to have a luxury tax payroll of about $390 million, which would result in a tax of about $116 million. While negotiators for teams and players adopted a fourth tax threshold last year know as the “Cohen tax,” the Mets owner has used his hedge-fund riches to keep spending. That has increased disparity in a sport that saw four teams finish last year with payrolls under $100 million.

            “They’ve been dealing with that problem for a long time,” Cohen said. “It’s really hard for me to say how to solve that because I think it’s a multi-variable problem. I think ultimately, I think the key for baseball is you need to grow revenues. And it can’t be through constantly raising ticket prices. It’s got to be getting more attendance, getting more interest in the game.”

            Cohen said some other owners told him at recent meetings they realized he was following the established rules. He doesn’t believe the owner's new economic study group will formulate proposals specifically aimed at him.

            “Absolutely not,” Cohen said. “There’s plenty of issues there. The media issues, as we know about, there are revenue issues, right? Attendance issues. So, you know, I say it again, I think it’s great that the owners are getting together discuss all these issues.”

            With team president Sandy Alderson shifting to a special assistant role, Cohen intends a more of a day-to-day role in management.

            Cohen expects improvement from the Mets farm system will cause less dependance on free agents, calling current behavior a “bridge” to the future.

            “People have to be patient,” Cohen said. “It’s taking time. I see progress, and I’m encouraged what we’re doing down in the lower part of the system. And from what I hear, we’re developing pitchers, which I think is really important.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816336,Major league teams searching for advantages with new rules,"PHOENIX (AP) — It’s a brand new day in the major leagues — potentially an even brighter one for base-stealers like Trea Turner and Ronald Acuña Jr., and most definitely a change of pace for veteran aces like Gerrit Cole or Yu Darvish.

            The bases are bigger, and the pickoff rules are different. The pitch clock has arrived, and infield shifts are gone.

            Sorry, Shohei Ohtani, you took too long to throw that pitch. Bryce Harper, get back in the batter’s box. Xander Bogaerts, can’t stand there when Mookie Betts is hitting.











            Only one thing is certain to stay the same: Everyone will try to find an edge, aiming to take advantage of baseball's dramatic alterations.

            “I think the one thing we know about our industry is to the extent there's an advantage to be gained, every team is going to be doing everything possible to try to exploit that advantage to the best of its ability,” said Chris Antonetti, president of baseball operations for the Cleveland Guardians.

            Those are the conversations that are dominating spring training this year after Major League Baseball approved a series of changes in September in an effort to make the sport more appealing to a younger generation turned off by its lack of action and leisurely tempo.

            As players reported to camps in Florida and Arizona to ramp up their preparation for the season, Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed confidence that the changes would work — after what could be an occasionally bumpy transition period.

            “I think you're going to see a game that moves along with more pace,” Manfred said. “I think you're going to see more balls in play. I think that you're going to look at the field and see players positioned the way that most of us grew up seeing them positioned. And I really think that (you're) going to see a movement toward the very best form of our game.”

            The size of the bases has been increased to 18-inch squares from 15. The new pitch clock is 15 seconds with no runners on base and 20 seconds with runners. The increasingly frequent infield shift has been eliminated, and there is a limit of two of what MLB calls disengagements — pickoff attempts or steps off the rubber — per plate appearance.

            “I think the pitch clock will be the most impactful for sure,” Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “I mean I'm hoping that's the one that's most impactful. I hope fans notice a real improvement in the pace of the game.”

            The pitch clock helped reduce the average time of a nine-inning game in the minor leagues from 3 hours, 4 minutes in 2021 to 2:38 last season. A catcher is required to be in the catcher’s box with nine seconds left on the clock and a hitter in the batter’s box and focused on the pitcher with eight seconds remaining.

            Penalties for violations will be a ball called against a pitcher and a strike called against a batter. And there almost assuredly will be some violations through the start of the season as players get used to the clock.

            “I'm not worried about it,” Chicago White Sox pitcher Lance Lynn said. “The hitters are going to hate it.”

            Under the new rules on defensive positioning, two infielders will be required to be on either side of second and all infielders to be within the outer boundary of the infield when the pitcher is on the rubber. Infielders may not switch sides unless there is a substitution, but five-man infields will still be allowed.

            With the elimination of the shift, major league teams could get more creative with their outfielders. It’s not hard to imagine a late-game scenario where a corner outfielder could move into a spot that a shifted infielder used to fill.

            “At least for my lifetime, when a ball's hit in a certain spot, you feel like, at least when you're watching on TV, you feel like it's a hit and you look up and somebody's standing there,” San Diego Padres general manager A.J. Preller said.

            “So I think that'll probably take some getting used to, kind of seeing that shift back, and from a strategy standpoint, how that plays out.”

            The bigger bases are intended to help reduce injuries and increase stolen bases — due to their size, the bases are closer together by a few inches. There were 3,297 steal attempts in the majors last year, according to Sportradar, up from 2,926 in 2021 but a marked decrease compared with 4,365 attempts a decade ago in 2012.

            All those bang-bang plays on the bases just got a little more interesting.

            But the most intriguing change just might be the limit on disengagements. A balk is called for a third step off or pickoff unless there is an out, and the limit is reset if a runner advances.

            What pitchers do with their disengagements — which ones keep one in their back pocket, which ones use all of them and which ones are willing to risk a balk with a throw over — will be closely scouted at the start of the season as teams look for a baserunning edge.

            “There's a lot of gamesmanship here,” Chicago Cubs general manager Carter Hawkins said. “So try to figure out how to best play it. I'm sure there'll be some cat-and-mouse games going on, and different pitchers will come up with different plans that we'll have to adjust to, and baserunners as well.

            ""I think that's exciting to be able to watch and some chances for some competitive advantages.”

The increasingly frequent infield shift has been eliminated, and there is a limit of two of what MLB calls disengagements — pickoff attempts or steps off the rubber — per plate appearance.“I think the pitch clock will be the most impactful for sure,” Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “I mean I'm hoping that's the one that's most impactful. I hope fans notice a real improvement in the pace of the game.”The pitch clock helped reduce the average time of a nine-inning game in the minor leagues from 3 hours, 4 minutes in 2021 to 2:38 last season. A catcher is required to be in the catcher’s box with nine seconds left on the clock and a hitter in the batter’s box and focused on the pitcher with eight seconds remaining.Penalties for violations will be a ball called against a pitcher and a strike called against a batter. And there almost assuredly will be some violations through the start of the season as players get used to the clock.“I'm not worried about it,” Chicago White Sox pitcher Lance Lynn said. “The hitters are going to hate it.”Under the new rules on defensive positioning, two infielders will be required to be on either side of second and all infielders to be within the outer boundary of the infield when the pitcher is on the rubber. Infielders may not switch sides unless there is a substitution, but five-man infields will still be allowed.With the elimination of the shift, major league teams could get more creative with their outfielders. It’s not hard to imagine a late-game scenario where a corner outfielder could move into a spot that a shifted infielder used to fill.“At least for my lifetime, when a ball's hit in a certain spot, you feel like, at least when you're watching on TV, you feel like it's a hit and you look up and somebody's standing there,” San Diego Padres general manager A.J. Preller said.“So I think that'll probably take some getting used to, kind of seeing that shift back, and from a strategy standpoint, how that plays out.”The bigger bases are intended to help reduce injuries and increase stolen bases — due to their size, the bases are closer together by a few inches. There were 3,297 steal attempts in the majors last year, according to Sportradar, up from 2,926 in 2021 but a marked decrease compared with 4,365 attempts a decade ago in 2012.All those bang-bang plays on the bases just got a little more interesting.But the most intriguing change just might be the limit on disengagements. A balk is called for a third step off or pickoff unless there is an out, and the limit is reset if a runner advances.What pitchers do with their disengagements — which ones keep one in their back pocket, which ones use all of them and which ones are willing to risk a balk with a throw over — will be closely scouted at the start of the season as teams look for a baserunning edge.“There's a lot of gamesmanship here,” Chicago Cubs general manager Carter Hawkins said. “So try to figure out how to best play it. I'm sure there'll be some cat-and-mouse games going on, and different pitchers will come up with different plans that we'll have to adjust to, and baserunners as well.""I think that's exciting to be able to watch and some chances for some competitive advantages.”___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816338,Cold-blooded: Abandoned alligator rescued from Brooklyn lake,"NEW YORK (AP) — It’s no urban legend: An alligator was found in a chilly New York City lake on Sunday, far from the subtropical and tropical climates where such creatures thrive.

            The 4-foot (1.2-meter) reptile was pulled from Prospect Park Lake in Brooklyn around 8:30 a.m. and taken to an animal care center and then the Bronx Zoo for medical treatment and rehabilitation.

            City officials said the gator appeared lethargic and possibly cold shocked. It was likely dumped as an unwanted pet, they said. Releasing animals in city parks is illegal. Police are investigating.











            For years, New Yorkers have pondered the myth that alligators roam the city’s sewer system, even celebrating Alligators in the Sewers Day as an unofficial February holiday.

            Sightings like Sunday’s help keep the urban legend alive, but experts throw cold water on the sewer theory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816354,South Carolina's No. 1 run in women's Top 25 hits 35 weeks,"South Carolina survived one of its stiffest tests of the season to remain No. 1 in The Associated Press women's college basketball poll released Monday.

            The Gamecocks (27-0) topped Mississippi in overtime on Sunday to win their 33rd consecutive game and secure the top spot in the poll for a 35th consecutive week. That is the third-longest run atop the poll, with UConn (51 weeks) and Louisiana Tech (36) having had longer streaks at No. 1. The Gamecocks broke a tie with UConn for third place.

            South Carolina received 27 of the 28 first-place votes from the national media panel. It was the first time this season that the team wasn't a unanimous choice at No. 1.











            Indiana got the other first place vote and stayed second in the poll. The Hoosiers have won 14 consecutive games and are 9-0 against AP Top 25 teams this season — the most wins against ranked opponents of any team in the country. The Hoosiers clinched at least a share of their first Big Ten title since 1983 with Sunday's win over Purdue.

            “It's nothing against South Carolina, but the Big Ten is incredibly strong this season and Indiana has played a tougher conference schedule,” voter Mitchell Northam said. “While the Gamecocks needed OT to get by Ole Miss, the Hoosiers handily beat ranked teams in Ohio State and Michigan this past week. I wanted to reward them for that. Indiana also has five wins against top 10 teams this season, the most in the country, and hasn't lost since Grace Berger has been healthy.”

            Stanford, UConn and LSU round out the top five teams.

            Iowa, which hosts Indiana on Sunday, was No. 6. The Hawkeyes were followed by Maryland, Utah, Virginia Tech and Notre Dame. The Utes dropped four places after falling to then-No. 18 Arizona. The Wildcats moved up four spots to 14th.

            RE-ENTRY

            Middle Tennessee and Illinois re-entered the poll tied at No. 25. The Blue Raiders and Illini had spent some time in the AP Top 25 before falling out. They replaced USC, which dropped games to Stanford and Cal over the weekend.

            STRUGGLING SEC

            The conference has two of the top five teams in South Carolina and LSU, but no other school is ranked. With three polls left in the season, the SEC is in danger of not having at least three teams ranked in the final AP Top 25 for the first time since the 1980-81 season, when the conference had only two.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816355,LAFC aims to defend its MLS Cup title in 2023,"LAFC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 21-9-4, 1st in the West, won the MLS Cup.

            COACH: Steve Cherundolo.











            KEY PLAYERS: Giorgio Chiellini, Carlos Vela, Kellyn Acosta.

            OUTLOOK: LAFC won the 2022 Supporters Shield and went on to lift the MLS Cup, defeating the Philadelphia Union on penalties. Coach Steve Cherundolo heads into his second year with those lofty expectations now in place. Gareth Bale, who scored the extra-time goal that sent the championship game to penalty kicks, has retired after his short stint with the team. One other key loss was Cristian Arango, who transferred to Pachuca in Mexico. There’s still a lot of firepower on the squad, and there were even recent rumors that the team is interested in Chelsea’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

            AUSTIN FC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 16-10-8, 2nd in the West, lost in the conference final to LAFC. 

            COACH: Josh Wolff. 

            KEY PLAYERS: Maxi Urruti, Sebastian Driussi, Gyasi Zardes.

            OUTLOOK: Sebastian Driussi was at times one of the league's best players last season, and wound up leading the club with 22 goals. He also had seven assists. Maxi Urruti was second on the board with nine goals. Austin was one of the league's surprise performers last season with a run to the conference finals after losing 21 games, second-most in the league, in the team's 2021 debut season. El Verde added free agent Gyasi Zardes in the offseason. Coach Josh Wolff has extra duties now that he's interim chief soccer officer after Claudio Reyna resigned amid controversy with the U.S. national team.

            COLORADO RAPIDS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-13-10, 10th in the Western Conference.

            COACH: Robin Fraser.

            KEY PLAYERS: Diego Rubio, Bryan Acosta, Cole Bassett.

            OUTLOOK: The Rapids finished atop the Western Conference in the 2021 season then failed to make the playoffs last year. Diego Rubio led the team with 16 goals last season, matching the franchise record. He leads the team all-time with 13 game-winning goals. Cole Bassett returns to the team after going to the Netherlands on loan. The Rapids also acquired Kevin Cabral from the LA Galaxy and center back Andreas Maxso from Danish club Bronby. One young player getting a lot of buzz: 18-year-old homegrown Darren Yapi. 

            FC DALLAS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-9-11, 3rd in the West, lost in the conference semifinal to Austin.

            COACH: Nico Estevez.

            KEY PLAYERS: Sebastian Lletget, Jesss Ferreira, Paul Arriola.

            OUTLOOK: Dallas is loaded with talent, led by forward Jesus Ferreira, who scored 18 goals with the team last season. Ferreira made the U.S. World Cup team but didn't play until the round of 16 match loss to the Netherlands. Paul Arriola, who had 10 goals for Dallas last year, was not included on the national team roster for Qatar despite playing for the team during qualifying. Lletget was acquired by Dallas in the offseason from the New England Revolution. Under coach Nico Estevez, the team improved 20 points last season over 2021, the biggest one-year turnaround in team history.

            HOUSTON DYNAMO

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-18-6, 13th in the West. 

            COACH: Ben Olsen.

            KEY PLAYERS: Hector Herrera, Sebastián Ferreira, Franco Escobar

            OUTLOOK: New head coach Ben Olsen is in the midst of a major rebuild. The team will rely on Hector Herrera, who is coming off his third World Cup with the Mexican national team. Herrera signed with the Dynamo last season as a designated player after spending three seasons with Atletico Madrid in Spain, but played in just 10 matches for Houston. The Dynamo also signed Franco Escobar, who was released in the offseason by LAFC, and more recently, free agent Will Bruin.

            LA GALAXY

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-12-8, 4th in the West, lost in conference semifinal to LAFC.

            COACH: Greg Vanney.

            KEY PLAYERS: Javier `Chicharito' Hernandez, Douglas Costa, Riqui Puig. 

            OUTLOOK: Right back Julian Araujo was headed to Barcelona for a reported $4 million transfer fee but the paperwork was processed 18 seconds too late and Araujo was in a strange limbo during the preseason. But the deal eventually went through. Coach Greg Vanney has an open designated player spot after the trade of Kevin Cabral to Colorado in December. The Galaxy will certainly look to get more out of Douglas Costa. The team added free agent Memo Rodriguez from Houston.

            MINNESOTA UNITED

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 6th in the West, lost in the opening round to Dallas. 

            COACH: Adrian Heath.

            KEY PLAYERS: Dayne St. Claire, Emanuel Reynoso, Luis Amarilla. 

            OUTLOOK: The Loons head into the season with uncertainty surrounding designated player Emanuel Reynoso. The Argentine has been suspended without pay for failing to show up for the preseason. He had 10 goals and 11 assists for Minnesota last season, and has signed with the team through 2026. Dayne St. Claire should start in goal after the offseason departure of Tyler Miller. The Loons are the only Western Conference team to appear in the playoffs for four straight years. 

            PORTLAND TIMBERS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-10-13, 8th in the West. 

            COACH: Giovanni Savarese.

            KEY PLAYERS: Evander, Eryk Williamson, Diego Chara.

            OUTLOOK: The Timbers missed out on the playoffs last season and made one big offseason move with the signing of Brazilian Evander. The club has been dealing with off-the-pitch issues stemming from the abuse and misconduct scandal in the National Women's Soccer League. Timbers owner Merritt Paulson, who also owns the NWSL's Portland Thorns, stepped away from an active role with the team last year. The Timbers recently named Ned Grabavoy as its new general manager, and Heather Davis as the club's new CEO.

            REAL SALT LAKE

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-11-11, 7th in the West, lost in the opening round to Austin.

            COACH: Pablo Mastroeni.

            KEY PLAYERS: Carlos Andres Gomez, Damir Kreilach, Jefferson Savarino. 

            OUTLOOK: Winger Carlos Andres Gomez was signed in January from Colombian club Millonarios. RSL reportedly paid the biggest transfer fee in club history for the 20-year-old, who had 10 goals last season. He won the Copa Colombia's Golden Boot with three goals during the competition. Salt Lake will look again to Rubio Rubin, who won MLS Goal of the Year honors in 2021. Captain Damir Kreilach appears to be healthy after missing much of 2022 with a back injury.

            SAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 8-15-11, last in the West.

            COACH: Luchi Gonzalez.

            KEY PLAYERS: Jeremy Ebobisse, Jonathan Mensah, Cade Cowell.

            OUTLOOK: Luchi Gonzalez, who most recently was an assistant on the U.S. national team that went to the World Cup in Qatar, returns to coach the team that drafted him as a player in 2002. Gonzalez previously coached FC Dallas. The Quakes added defender Jonathan Mensah, acquired in the trade with the Columbus Crew. Defender Nathan will miss the season after a preseason ACL injury. Young player to keep an eye on: 16-year-old Cruz Medina, who signed with the team last year and has been making noise for the U.S. under-17 national team. He has yet to appear with the first-team Quakes. 

            SEATTLE SOUNDERS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-17-5, 11th in the West.

            COACH: Brian Schmetzer.

            KEY PLAYERS: Jordan Morris, Nicolás Lodeiro, Raul Ruidiaz. 

            OUTLOOK: The Sounders won the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League, snapping a run of 13-straight teams from Liga MX to win the title. As a result, Seattle became the first MLS team to appear in the Club World Cup. The team's debut in the tournament was short-lived with a 1-0 loss to Egyptian club Al Ahly. The Sounders have a strong side, again. The team locked Jordan Morris and Cristian Roldan into deals that will keep them with the club through 2027. They added forward Heber in a trade with NYCFC.

            SPORTING KANSAS CITY

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-16-7, 12th in the West. 

            COACH: Peter Vermes

            KEY PLAYERS: Alan Pulido, Graham Zusi, Willy Agada.

            OUTLOOK: There are rumors that Alan Pulido may bolt for Chivas de Guadalajara in Liga MX. Sporting added Serbian defensive mid Nemanja Radoja and German left back Tim Leibold in the offseason. Sporting may have a battle for the starting spot at goalkeeper between veteran Tim Melia, who had hamstring issues last season, and John Pulskamp, who replaced Melia and performed well. Defender Kortne Ford ruptured his Achilles tendon in a preseason match and is out for the season.

            ST. LOUIS CITY

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: Expansion team for 2023.

            COACH: Bradley Carnell.

            KEY PLAYERS: Joao Klauss, Indiana Vassilev, Roman Burki.

            OUTLOOK: City has an experienced goalkeeper in Roman Burki, who came to MLS after a long career with Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga. Swedish international Joakim Nilsson, a defender who also came from the Bundesliga, will also be tasked with a leadership role. St. Louis also acquired midfielder Indiana Vassilev in the expansion draft from Inter Miami, where he spent part of the last two seasons on loan from Aston Villa. One young player to watch: 15-year-old Caden Glover, the team's first-ever homegrown player.

            VANCOUVER WHITECAPS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-15-7, 9th in the West. 

            COACH: Vanni Sartini.

            KEY PLAYERS: Julian Gressel, Mathias Laborda, Yohei Takaoka.

            OUTLOOK: Veteran forward Tosaint Ricketts, who also played for Toronto FC, retired from MLS but is now on Vancouver's staff as a club and player engagement liaison. The team is looking to add forward Sergio Cordova, who joined the team in the preseason, but the signing isn't official just yet. The Whitecaps added goalkeeper Yohei Takaoka and Uruguayan center back Mathias Laborda in the offseason. Forward Lucas Cavallini, who had been with the Whitecaps since the 2020 season, left for Tijuana in Liga MX.

            AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLAFC2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 21-9-4, 1st in the West, won the MLS Cup.COACH: Steve Cherundolo.KEY PLAYERS: Giorgio Chiellini, Carlos Vela, Kellyn Acosta.OUTLOOK: LAFC won the 2022 Supporters Shield and went on to lift the MLS Cup, defeating the Philadelphia Union on penalties. Coach Steve Cherundolo heads into his second year with those lofty expectations now in place. Gareth Bale, who scored the extra-time goal that sent the championship game to penalty kicks, has retired after his short stint with the team. One other key loss was Cristian Arango, who transferred to Pachuca in Mexico. There’s still a lot of firepower on the squad, and there were even recent rumors that the team is interested in Chelsea’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.AUSTIN FC2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 16-10-8, 2nd in the West, lost in the conference final to LAFC.COACH: Josh Wolff.KEY PLAYERS: Maxi Urruti, Sebastian Driussi, Gyasi Zardes.OUTLOOK: Sebastian Driussi was at times one of the league's best players last season, and wound up leading the club with 22 goals. He also had seven assists. Maxi Urruti was second on the board with nine goals. Austin was one of the league's surprise performers last season with a run to the conference finals after losing 21 games, second-most in the league, in the team's 2021 debut season. El Verde added free agent Gyasi Zardes in the offseason. Coach Josh Wolff has extra duties now that he's interim chief soccer officer after Claudio Reyna resigned amid controversy with the U.S. national team.COLORADO RAPIDS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-13-10, 10th in the Western Conference.COACH: Robin Fraser.KEY PLAYERS: Diego Rubio, Bryan Acosta, Cole Bassett.OUTLOOK: The Rapids finished atop the Western Conference in the 2021 season then failed to make the playoffs last year. Diego Rubio led the team with 16 goals last season, matching the franchise record. He leads the team all-time with 13 game-winning goals. Cole Bassett returns to the team after going to the Netherlands on loan. The Rapids also acquired Kevin Cabral from the LA Galaxy and center back Andreas Maxso from Danish club Bronby. One young player getting a lot of buzz: 18-year-old homegrown Darren Yapi.FC DALLAS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-9-11, 3rd in the West, lost in the conference semifinal to Austin.COACH: Nico Estevez.KEY PLAYERS: Sebastian Lletget, Jesss Ferreira, Paul Arriola.OUTLOOK: Dallas is loaded with talent, led by forward Jesus Ferreira, who scored 18 goals with the team last season. Ferreira made the U.S. World Cup team but didn't play until the round of 16 match loss to the Netherlands. Paul Arriola, who had 10 goals for Dallas last year, was not included on the national team roster for Qatar despite playing for the team during qualifying. Lletget was acquired by Dallas in the offseason from the New England Revolution. Under coach Nico Estevez, the team improved 20 points last season over 2021, the biggest one-year turnaround in team history.HOUSTON DYNAMO2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-18-6, 13th in the West.COACH: Ben Olsen.KEY PLAYERS: Hector Herrera, Sebastián Ferreira, Franco EscobarOUTLOOK: New head coach Ben Olsen is in the midst of a major rebuild. The team will rely on Hector Herrera, who is coming off his third World Cup with the Mexican national team. Herrera signed with the Dynamo last season as a designated player after spending three seasons with Atletico Madrid in Spain, but played in just 10 matches for Houston. The Dynamo also signed Franco Escobar, who was released in the offseason by LAFC, and more recently, free agent Will Bruin.LA GALAXY2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-12-8, 4th in the West, lost in conference semifinal to LAFC.COACH: Greg Vanney.KEY PLAYERS: Javier `Chicharito' Hernandez, Douglas Costa, Riqui Puig.OUTLOOK: Right back Julian Araujo was headed to Barcelona for a reported $4 million transfer fee but the paperwork was processed 18 seconds too late and Araujo was in a strange limbo during the preseason. But the deal eventually went through. Coach Greg Vanney has an open designated player spot after the trade of Kevin Cabral to Colorado in December. The Galaxy will certainly look to get more out of Douglas Costa. The team added free agent Memo Rodriguez from Houston.MINNESOTA UNITED2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 6th in the West, lost in the opening round to Dallas.COACH: Adrian Heath.KEY PLAYERS: Dayne St. Claire, Emanuel Reynoso, Luis Amarilla.OUTLOOK: The Loons head into the season with uncertainty surrounding designated player Emanuel Reynoso. The Argentine has been suspended without pay for failing to show up for the preseason. He had 10 goals and 11 assists for Minnesota last season, and has signed with the team through 2026. Dayne St. Claire should start in goal after the offseason departure of Tyler Miller. The Loons are the only Western Conference team to appear in the playoffs for four straight years.PORTLAND TIMBERS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-10-13, 8th in the West.COACH: Giovanni Savarese.KEY PLAYERS: Evander, Eryk Williamson, Diego Chara.OUTLOOK: The Timbers missed out on the playoffs last season and made one big offseason move with the signing of Brazilian Evander. The club has been dealing with off-the-pitch issues stemming from the abuse and misconduct scandal in the National Women's Soccer League. Timbers owner Merritt Paulson, who also owns the NWSL's Portland Thorns, stepped away from an active role with the team last year. The Timbers recently named Ned Grabavoy as its new general manager, and Heather Davis as the club's new CEO.REAL SALT LAKE2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-11-11, 7th in the West, lost in the opening round to Austin.COACH: Pablo Mastroeni.KEY PLAYERS: Carlos Andres Gomez, Damir Kreilach, Jefferson Savarino.OUTLOOK: Winger Carlos Andres Gomez was signed in January from Colombian club Millonarios. RSL reportedly paid the biggest transfer fee in club history for the 20-year-old, who had 10 goals last season. He won the Copa Colombia's Golden Boot with three goals during the competition. Salt Lake will look again to Rubio Rubin, who won MLS Goal of the Year honors in 2021. Captain Damir Kreilach appears to be healthy after missing much of 2022 with a back injury.SAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 8-15-11, last in the West.COACH: Luchi Gonzalez.KEY PLAYERS: Jeremy Ebobisse, Jonathan Mensah, Cade Cowell.OUTLOOK: Luchi Gonzalez, who most recently was an assistant on the U.S. national team that went to the World Cup in Qatar, returns to coach the team that drafted him as a player in 2002. Gonzalez previously coached FC Dallas. The Quakes added defender Jonathan Mensah, acquired in the trade with the Columbus Crew. Defender Nathan will miss the season after a preseason ACL injury. Young player to keep an eye on: 16-year-old Cruz Medina, who signed with the team last year and has been making noise for the U.S. under-17 national team. He has yet to appear with the first-team Quakes.SEATTLE SOUNDERS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-17-5, 11th in the West.COACH: Brian Schmetzer.KEY PLAYERS: Jordan Morris, Nicolás Lodeiro, Raul Ruidiaz.OUTLOOK: The Sounders won the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League, snapping a run of 13-straight teams from Liga MX to win the title. As a result, Seattle became the first MLS team to appear in the Club World Cup. The team's debut in the tournament was short-lived with a 1-0 loss to Egyptian club Al Ahly. The Sounders have a strong side, again. The team locked Jordan Morris and Cristian Roldan into deals that will keep them with the club through 2027. They added forward Heber in a trade with NYCFC.SPORTING KANSAS CITY2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 11-16-7, 12th in the West.COACH: Peter VermesKEY PLAYERS: Alan Pulido, Graham Zusi, Willy Agada.OUTLOOK: There are rumors that Alan Pulido may bolt for Chivas de Guadalajara in Liga MX. Sporting added Serbian defensive mid Nemanja Radoja and German left back Tim Leibold in the offseason. Sporting may have a battle for the starting spot at goalkeeper between veteran Tim Melia, who had hamstring issues last season, and John Pulskamp, who replaced Melia and performed well. Defender Kortne Ford ruptured his Achilles tendon in a preseason match and is out for the season.ST. LOUIS CITY2022 RECORD AND FINISH: Expansion team for 2023.COACH: Bradley Carnell.KEY PLAYERS: Joao Klauss, Indiana Vassilev, Roman Burki.OUTLOOK: City has an experienced goalkeeper in Roman Burki, who came to MLS after a long career with Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga. Swedish international Joakim Nilsson, a defender who also came from the Bundesliga, will also be tasked with a leadership role. St. Louis also acquired midfielder Indiana Vassilev in the expansion draft from Inter Miami, where he spent part of the last two seasons on loan from Aston Villa. One young player to watch: 15-year-old Caden Glover, the team's first-ever homegrown player.VANCOUVER WHITECAPS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-15-7, 9th in the West.COACH: Vanni Sartini.KEY PLAYERS: Julian Gressel, Mathias Laborda, Yohei Takaoka.OUTLOOK: Veteran forward Tosaint Ricketts, who also played for Toronto FC, retired from MLS but is now on Vancouver's staff as a club and player engagement liaison.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816357,"LA Sparks sign Yang Liwei, 2nd China-born player for team","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Sparks have signed guard Yang Liwei, who will become the second China-born player to suit up for the team.

            Zheng Haixia was drafted by the Sparks in 1997 and played one season for them, leading the league in field-goal percentage.

            Yang recently led China to a silver medal in the 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup. She averaged 9.3 points, 3.9 assists and 1.6 rebounds in eight games.











            In her most recent season with Inner Mongolia, Yang averaged 13.5 points, 5.2 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 19 games. She also shot a career-best 61% from the field.

            Yang previously played 10 seasons in Guangdong, including two with current Sparks forward Nneka Ogwumike in 2014 and 2019.

            “She will bring us tremendous energy and enthusiasm on the court,” Sparks coach Curt Miller said. ""She is a terrific leader on the Chinese National Team and we look forward to that leadership impacting our locker room.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816358,Philadelphia looks to build on MLS success in the East,"PHILADELPHIA UNION

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 19-5-10, 1st the East, lost in the MLS Cup final to LAFC. 

            COACH: Jim Curtin.











            KEY PLAYERS: Andre Blake, Kai Wagner, Alejandro Bedoya. 

            OUTLOOK: The Union made it all the way to the MLS Cup final but fell to champion LAFC on penalties. Jim Curtin won MLS Coach of the Year honors, while Andre Blake won Goalkeeper of the Year. The team has not changed all that much in the offseason, but the Union sold Paxten Aaronson to Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Bundesliga, and acquired attacking midfielder Joaquín Torres in a trade with Montreal. Philadelphia is likely to use nearly the same starting lineup as last season. 

            CF MONTREAL

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 20-9-5, 2nd in the East, lost in the conference semifinal to NYCFC. 

            COACH: Hernan Losada. 

            KEY PLAYERS: Romell Quioto, Kei Kamara, Victor Wanyama.

            OUTLOOK: Montreal lost coach Wilfried Nancy, who took over in Columbus, and hired Hernan Losada, who was dismissed by D.C. United early last year. Montreal had a big sale in the offseason, sending defender Alistair Johnston to Scottish team Celtic, midfielder Djordje Mihailovic to AZ Alkmaar in Holland and midfielder Ismael Kone to Watford in the English second division. The team brought in Aaron Herrera from Salt Lake and George Campbell from Atlanta. One thing to watch: Kei Kamara has said he's looking to land elsewhere but so far he's still on the roster.

            NEW YORK CITY FC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 16-11-7, 3rd in the East, lost in the conference final to Philadelphia. 

            COACH: Nick Cushing. 

            KEY PLAYERS: Thiago Martins, Gabriel Pereira, Talles Magno. 

            OUTLOOK: Midfielder Maxi Moralez returned to Racing Club in his native Argentina after six seasons with NYCFC. He had 26 goals and 69 assists during his tenure. Forward Heber was traded to Seattle and goalkeeper Sean Johnson signed with Toronto. It appears that Nick Cushing will have a rebuilding project on his hands in his first full year at the team's coach. NYCFC brought in goalkeeper Matthew Freese from Philadelphia to replace Johnson. NYCFC won the MLS Cup in 2021.

            NASHVILLE SC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 13-10-11, 5th in the West, lost in the opening round to the LA Galaxy. 

            COACH: Gary Smith. 

            KEY PLAYERS: Hany Mukhtar, Walker Zimmerman, C.J. Sapong. 

            OUTLOOK: Nashville SC moves back to the Eastern Conference this season, following the addition of expansion St. Louis City in the West. The team has made the playoffs each year since joining the league in 2020. Hany Mukhtar won both the MLS MVP and the Golden Boot with 23 goals and 11 assists last season. Nashville added winger Fafa Picault in a trade with Houston. Walker Zimmerman played for the United States at the World Cup in Qatar. 

            NEW YORK RED BULLS

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 15-11-8, 4th place in the East, lost in the opening round to Cincinnati.

            COACH: Gerhard Struber.

            KEY PLAYERS: Cory Burke, Lewis Morgan, Dante Vanzeir.

            OUTLOOK: The Red Bulls made the playoffs for the 13th straight season, but they've never won an MLS Cup. The team had two big acquisitions in the offseason, Belgian forward Dante Vanzeir and free agent Cory Burke from Philadelphia. Captain Aaron Long went to LAFC. While winger Lewis Morgan scored a career-high 14 goals, six of those were on penalties. Still, he was the first Red Bulls player with double-digit goals since Bradley Wright-Phillips in 2018.

            CINCINNATI FC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-9-13, 5th in the East, lost in the conference semifinal to Philadelphia. 

            COACH: Pat Noonan.

            KEY PLAYERS: Brenner, Matt Miazga, Brandon Vazquez. 

            OUTLOOK: Cincinnati was among the surprise teams of 2022 with its fifth-place finish in the East after winning just four games — fewest in the league — the year before. Brandon Vazquez had 18 goals and eight assists last season. Brenner had 18 goals and six assists. There was nearly a deal to send the Brazilian to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League but it ultimately fell through. The team brought in Ecuadorian midfielder Marco Angulo.

            INTER MIAMI

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 6th in the East, lost in the opening round to NYCFC. 

            COACH: Phil Neville.

            KEY PLAYERS: Josef Martinez, Jean Mota, Leo Campana.

            OUTLOOK: Rumors abound that David Beckham may lure Lionel Messi to Miami, but that's not something that will happen in the immediate future. The team did add seasoned striker Josef Martinez in a trade with Atlanta. Martinez won an MLS Cup with United in 2018, when he won league MVP and the Golden Boot. Rodolfo Pizarro returned to Miami after spending a season with Monterrey in Liga MX. Gonzalo Higuain retired at the end of last season. 

            ORLANDO CITY

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 7th in the East, lost in the opening round to Montreal. 

            COACH: Oscar Pareja.

            KEY PLAYERS: Facundo Torres, Ercan Kara, Mauricio Pereyra.

            OUTLOOK: The Lions won the U.S. Open Cup last year, so they qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League. They'll face Tigres from Liga MX in early March. Ercan Kara was the team's top scorer with 11 goals and Facundo Torres added 10, while Mauricio Pereyra had 11 assists. But Orlando had lots of players depart in the offseason, including Junior Urso, Joao Moutinho and Tesho Akindele. Argentine Martín Ojeda was brought in from Godoy Cruz as a designated player. 

            COLUMBUS CREW

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-8-16, 8th in the East. 

            COACH: Wilfried Nancy.

            KEY PLAYERS: Cucho Hernandez, Lucas Zelarayan, Darlington Nagbe.

            OUTLOOK: Coach Caleb Porter is out, replaced in the offseason by Wilfried Nancy from Montreal. The Crew won the MLS Cup in 2020, but have missed the postseason in three of the last four seasons. Columbus has a star in Cucho Hernandez, who came to the Crew from Watford in the Premier League last July. Hernandez finished last season with nine goals and three assists. Lucas Zelarayan, named the MLS Cup MVP in 2020, had 10 goals and 11 assists last season. Keep an eye on Milos Degenek, who went to the World Cup with Australia.

            CHARLOTTE FC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 13-18-3, 9th in the East. 

            COACH: Christian Lattanzio.

            KEY PLAYERS: Enzo Copetti, Karol Swiderski, Bill Tuiloma. 

            OUTLOOK: Charlotte nearly made the playoffs in its first season and defied expectations for an expansion team. In the offseason the team added winger Enzo Copetti from Racing Club in his native Argentina, along with Ashley Westwood from Burnley. But the team was dealt a considerable emotional blow by the death of Anton Walkes in a boating accident. Karol Swiderski represented Poland at the World Cup in Qatar. 

            NEW ENGLAND REVOLUTION

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-12-12, 10th in the East. 

            COACH: Bruce Arena.

            KEY PLAYERS: Gustavo Bou, Carles Gil, Latif Blessing.

            OUTLOOK: It was a disappointing season for the Revolution, who failed to make the playoffs after winning the Supporters' Shield in 2021. Defender A.J. DeLaGarza retired, but not before signing a one-day ceremonial contract with the Galaxy, where he spent the bulk of his career. The Revs added Latif Blessing via trade with LAFC and picked up Bobby Wood in the re-entry draft. Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic is one of the best in the league but New England still gave up 50 goals last year. 

            ATLANTA UNITED

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-14-10, 11th in the East. 

            COACH: Gonzalo Pineda.

            KEY PLAYERS: Thiago Almada, Derrick Etienne Jr., Brad Guzan.

            OUTLOOK: No more Josef Martinez, the 2018 MVP and Golden Boot winner bolted for Inter Miami after Atlanta bought out his contract. But the Five Stripes still have Thiago Almada, who won the World Cup with Argentina. He's the first player to win soccer's most coveted trophy while on an MLS roster. Atlanta also made a key front office move, brining in Club President and CEO Garth Lagerwey from the Seattle Sounders. One addition was free agent Derrick Etienne Jr., who will likely start on the left wing. 

            CHICAGO FIRE

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-15-9, 12th in the East. 

            COACH: Ezra Hendrickson.

            KEY PLAYERS: Xherdan Shaqiri, Kacper Przybylko, Jairo Torres. 

            OUTLOOK: The Fire have not qualified for the postseason since 2017. Young goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina has officially moved on to Chelsea. He signed with the Premier League club last summer but served out the season in Chicago on loan. Striker Jhon Duran went to Aston Villa. But the Fire added a handful of players they hope will help put the team back in the playoffs this season, including Arnaud Souquet from Montpellier in France, Maren Haile-Selassie from Swiss club Lugano and goalkeeper Jeff Gal from Degerfors in Sweden.

            TORONTO FC

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 9-18-7, 13th in the East. 

            COACH: Bob Bradley.

            KEY PLAYERS: Jonathan Osorio, Matt Hedges, Lorenzo Insigne. 

            OUTLOOK: The Red won just nine games last year. Lorenzo Insigne, who joined Toronto last summer from Napoli, is the league's highest-paid player with a $14 million salary. The Reds also have a high-profile player in Federico Bernardeschi, brought over last summer from Juventus. In the offseason Toronto added Sigurd Rosted from Danish club Brondby. The Reds also acquired Matt Hedges and goalkeeper Sean Johnson to shore up the defense — a good thing since the team gave up 66 goals last season, second-most in the East. 

            D.C. UNITED

            2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 7-21-6, last in the East. 

            COACH: Wayne Rooney.

            KEY PLAYERS: Mateusz Klich, Tyler Miller, Christian Benteke. 

            OUTLOOK: D.C. United is by far the MLS club with the biggest turnover since last season. And, with and MLS-worst 21 losses, it was arguably necessary. The rebuilding started last summer when United named Wayne Rooney as coach. In the offseason, the team declined to bring back Ola Kamara and goalkeeper Bill Hamid. In all, they declined the options on 12 players. They signed midfielder Mateusz Klich from Leeds United and added free agent goalkeeper Tyler Miller, who is likely to start. United gave up a whopping 71 goals last season.

            AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPHILADELPHIA UNION2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 19-5-10, 1st the East, lost in the MLS Cup final to LAFC.COACH: Jim Curtin.KEY PLAYERS: Andre Blake, Kai Wagner, Alejandro Bedoya.OUTLOOK: The Union made it all the way to the MLS Cup final but fell to champion LAFC on penalties. Jim Curtin won MLS Coach of the Year honors, while Andre Blake won Goalkeeper of the Year. The team has not changed all that much in the offseason, but the Union sold Paxten Aaronson to Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Bundesliga, and acquired attacking midfielder Joaquín Torres in a trade with Montreal. Philadelphia is likely to use nearly the same starting lineup as last season.CF MONTREAL2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 20-9-5, 2nd in the East, lost in the conference semifinal to NYCFC.COACH: Hernan Losada.KEY PLAYERS: Romell Quioto, Kei Kamara, Victor Wanyama.OUTLOOK: Montreal lost coach Wilfried Nancy, who took over in Columbus, and hired Hernan Losada, who was dismissed by D.C. United early last year. Montreal had a big sale in the offseason, sending defender Alistair Johnston to Scottish team Celtic, midfielder Djordje Mihailovic to AZ Alkmaar in Holland and midfielder Ismael Kone to Watford in the English second division. The team brought in Aaron Herrera from Salt Lake and George Campbell from Atlanta. One thing to watch: Kei Kamara has said he's looking to land elsewhere but so far he's still on the roster.NEW YORK CITY FC2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 16-11-7, 3rd in the East, lost in the conference final to Philadelphia.COACH: Nick Cushing.KEY PLAYERS: Thiago Martins, Gabriel Pereira, Talles Magno.OUTLOOK: Midfielder Maxi Moralez returned to Racing Club in his native Argentina after six seasons with NYCFC. He had 26 goals and 69 assists during his tenure. Forward Heber was traded to Seattle and goalkeeper Sean Johnson signed with Toronto. It appears that Nick Cushing will have a rebuilding project on his hands in his first full year at the team's coach. NYCFC brought in goalkeeper Matthew Freese from Philadelphia to replace Johnson. NYCFC won the MLS Cup in 2021.NASHVILLE SC2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 13-10-11, 5th in the West, lost in the opening round to the LA Galaxy.COACH: Gary Smith.KEY PLAYERS: Hany Mukhtar, Walker Zimmerman, C.J. Sapong.OUTLOOK: Nashville SC moves back to the Eastern Conference this season, following the addition of expansion St. Louis City in the West. The team has made the playoffs each year since joining the league in 2020. Hany Mukhtar won both the MLS MVP and the Golden Boot with 23 goals and 11 assists last season. Nashville added winger Fafa Picault in a trade with Houston. Walker Zimmerman played for the United States at the World Cup in Qatar.NEW YORK RED BULLS2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 15-11-8, 4th place in the East, lost in the opening round to Cincinnati.COACH: Gerhard Struber.KEY PLAYERS: Cory Burke, Lewis Morgan, Dante Vanzeir.OUTLOOK: The Red Bulls made the playoffs for the 13th straight season, but they've never won an MLS Cup. The team had two big acquisitions in the offseason, Belgian forward Dante Vanzeir and free agent Cory Burke from Philadelphia. Captain Aaron Long went to LAFC. While winger Lewis Morgan scored a career-high 14 goals, six of those were on penalties. Still, he was the first Red Bulls player with double-digit goals since Bradley Wright-Phillips in 2018.CINCINNATI FC2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 12-9-13, 5th in the East, lost in the conference semifinal to Philadelphia.COACH: Pat Noonan.KEY PLAYERS: Brenner, Matt Miazga, Brandon Vazquez.OUTLOOK: Cincinnati was among the surprise teams of 2022 with its fifth-place finish in the East after winning just four games — fewest in the league — the year before. Brandon Vazquez had 18 goals and eight assists last season. Brenner had 18 goals and six assists. There was nearly a deal to send the Brazilian to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League but it ultimately fell through. The team brought in Ecuadorian midfielder Marco Angulo.INTER MIAMI2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 6th in the East, lost in the opening round to NYCFC.COACH: Phil Neville.KEY PLAYERS: Josef Martinez, Jean Mota, Leo Campana.OUTLOOK: Rumors abound that David Beckham may lure Lionel Messi to Miami, but that's not something that will happen in the immediate future. The team did add seasoned striker Josef Martinez in a trade with Atlanta. Martinez won an MLS Cup with United in 2018, when he won league MVP and the Golden Boot. Rodolfo Pizarro returned to Miami after spending a season with Monterrey in Liga MX. Gonzalo Higuain retired at the end of last season.ORLANDO CITY2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 14-14-6, 7th in the East, lost in the opening round to Montreal.COACH: Oscar Pareja.KEY PLAYERS: Facundo Torres, Ercan Kara, Mauricio Pereyra.OUTLOOK: The Lions won the U.S. Open Cup last year, so they qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League. They'll face Tigres from Liga MX in early March. Ercan Kara was the team's top scorer with 11 goals and Facundo Torres added 10, while Mauricio Pereyra had 11 assists. But Orlando had lots of players depart in the offseason, including Junior Urso, Joao Moutinho and Tesho Akindele. Argentine Martín Ojeda was brought in from Godoy Cruz as a designated player.COLUMBUS CREW2022 RECORD AND FINISH: 10-8-16, 8th in the East.COACH: Wilfried Nancy.KEY PLAYERS: Cucho Hernandez, Lucas Zelarayan, Darlington Nagbe.OUTLOOK: Coach Caleb Porter is out, replaced in the offseason by Wilfried Nancy from Montreal. The Crew won the MLS Cup in 2020, but have missed the postseason in three of the last four seasons.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816359,Talbot to miss 2023 WNBA season after injury in Australia,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Three weeks after signing with the Los Angeles Sparks, forward Stephanie Talbot will miss the upcoming WNBA season after getting hurt in her native Australia.

            The Sparks said Monday they learned that Talbot suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament while playing for the Adelaide Lightning of the WNBL, where she was league MVP in 2020.

            Talbot signed a two-year deal with the Sparks on Feb. 1. She was 10th in the WNBA in 3-point shooting last year. She averaged 5.0 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 34 games with the Seattle Storm.











            The 28-year-old forward has also played for Phoenix and Minnesota during her five seasons in the WNBA.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816362,India scrapes into T20 World Cup semis after rainy win,"GQEBERHA, South Africa (AP) — India scraped through to the semifinals at the Women's T20 World Cup after narrowly winning its rain-shortened final group game against Ireland on Monday.

            India triumphed by five runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method after setting a target of 155-6, boosted by another half-century by star opener Smriti Mandhana, who survived a host of chances to make a career-best 87 from 56 balls.

            Ireland was 54-2 in 8.2 overs and just behind the rate needed when rain arrived at St. George's Park in Gqeberha, the south coast city formerly known as Port Elizabeth.











            It meant India moved to second in Group 2 behind England and will likely go on to a semifinal against defending champion and top-ranked Australia on Thursday at Newlands in Cape Town — unless England loses to Pakistan on Tuesday by enough that its net run rate dips under India's. Then India will qualify as the top team of Group 2.

            “Good to get into the semis and we will give our 100%,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said.

            The Group 2 winner will play whoever qualifies behind Australia in Group 1. New Zealand is in position to do that but host South Africa could seize the last semifinal place if it beats Bangladesh on Tuesday.

            For India, Mandhana's 87 followed her 52 in a losing effort against England on Saturday.

            She hit nine fours and three sixes against Ireland to underline she is back to her best after missing India's opening game of the tournament with a finger injury. Ireland, which dropped Mandhana four times, including twice in two overs, finally held onto a chance when Gaby Lewis took a catch down at long-off.

            Ireland had a disastrous start to its chase when Amy Hunter was run out going for a second run off the first ball of the innings. Orla Prendergast was bowled by Renuka Singh off the fifth ball of the first over and Ireland was reeling at 1-2.

            Lewis (32 not out) and captain Laura Delany (17 not out) brought Ireland back and might have done enough to win if they hadn't scored only singles for the last 2.2 overs before the rain.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816365,UK summons Iran's top diplomat over threats to journalists,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's government said Monday it has summoned Iran's top diplomat in the U.K. after journalists based in the country were targeted for intimidation by Tehran.

            The Foreign Office said its Middle East director Vijay Rangarajan met with Iranian Chargé d’Affaires Mehdi Hosseini Matin to “make clear the U.K. will not tolerate threats to life and media freedom.""

            “I am appalled by the Iranian regime’s continuing threats to the lives of U.K.-based journalists and have today summoned its representative to make clear this will not be tolerated,"" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.











            On Saturday, Iran International, a Farsi-language TV news channel based in London, said it had moved its broadcasts to Washington to protect its journalists after British police told it about “serious and immediate threats” to the safety of Iranian journalists.

            Iran International said ""threats had grown to the point that it was felt it was no longer possible to protect the channel’s staff” or the public around its studio in London.

            The Metropolitan Police said authorities had foiled “15 plots since the start of 2022 to either kidnap or even kill British or U.K.-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime,” without elaborating.

            The BBC has separately filed a complaint to the United Nations saying there were increased security concerns for journalists working for its Persian service ""in light of extraterritorial threats.”

            The Foreign Office also said Monday that it was imposing new sanctions against Iranian officials for human rights violations. Those sanctioned included three senior judges for imposing death penalties on protesters, and five commanders of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

            Britain has imposed sanctions on more than 50 Iranian individuals and entities since September, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest by the Islamic Republic’s morality police triggered a wave of protests and a violent crackdown by Tehran.LONDON (AP) — Britain's government said Monday it has summoned Iran's top diplomat in the U.K. after journalists based in the country were targeted for intimidation by Tehran.The Foreign Office said its Middle East director Vijay Rangarajan met with Iranian Chargé d’Affaires Mehdi Hosseini Matin to “make clear the U.K. will not tolerate threats to life and media freedom.""“I am appalled by the Iranian regime’s continuing threats to the lives of U.K.-based journalists and have today summoned its representative to make clear this will not be tolerated,"" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.On Saturday, Iran International, a Farsi-language TV news channel based in London, said it had moved its broadcasts to Washington to protect its journalists after British police told it about “serious and immediate threats” to the safety of Iranian journalists.Iran International said ""threats had grown to the point that it was felt it was no longer possible to protect the channel’s staff” or the public around its studio in London.The Metropolitan Police said authorities had foiled “15 plots since the start of 2022 to either kidnap or even kill British or U.K.-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime,” without elaborating.The BBC has separately filed a complaint to the United Nations saying there were increased security concerns for journalists working for its Persian service ""in light of extraterritorial threats.”The Foreign Office also said Monday that it was imposing new sanctions against Iranian officials for human rights violations.

            Julius Michael Freeman, 21, of Memphis, admitted to driving the shooter to and from the area where the gunman opened fire early Sunday and to handing him a rifle from the trunk of Freemen’s Dodge Charter, according to a police affidavit.

            Freeman is charged with facilitation of second-degree murder, five counts of attempted facilitation of second-degree murder and five counts of possession of a firearm to commit a dangerous felony, the Commercial Appeal reported.











            Freeman was one of three men police identified as persons of interest after the shooting early Sunday. It could not immediately be determined Monday if Freeman has retained an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

            Victims were found at two locations in the Whitehaven neighborhood of Memphis, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of downtown and near the Memphis International Airport. 

            Police responded first to Memphis nightclub the Live Lounge, according to a police news release. Seven people were injured there, two critically.

            While there, police were notified that other victims of the shooting were about a mile away. There, one male victim was pronounced dead. Three more people were critically wounded, according to police. 

            The police affidavit said Freeman turned himself in.

            Both locations where the victims were found were on East Shelby Drive, a commercial corridor of restaurants, grocery stores, churches and medical offices surrounded by residential streets. 

            Police do not know what led to the shooting or whether the shooter knew the victims.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816368,EU sanctions Iran but no terror tag for Revolutionary Guards,"The European Union on Monday imposed new sanctions on Iranian officials and entities for their role in the violent crackdown against public protests in the Islamic Republic.The new sanctions target 32 people and two entities and include the culture and Islamic guidance minister, the education minister and other politicians and officials supporting the crackdown.The latest raft of sanctions brings the total to 196 individuals and 33 entities in Iran.However, the bloc decided against the initiative to label Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.""As of now, we don't have legal grounds in the EU to list the Revolutionary Guards as terrorist organization,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said following the summit in Brussels.Shortly after the EU officials made the announcements, the UK added eight new designations to its sanctions list relating to Iran. Some of the UK sanctions are targeting the region's judges for what London said were human rights violations.Additionally, the UK government has summoned Iran's most senior diplomat in London over what it said were serious threats against journalists living in Britain.On Saturday, a London-based television station critical of the Iranian government said it was moving its studios to the US following threats from Tehran.""I am appalled by the Iranian regime's continuing threats to the lives of UK-based journalists and have today summoned its representative to make clear this will not be tolerated,"" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.Acting on advice from London's Metropolitan Police, Iran International TV ""reluctantly"" closed its studios in the capital after state-backed threats, a statement said, as safety concerns made it no longer possible to protect the broadcaster's staff and the surrounding public.Last month Iran executed a former Iranian deputy defense minister with dual British-Iranian nationality after convicting him of spying for the UK.Iran has witnessed a wave of protests in recent months following the death of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini while in police custody.After a brief lull in the unrest, demonstrators last week marched in several Iranian cities, this time over the executions of protesters Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Mohammad Hosseini, who were hanged in January.Protests kicked off in Iran in September, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.At least 529 people have been killed in demonstrations, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRA), a group that's been tracking the crackdown, while more than 19,700 people have been detained by authorities.jsi/dj (Reuters, dpa)",2023/02/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816369,MSC: Iranian activists demand more action from the West,"Hundreds of Iranian expats gathered over the weekend outside the famous Bayerischer Hof Hotel, the venue of the 2023 Munich Security Conference (MSC), to show solidarity with anti-regime protests in Iran. Their demand was clear: the Iranian regime must be overthrown, and a democratic, secular government be installed in its place.Massive protests kicked off in Iran in September 2022 after 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini died following her arrest by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code. Since then, at least 529 people have been killed in demonstrations, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been tracking the crackdown. Over 19,700 people have been detained by authorities.Women have played a leading role in the protests, with many publicly taking off their hijabs, the compulsory Islamic headscarf. The protests have marked one of the biggest challenges to Iran's Shiite regime since the 1979 overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which paved the way for clerical rule.Inside the MSC venue, Masih Alinejad, a renowned Iranian-American activist and journalist, expressed her concern over a lack of coordinated support for Iranian protesters from the international community.""Leaders of the democratic countries keep saying that we stand with the people of Iran … We don't need empty words,"" Alinejad told DW following a panel discussion on the issue.""Of course, we see a change in their tone toward Iran, which is great, especially the US kicking out the Islamic Republic from one of the top women's bodies from the UN. But we want the Western countries to announce their policy toward Iran, to isolate the regime the way they isolated Russian President Vladimir Putin,"" she added.The protests in Iran are somewhat losing steam, and it is obvious they need a lot more than just speeches by Western governments and their leaders.Iran's pro-democracy activists, however, are not ready to give up. At the end of last week, protesters once again took to the streets in several Iranian cities.""I have been focused on Iran for two decades in the US Congress. We hope that Iran can be a secular and democratic country someday. For those who believe that the current protests in Iran will be similar to those in the past, they are tragically confused,"" Robert Menendez, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during an MSC panel discussion.The US senator, however, did not specify what kind of support Washington would provide to Iran's anti-regime protesters.Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic revolution and who now lives in the US, demands a coordinated approach from the West on the Iran issue. ""Iranians needs solidarity for the principles they are fighting for. We want the world to be unified [in their support for Iranian protesters] the way they expect us to be unified. Apart from maximum pressure on the Iranian regime, we also expect maximum support for the Iranian people,"" he said during a panel.Hannah Neumann, a member of the European Parliament, says the European Union is aware of its responsibility toward Iran's pro-democracy movement. ""The [Islamic] regime does not represent the people of Iran,"" she told the panel. ""As long as this regime kills its own people, we are not going to negotiate with them,"" she added.There is criticism that the West is looking at the Iranian situation through the geopolitical lens, a stance echoed by Neumann at the panel. Tehran's nuclear ambition and the stalled 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program appear to be a bigger concern for the international community.""The Iranian regime with nuclear weapons is a problem ... The best way to get rid of the nuclear threat is to get rid of the regime,"" Neumann underlined.The European Parliament member also said that it has become even more crucial to address the Iranian situation because of the Islamic regime's support for Russia.There is also some apprehension about Iran becoming unstable in the wake of a possible regime collapse.Women's rights activist Masih Alinejad believes that Iran's rulers want the international community to believe that Iran will turn into another Syria if they lose power.""That's wrong. We have a progressive society [and we] are ready to have an Iran without the Islamic republic. The time has come for the leaders of democratic countries to see an Iran without the Islamic republic,"" Alinejad stressed.Pahlavi added that a post-regime Iran would bring stability to the region. ""It will be a different Iran. It won't be warmongering, won't be shooting rockets across the border … or send[ing] drones to attack another country's citizens.""Edited by: J. Wingard",2023/02/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816370,New earthquake hit Turkey-Syria border region,"A magnitude 6.4 struck the Turkey-Syria border region on Monday, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said.The quake hit near Defne in the district of Samandag but it was felt as far as Jordan, Israel, and Egypt.""We had just arrived in Gaziantep when we felt the tremor. Our car started shaking — for about 10 seconds. We immediately thought it was an earthquake because we use an alert app. And then we saw people had run out of buildings here in the city center,"" DW correspondent Julia Hahn said from the scene.""That's when we knew it was a powerful one.""The initial quake was followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 tremor.Lutfu Savas, the mayor for Hatay said a number of buildings have collapsed, trapping people who had either returned to homes or were trying to move furniture from damaged homes.Abdel Kafi, a Syrian activist in north-west Syria said, ""It was strong like the first one but did not last long... it scared people and people rushed to the streets.""It comes two weeks after two major earthquakes devastated the same region and left at least 47,000 dead.Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said more than 6,000 aftershocks had been recorded since the 7.8-magnitude quake hit Turkey and Syria on February 6.Hours before the latest earthquake, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was on a visit to Turkey, vowed the American government would help ""for as long as it takes.""Binken pledged another $100 million in disaster assistance after a helicopter tour of the devastated Hatay province.On Monday, Blinken met his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Erdogan said construction work on nearly 200,000 apartments in 11 earthquake-hit provinces of Turkey would begin next month.Blinken also praised the work of the Syrian White Helmets and the search-and-rescue teams who assisted quake victims in Syria's opposition-held areas.Also on Monday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called on Germans to show ""enduring solidarity"" with those affected by earthquakes in Syria and Turkey.""Our humanity remains in demand even after images from the earthquakes are replaced in the daily news,"" Steinmeier said.He was speaking at an event in Berlin to commemorate the quake victims, organized by the Turkish Community in Germany and the VDSH association of German-Syrian aid organizations.Germany has already sent 82 tonnes of relief supplies to the region and was planning to contribute to an EU shipment of relief supplies.The country has also contributed €26 million ($27 million) in humanitarian assistance for people in Syria.The aid is on top of German search-and-rescue teams who helped with relief efforts in the quake area.lo/dj (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816371,"Kremlin critic in prison in northwest Russia, allies say","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Allies and family members of an opposition politician imprisoned in Russia say he is being held in a restricted housing unit in a penal colony in the northwest of the country, isolated from most inmates and not allowed to make phone calls.

            Andrei Pivovarov, who was sentenced to four years in prison last year, was transferred from a detention center in southern Russia in late December, and his allies, family and lawyers lost touch with him three weeks later, not knowing anything about his whereabouts or well-being for a month.

            Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited. Amnesty International in a statement last week likened them to the “practices of the Gulag” and said that Pivovarov’s situation amounted to an enforced disappearance.











            Pivovarov's ally and partner Tatyana Usmanova said on Monday that the politician's mother was able to confirm that he arrived at the IK-7 penal colony in Russia's northwestern region of Karelia on Jan. 24. He has been placed in a restricted housing unit for nearly three months over undisclosed violations he allegedly committed, she said.

            The 41-year-old politician wasn't allowed to let his relatives know where he was, Usmanova said in a Facebook post, and he wouldn't be allowed to make phone calls or have visitors while in restricted housing.

            Pivovarov was pulled off a Warsaw-bound flight at St. Petersburg’s airport just before takeoff in May 2021 and taken to the southern city of Krasnodar.

            Several days earlier, the opposition group he headed, Open Russia, had disbanded to protect its members from prosecution after Russian authorities designated it as an “undesirable” organization. The government cited a 2015 law that made membership in such organizations a criminal offense.

            In Krasnodar, Pivovarov was accused of supporting a local candidate on behalf of an “undesirable” organization — charges he rejected as politically motivated and triggered by his plans to run for the Russian parliament in 2021. He was convicted and sentenced in July 2022.

            Pavel Chikov, a leading human rights advocate in Russia, said on Telegram that IK-7 in Karelia is a notorious penal colony where the former tycoon-turned-opposition-politician Mikhail Khodorkovsky served part of his sentence as well as opposition activist Ildar Dadin.

            Dadin in 2016 complained of beatings and other harsh treatment at the facility, and his harrowing account of serving time at IK-7 made international headlines.TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Allies and family members of an opposition politician imprisoned in Russia say he is being held in a restricted housing unit in a penal colony in the northwest of the country, isolated from most inmates and not allowed to make phone calls.Andrei Pivovarov, who was sentenced to four years in prison last year, was transferred from a detention center in southern Russia in late December, and his allies, family and lawyers lost touch with him three weeks later, not knowing anything about his whereabouts or well-being for a month.Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816373,"Students, faculty return to Michigan State after shooting","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State University students and faculty returned to the East Lansing campus Monday as the university resumed normal operations, one week after a gunman shot and killed three students and injured five others.

            The 50,000-student university's campus remained relatively quiet on the first day back, with many professors allowing students to attend class virtually. Many students skipped class to attend an afternoon protest at the state Capitol in Lansing to call for gun control legislation. 

            All students at the university this semester will be given a credit/no credit option, which allows students to receive credit for all classes without it impacting their overall grade point average. University officials also asked teachers in an email Friday to ""extend as much grace and flexibility as you are able with individual students, now and in the coming weeks.”











            Brogan Kelley, a freshman at Michigan State, left East Lansing after last week's shooting to return home to his family in west Michigan. But he drove back on Sunday so that he could attend class in person. He said that he felt like it was important “to go back about my life.”

            “For me, not going to class felt like I would have been letting the shooter win. I didn't want this one tragedy to define the place I call home and the university that's giving me my education,” said Kelley said. 

            Kelley, who was at an off-campus house when the shooting took place, said that the majority of his professors had given students the option to attend class in person or online, with many students choosing the latter. 

            The shootings at Michigan State happened last Monday during evening classes at Berkey Hall and nearby at the MSU Union. Students across the vast campus were ordered to shelter in place for four hours — “run, hide, fight” if necessary — while police hunted for Anthony McRae, 43, who eventually killed himself when confronted by police not far from his home in Lansing.

            Two wounded students remain in critical condition at Sparrow Hospital, university police said Monday. Two other students were in stable condition with another student in “fair condition.”

            The university has been criticized by some in the community for returning too quickly. The editorial board of The State News, the student newspaper, wrote Thursday that they wouldn’t attend class next week, either in person or online. More time was needed to heal, the students wrote.

            March for Our Lives founder David Hogg, a survivor of a 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, joined hundreds of students and community members at the state Capitol for a sit-down protest Monday. Hogg and other students spoke on the capitol steps, calling for state lawmakers to pass enact gun reform. 

            “Enough is enough. How many more students have to die until you can hear our cries?” Michigan State senior Kelsey Gruzin said outside the state Capitol.

            In the days after the shooting, Michigan Democrats, who control all levels of the state government for the first time in decades, have promised to pass gun-safety measures. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has called for gun control legislation that includes universal background checks, safe storage laws and “extreme risk protection orders.” 

            “It’s no secret that your governor is probably going to be running for president,” Hogg said Monday. “Are you ready to hold Gretchen Whitmer accountable?”EAST LANSING, Mich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816374,Neesham's all-round show earns Peshawar win in PSL,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — James Neesham’s brilliant all-round show eased Peshawar Zalmi to a four-wicket win over Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League on Monday.

            Neesham picked up the key wicket of his fellow New Zealander Martin Guptill inside the batting powerplay and top-scored with 37 off 23 balls as Peshawar chased down 155 with nine balls to spare.

            Peshawar cruised to 157-6 after Quetta made 154-4.











            Quetta was led by Iftikhar Ahmed, who notched 50 off 34 balls for his first half-century this season, and Odean Smith with a breezy 25.

            Peshawar fast bowlers Arshad Iqbal, making his season debut, and Wahab Riaz dominated early, forcing the Quetta batters to take risks.

            After 117 on Saturday, Guptill scratched out 12 before holing out to midwicket off Neesham. Jason Roy was clean bowled by Usman Qadir's googly, and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was deceived by a slow Iqbal yorker after 39 off 30.

            Iftikhar and Smith hit 43 off the final 19 balls to set a target.

            Peshawar's batters plundered spinners Qais Ahmed and Mohammad Nawaz, while Mohammad Hasnain snared 3-13.

            Neesham and Rovman Powell combined in a rapid 43-run stand to take the game away from Quetta. When they were dismissed by the 15th over, Peshawar needed just 21 more runs.

            Wahab finished the game with two successive boundaries and Peshawar moved to second in the standings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816375,Man arrested in Catholic bishop's killing had worked for him,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man arrested Monday in the weekend killing of a Catholic bishop that shocked Los Angeles religious and immigrant communities is the husband of the victim's housekeeper and had done work at his home, authorities said.

            Auxiliary Bishop David O’Connell, 69, was fatally shot Saturday in the bedroom of his home in Hacienda Heights, an unincorporated community about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. 

            A SWAT team arrested Carlos Medina, the husband of O'Connell's housekeeper, at their home in Torrance, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of Hacienda Heights, Luna said. 











            The sheriff said detectives first linked Medina to the crime after finding surveillance video that showed his SUV in the driveway of O'Connell's home at the time of the killing. 

            A caller told authorities that Medina, 65, was acting irrationally and had made comments about O’Connell “owing him money,"" Luna said, adding that a motive in the killing remains under investigation.

            He said detectives found no evidence of forced entry at the archdiocese-owned home and that Medina’s wife was cooperating with detectives. Detectives recovered weapons at Medina’s home and ballistic tests are pending, Luna said.

            It was not immediately known if Medina has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.

            A deacon who had gone to check on O'Connell after he failed to show up for a meeting found him at his home just blocks from the St. John Vianney Catholic Church, part of his archdiocese, and called authorities, Luna said. 

            ""Although I personally did not know the bishop, I cannot tell you how many phone calls I’ve received over the last 48 hours of people who have worked with him in different capacities,"" Luna said. “This bishop made a huge difference in our community. He was loved.”

            O’Connell had been a priest for 45 years and was a native of Ireland, according to Angelus News, the news outlet of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest. In 2015, Pope Francis named him one of several auxiliary bishops of the archdiocese.

            O’Connell worked in South Los Angeles for years and focused on gang intervention, Angelus News reported. He later sought to broker peace between residents and law enforcement following the violent 1992 uprising after a jury acquitted four white LA police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a Black man. 

            Nearly two decades later, O’Connell brought the San Gabriel Valley community together to rebuild a mission there destroyed in an arson attack. In recent years he also spearheaded Catholic efforts in the region to work with immigrant children and families from Central America.

            Los Angeles Archbishop Jose H. Gomez said Monday that O'Connell spoke fluent Spanish with an Irish accent and every day showed “compassion to the poor, to the homeless, to the immigrant, and to all those living on society’s margins.”

            “He was a good priest and a good bishop and a man of peace and we’re very sad to lose him,” added Gomez, his voice breaking. 

            Janice Hahn, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said O'Connell was a longtime friend who she first met while on the LA City Council. She said that in recent years O'Connell had devoted much of his time to helping immigrants arriving in the country. 

            “He devoted himself to supporting immigrants, not only making sure that they have food and shelter, but even helping immigrant children, unaccompanied minors, get into Catholic schools, and he helped them get into college,” she said. 

            Neighbors and parishioners left flowers and candles and prayed the rosary next to police tape in Hacienda Heights on Sunday. 

            Gabriela Gil, who first met O'Connell when she was pregnant with her youngest child, was among those who prayed outside O'Connell's home.

            “I’ve never ever felt more understood by anyone in this world,” she said.

            The Diocese of Cork and Ross in Ireland, where O’Connell was born, was shocked by the killling. Bishop Fintan Gavin said in a statement that O’Connell “has always maintained his connection with family and friends in Cork” through frequent visits back to Ireland. 

            The violence was the latest to rock religious leaders in Los Angeles. Two Jewish men were shot and wounded last week by a gunman who authorities said had targeted them for their faith. Suspect Jaime Tran has been charged with federal hate crimes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816378,Column: Stenhouse Jr. and JTG get breakout Daytona 500 win,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — One victory in 28 years was all tiny JTG Daugherty Racing had to show for the time, sweat and money — so much money — the team had poured into trying to build a winning NASCAR organization.

            The team owned by Tad and Jodi Geschickter, as well as former NBA player Brad Daugherty, entered Season 29 still committed to a driver stuck in a losing streak that stretched nearly six years.

            But they believed in Ricky Stenhouse Jr., and so did the sponsors on the No. 47 Chevrolet, which includes grocery chain Kroger, a JTG partner for more than a decade. The trick was rebuilding Stenhouse's confidence and returning him to the level of driver who won a pair of Xfinity Series championships at the start of his NASCAR career.











            Would a Daytona 500 win do the trick?

            Certainly so.

            
                Stenhouse scored just the third Cup victory of his career by winning the longest Daytona 500 in history. He won Sunday night in double overtime, under caution, to snap a losing streak that spanned 2,060 days and 199 races.

            He did it with crew chief Mike Kelley, who took over leading the team during the offseason, in a reunion for the pair. Kelley was Stenhouse's crew chief at Roush Fenway Racing for his Xfinity titles and spent one season as his Cup crew chief before stepping back into a support role the last seven seasons.

            Kelley's return to the top has been stabilizing for Stenhouse.

            “Not winning since 2017, having struggles, ups and downs, to have somebody like Mike, who when he took over the reins as soon as the season was over, it was: ‘Hey, I know you can still get this done. We’ve just got to give you the right opportunities. We know if we give you cars capable of running up front, you can do that,’"" Stenhouse said. ""He believes in myself more than I do, I think, and that’s huge. I feel like that’s what separates crew chiefs these days, is that team aspect and leading your guys and getting the most out of them.

            “We all felt confident this offseason, but it’s special to do it with Mike. We accomplished so much together. We’ve gone through ups and downs. He’s been in the sport a long time. We need to make some new memories.”

            Stenhouse celebrated the win by scaling the fence at Daytona International Speedway — the Superman move created by four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves. Once the 35-year-old from Olive Branch, Mississippi, reached the top, he hung and did a pair of pullups before climbing back down to collect the checkered flag. Stenhouse's only other two Cup wins came in 2017.

            Stenhouse then packed up his replica version of the Harley J. Earl Trophy for a late-night trip to a Daytona Beach-area Waffle House, where he sat with his new hardware on the table and wore a paper crown to mark his achievement.

            For the Geschickters, the couple now will bring back to their North Carolina race shop only their second NASCAR trophy. And it happens to be the most important trophy in the sport and came in the opening race of NASCAR's 75th celebratory season.

            JTG is the first single-car team since The Wood Brothers Racing in 2011 to win the Daytona 500, Jodi Geschickter is only the second female car owner to win the Daytona 500 and Daughtery is the first Black owner to be part of a winning Daytona effort.

            Daugherty had to leave Sunday's race early after sponsor obligations because the bright sun was bothering the lingering effects of recent eye surgery. But when his car went to victory lane, Jodi Geschickter said, Daugherty wasted no time reaching out to Michael Jordan, who like Daugherty is a part-owner of a NASCAR team.

            “He said that he and Michael Jordan are already talking trash,” she said. “I’m not sure what was said, but there have been conversations.”

            The win was such a remarkable breakthrough for JTG, which in 2017 expanded to a two-car team, only to have to contract back to one car last season when it didn't secure a charter for Ryan Preece. He elected to sit out the season and JTG has entered this year with just Stenhouse for a second consecutive season.

            The ownership and sponsors could have bailed on Stenhouse at any time, and the sponsors could have bailed on winless JTG, as well. But that's not how the Geschickters run their business and they haven't been doing this nearly three decades to just give up.

            “We didn’t give up on Ricky because personally, I feel like he’s got the spirit of a winner and I like what he represents as a person,” Jodi Geschickter said. “I see flashes of brilliance in what he does. I felt like he could do it. I felt like he could get the job done, and I never questioned that.”

            Added her husband: ""We have 18 corporate partners. There are not many drivers in this series that would do the work that Ricky Stenhouse does every day behind the scenes.

            “Appearances in front of grocery stores to trips to corporate headquarters,” Tad Geschickter said. “He’s a workhorse, and someone that believes in you that hard, you’re going to keep believing back in them.”

            JTG and Stenhouse put the work in, understanding they are up against the biggest and best in NASCAR for 38 weekends a year. Stenhouse, who with the Daytona 500 win qualified for the playoffs for just the second time in his career, may not be a title contender but he proved Sunday night that JTG is headed in the right direction.

            “Every morning I get up and I put on my shoes at peace and I go out. But make no mistake, this is a battle. The competition in this series is fierce and it’s serious,” Jodi Geschickter said. ""It’s a battle and it’s a fight, and it’s hard. It’s not for lack of effort. We’ve come really close, so I try not to get our hopes up.

            “We work hard. The guys do their jobs. We’re prepared. We’re prepared everyday. We don’t quit. We’re tenacious. We dig in. You get the information, you try to make good decisions, and you just don’t quit.""

            “If your best player is unavailable, it’s probably at your detriment. I think there’s a balance somewhere. I’m not opposed to shortening the schedule, but I’m not sure how much gain you really get out of that when guys rest even more.

But the finances of today’s game, if you’re going to roll it back, that means you’re probably going to have to roll back the finances. So I don’t think players or the employees of the NBA will go for that. But who knows. We’ll see.” — Dallas coach Jason Kidd.___“I do worry about the historical effects, how it affects guys who did play in 82 games and the records could be affected, but it’s not a major concern for me."" — Phoenix coach Monty Williams.___“If your best player is unavailable, it’s probably at your detriment. I think there’s a balance somewhere. I’m not opposed to shortening the schedule, but I’m not sure how much gain you really get out of that when guys rest even more. I’m sure they’re doing all the studies to figure out what works best and what’s best for the league, but I’m OK with an 82-game season."" — Washington coach Wes Unseld Jr.___“For us, a few more practices would be good. A few more days off would be great."" — Houston coach Stephen Silas.___“If it was up to me, I always want to play and I always want to be on the floor. It doesn’t matter how many games we have — 82- or 72-game season or whatever — because I’m always focused on preparing to play."" — Philadelphia center Joel Embiid.___“I don’t know exactly what the right number is. I’m sure if it was reduced at some point, five years from now, we’d be talking about ‘Well, this number isn’t right either.’ So, I’m not really sure what the right number is; 82 is definitely a lot, but 72 is a lot also."" — Utah coach Will Hardy.___“Obviously at the end of the day, the number of games is going to drive the product of our entertainment. Our fans are craving it every single day. ... But I think the thing that can’t be lost is our game is at the best place it’s ever been. So, you want to be very conscientious of protecting that, the integrity of the game and the product of the game.” — Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins.___“I think (a shorter season) would help for sure. It is a long season. ... As long as our players are staying healthy and guys are able to get through a long season, we really just have to come to a number and an agreement on whatever number of games there will be.” — Miami guard Tyler Herro.___“I don’t know who created the term ‘load management' for guys sitting out games or this narrative that continues to play on about star players or guys not being available. I don’t know who started the narrative, but it’s completely run amok. I think it has dehumanized some of us in terms of just the way we prepare ourselves day to day."" — Dallas guard Kyrie Irving.___“You just get used to it — go out there every night and eventually it just becomes a pattern and a rhythm every day you go out, practice and play. You signed up for it."" — Cleveland guard Evan Mobley.___“I love hoops. I play in the summer. I like the 82-game season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816381,Newborn saved from earthquake in Syria adopted by her aunt,"JINDERIS, Syria (AP) — A baby girl who was born under the rubble of her family’s earthquake-shattered home has left the hospital and gone to her new home, where she was with her paternal aunt’s family Monday.

            The girl had been at the hospital since hours after the Feb. 6 earthquake. She was discharged Saturday and her aunt and uncle adopted her and gave her a new name, Afraa, after her late mother. 

            Afraa's mother died in the quake along with her father and four siblings. A day after the infant arrived at the hospital, officials there named her Aya — Arabic for “a sign from God.”











            Afraa’s story has been widely shared in news reports and people from around the world have offered to help her, with some saying they would like to adopt her. However, the relatives who took her in said that, however hard their circumstances, the best place for the infant is with family. 

            On Monday, Afraa was being cared for by her uncle, Khalil al-Sawadi, who is now living with relatives in the town of Jinderis in northern Syria after his home was also destroyed in the earthquake. Al-Sawadi and his wife have four daughters and two sons and now Afraa will be living with her cousins.

            “She is one of my children now. I will not differentiate between her and my children,” al-Sawadi, who is also a cousin of the newborn's parents, told The Associated Press on Monday while sitting cross-legged holding Afraa and surrounded by his six children. “She will be dearer than my children because she will keep the memory alive of her father, mother and siblings.”

            He added that days after Afraa was born, his wife gave birth to a daughter, Attaa.

            While in the hospital in the nearby town of Afrin, the director’s wife has been breast-feeding Afraa. 

            Judicial officials in Afrin had taken over the case of Afraa after the girl drew international attention and some people came to the hospital claiming they are related to her although they had different family names than Afraa and her mother.

            For days, al-Sawadi was worried that someone might kidnap her and he visited her frequently at the hospital. 

            A hospital official said Afraa was handed over to her aunt's family days after a DNA test was conducted to make sure the girl and her aunt are biologically related. 

            “It was sad and some nurses wept” when she was taken from the hospital, said Dr. Hani Maarouf who had taken care of Afraa since she was brought to the facility. He added that the baby girl was in very good health when she was released.

            Rescue workers in Jinderis discovered the dark-haired baby girl more than 10 hours after the quake as they were digging through the wreckage of the five-story apartment building where her parents lived.

            Al-Sawadi recounted how he rushed out of his home when the earthquake happened and found that the nearby building where Afraa's family lived had been reduced to a pile of rubble. Along with others from the area, al-Sawadi said they dug through the rubble in heavy rain for hours until he grew tired and sat to rest nearby. 

            Shortly afterward, someone called him to identify a dead woman whom they found under the rubble. He told people around that she was his cousin, Afraa. Then, they started hearing a child crying and frantically removed the sand that covered the baby, whose umbilical cord was still still connected to her mother. 

            Al-Sawadi said he took a razor from his pocked and cut the umbilical cord and handed the girl to another cousin and they rushed her to a nearby hospital where he was told that the girl was in good health. They drove to another hospital in the nearby town of Afrin where they were told it was full and unable to take more patients. They continued to a second hospital, which was also full, before reaching the children's hospital where she was kept until Saturday.

            He said during the chaos after they pulled Afraa from under the rubble, al-Sawadi thought that the newborn was a boy and told the doctor to name “him” after her late father Abdullah Turki Mleihan. They later found out it was a girl. 

            He said that the girl was kept in hospital for nearly two weeks until the paperwork for her adoption was done. 

            The devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake with its epicenter in Turkey’s southeastern Kharamanmaras province struck in the early hours of Feb. 6, followed by multiple aftershocks. Many communities in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria were reduced to piles of broken concrete and twisted metal. More than 44,000 people have been reported dead, a toll expected to rise as search teams find more bodies.

            The earthquake destroyed dozens of housing units in the town of Jinderis, where Afraa’s family had been living since 2018. 

            Afraa’s father, Abdullah Turki Mleihan, was originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured the village, Saleh al-Badran, an uncle of Afraa’s father, said earlier this month.

            “I will raise her in a way that she will not feel in need for anything,” said al-Sawadi, who buys and sells cars. Surrounded by his children, al-Sawadi asked them if he should give away Afraa to the well-wishers offering to adopt her and they said in one voice, “No.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816382,"NBA on All-Star break, but no easy answers to rest problem","Golden State coach Steve Kerr wants a shorter NBA season. Milwaukee All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo does not. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver isn’t sure what the right answer is.

            Such is the conundrum with the NBA’s ongoing battle with load management — often the fancy way of saying resting — and finding ways to optimize player health, performance and availability. While there is a consensus that the league has problems, there is no consensus on how to solve those problems.

            Over the last week, The Associated Press asked a cross section of 48 players, coaches, owners and executives if the NBA should abandon its 82-game, 170-day blueprint of a regular season for something with either fewer games or more days in the season to allow for more rest.











            The results were as muddled as the issue itself: 40% said they would simply go along with whatever the league decides is best, 35% said they don’t want the current format changed, and the remaining 25% wants changes.

            How fans will be affected is one concern. Money is another.

            “I think if you want to get the best player availability, shortening the season may be in the best interest of everybody involved,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “But that’s also a lot of money being lost — TV games, money. Let’s not forget: This is a business.”

            With the All-Star Weekend in the books and regular-season play resuming Thursday, there are still 19 players with a chance to play in 82 games this season. There were only five who did it last season, 11 who played every game in a 72-game 2020-21 season and 14 who played all possible games in the COVID-19-interrupted 2019-20 season.

            It used to not be so uncommon for players to play every game, or at least almost every game. A decade ago, in 2012-23, there were 28 players making 82 appearances. A decade before that, it was 46. John Stockton played in 82 games 16 times for Utah and missed 22 games in 19 seasons; A.C. Green played 82 games 14 times in his career. Among players currently active, nobody has logged more than five 82-game seasons.

            Antetokounmpo doesn't want change: “I think 82 games is perfect,"" he said.

            Minnesota guard Anthony Edwards said seeing players sometimes take a game to rest is the thing he dislikes most about the league. His rationale: Somebody might have bought a ticket to just that one game, and feelings can be hurt if the player they want to see most takes the night off.

            “Just play, man. If you’re 80%, you’ve got to play,” said Edwards, 21, a first-time All-Star. “I don’t like all the sitting, missing games and stuff. These people might have enough money to come to one game. And that might be the game they come to and you’re sitting out. I take pride in trying to play every game because I don’t know, it might be one fan that has never seen me play, and I’m trying to play.”

            Kerr is a proponent of a 72-game season, and has said so this year after some games where the reigning champion Warriors have given their stars — the Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green types — a night off because the team feels it was in the best interest of their health.

            He also knows a 72-game season would come with a price. Literally, a big price. Shaving 12% of games from the schedule would, in theory, shave 12% of revenue opportunities. And while it's not likely owners would embrace making less money, players probably wouldn’t go for that, either.

            “I feel terrible for fans who buy tickets who are expecting to see someone play and they don’t get to see that person play,” Kerr said. “It’s a brutal part of the business. That’s why I’m going to continue to advocate for 72-game seasons. And I know that means less revenue, but at some point, I think there just needs to be an awareness from everybody involved.”

            At least one other coach is listening to Kerr, loud and clear.

            “I do think in an ideal world that the season would be shorter,"" Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer said. “We would space the games out, give the players more recovery time, hopefully more health. And I think one of the big points of emphasis is for the fans, more player availability. But it’s a complicated equation.""

            One potential tweak that some prefer is the idea of not squeezing 82 games into 170 days, which basically means a game every other day. Building even another week into the schedule could allow for more multiday breaks.

            The NFL and NHL have bye weeks. Minnesota coach Chris Finch wonders if the NBA should do the same.

            “I think what we need to do as a league is remove all the obstacles for guys not playing,” Finch said. “Back-to-backs seem to be a big one. They’ve done a really good job over the last years of trying to limit back-to-backs, make them more intelligent if you will. It doesn’t seem to me that we’re that far off of being able to eliminate them altogether, whether that’s fewer games or, heck, the season’s so long right now anyway, what’s another week or two?”

            The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are currently in talks on a new collective bargaining agreement, with both sides hopeful that it’ll get done by next month — which hardly guarantees anything, but it's a reason for optimism.

            There is a strong chance that an in-season tournament, something Silver has wanted for years, could be part of the NBA calendar as early as next season. But there is no talk of that changing the format for the season; teams have been told that, if the tournament is added, they’ll get an 80-game schedule this summer with two more games — those matchups based on how they fare in the opening portion of the tournament — to be added later.

            “I think part of the realization these days in playing in this league is that this is a year-round pursuit now,” Silver said. “I think part of injury avoidance means how players are treating their bodies year-round, how teams are interacting with players year-round, and using the best data to conclude what will allow players to stay healthy and on the floor as long as possible.

            “We think we can do a better job,” he added, “but we don’t have a specific solution yet.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816385,Reds will give Stephenson time off from rigors of catching,"Catcher Tyler Stephenson is one of the cornerstones of a multiyear rebuild of the Cincinnati Reds.

            The Reds want to make sure the 26-year-old is fresh and healthy enough to give them 140 to 150 games a year, even if there are fewer starts at his natural position behind the plate.

            Stephenson was the Reds best hitter last year, but played only 50 games because of a series of injuries, including a concussion on a collision at the plate and a broken collarbone and broken thumb.











            “He just had bad luck,"" said second baseman Jonathan India, another one of the team's young stars who was limited by injuries in 2022. 

            “There’s a lot of luck that comes with this game. He just didn’t get the right end of the stick. But he controls his attitude the best I’ve ever seen.”

            As pitchers and catchers reported to the spring training facility in Goodyear, Arizona, last week, Reds manager David Bell said he's planning for Stephenson to start around 65 games behind the plate and about 80 at first base or as DH. The manager even went through the schedule and mapped out a daily plan for Stephenson.

            “It made the most sense,"" Bell said. “I believe it was four out of 10 (catching),” Bell said. “It was about three at DH, two at first out of 10, and then one off-day.”

            Stephenson has mixed feelings. He wants to continue to be known as a catcher, but he knows the plan makes sense for his longevity.

            “I know it will give me more days of rest,"" he said. ""It’s going to be new territory for me. We’re going to adapt and see how it goes. I’m confident that it’s going to go well and I will feel fresher, and that will be a big thing going forward.”

            To prepare, the Reds signed veteran catchers Curt Casali — who played for Cincinnati in 2018-2020 — and Luke Maile — to share catching duties.

            Stephenson split time with veteran Tucker Barnhart in 2021 and became the No 1. catcher last season after Barnhart was traded to Detroit. 

            The Reds struggled offensively when Stephenson went out.

            Joey Votto's status may determine where Stephenson will fit in the lineup when he's not behind the plate. The 39-year-old first baseman/DH — entering the final year of a 10-year contract — had surgery in August for tears in both the rotator cuff and biceps in his left shoulder.

            Votto is still rehabbing and it's not clear if he'll be ready to start the season. Stephenson has been working at first base to get ready to play there. 

            The three catchers will be expected to bring along a young pitching staff. The presumptive top three starters, Hunter Green, Nick Lodolo and Graham Ashcraft, all will be in just their second seasons.

            “I’m hoping to be a part of this team for a long time,” Stephenson said. “The pieces are starting to align.""

            Full squad spring training workouts began Monday. The Reds open the season March 30 at home against Pittsburgh.

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCatcher Tyler Stephenson is one of the cornerstones of a multiyear rebuild of the Cincinnati Reds.The Reds want to make sure the 26-year-old is fresh and healthy enough to give them 140 to 150 games a year, even if there are fewer starts at his natural position behind the plate.Stephenson was the Reds best hitter last year, but played only 50 games because of a series of injuries, including a concussion on a collision at the plate and a broken collarbone and broken thumb.“He just had bad luck,"" said second baseman Jonathan India, another one of the team's young stars who was limited by injuries in 2022.“There’s a lot of luck that comes with this game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816386,Belarus to form new paramilitary force amid Ukraine conflict,"MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus' authoritarian president said Monday that the ex-Soviet nation will form a new territorial defense force amid the fighting in neighboring Ukraine.

            President Alexander Lukashenko has cultivated close military ties with Russia, which used Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine nearly a year ago at the start of what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation.” Russia also has maintained about 10,000 troops in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.

            Speaking during a meeting with officials Monday, Lukashenko said the country needs to form paramilitary units in every town or village to serve as territorial defense to complement the country's 45,000 military “in case of aggression."" He added that every Belarusian man must learn how to handle weapons “to protect his family and home” if needed.











            Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said Belarus will form a force of up to 150,000 volunteers who will be given weapons but keep their civilian jobs. He noted that its members will form a military reserve in peacetime and could act as guerrillas in case of war.

            While hailing the importance of defense cooperation with Russia and expressing support for the Kremlin’s action in Ukraine, Lukashenko has emphasized that he will only send Belarusian troops into Ukraine if his country is attacked.

            The Kremlin has staunchly backed Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for nearly three decades, helping him weather months of massive protests triggered by his re-election in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus' authoritarian president said Monday that the ex-Soviet nation will form a new territorial defense force amid the fighting in neighboring Ukraine.President Alexander Lukashenko has cultivated close military ties with Russia, which used Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine nearly a year ago at the start of what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation.” Russia also has maintained about 10,000 troops in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.Speaking during a meeting with officials Monday, Lukashenko said the country needs to form paramilitary units in every town or village to serve as territorial defense to complement the country's 45,000 military “in case of aggression.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816387,5-year firearms enhancement dropped in Baldwin shooting case,"The prosecution in the case of a fatal New Mexico film-set shooting made a stark turnaround Monday, dropping the possibility of a mandatory five-year sentence against Alec Baldwin, new court filings show. 

            The actor-producer's attorneys had earlier objected to the enhancement, saying it was unconstitutional because it was added after the October 2021 shooting. Legal experts had said Baldwin had a strong chance of seeing it tossed out. 

            “The prosecutors committed a basic legal error by charging Mr. Baldwin under a version of the firearm-enhancement statue that did not exist on the date of the accident,” Baldwin's attorneys said in an earlier court filing. 











            Baldwin's attorney declined to comment Monday after the reversal by prosecutors, who earlier criticized his efforts to have the sentencing requirement dropped. The related standard for the possibility of a mandatory five years would be reckless disregard of safety “without due caution and circumspection” and carried a higher threshold of wrongdoing.

            The remaining alternative standard and set of penalties in the case now requires proof of negligence, which is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.

            Heather Brewer, spokesperson for the New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney’s Office, said in an email earlier this month that the prosecution's focus ""will remain on ensuring that justice is served and that everyone — even celebrities with fancy attorneys — is held accountable under the law.”

            
                Baldwin and Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the weapons supervisor on the set of the film “Rust,” were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.

            Authorities said Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. 

            Hutchins’ parents and sister have filed a lawsuit over the shooting after a similar suit filed by her husband and son was settled. 

            Production that was halted by the shooting is expected to resume this spring. Rust Movie Productions said Hutchins’ widower, Matthew Hutchins, will be the film’s new executive producer with Blanca Cline as the new cinematographer. 

            Rust Movie Productions said last week a related documentary will detail the completion of the film and the life of Halyna Hutchins. 

            Souza will return as director when production resumes, although it’s unclear in what state the filming will take place.

            Rust Movie Productions officials said the use of “working weapons” and “any form of ammunition” will be prohibited on the movie set.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816389,Elvis Andrus to play 2nd base with Chicago White Sox,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Elvis Andrus enjoyed his short stay in Chicago so much that he decided to return to the White Sox.

            Even if it meant changing positions.

            Andrus finalized a $3 million, one-year contract on Monday, stepping into team's opening at second base. The two-time All-Star also finished last season with the White Sox.











            “The main thing for me, at this point in my career, I want to win and compete,” Andrus said, “and I know this team is set to do that. ... I think that being able to play here (for the) last month last season, get to know the guys, kind of put a lot of weight towards my decision.""

            The 34-year-old Andrus has played shortstop for his entire big league career. But he has some experience making plays on the other side of the infield because of the shift.

            “Playing second, I don't think it's going to be such a big challenge for me,” he said. “I think it's just put in the work, you know, trying to get the ABC of playing second.”

            Andrus also gives the White Sox some insurance at shortstop after Tim Anderson played in just 79 games last year.

            The shift provided an opportunity for Andrus to learn some of the angles at second, and the new ban on the infield shift made putting a player such as Andrus at second even more appealing for Chicago.

            “With the change in the shift rules, having someone with range and a strong arm and good instincts is going to be of added benefit in the middle infield. We think Elvis profiles that way,” general manager Rick Hahn said. “Certainly going to be no doubt that he’s going to put the work in to make himself as good as possible at that position and look forward to get starting today.”

            To make room on the roster, left-hander Bennett Sousa was designated for assignment. Sousa went 3-0 with an 8.41 ERA in 25 appearances with the White Sox last year.

            Andrus originally joined Chicago after he was cut by Oakland in August. He hit .271 with nine homers and 28 RBIs in 43 games with the White Sox.

            He was signed by the team after Anderson had surgery for a torn ligament in his left middle finger, but the All-Star shortstop is healthy again.

            Andrus “was a big spark for us,” outfielder Gavin Sheets said. ""Obviously when you lose a player like Tim Anderson, it hurts the clubhouse and hurts the team. He came in and didn’t skip a beat and played really, really well last year. It’s going to help us to bring in another veteran guy that can help us win a championship.""

            Andrus is a .270 hitter with 96 homers, 731 RBIs and 335 steals in 14 years in the majors. He broke into the big leagues with Texas in 2009 and played for the Rangers for 12 seasons before he was traded to Oakland in February 2021.

            Andrus' contract includes a $1 million assignment bonus if he is traded. He has never played second in a major league game.

            “I think he’s going to be fine over there,” first-year manager Pedro Grifol said. “He’s extremely instinctual. He’s a baseball player. We’ll have a lot of information for him and he knows how to decipher that and I think he’s going to be fine.”

            Romy Gonzalez had been in the mix at second, and Hahn said he is going to move around the infield and play the corner outfield spots.

            “Very confident Romy is going to help us win ballgames in Chicago in some capacity over the course of this season,” Hahn said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816391,College Baseball Notebook: No break in sight for rising TCU,"Big 12 preseason favorite TCU had the best opening weekend in college baseball, knocking off two top-10 opponents in a multi-team event at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.

            There's no relief in sight for a Horned Frogs team playing one of the most ambitious nonconference schedules in the country.

            Florida State, among the game's biggest brands and coming off a three-game sweep of James Madison under first-year coach Link Jarrett, visits Fort Worth this weekend. Next it's Dallas Baptist, Michigan and nationally ranked Louisville in a multi-team event in Houston. Then 2022 NCAA Tournament qualifier San Diego visits for three games.











            “Every once in a while you kind of look back and go, ‘OK, where is the little take-a-breath weekend?” TCU coach Kirk Saarloos said Monday. “It’s good. You'll find out a lot about yourself... Sometimes you can play a lot of quote-unquote cupcakes and feel great about yourself and then get punched in the face when you play your conference.”

            TCU opened with wins of 11-4 over Vanderbilt and 18-6 over Arkansas, and the Horned Frogs start this week ranked as high as No. 8 in the polls. All but one run against Vandy were scored with two outs, and the Horned Frogs collected 19 hits against Arkansas.

            Another promising sign was the work of freshman relievers Kole Klecker, Ben Abeldt and Justin Hackett against Arkansas. They combined for 10 strikeouts and allowed four hits and two runs in 7 1/3 innings.

            The down side of the weekend was a 9-8, 10-inning loss to Missouri. The Horned Frogs committed five errors, their most in 142 games.

            “We kind of gave one away yesterday,” Saarloos said, “but overall it was a solid weekend. We learned a lot, especially in the loss. The margin for error in college baseball is super thin, and now they understand why we run practice the way we do. Those little things are important to win a game.”

            IN THE POLLS

            LSU (3-0) took care of business in a sweep of Western Michigan and remains the consensus No. 1 team.

            
                D1Baseball.com ranks Stanford (2-1) second and Tennessee (1-2) third. Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball newspaper have Florida (3-0) at No. 2 and Stanford (2-1) at No. 3.

            REBELS ROLL

            Defending national champion Mississippi outscored Delaware 35-6 in a three-game sweep, with the last two games ending on the 10-run mercy rule.

            Jacob Gonzalez hit a grand slam and drove in a career-high seven runs in Sunday's 14-4 win. Peyton Chatagnier was 5 for 8 with two homers in the series, and Ole Miss pitchers struck out 41.

            CARDINAL COMEBACK

            Stanford pulled off one of the best comebacks of the weekend Sunday. The Cardinal went into the ninth inning down five runs at Cal State Fullerton and outscored the Titans 15-2 the rest of the way for a 21-13 win in 10 innings.

            Braden Montgomery hit a three-run double in the ninth to tie it and he pitched the last two innings for the win.

            CAL BAPTIST MILESTONE

            Cal Baptist opened its fifth season in Division I with the program's first series win over a Power Five opponent. Josiah Chavez's three-run, tie-breaking homer in the eighth inning Sunday lifted the Lancers to a 6-3 win over 2022 national runner-up Oklahoma.

            EASY AS 1-2-3

            UCLA outscored Omaha 47-2 over three games, finishing the sweep in impressive fashion. Cody Delvecchio struck out the side in the seventh inning, Charles Harrison did the same in the eighth and Luke Jewett ended the game with a nine-pitch ninth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816392,AP wins Polk award for coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine,"NEW YORK (AP) — Four Associated Press journalists were honored with the George Polk Award for War Reporting for their searing coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials have credited with saving many lives.

            AP videojournalist Mstyslav Chernov, photographer Evgeniy Maloletka, video producer Vasilisa Stepanenko and reporter Lori Hinnant were awarded for producing what the prize's presenters said were “horrific narratives and images during the siege of Mariupol” a year ago.

            “Our team’s eyewitness reporting from Mariupol represents journalism at its best,” AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said. “Without their work, the world would not know the horrors of the siege of Mariupol and the stories of its people. We’re so pleased that their reporting has been recognized.”











            Chernov, Maloletka and Stepanenko hid from Russian forces until making a harrowing escape that involved passing through 15 enemy checkpoints. Ukrainian authorities said the AP's reporting saved lives by helping open a humanitarian corridor for people to leave.

            Polk Awards winners were announced Sunday in 15 categories. Three of the prestigious prizes, awarded by Long Island University, were for reporting on the war in Ukraine. The winners will be honored April 14 at a luncheon at the New York Athletic Club. Some will also participate in a seminar, “When Covering War Gets Personal,” April 13 at the university’s Brooklyn campus.

            Lynsey Addario, a veteran war photographer for The New York Times, received the photojournalism award for her work in Ukraine — a photograph showing the bodies of a woman and her two children alongside a friend who lay dying moments after a mortar struck them as they sought to flee.

            The Times was also honored for its reporting on the war, including deep-dive investigations into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s increasingly tight grip on power and the Russian military’s combat failures.

            Polk Awards also went to journalists who exposed trouble at cryptocurrency giant FTX; the plundering of the Amazon rain forest; police and child labor abuses in Alabama; and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ use of state resources to fly migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

            A student journalist, Theo Baker of The Stanford Daily, was honored with a special award for uncovering questions about past scientific research conducted by the university’s president.

            Politico was honored for reporting on the leaked draft of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. ProPublica’s Brett Murphy won for debunking “911 call analysis” used to implicate callers based on voice patterns. Kendall Taggart and a BuzzFeed team won for exposing declines in care after a private equity firm purchased homes for people with severe disabilities.

            “We were deluged with so many worthwhile entries it was difficult to choose among them,” awards curator John Darnton said. “Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes. And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril.”

            Other winners included: Eliza Shapiro and Brian Rosenthal of The Times, for detailing how New York’s Hasidic yeshivas failed to provide students with a basic education; CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz for reporting on the failed law enforcement response to a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas; Al Jazeera for an examination of the killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank; and Alex Perry, who reported in Outside Magazine about a 2021 ISIS attack that killed hundreds of people in northern Mozambique.

            “The fearless work of these distinguished journalists proves that diligent reporting will always have the power to affect positive change throughout the world,” Long Island University President Kimberly Cline said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816393,Syrian president visits Oman in 1st trip abroad since quake,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syrian President Bashar Assad visited the Gulf nation of Oman on Monday on his first official visit since the deadly Feb. 6 earthquake, his office said. 

            Oman is one of a few Arab countries that kept normal relations with Damascus after Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011 over its crackdown on Arab Spring protests.

            The 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck on Feb. 6 has killed nearly 45,000 people in Turkey and Syria and has brought a further thawing in relations between Assad and other Arab states. 











            Assad’s office said that during the visit, the president was received by Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, Oman's leader.

            It quoted Assad as saying that Oman preserved “its balanced policies and credibility” adding that the region needs the role of Oman to strengthen relations between Arab countries based on “mutual respect and noninterference in other countries' affairs.” 

            In the past few years, Assad has visited Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. 

            Since the quake, United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Assad, while other Arab countries that had cut relations with Syria during the war — most notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt — have delivered aid to Damascus.

            Jordan’s foreign minister met last week with Assad in Damascus, the first Jordanian official to visit since the start of the conflict.

            In 2020, Oman sent an ambassador to Syria after an eight-year hiatus making Oman the first Gulf Arab state to reinstate its ambassador to Syria since the eruption of the country’s conflict.

            In 2012, Oman and other Gulf Arab countries withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the Syrian government’s violent suppression of a year-old uprising. Other Arab states shuttered their embassies but Oman, known for its neutrality and diplomacy between regional foes, kept its open throughout the years of conflict.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816394,"Milestones behind him, Cabrera hopes for fun final year","LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) — Two years ago, Miguel Cabrera hit his 500th home run, and last season he reached 3,000 hits.

            Now there's one more reason for an extended celebration of the Detroit slugger's career. 

            This is his final year.











            “I’m going to go out there and be me. Try to have fun, try to go out there and, when they give me a chance to play, play. I don’t know what is going to be my role this year,"" Cabrera said. ""If I can hit, I want to be in the lineup.”

            Cabrera sounded at ease with his decision to call it a career when he spoke at spring training Monday, joking with reporters in his usual playful way and insisting he doesn't need opponents to lavish him with attention. That will likely come whether he wants it or not.

            “I brought him up in the first meeting, so that tells you that I didn’t listen to his desire to not be talked about,"" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. ""We’re going to cherish our time with Miggy. We’re also going to let him be a player, a contributor, and just be himself.”

            Two decades after his big league debut as a 20-year-old Florida Marlin, Cabrera says he doesn't remember much about his first spring training — “I have a better car right now” — but he's hoping for a healthy season and more wins for Detroit. 

            The Tigers haven't made the playoffs since 2014, and Cabrera hasn't had a really excellent season since 2016.

            Still, baseball was captivated a year ago when Albert Pujols managed to hit 24 home runs in his last season, surpassing 700 for his career. 

            Don't expect a similar chase from Cabrera, if only because he passed so many milestones so recently. He enters this season with 507 homers, 3,088 hits and 607 doubles — not to mention a .308 career average.

            “It’s been a thrill to be able to follow him. I feel privileged to have a chance to watch him play days in, day out for so many years, and the joy that he brought us,"" said Dave Dombrowski, who is currently the president of the Philadelphia Phillies but ran Detroit's front office when Cabrera won the Triple Crown and the first of two straight MVPs in 2012.

            Dombrowski, who was also with Florida when the Marlins signed a teenaged Cabrera in 1999, says he still exchanges texts with him when he accomplishes something big. There's certainly plenty of respect for Cabrera around the sport.

            Cabrera played in 112 games last season. He said Monday that he feels good physically, but he joked that he'll have to wait and see how he feels after an 0-for-4 day at the plate. He made it clear that he's not expecting opponents to roll out the red carpet for him as his playing career winds down.

            “It’s nice if they do something. It’s nice if they don’t,"" he said. ""I don’t want attention, I don’t want any distraction for our team. We look forward to go out there and beat these guys.”

            Hinch and the Tigers, however, want to enjoy this final season with him. Cabrera may be in the spotlight sooner than usual, since he's on Venezuela's roster for next month's World Baseball Classic — along with Detroit left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez.

            “It's just going to be something special,"" Rodriguez said. ""It's his last year. We're going to go to play together in WBC for our country and then play the last season in MLB together. I know it's going to be great and I can't wait to enjoy it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816395,"New quake hits battered Turkey, Syria; 3 dead, hundreds hurt","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A new 6.4-magnitude earthquake on Monday killed three people and injured more than 200 others in parts of Turkey laid waste two weeks ago by a massive quake that killed tens of thousands, authorities said. More buildings collapsed, trapping some people, while scores of injuries were recorded in neighboring Syria too.

            Monday's earthquake was centered in the town of Defne, in Turkey's Hatay province, one the worst-hit regions in the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck on Feb. 6. It was felt in Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Israel and as far away as Egypt, and followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 temblor.

            Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said three people were killed and 213 injured. Search and rescue efforts were underway in three collapsed buildings where six people were believed trapped.











            In Hatay, police rescued one person trapped inside a three-story building and were trying to reach three others inside, HaberTurk television reported. It said those trapped included movers helping people shift furniture and other belongings from the building that was damaged in the massive quake.

            Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported that six people were injured in Aleppo by falling debris. The White Helmets, northwest Syria’s civil defense organization, reported more than 130 injuries, most of them non-life threatening, including fractures and cases of people fainting from fear, while a number of buildings in areas already damaged by the quake collapsed.

            The Feb. 6 quake killed nearly 45,000 people in both countries — the vast majority of them in Turkey, where more than a million and a half people are in temporary shelters. Turkish authorities have recorded more than 6,000 aftershocks since.

            HaberTurk journalists reporting from Hatay said they were jolted violently by Monday's quake and held onto to each other to avoid falling.

            In the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets into their cars. Malaver said everyone is really scared and “no one wants to get back into their houses.”

            Mehmet Salhaoglullari, from a village near Samandag, said he was eating at a restaurant when the building began to shake.

            “We all threw ourselves outside and we continued to shake outside,” he said.

            In the Syrian city of Idlib, frightened residents were preparing to sleep in parks and other public places, while fuel lines formed at gas stations as people attempted to get as far as possible from any buildings that might collapse.

            The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria, said it had treated a number of patients — including a 7-year-old boy — who suffered heart attacks brought on by fear following the new quake.

            President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Hatay earlier on Monday, and said his government would begin constructing close to 200,000 new homes in the quake-devastated region as early as next month.

            Erdogan said the new buildings will be no taller than three or four stories, built on firmer ground and to higher standards and in consultation with “geophysics, geotechnical, geology and seismology professors” and other experts.

            The Turkish leader said destroyed cultural monuments would be rebuilt in accordance with their “historic and cultural texture.” 

            Erdogan said around 1.6 million people are currently being housed in temporary shelters. 

            The Turkish disaster management agency AFAD on Monday raised the number of confirmed fatalities from the Feb. 6 earthquake in Turkey to 41,156. That increased the overall death toll in both Turkey and Syria to 44,844.

            Search and rescue operations for survivors have been called off in most of the quake zone, but AFAD chief Yunus Sezer said earlier that search teams were continuing their efforts in more than a dozen collapsed buildings — mostly in Hatay province.

            There were no signs of anyone being alive under the rubble since three members of one family — a mother, father and 12-year-old boy — were extracted from a collapsed building in Hatay on Saturday. The boy later died.

            Authorities said more than 110,000 buildings across 11 quake-hit Turkish provinces were either destroyed or so severely damaged by the Feb. 6 quake that they need to be torn down.

            The European Union’s health agency warned Monday of the risk of disease outbreaks in the coming weeks. The Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls said that “food and water-borne diseases, respiratory infections and vaccine-preventable infections are a risk in the upcoming period, with the potential to cause outbreaks, particularly as survivors are moving to temporary shelters.”

            “A surge of cholera cases in the affected areas is a significant possibility in the coming weeks,” it said, noting that authorities in northwestern Syria have reported thousands of cases of the disease since last September and a planned vaccination campaign was delayed due to the quake.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A new 6.4-magnitude earthquake on Monday killed three people and injured more than 200 others in parts of Turkey laid waste two weeks ago by a massive quake that killed tens of thousands, authorities said.

            In its first game since losing to Real Madrid 5-3 in the Club World Cup final nine days previously, Al-Hilal had too much firepower for the team from Dubai, led by former coach Leonardo Jardim.

            Odion Ighalo, who arrived in Saudi Arabia from Manchester United in 2021, opened the scoring after 17 minutes in Al Wakrah. South Korean defender Jang Hyun-soo added a second with 18 minutes remaining and Luciano Vietto sealed the win soon after.











            Syrian striker Omar Khribin bagged a consolation for Al-Ahli.

            Al-Hilal joined local rival Al-Shabab in the last eight. Also from Riyadh, Al-Shabab defeated FC Nasaf of Uzbekistan 2-0 on Sunday. Saudi Arabia was denied a third representative in the next round after Al-Faisaly lost to Foolad 1-0 in Doha. Sasan Ansari's goal gave the Iranian team the win.

            In the remaining fixture in the western zone of the round of 16, Al-Duhail defeated Qatar rival Al-Rayyan 7-6 in a penalty shootout after the game ended 1-1.

            The western zone quarterfinals — also in Qatar — will take place on Thursday and the semifinal three days later. The victor will meet Urawa Reds of Japan in April’s final.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816408,Nigeria: Gunmen kill 8 police days before presidential vote,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Suspected separatist gunmen have killed at least eight police officers over the past three days in southeast Nigeria, authorities said Monday, raising concerns ahead of weekend presidential elections.

            Four officers were killed in an attack at a station in Anambra state Monday, while authorities searched for suspects accused of killing four others over the weekend local police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. The assailants opened fire on officers while detonating explosives, he said, adding that three of the attackers were killed and two more arrested.

            Police blamed the attacks on a separatist group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra, or IPOB, which wants the southeast region to gain independence from the West African country.











            Authorities have accused the IPOB of instigating violence which has led to many deaths in the conflict-riddled region and stoked fears about the ability of Nigeria's security forces to protect voters at the polls.

            The election commission might not be able to deploy to some polling stations because of security concerns, said Festus Okoye, an official with Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816410,"Huey ‘Piano' Smith, session man and hit maker, dead at 89","NEW YORK (AP) — Huey ""Piano” Smith, a beloved New Orleans session man who backed Little Richard, Lloyd Price and other early rock stars and with his own group made the party favorites ""Don't You Just Know It"" and ""Rockin' Pneumonia and Boogie Woogie Flu,"" has died. He was 89.

            His daughter, Acquelyn Donsereaux, told The Associated Press that he died in his sleep Feb. 13 at his home in Baton Rouge. She did not cite a specific cause.

            A New Orleans native who performed nationwide but always returned to Louisiana, Smith was one of the last survivors of an extraordinary scene of musicians and songwriters who helped make New Orleans a fundamental influence on rock ‘n’ roll. He was just 15 when he began playing professionally and in his 20s helped out on numerous '50s hits, including Price's “Where You At?”, Earl King's ""Those Lonely Lonely Nights"" and Smiley Lewis' ""I Hear You Knocking."" Little Richard, Fats Domino and David Bartholemew were among the many other artists he worked with. 











            In 1957, he formed Huey ""Piano"" Smith and the Clowns and reached the top 10 with ""Rockin' Pneumonia,"" a mid-tempo stomp which featured the vocals of John Marchin and Smith's buoyant keyboard playing, and the equally rowdy and good-natured ""Don't You Just Know It."" The Clowns also were known for ""We Like Birdland"", ""Well I'll Be John Brown"" and ""High Blood Pressure.""

            One Smith production became a major hit and rock standard, for another performer. Smith and his group wrote, arranged and recorded ""Sea Cruise,"" but Ace Records thought the song would have more success with a white singer — as Smith learned bluntly from local record distributor Joe Caronna — and replaced the Clowns' vocals with those of Frankie Ford, whose version became a million seller.

            “I was crying as he (Caronna) said that,” Smith told biographer John Wirt, whose ""Huey ‘Piano’ Smith and the Rocking Pneumonia Blues” came out in 2014. “I had been drinking a little bit. It hurt me to my heart when he told me he was taking that.”

            Artists covering ""Sea Cruise"" and other Smith songs included John Fogerty, the Beach Boys, Aerosmith and Jerry Garcia. In 2005, Ford would deny “stealing” the song, alleging that he had written the words. “Huey sorta went through a period and ‘forgot’ a lot of things,” Ford told Offbeat Magazine.

            Smith's popularity faded after the Beatles arrived and by 1980 he had quit the business, settled in Baton Rouge with his wife, Margrette, and become a Jehovah's Witness. Like many rock musicians from the '50s, he fought to be paid and credited for “Sea Cruise” and other hits and spent decades in legal battles and financial trouble. Local musicians, meanwhile, continued to cite him as an inspiration.

            ""To me he was the man who got more out of simplicity than anybody in New Orleans,"" drummer Earl Palmer told Wirt.

            In 2000, Smith received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and he was honored a year later by the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame. Admirers would cite him as one of the most vital performers not to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

            He is survived by his wife, 10 children, 18 grandchildren and 47 great grandchildren, his daughter told the AP.

            Smith grew up in the Uptown section New Orleans, his father a roofer, his mother a laundry worker. As a boy, Smith took up piano, learning by watching his uncle play, and he soon mastered the eight-bar progression that anchored countless blues songs. He played obsessively, sometimes to the annoyance of his neighbors, and in high school he helped start the band the Joy Jumpers.

            He was still in his teens when he met another young New Orleans musician, Eddie Lee Jones, who as ""Guitar Slim"" influenced countless musicians and gave Smith his ""Piano"" nickname. Lewis' own work initially drew upon the blues-boogie woogie of Professor Longhair. But he would eventually absorb a wide range of styles, whether the jazz of Jelly Roll Martin or the rock-rhythm and blues of Fats Domino.

            ""I took up to tryin' a variety of music other than just one individual style,"" he told Wirt. ""I like my own style, but my own style is completely different than rhythm-and-blues, or calypso or any of that. It's just deep down funk.""NEW YORK (AP) — Huey ""Piano” Smith, a beloved New Orleans session man who backed Little Richard, Lloyd Price and other early rock stars and with his own group made the party favorites ""Don't You Just Know It"" and ""Rockin' Pneumonia and Boogie Woogie Flu,"" has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816416,Bruins win 4th straight; Pastrnak nets 2 to pass 40 goals,"BOSTON (AP) — David Pastrnak had already scored twice, and with the Senators' net empty, a third was within reach. 

            The Bruins forward passed up the chance at a hat trick — and the league lead in goals — and fed the puck to teammate David Krejci, whose family was at the game for a celebration honoring his 1,000th career NHL game.

            “That was my only goal,” said Pastrnak, who scored twice to lead Boston to a 3-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday. “I was looking for him all game.”











            Linus Ullmark stopped 30 shots in the Bruins' fourth straight victory. Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston — the second straight time he has opened the scoring in two games since returning from an injury. 

            Pastrnak broke a second-period tie to pass the 40-goal plateau for the third time in his career, and added another goal in the third for No. 41. Edmonton's Connor McDavid leads the league with 42 goals.

            With the Bruins in the Ottawa zone and no goalie in net in the final minute, Pastrnak was looking for Krecji. 

            “It just says a lot about the character that (Pastrnak) has as a human being, and understanding it was a big night for Krech,” said DeBrusk, who returned Saturday after missing 17 games with a broken leg. “He’s in position to get a hat trick and he still dishes it to Krech. It’s pretty cool.""

            Claude Giroux scored and Kevin Mandolese stopped 29 shots for the Senators, who were playing back-to-back games; they beat St. Louis on Sunday. Ottawa had won its previous two games against Boston this season.

            Playing in only his second game since the Jan. 2 Winter Classic, DeBrusk gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead with five minutes remaining in the first. Giroux tied it for Ottawa with 30 seconds left in the period.

            It remained that way until the Bruins had two good scoring chances late in the second. 

            The first came when Pavel Zacha went crashing into Mandolese and lost control of the puck. A review showed that it never crossed the goal line. On the ensuing faceoff, Charlie McAvoy found Pastrnak to the goalie's left and Pastrnak sent the puck high into the corner of the net.

            Midway through the third, Pastrnak drifted down the ice while his teammates fought to gain control in their own zone. Finally, McAvoy chipped the puck free from one knee and it made it to Pastrnak, who had a 20-foot lead on the nearest defender. 

            “He beat three guys with one pass,” said Pastrnak, who skated in on Mandolese, switched to his backhand at the last minute and then slid it through the goalie’s pads.

            KREJCI'S MOMENT

            The Bruins honored Krejci before the opening faceoff for playing in his 1,000th game.

            The forward, who reached the milestone on Jan. 16, has played his entire 16-year NHL career in Boston. The ceremony featured a video with tributes from current and former teammates including Zdeno Chara and Jaromir Jagr to Patrice Bergeron and Pastrnak. 

            Krejci’s family joined him on the ice when he was given a silver engraved stick, a watch, a painting and a Tiffany crystal from the NHL, which was presented by Hall of Famer John Bucyk. 

            Many of the Bruins wore hats with a special “1KREJCI” logo. 

            ANTHEM ISSUES

            Bruins anthem singer Todd Angilly had to do a restart before the game when he began with the U.S. national anthem for the game against Ottawa. 

            With the Canadian flag shown on the scoreboard, Angilly belted out his usual “O say can you see …"" before realizing that the organ was playing a different song. He stopped and then went into “O, Canada” and followed it with “The Star-Spangled Banner” without further difficulty. 

            He smiled and gave the fans a wave before leaving the ice. 

            Angilly became a fan favorite during the Bruins’ 2019 to the Stanley Cup Final by singing the anthem as a side gig as a bartender in one of the TD Garden clubs. After singing the anthem – or anthems – he returns to serve drinks.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBOSTON (AP) — David Pastrnak had already scored twice, and with the Senators' net empty, a third was within reach.The Bruins forward passed up the chance at a hat trick — and the league lead in goals — and fed the puck to teammate David Krejci, whose family was at the game for a celebration honoring his 1,000th career NHL game.“That was my only goal,” said Pastrnak, who scored twice to lead Boston to a 3-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday. “I was looking for him all game.”Linus Ullmark stopped 30 shots in the Bruins' fourth straight victory. Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston — the second straight time he has opened the scoring in two games since returning from an injury.Pastrnak broke a second-period tie to pass the 40-goal plateau for the third time in his career, and added another goal in the third for No. 41. Edmonton's Connor McDavid leads the league with 42 goals.With the Bruins in the Ottawa zone and no goalie in net in the final minute, Pastrnak was looking for Krecji.“It just says a lot about the character that (Pastrnak) has as a human being, and understanding it was a big night for Krech,” said DeBrusk, who returned Saturday after missing 17 games with a broken leg. “He’s in position to get a hat trick and he still dishes it to Krech. It’s pretty cool.""Claude Giroux scored and Kevin Mandolese stopped 29 shots for the Senators, who were playing back-to-back games; they beat St. Louis on Sunday. Ottawa had won its previous two games against Boston this season.Playing in only his second game since the Jan. 2 Winter Classic, DeBrusk gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead with five minutes remaining in the first. Giroux tied it for Ottawa with 30 seconds left in the period.It remained that way until the Bruins had two good scoring chances late in the second.The first came when Pavel Zacha went crashing into Mandolese and lost control of the puck. A review showed that it never crossed the goal line. On the ensuing faceoff, Charlie McAvoy found Pastrnak to the goalie's left and Pastrnak sent the puck high into the corner of the net.Midway through the third, Pastrnak drifted down the ice while his teammates fought to gain control in their own zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816417,"MLS opens 28th season, build up to World Cup starts now","The push toward the World Cup in 2026 begins now for Major League Soccer.

            The league, entering its 28th season this year, has a new team in St. Louis City SC and a new media deal with Apple TV. This season will also feature an expanded Leagues Cup, which will involve all of the MLS and Liga MX teams for the first time.

            The tournament is part of an ever-increasing collaboration between MLS and Liga MX, with both professional leagues looking forward to the attention they'll see in the run-up to the World Cup hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.











            The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was already record-breaking, with 36 MLS players making national team rosters — double the league's players that were in Russia in 2018.

            LAFC is the defending MLS Cup champion and Supporters Shield winner. The Western Conference team is loaded with talent, including Carlos Vela, Kellyn Acosta and Giorgio Chiellini, but top scorer Cristian `Chicho' Arango was sold to Pachuca in Mexico. 

            Wales legend Gareth Bale, LAFC's splashy signing last June, retired in the offseason but not before he provided a memorable moment in the championship game with an equalizer late in extra time that sent the match to penalties and a victory over the Philadelphia Union. 

            “I think our first 11 is still pretty good, and we're quite pleased with it. And we have a few very good players off the bench, we just don't have as deep a bench as last season. So we're focusing on staying healthy, and trying to manage a lot of games in a congested schedule this year,” LAFC second-year coach Steve Cherundolo said.

            Philadelphia, the Eastern Conference's top finisher last season, didn't make many huge moves in the offseason but lost key sub Cory Burke in free agency. The Union scored a league-best 72 goals and allowed just 26, fewest in MLS last season and a record for a 34-game season.

            “It's going to be hard to replicate what we did defensively last year, setting a record in goals-against, and then scoring as many goals as we did is certainly going to be a challenge, but this group will fight like hell for our fans and try to get back to that MLS Cup final,” Union coach Jim Curtin said.

            The 28th MLS season opens this Saturday.

            HOW ABOUT THEM APPLE(S)

            MLS kicked off a 10-year partnership with Apple with the launch of Season Pass on Apple TV+ this season. Apple has made previous forays into sports streaming, but this is its first significant involvement with a league.

            MLS will receive at least $250 million per season from Apple. The league averaged $90 million per season under its previous eight-year agreements with Fox, ESPN and Univision.

            Oh, and for those who prefer watching games at the local pub or eatery, the league has a “commercial establishments” deal with DirectTV.

            NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK

            St. Louis City joins MLS this season as the 29th club. City opens the season on the road at Austin but returns home to face Charlotte on March 4 at the team's soccer-specific stadium, CITYPARK. The team's first home match will be played before a sellout crowd of 22,500.

            City named goalkeeper Roman Burki, who came from Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, as its captain for the inaugural season. Defender Tim Parker was named vice captain.

            “We want to play a fast-paced game. We want to keep it action packed, we want to really be working in the transition, we want to be working on the front foot, really bringing a lot of energy to the fans, hoping that they sit on the edge of their seats and not really get too comfortable, right?” coach Bradley Carnell said. 

            The league plans to add a 30th team, possibly making an announcement in the first half of this year. 

            NEW(ISH) COACHES

            One of the biggest coaching moves in the offseason was made by Wilfried Nancy, who left Montreal last season to take over the Columbus Crew after Caleb Porter was dismissed. Hernan Losada, who was coach at D.C. United in 2021 and part of 2022, took Nancy's spot in Montreal.

            Luchi Gonzalez returned from his duties as an assistant for the United States at the World Cup to join the San Jose Earthquakes. Gonzalez also coached at FC Dallas from 2018-21. Ben Olsen is another former MLS coach that has a new team this season. Olsen, previously coach at D.C. United, is now with Houston.

            GOING BOWLING

            On opening day the season features an El Trafico rivalry game between defending MLS Cup champion LAFC and the LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

            The match could break the league's all-time attendance record for a standalone game, set last year when Charlotte drew 74,479 fans to its season opener.

            “We're looking forward to those games, they're always fun, they're always exciting, pretty intense. And I know our players, I know our group, and they'll be ready,” LAFC coach Cherundolo said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816418,Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe out at right-wing org,"MAMARONECK, N.Y. (AP) — Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe said in a speech posted online Monday that he has been removed as the right-wing group's leader.

            In remarks that appeared to have been made at a Project Veritas' office, O'Keefe said the board had stripped him of all decision-making. The move comes after the board reportedly put him on leave from his role as chairman amid complaints about his treatment of staff at the organization, which is known for using hidden cameras and hiding identities to try to ensnare journalists in embarrassing conversations and to reveal supposed liberal bias. 

            “So currently, I have no job at Project Veritas,"" O'Keefe said in the video. “I have no position here based upon what the board has done. So I’m announcing to you all that today on President's Day, I’m packing up my personal belongings.”











            In a statement released later Monday, the group's board of directors said it had uncovered “financial malfeasance” and accused O'Keefe of spending “an excessive amount of donor funds in the last three years on personal luxuries.” 

            According to the group, those included “$14,000 on a charter flight to meet someone to fix his boat under the guise of meeting with a donor”; $60,000 in losses from dance events; more than $150,000 “in Black Cars in the last 18 months”; and others. 

            The statement added that O'Keefe had been suspended in recent weeks. It said he was invited to meet with the board to discuss financial issues and staff retention and morale, but he ignored those entreaties and “today ... decided to remove his belongings from Project Veritas headquarters.” 

            O'Keefe, who choked up and wiped away tears during his remarks in the video, said several times that the nearly 45-minute speech was for staff internally, but it was posted on the Vimeo platform. 

            The announcement comes after the group's executive director and several board members put out a statement last week saying that “a number of our staff members provided leadership with some verbal feedback describing real management concerns regarding the treatment of people and our internal processes.”

            Project Veritas, which identifies itself as a news organization, is best known for its hidden camera stings that have embarrassed news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic politicians. O'Keefe founded the nonprofit group 13 years ago, and its most recent IRS filings provided to charity regulators in Florida show it brought in more than $20 million in revenue in 2021. 

            Last year, two Florida residents pleaded guilty to selling a diary and other items from President Joe Biden’s daughter to Project Veritas for $40,000, prosecutors said. As part of its investigation, the FBI searched the group’s New York offices and the homes of some employees in 2021.

            Neither Project Veritas nor any staffers have been charged with a crime, and the group has said its activities were protected by the First Amendment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816419,Panthers slip past Ducks with 4-3 OT victory,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe scored 1:42 into overtime to lead the Florida Panthers to a 4-3 win against the Anaheim Ducks on Monday. 

            Florida has won six of its past nine games. Anaheim has lost its past five. 

            The Panthers also got goals from Eric and Marc Staal as well as Ryan Lomberg. Sergei Bobrovsky had 29 saves. 











            Mason McTavish, Frank Vatrano and Dmitry Kulikov scored for the Ducks. John Gibson made 51 saves.

            “It was pretty cool, pretty good accomplishment but it was nice to win,” said Verhaeghe, who hit the 30-goal mark for the first time in his career with the overtime winner. 

            “All game, it felt like we were in control and had a ton of chances. We just could not finish them. They got a couple one-off chances; it was nice to win.”

            Anaheim has one of the worst records in the league, but played like the team fighting for its playoff lives instead of the Panthers. 

            Anaheim scored the first two goals and had a 2-0 lead into the second period. 

            McTavish opened the scoring at 11:46 of the first by scoring off a rebound. 

            Vatrano converted on the power play against his former teammates moments after the team played a tribute video for him. Florida traded Vatrano to the New York Rangers last season.

            “I thought we had a great first. They are a desperate team over there,’’ Vatrano said. “They had a good second half and I thought the third was pretty even. We were in it all the way. We scored a late one there, then they get one right back. Overall we could clean up a couple areas, but I thought we played overall a pretty solid game.”

            Florida rallied in the second. Eric Staal scored 2:12 into the period with his younger brother, Marc, tying the score at 2 with 2:37 remaining.

            The game remained tied throughout the third before Kulikov gave Anaheim the lead back at 12:51.

            Florida tied it at 3 just over a minute later when Lomberg knocked in a long shot from defenseman Gustav Forsling.

            “We know where we are at, we know we needed these points and that was a great response by everyone to stay with it and ultimately get two big points,’’ Eric Staal said. 

            “We knew this was important and was a big night. I liked the way my line played whole way. I thought we were engaged and we ended up being rewarded.”

            NOTES: The Panthers were without center Sam Bennett for the third consecutive game after he left their game in St. Louis early. Bennett, out with a lower-body injury, is expected to return Friday night. ... Florida lost forward Givani Smith midway through the second period when he was struck in the face by a shot as he turned his back toward to the net. Smith rushed off the ice and did not return. Florida coach Paul Maurice said Smith is not believed to have sustained a concussion as he was not placed in the protocol. ... The Ducks were successful in a coach’s challenge on Monday when what would have been Eric Staal’s second goal of the game was taken away for goalie interference on former Anaheim defenseman Josh Mahura. ... The Panthers play eight of their next nine at home and do not leave the state of Florida until March 20 when it plays at Detroit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816431,Fangio introduced as Dolphins defensive coordinator,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Veteran NFL coach Vic Fangio compared the year he took off from the sidelines to a tenured professor on sabbatical leave.

            For the 64-year-old Fangio, whose NFL coaching career spans 35 years, class is in session again.

            Fangio was introduced as the Miami Dolphins new defensive coordinator at the club’s training facility Monday. Fangio replaces Josh Boyer, who was not retained by head coach Mike McDaniel after three seasons with the club.











            “I think the Dolphins have a good thing going here,” Fangio said. “There are good components of the coaching staff led by Mike that made it intriguing to join that. I still have a lot of coaching left in me. It’s who I am and what I enjoy doing.”

            Fangio had a three-year head coaching tenure with the Denver Broncos, going 19-30. He was fired after the 2021 season, when the Broncos finished 7-10, and didn’t coach in 2022.

            Fangio is considered one of the league’s respected defensive coaches. Before his career promotion in Denver, Fangio had two four-year stints as defensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears. Fangio also has served as coordinator with the Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts and the Houston Texans.

            “It’s an exciting day for the Miami Dolphins organization,” McDaniel said. “Since the season ended we’ve tried to attach in the journey looking towards the future, whom can we entrust to continue to develop the players.”

            Under Boyer, the Dolphins were ranked 18th in defense and 27th in passing defense.

            “You don’t have a sustaining career — longer than I’ve been alive — like Vic has, without that fearless chase of continuing to evolve and get better,” the 39-year-old McDaniel said.

            Although the Dolphins defense was in the bottom half statistically last season, Fangio believes the unit has a young and talented core. 

            Fangio singled out pass rusher Jaelan Phillips, safety Jevon Holland and defensive tackle Christian Wilkins among the players who could help lift Miami’s defense.

            Fangio’s hiring already is attracting assistants from other teams. Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Renaldo Hill, who worked with Fangio in Chicago and Denver, will join him in Miami.

            “First and foremost, Renaldo is a good coach, a talented coach that’s got a bright future in the NFL,” Fangio said. “His familiarity with me and the system and what we do was important to me. But, regardless of that, just his ability to be a great coach is what attracted me.”

            During his time off from coaching, Fangio studied game tapes throughout the season, visited family in the Northeast and played golf. Fangio also served as a consultant to Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni while the club prepared for the NFC championship game and Super Bowl.

            “It was an interesting year, one I would recommend for anybody to do it at some point,” Fangio said. “But in this business you can’t do it too often.”

            Now, Fangio directs his entire attention to helping the Dolphins defense become a comparable component to their offense.

            “You have to fit the scheme to the players that you have while also factoring in the opponents that you’re playing,” Fangio said. “Hopefully we will be a team that would keep the points down and put our offense in a position to score points for us.

            “I’m not a buzzword guy. You want to play good defense and what’s good defense? Keep them out of the end zone.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816432,Deaths from jihadi attack on Burkina Faso army rise to 51,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The death toll from a jihadi attack on a Burkina Faso army unit in the north of the country last week has risen to 51, military officials said Monday, after 43 new bodies were found.

            The military unit was ambushed in the Sahel region’s Oudalan province, between the towns of Deou and Oursi, the Burkinabe military said Monday. Reinforcements have been sent to the area and an unspecified number of wounded have been taken to hospital.

            The West African nation has been wracked for seven years by violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, which has killed thousands, displaced nearly 2 million people and caused a humanitarian crisis.











            Successive governments' failure to effectively address the problem led to two coups last year, with each military leader vowing to stem attacks and secure the country, albeit with little success.

            Last week's attack came while some 400 French special forces soldiers were leaving Burkina Faso, one month after the junta government ordered them out — following in the path of neighboring Mali, which is also ruled by a military dictatorship.

            While the number of French troops in Burkina Faso was far smaller than in Mali, their departure adds to growing concerns that Islamic extremists are capitalizing on the political disarray and using it to expand their reach.

            Analysts have questioned whether the countries' militaries are capable of filling the void.

            “The struggle for state forces to avoid deadly attacks, especially such an ambush against convoys, is a major concern since it comes at a time where the state is trying to assert its presence and chase jihadists out from areas they control,"" said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan-based think tank. 

            “If convoys are repeatedly targeted, recovering territories and providing protection for civilians is going to take a very long time and going to be deadly,"" Lyammouri added.OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The death toll from a jihadi attack on a Burkina Faso army unit in the north of the country last week has risen to 51, military officials said Monday, after 43 new bodies were found.The military unit was ambushed in the Sahel region’s Oudalan province, between the towns of Deou and Oursi, the Burkinabe military said Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816433,Lawyers: Feds seek 'eye for eye' from NYC bike path killer,"NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for a man convicted of killing eight people along a Manhattan bike path say prosecutors are seeking “eye for an eye” justice by using tearful testimony from victims and their families to convince a jury to order death. 

            They asked the judge presiding over the death penalty phase of Sayfullo Saipov's trial to declare a mistrial over the issue.

            “The government’s victim-impact evidence has been laden with emotional testimony, improper references to and characterizations of Mr. Saipov and his crime, and appeals to jurors’ emotions and sympathy for the victims and their plight,"" the lawyers wrote.











            The request came late last week as the lawyers prepared to begin presenting evidence to support their arguments against the death penalty as early as Tuesday, when the trial resumes and prosecutors complete their presentation. If any juror votes against death, Saipov will serve a life prison sentence.

            Late Monday, prosecutors filed a response to the defense’s request for a mistrial, saying it was meritless and that emotional testimony by and about victims “does not approach, much less cross, the bounds of the law.”

            They added: “The contested testimony did not offer opinions or characterizations of the crime, did not comment on the appropriate sentence, and did not — by any means — otherwise render the trial fundamentally unfair.”

            Saipov, 35, was convicted last month of killing eight people and seriously injuring about 18 others Oct. 31, 2017, when he raced his rented truck onto a bike path in lower Manhattan along the West Side Highway. Arrested at the scene, he said he was supporting the Islamic State group.

            The same jurors who heard numerous victims and family members of the dead tearfully testify before convicting Saipov have watched many others describe during the last week how their lives have been permanently altered by the terror attack. Some witnesses have testified twice.

            Testimony did not occur Friday, when defense lawyers made their mistrial request, describing emotional testimony a day earlier as “the most forceful and evocative so far.”

            They also made the unusual request of asking the judge to order that audio recordings of the court proceedings used solely by court stenographers to ensure transcripts are accurate and be preserved, presumably so an appeals court panel can hear the extent of the emotional testimony.

            In their filing, defense lawyers cited some of Thursday's testimony, including by Belgian witness Alexander Naessens, whose wife, Ann-Laure Decadt, was killed.

            He said his children “will never have their mother, never have the most important person in their life, never.”

            “And as for me, you know, my life is ruined,” Naessens said.

            Defense lawyers wrote that the testimony “transcended a mere description of pain and loss and all but urged jurors to end Mr. Saipov’s life because he had ended Ms. Decadt’s and ‘ruined' the lives of her husband and children.”

            The defense lawyers also complained that prosecutors followed Naessens’ testimony by playing recorded jail phone calls between Saipov and his children in what they described as an obvious attempt to invite jurors “to exact revenge on Mr. Saipov for the sake of Ms. Decadt’s children.”

            “This is nothing more than an appeal for an ‘eye for an eye' justice that encourages the jury to ignore or disregard any mitigation and is otherwise irreconcilable with the jury’s task: To soberly weigh the evidence in aggravation to determine whether Mr. Saipov deserves the ultimate punishment,” they added.

            The defense lawyers also said a mistrial might be necessary because of the emotional testimony by Lieve Wyseur, Ann-Laure Decadt’s mother.

            “Having wept and sobbed through most of her testimony, in visible fits of anger at times, Ms. Wyseur’s presentation was a quintessential appeal to passion and emotion,” they wrote. 

            “Of course, the defense is not criticizing the witnesses for the grief and pain they feel over the loss of Ms. Decadt,"" they added. “However, it is indisputable that the penalty phase of a federal capital proceeding is not the forum for victims to freely express their emotions or, in Ms. Wyseur’s case, vent their (understandable) rage and torment.”

            A spokesperson for the prosecutors declined comment.

            During the trial's penalty-phase, Judge Vernon S. Broderick repeatedly urged witnesses to request a break if they believed they were about to be too emotional, and he has made rulings to disallow some audio or video recordings that he concluded might be unfairly prejudicial.

            During the presentation of the defense's case, members of Saipov's family were expected in a courtroom that has often been filled with victims and family members of the dead.

            New York does not have capital punishment and hasn’t executed anyone since 1963, but Saipov’s trial is in federal court, where a death sentence is still an option. The last time a person was executed for a federal crime in New York was in 1954.NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for a man convicted of killing eight people along a Manhattan bike path say prosecutors are seeking “eye for an eye” justice by using tearful testimony from victims and their families to convince a jury to order death.They asked the judge presiding over the death penalty phase of Sayfullo Saipov's trial to declare a mistrial over the issue.“The government’s victim-impact evidence has been laden with emotional testimony, improper references to and characterizations of Mr. Saipov and his crime, and appeals to jurors’ emotions and sympathy for the victims and their plight,"" the lawyers wrote.The request came late last week as the lawyers prepared to begin presenting evidence to support their arguments against the death penalty as early as Tuesday, when the trial resumes and prosecutors complete their presentation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816434,Sasser looks to lead No. 1 Houston to title in last season,"HOUSTON (AP) — Marcus Sasser weighed many factors in deciding whether to return for his senior season at Houston.

            The chance that he could lead the top-ranked Cougars to their first national title at home, with the Final Four being played in Houston, made his decision to come back much easier.

            “That was a big factor because that’s once in a lifetime, that really doesn’t happen where the national championship is in your city and it’s like you’re playing the national championship at home,” he told The Associated Press. “So, I feel like that would be one of the best moments in college basketball really.”











            
                Houston reclaimed the top spot in the AP men’s college basketball poll on Monday after winning seven straight, capped by a 72-64 victory over Memphis on Sunday, when Sasser scored 20 points.

            The preseason AP All-America selection leads Houston (25-2, 13-1 American) by averaging 16.7 points a game. Sasser has made a strong comeback this season after suffering a season-ending foot injury just 12 games into the 2021-22 season.

            Sasser is rounding into form after saying he didn’t really feel like himself until about 10 games into this season after sitting out for so long. Though he couldn’t play for most of last season, he tried to stay engaged with the team in other ways.

            “It was hard,” he said. “I always wanted to be out there with them, but I just feel like it made me learn basketball from a different way,” he said. “I couldn’t be out there, so I tried to turn a negative to a positive really. And I did that by just watching a lot of film, seeing the game from a different perspective.”

            Coach Kelvin Sampson spoke about Sasser’s development from when he joined the program in 2019 until now. The veteran coach, who has led a remarkable resurgence at the school, said the most important way in which he’s grown is his confidence.

            But from the moment he met the guard, he knew that he would be a good fit for his program.

            “There’s just something about Marcus that I like,” Sampson said. “He had a quiet maturity about him.”

            And it didn’t hurt that he was a good shooter, the kind of player that Sampson likes to stack his team with. Sasser is shooting 43% overall this season and is 37.4% on 3-pointers.

            Though Sasser knows he’s a much better player than he was when he first arrived at Houston, he’s looking to take his game to another level as the NCAA Tournament approaches.

            “I’m just staying in the gym 24/7,"" he said. “Working on the little details, that’s kind of a big thing. Because I feel like if you just look at the bigger picture and skip the details, then something’s going to be missing in your game. So that’s what I hang my hat on, it’s just details and getting better at the little things every day.”

            This is the first season in which the Cougars have been ranked No. 1 since the Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler-led Phi Slama Jama team ended the regular season in the top spot in 1983. That year, Houston reached the Final Four for a second straight season before losing to North Carolina State 54-52 in the title game.

            Sasser is well versed in the history of that team and has grown close to Olajuwon in his time at the school.

            “One of the first things I knew about was the Phi Slama Jama teams when I came here,” he said. “So, the history was a big part of the reason I came here for real.""

            As he rounds out his college career, Sasser has helped the Cougars to heights not seen since those days. He was a starter during the 2020-21 season when Houston reached the Final Four before losing to eventual champion Baylor in the national semifinal.

            The Cougars advanced to the Elite Eight last season despite losing Sasser in December.

            On a recent day at the team’s training facility, Sasser wore a beanie he got during the team’s trip to the Final Four as he talked about Houston’s goal of getting there again.

            But he doesn’t simply have designs on taking the Cougars that far. He wants to cap his career by helping this Houston squad accomplish what even those lauded Phi Slama Jama teams couldn’t.

            Sasser wants to bring a championship to the school.

            “It’s extra motivation to try to be better than them so they can tip their hats off to us,” he said. “They had a crazy run… so if we can get past them or even do something bigger than them, that’ll be big for us and this program. And for us to be a part of that would just be special for Houston.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816436,"Cubs, RHP Michael Fulmer finalize $4M, 1-year contract","MESA, Ariz. (AP) — The Chicago Cubs added Michael Fulmer to their bullpen on Monday, finalizing a $4 million, one-year contract with the right-hander.

            Fulmer played for Detroit and Minnesota last season, going 5-6 with 3.39 ERA in a career-high 67 appearances. He began the season with the Tigers and was traded to the Twins in August.

            Chicago has been active since it went 74-88 last year in its second straight losing season. Shortstop Dansby Swanson, right-hander Jameson Taillon, outfielder Cody Bellinger, first baseman Eric Hosmer, reliever Brad Boxberger and catcher Tucker Barnhart also signed with the team in free agency.

            “It just kind of confirmed my beliefs of me wanting to be here,” Fulmer told reporters, “and ultimately, just glad it worked out.”

            Fulmer, 29, is 34-45 with a 3.89 ERA and 17 saves in 204 career games, including 89 starts. He was the 2016 AL Rookie of the Year with Detroit, going 11-7 with a 3.06 ERA.

            In a corresponding roster move, Chicago placed reliever Codi Heuer on the 60-day injured list. Heuer had Tommy John surgery in March 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816437,"Former NBA, NFL team owner, businessman Red McCombs dies","A former owner of two NBA teams, an NFL franchise and longtime Texas businessman, Billy Joe “Red” McCombs has died at his home in San Antonio, according to a statement from his family on Monday.

            McCombs was 95 and preceded in death by his wife, Charline, in 2019.

            “The entire McCombs family is heartbroken to announce that our father, grandfather and great-grandfather, Red McCombs passed away Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023,"" according to the statement that called McCombs “a Texas icon.”











            “Red was a visionary entrepreneur who touched many lives and impacted our community in immeasurable ways,” the statement said. “But to us he was always, first and foremost, ‘Dad’ or ‘Poppop.’” 

            McCombs owned more than 400 businesses during his lifetime, according to the McCombs Enterprises website, and the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin is named for him.

            He twice owned the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and between those two ownership stints owned the league's Denver Nuggets and later the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL.

            In a statement, the Vikings expressed gratitude to McCombs and condolences to his family.

            “Red embodied his famous ‘Purple Pride’ phrase and remained a staunch Vikings fan” after selling his ownership of the team, according to the statement.

            “While Red had a clear passion for sports, it was evident what he loved the most were his children and grandchildren,” the statement said.

            McCombs also played a big role in Formula One’s return to the United States. He was one of the largest investors in the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the first purpose-built F1 racetrack in the U.S. and host of the U.S. Grand Prix since 2012. 

            The Texas circuit and annual grand prix were pivotal for the global racing series' efforts to establish and grow a significant presence in the U.S. Formula One will race three times in the country in 2023, in Austin and Miami and the debut of the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

            Beginning as an automobile salesman in the early 1950s in Corpus Christi, Texas, he would later establish Red McCombs Automotive, a group of dealerships in San Antonio.

            He later established McCombs Energy, an oil and gas industry company, and operated real estate and land development companies, cattle ranches and breeding operations. He also was a co-founder of Clear Channel Communications, which later became iHeartCommunications, Inc.

            Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called McCombs an inspiration and “a true Texas titan across sports, media, business and philanthropy.”

            “Red’s determination, accomplishments and positive spirit will live forever as he embodied a relentless and passionate approach to life, relationships and community,” Jones said. 

            McCombs is survived by daughters Lynda McCombs, Marsha Shields and Connie McNab, as well as eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816441,D-backs' Lovullo renews friendship with Japanese teammate,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona manager Torey Lovullo's final year as a player was an injury filled season with Japan's Yakult Swallows.

            Lovullo's stats that year were forgettable, but he often talks about his positive experiences during the 2000 season. One day before a game in Hiroshima, he was talking with Swallows star catcher Atsuya Furuta.

            “I explained to this player — who was a superstar inside of Japanese baseball — that my days were winding down. I was old and broken,” Lovullo said. “I was probably going to come back to America and become a manager. 











            ""If I did, would he be willing to join the staff in some capacity?""

            It took 23 years, but Lovullo finally made it happen.

            Lovullo invited Furuta to Diamondbacks camp for a two-week stint, mainly to work with the team's catchers, particularly Carson Kelly and top prospect Gabriel Moreno. The Diamondbacks manager presented Furuta a team jersey on Monday at spring training.

            Furuta said he was enjoying his experience in the U.S. and had just one request from the D-backs.

            “I told (Lovullo) yesterday, if they win a championship, please send a champion's ring to Japan,"" Furuta said, grinning. 

            Lovullo — without hesitation — replied he would make that happen.

            Furuta played for Yakult from 1990 to 2007 and hit .294 with 217 homers. He managed the Central League team in 2006 and 2007.

            PEDRO'S WATCHING

            Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez was at Red Sox camp for the first time this spring training and watched the pitchers throw on a back field, including top prospect Brayan Bello, who had been sidelined for a few days with right forearm soreness. 

            Martinez also stood to the side of a catcher watching Corey Kluber throw off a mound. The right-hander signed a $10 million, one-year contract. 

            “It’s just knowledge,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said of former players like Martinez talking to the team. “It’s players that have been here, been very successful. We haven’t been able to due that the last two springs because of the restrictions, but now we’re back to almost normal. To have him around is always good for us and good for him.”

            Later, Martinez headed to a back field and watched Kluber throw live batting practice to Rafael Devers and Christian Arroyo. 

            In December, Bello worked out at Martinez’s home in the Dominican Republic.

            ELVIS AT 2B

            The Chicago White Sox and veteran Elvis Andrus finalized a $3 million, one-year contract. 

            The two-time All-Star has played shortstop for his entire big league career, but he is going to move over to second in his return to Chicago.

            “With the change in the shift rules, having someone with range and a strong arm and good instincts is going to be of added benefit in the middle infield. We think Elvis profiles that way,” general manager Rick Hahn said. “Certainly going to be no doubt that he’s going to put the work in to make himself as good as possible at that position and look forward to get starting today.”

            The 34-year-old Andrus finished last season with Chicago, hitting .271 with nine homers and 28 RBIs in 43 games after he was cut by Oakland.

            He was signed by the White Sox after Tim Anderson had surgery for a torn ligament in his left middle finger, but the All-Star shortstop is healthy again.

            HARRIS TALKS TIGERS

            Scott Harris, who was hired last September as Detroit’s president of baseball operations, spoke at spring training, saying it’s the team’s responsibility to convince prospective free agents of its appeal.

            “Each year that we are pursuing new players, we’ve got to make a very compelling pitch to them as to why they should be Tigers,” he said.

            As for whether he’s noticed any impediments to attracting new talent – in terms of money or anything else –- it’s hard to say.

            “It’s never easy to tell what the final decision-making criteria is for a player,” Harris said. “They don’t tell you. When you are pursuing a free agent, at the end of it, they call you and say they want to be a Tiger or they call you and they say they’re going somewhere else.”

            Detroit did sign left-hander Matthew Boyd and righty Michael Lorenzen to one-year deals.

            “We identified two starters who we felt are getting better, who we felt could come here … and take sort of the next step in their development,” Harris said.

            SIGNINGS

            The Chicago Cubs added Michael Fulmer to their bullpen, finalizing a $4 million, one-year contract with the right-hander. Fulmer played for Detroit and Minnesota last season, going 5-6 with 3.39 ERA in a career-high 67 appearances. ... RHP Chase Anderson agreed to a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. Anderson had a 6.38 ERA over 24 innings last season for the Reds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816454,"Despite new coach, Valencia loses fifth straight league game","MADRID (AP) — New coach, same disappointing result for Valencia.

            In the debut of coach Rubén Baraja, struggling Valencia lost at Getafe 1-0 on Monday for its fifth straight loss in the Spanish league, and sixth in a row in all competitions.

            The result dropped the traditional club to second-to-last in the league, two points from safety, and was expected to add fuel to the protests from fans against Singaporean owner Peter Lim.











            Captain Gabriel Paulista went to talk to the Valencia supporters at Coliseum Alfonso Pérez Stadium after the match. Some fans held “Lim Go Home” signs.

            “They have to stick with us until the end,"" Gabriel Paulista said. “We will keep fighting until the last minute. It's complicated to be in this situation, but we can't be afraid of what can happen. We have to keep trying to win matches.”

            Valencia has only one league win in its last 14 games in a poor run that started under coach Gennaro Gattuso. He was replaced by Baraja, who previously coached in the second division.

            “We paid for not capitalizing on our chances,” Baraja said. “They scored off a set-piece and it cost us three points that were very important. But I'll stay with the positive, which was the effort and the attitude of our players. We know it's not going to be easy, but we will keep competing.""

            Valencia next hosts third-placed Real Sociedad and then visits league leader Barcelona. Getafe is at ninth-placed Villarreal in the next round. 

            Striker Borja Mayoral scored his first goal since January in the 82nd minute to end Getafe's seven-match winless streak in all competitions and move the team out of the relegation zone. It was 16th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816460,Seager's 2nd spring with Texas already `world of difference',"Within hours after Corey Seager was introduced by the Rangers with his $325 million, 10-year contract in December 2021, a lockout prevented him from contacting Texas for more than three months. 

            Following a late and rushed spring training, the Rangers never had a winning record while skidding to a 94-loss season.

            “Not winning is always frustrating,” the All-Star shortstop said.











            Texas hired a three-time World Series champion manager and revamped its starting rotation, and Seager was able to have a normal offseason. He has described coming into his second spring with the Rangers as “a world of difference.”

            The Rangers held their first full-squad workout in Arizona on Monday. Seager arrived in camp over the weekend, no longer the new guy in the clubhouse. 

            Seager was in constant contact with the organization all offseason, including general manager Chris Young and new manager Bruce Bochy. The shortstop is getting to know the players who are now the newcomers. Among them two-time National League Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom, former All-Star right-hander Nathan Eovaldi and left-hander Andrew Heaney, all signed to multiyear contracts. 

            “It just makes everybody better, right? Like when you’ve got the five guys that we have, six guys, seven guys, really, that can go out there and start for us now, it’s that much more comforting,” Seager said even before getting to camp. “It’s more of the buy-in of expecting to win every night. You know there’s no excuses now with who were throwing out there on why we can’t at least expect to win.”

            
                The Rangers introduced their half-billion dollar middle infield of Seager and second baseman Marcus Semien on Dec. 1, 2021, only hours before the lockout began Texas peaked at 24-24 at the end of May and finished with its sixth consecutive losing season.

            “It’s probably one of the things I didn’t anticipate enough, is just the impact of an abbreviated spring training,” Young said. “Really a lot of changes and new personalities coming together all at once in the hope that we would get off to a hot start. It didn’t materialize and I think it took us time to really get used to each other, to understand just the locker room dynamics, the coaching dynamics. ... We're in a much better spot than we were last year.”

            Seager said the biggest learning curve last spring was the aspect of everything being new for him. Then all the losses started piling up. 

            Seager spent his first seven big league seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was the 2016 NL Rookie of the Year. Los Angeles averaged about 99 wins a year during that time — not including the COVID-shortened 2020 season, when the Dodgers won a franchise-record 71.7% of their regular-season games and went on to win a World Series played entirely at the Rangers' ballpark. 

            That makes Seager the only person on the 40-man roster in Texas who has been in a playoff game at Globe Life Field, the retractable roof stadium that was in its first year of use when the Dodgers played 16 of their postseason games there in 2020. They won the NL Division Series and NL Championship Series before a six-game win over Tampa Bay in the World Series, with Seager the MVP of both the World Series and NLCS. 

            Seager hit a career-low .245 overall last season,but had a career-high 33 homers in his debut season with Texas He hit 22 homers at home, where he batted .273. 

            Seager and the Rangers will be back home for the March 30 season opener against the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. 

            “Last year was so accelerated with new faces, with new everything, too. Spring was tough last year trying to fit everything in a short amount of time,"" Seager said. “I think it was just a bad recipe for trying to be prepared with a new team and new people, and stuff like that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816461,Judge: 'You never know' if 62 homers possible this year,"TAMPA, Fla, (AP) — Aaron Judge flashed a big smile when asked if he could repeat his accomplishments of last year, when he hit an American League record 62 home runs for the New York Yankees.

            ""You never know,"" he said after the Yankees’ first full-squad workout on Monday. ""I don't really like putting a number on it. I just kind of like going out there and trying to control what I can control, but you never know what could happen. So, we'll see about 62.""

            Judge was voted the American League MVP after breaking Roger Maris' AL record of 61 homers, set in 1961. Judge's 131 RBIs tied the New York Mets' Pete Alonso for most in the majors and Judge's .311 batting average was second in the AL. After becoming a free agent, Judge agreed to a $360 million, nine-year contract with the Yankees.











            “Last year was fun chasing history and having those moments,” Judge said. “Every time we play in New York I feel like you're chasing history. It's never a cakewalk in the Bronx, that's for sure. You have to enmbrace those challenges.""

            Judge slumped offensively as New York was swept in the AL Championship Series by eventual World Series champion Houston. He went 1 for 16 (.063) with no homers or RBIs. 

            New York hasn't won the World Series since 2009.

            “It bothers me, and I think it bothers the group as well,” Judge said, “Every year we don't finish what we started, it wears on us in different ways. I think every failure pushes you towards that ultimate goal.”

            After Judge agreed to the longterm deal with the Yankees, he become New York's first captain since Derek Jeter from 2003-13.

            “I'll be doing what I've been doing the past six or seven years, try and lead by example,” Judge said. “Be a voice for this team on and off the field. Keep pushing this team to the ultimate goal of bringing a championship back to New York.”

            “That's why I'm here,” Judge added. “It's one of the main reasons why I wanted to come back and wear pinstripes. Have a lot of unfinished business here. I'm looking forward to the new role but stuff doesn't change for me.""

            Notes: Judge took batting practice for the first time with the pitch clock that will be used this season. “Oh man, I completely forgot about it until about three pitches in,” Judge said. “I had to kind of check myself because I was getting into the box around eight or nine seconds. That would be strike one, strike two, strke three on me. Once we play a couple games, get a couple at-bats, guys will get used to it.” ... Judge is looking to improve his contact rate this season and has talked with other big leaguers about two-strike approaches, including mixing in the no-stride approach.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816463,"Reimer makes 26 saves, Sharks blank Kraken 4-0","SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — James Reimer stopped 26 shots for his second shutout of the season and the San Jose Sharks beat the Seattle Kraken 4-0 on Monday.

            “The team played great,” Reimer said. “We’ve had a couple of really solid games start to finish this year and this is one. Blocking shots, making hard plays, making smart plays.”

            Logan Couture, Evgeny Svechnikov, Noah Gregor and Michael Eyssimont scored for San Jose, which snapped a three-game skid. Erik Karlsson had two assists.











            “I thought from the get-go we were on our toes,” Sharks coach David Quinn said. “We were playing an aggressive style. We were on the attack. ... From top to bottom, I really liked our effort.”

            Martin Jones made 19 saves against his former team but lost his fourth straight start as Seattle was shut out for the third time this season.

            “They were quicker and harder at the puck,"" Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said. “They worked at a level that they were winning and dictating those battles.”

            After a scoreless first period, Couture was credited with his 20th goal of the season on a bizarre play midway through the second. Off a faceoff, Couture battled Seattle’s Yanni Gourde, who won the draw back toward his own goal and past Jones into the net.

            “Trying to win the faceoff, it’s unfortunate,” Gourde said. “I don’t think that Jonesy sees the puck at all. ... It’s a quick play. Doesn’t have time to react.”

            Couture became the third Shark to reach 20 goals in at least 10 seasons, joining Patrick Marleau and Joe Pavelski.

            Later in the second period, Svechnikov intercepted a pass by Vince Dunn and beat Jones on his own rebound to make it 2-0.

            Gregor added a goal with 17.2 seconds remaining in the period and Eyssimont made it 4-0 late in the third.

            “This is a really good team we just beat tonight,” Quinn said. “It’s good to see we can step up our game when we need to.”

            Seattle’s Jared McCann and Eeli Tolvanen each saw five-game point streaks come to an end as the Kraken fell to 4-2 against San Jose in their history.

            “It’s a good feeling that you can play spoiler a little bit,” Reimer said. “They’re a talented team. They’re a hard-working team. We played a suffocating, aggressive style of play tonight and just didn’t allow them to get anything going.”

            The Sharks won at home for the sixth time this season. Their 6-14-7 home record is the worst in the NHL.

            Both teams were 0 for 2 on the power play.

            NOTES: Sharks RW Timo Meier missed the game with an upper-body injury, which occurred in the second period of Saturday’s 4-2 loss to Buffalo. He is likely to return in the next game. ... C Tomas Hertl was also out for personal reasons, but is not expected to miss any further time. ... San Jose recalled RW Martin Kaut from the San Jose Barracuda of the AHL.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816464,"Love signs with Miami, moving fast after clearing waivers","Kevin Love wasted no time. He’s officially a member of the Miami Heat.

            The five-time All-Star and 15-year NBA veteran cleared waivers on Monday afternoon, then signed a contract to join the Heat for the remainder of the season not long afterward. The now-former Cleveland forward was in Miami for the signing, with plans to start working out at his new team facility right away.

            Love’s first official practice with Miami is scheduled for Thursday when the team returns from its All-Star break, and he could make his Heat debut as early as Friday at Milwaukee.











            Love is an NBA champion, an Olympic champion and a FIBA World Cup champion. He’s 42nd on the NBA’s 3-pointers made list with 1,536, which ranks 19th among players currently in the league.

            Heat center Bam Adebayo — who was hoping Love would come to Miami if the Cavaliers bought him out — said he planned to call coach Erik Spoelstra on Monday to start a conversation about how he and Love might be able to play alongside one another.

            “Spo’s smart. He’ll figure it out, how we’re going to handle things,” Adebayo told The Associated Press. “It’s exciting. We’ve got fresh legs on the team. We’ve got a guy like Kevin Love, who has been through those wars, came back from 3-1 (with Cleveland against Golden State in the 2016 NBA Finals). You’ve got a battle-tested guy like that who has won. It’s big for us.”

            Over parts of 15 NBA seasons with Cleveland and Minnesota, Love has averaged 17.2 points and 10.5 rebounds. He averaged career lows of 8.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 20 minutes per game in 41 games, almost all as a reserve, this season for Cleveland and didn’t play in the team’s final 12 games before the All-Star break.

            That's what led to the buyout talks, and ultimately, Love coming to the Heat.

            When he thinks about what adding Love means to the Heat, Adebayo draws parallels between him and two other players — current Heat forward Udonis Haslem when it comes to leadership, and former Heat center Meyers Leonard when it comes to things like an ability to space the floor, talk on defense and bring help defending the rim.

            “He’s smart, he stretches the floor, and you can learn from guy like that, having a guy like that in your corner,” Adebayo said. “Him and UD, two different walks of life, but now they’re kind of going down the same road. Having guys like that, it’ll help me tremendously. He’s an all-around great person.”

            Miami signed another big man on Monday — free agent center Cody Zeller. He has averaged 8.5 points and 6.0 rebounds in 494 games with Charlotte and Portland.

            The 6-foot-11 center was the fourth pick in the 2013 draft.

            “He's really underrated as a team player,” Adebayo said. “He's underrated for what he does. I know what he'll bring to our team will make us more successful.”

            The Heat will come out of the All-Star break seventh in the Eastern Conference at 32-27, five games back of Cleveland for the No. 4 spot. The top four teams in each conference will have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs, and the top six in each conference will avoid the play-in tournament to determine the seventh and eighth seeds.

            Travis Konecny and Tony DeAngelo each had a goal and an assist for Philadelphia. Nicolas Deslauriers also scored as the Flyers snapped a four-game losing streak.

            Mikael Backlund and Andrew Mangiapane had a goal an assist each for Calgary while Tyler Toffoli notched his team-leading 23rd.











            Ersson is the eighth goaltender in NHL history to start his career 6-0-0. 

            “It’s fun, it’s special, but I’m just trying to make my spot here on the team,” said the 23-year-old Ersson, who was a fifth-round pick of the Flyers in 2018. “Every game is huge for me here. I really have to focus on taking it game by game.”

            At the other end, the struggles continue for Jacob Markstrom, who had 18 stops. A finalist last season for the Vezina Trophy as the league’s top goaltender, Markstrom is 15-14-7 record and has not won consecutive starts since mid-December.

            Down 3-1 to start the third period, Calgary got it back to even when Toffoli scored from a sharp angle at 4:38 and, less than five minutes later after a stretch of tremendous pressure, Mangiapane rattled in a rebound.

            But the Flyers retook the lead at 11:33 on a defensive breakdown when James Van Riemsdyk got free in the slot and set up Allison at the far post for his eighth goal.

            “Big goal for us. We were bending a little bit but we didn’t break,” said Flyers coach John Tortorella. “Anytime when you’re up in the third, the tendency is to sit back a little bit or the other team pushes a little bit more. We found a way. We closed it off in the middle of the ice and blocked a lot of shots.”

            The Flames remain two points back of Minnesota, which occupies the second wild card spot in the Western Conference. The Wild also hold a game in hand.

            “We believe in each other and we’re going to keep grinding and we’re gonna keep giving our best,” said Backlund. “We’re not gonna give up, we’re gonna keep pushing ourselves here to get to where we want to be.”

            Philadelphia scored first at 16:59 when Konecny broke down the left wing, cut inside to sidestep the backcheck of Noah Hanifin, and beat Markstrom blocker side from 25 feet out.

            The Flyers made it 2-0 at 7:30 of the second when Cam York hopped out of the penalty box to corral a loose puck at center and seconds later on a 2-on-1, his centering pass to Deslauriers was deflected in.

            Backlund’s goal less than 90 seconds later cut the deficit to one, but Philadelphia restored its two-goal cushion at 11:31 when DeAngelo’s wrist shot from 40 feet out beat Markstrom over his glove.

            Calgary failed to take advantage of a Philadelphia penalty kill that had surrendered three goals on its last five man disadvantages, going 0-for-4 on the power play. The Flyers finished 0-for-1.

            LINDHOLM RETURNS

            Elias Lindholm returned to his spot as center on the Flames No. 1 line after missing last game due to the birth of his first child. Adam Ruzicka, his replacement last game, stayed in the line-up, dropping down to center the fourth line.

            Tsai and Ro will share views on economic and trade relations, regional security, digital development, and information security at the Presidential Office, Kolas said in a statement.

            Kolas said this was Khanna’s first visit to Taiwan as a member of Congress. His delegation includes other representatives, Tony Gonzales, Jake Auchincloss, and Jonathan Jackson.

            They are members of different House committees, including the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, and other committees on appropriations, foreign affairs, and agriculture, Kolas said, which fully demonstrates the solid support of Congress for Taiwan across all parties and fields.











            The spokesperson pointed out that Khanna is also a member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus and has repeatedly supported Taiwan-friendly bills and spoken out for Taiwan. Through this trip, the president will continue to deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership in various fields and continue to work with Washington to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region, she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816484,"Dudamel on New York: 'I keep that wild, wild animal Gustavo'","Gustavo Dudamel’s focus on hair was apparent on his first day at the New York Philharmonic as heir apparent.

            The 42-year-old conductor, famous for his bushy locks, magnetic personality and an ability to boost audiences, thought back to his 2007 debut with the orchestra.

            “I came here still with black hair,” Dudamel said during a news conference Monday on the stage of David Geffen Hall, “And then immediately it was a connection — it was an artistical, deep, soul connection.”











            His once-dark tresses were closely cropped and salt-and-pepper speckled. Dudamel talked about his maturation as he prepares to become music director for the 2026-27 season.

            “When I was 24 — 23, 24, 25 — it was crazy. I was a wild animal, not only because my hair was huge,” he said. “Right now, yes, I’m not anymore a young promise, but I’m still young. ... With the time, with experience, you change a lot, but I keep that wild, wild animal Gustavo that is always there — and only with less hair now.” 

            Dudamel, the first Latino to lead the oldest of the major American orchestras, recalled growing up in Venezuela.

            “My father played the trombone in a salsa band,” he said. “I wanted to play salsa. That was my dream as a kid. At the beginning, I was not dreaming about the symphony orchestra.”

            He enrolled in El Sistema, Venezuela’s music education program, at a young age. Showing charm and humor, he spoke at Monday's news conference about how he conducted the New York Philharmonic when he was 8 or 9 — while listening to recordings.

            “At home, for my family. For a good audience — for my puppets,” Dudamel said. “I rehearsed. I said, ‘This is not good.’”

            His first trip to New York was in 1995 with Venezuela’s national student orchestra.

            “We were blessed because we came for only one night,” he said. “There was a storm, a snowstorm, and we had to stay one more day.”

            Dudamel became music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra in 1999. served as principal conductor of Sweden’s Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra from 2007-12 and took over as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the 2009-10 season. He announced Feb. 7 he will give up the LA role in 2026 when he assumes the New York podium from Jaap Van Zweden, who departs after the 2023-24 season.

            Wearing a suit and dress shirt but no tie as he sat beside New York Philharmonic CEO Deborah Borda, Dudamel said the city “can enrich my soul, my spirit as an artist and as a citizen of the world.”

            Dudamel cited José Antonio Abreu, Daniel Barenboim, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle as mentors. He name-checked many predecessors as New York music director, including Leonard Bernstein, whose baton Dudamel accidently broke during his debut run.

            About 30 musicians from the New York Philharmonic attended the news conference and a reception after, welcoming Dudamel with hugs and handshakes. When he guest-conducted the orchestra last May, the players gave him Widow Jane bourbon from Brooklyn as part of the wooing.

            Dudamel, who currently calls Barcelona home, spoke fluently English and Spanish, at one point quipping: “I wanted to answer in Italian.”

            He hopes to change a mentality that classical music “is is only for rich people.”

            “Young people get afraid (of) classical, because this feels a little bit like the old car or vintage,” he said. “Music is made in the moment. Even if Beethoven wrote ... in 1807 a symphony, this music that we are playing is happening right now, so it’s not any more music from that time; it’s music from this time.”

            After at first declining to speak of Venezuela’s economic and political turmoil, Dudamel criticized his nation’s government in 2017 for suppressing protests. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro then canceled the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra’s U.S. tours.

            “I have nothing at present physically with the orchestra. We have been in contact all the time,” Dudamel said. “The orchestra is in amazing shape. I had the chance to see them a few months ago. It’s my orchestra. It’s my family. ... I hope in the near future we will be doing thousands of things again together.”

            Dudamel pushed for the 2007 establishment of the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles. At Monday's news conference, he sidestepped whether he hoped for a similar program in New York and said he would have to learn more about the community.

            He tried to avoid answering whether he would root for the Yankees or Mets.

            “Cardenales,” Dudamel said, referring to the Venezuela team from his hometown of Barquisimeto. “I played a lot of baseball. I was good.”Gustavo Dudamel’s focus on hair was apparent on his first day at the New York Philharmonic as heir apparent.The 42-year-old conductor, famous for his bushy locks, magnetic personality and an ability to boost audiences, thought back to his 2007 debut with the orchestra.“I came here still with black hair,” Dudamel said during a news conference Monday on the stage of David Geffen Hall, “And then immediately it was a connection — it was an artistical, deep, soul connection.”His once-dark tresses were closely cropped and salt-and-pepper speckled. Dudamel talked about his maturation as he prepares to become music director for the 2026-27 season.“When I was 24 — 23, 24, 25 — it was crazy. I was a wild animal, not only because my hair was huge,” he said. “Right now, yes, I’m not anymore a young promise, but I’m still young. ... With the time, with experience, you change a lot, but I keep that wild, wild animal Gustavo that is always there — and only with less hair now.”Dudamel, the first Latino to lead the oldest of the major American orchestras, recalled growing up in Venezuela.“My father played the trombone in a salsa band,” he said. “I wanted to play salsa. That was my dream as a kid. At the beginning, I was not dreaming about the symphony orchestra.”He enrolled in El Sistema, Venezuela’s music education program, at a young age. Showing charm and humor, he spoke at Monday's news conference about how he conducted the New York Philharmonic when he was 8 or 9 — while listening to recordings.“At home, for my family. For a good audience — for my puppets,” Dudamel said. “I rehearsed. I said, ‘This is not good.’”His first trip to New York was in 1995 with Venezuela’s national student orchestra.“We were blessed because we came for only one night,” he said. “There was a storm, a snowstorm, and we had to stay one more day.”Dudamel became music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra in 1999. served as principal conductor of Sweden’s Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra from 2007-12 and took over as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the 2009-10 season. He announced Feb. 7 he will give up the LA role in 2026 when he assumes the New York podium from Jaap Van Zweden, who departs after the 2023-24 season.Wearing a suit and dress shirt but no tie as he sat beside New York Philharmonic CEO Deborah Borda, Dudamel said the city “can enrich my soul, my spirit as an artist and as a citizen of the world.”Dudamel cited José Antonio Abreu, Daniel Barenboim, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle as mentors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816493,3 Austin Peay players suspended after brawl vs North Florida,"CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Three Austin Peay players were suspended for their roles in a fight at the end of its final home game of the regular season. 

            Carlos Paez and Cameron Copeland will sit out Wednesday’s game at Stetson. Kamarie Coffey will have to sit out Wednesday and on Friday for the game at Florida Gulf Coast. 

            The suspensions were announced Monday by the school and the ASUN Conference. The school said in a statement that it “will have no further comment about the matter.”











            With four seconds left in Saturday's game and Austin Peay up on North Florida by one, the Governors got possession of the ball on North Florida's end of the court and Copeland went up for what appeared to be a layup or dunk at the buzzer. A North Florida player jumped into Copeland to try to defend the shot and sent Copeland to the floor. 

            Copeland got up and pushed the player as teammates ran off the bench and a fight ensued, ending up in the first row of seats behind the basket. The teams were separated shortly after, though the ESPN broadcast noted the possibility of it continuing near the locker rooms. 

            North Florida has not announced any suspensions, the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle reported. The newspaper also said Austin Peay Director of Athletics Gerald Harrison said in a statement Saturday that he was disappointed and that “tonight’s behavior does not represent the ‘Total Gov Concept.'”

            Austin Peay is 9-20 this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816496,"Guardians top prospects Espino, DeLauter out with injuries","GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Cleveland Guardians top pitching prospect Daniel Espino will be sidelined at least two months with a right shoulder strain.

            Espino, who was tracking to possibly make his big league debut this season, reported soreness after a throwing session last month. Further tests revealed the strain. The 22-year-old will be re-evaluated later in camp, but at this point the team doesn't expect him to throw for eight weeks.

            Espino struck out 35 in 18 1/3 innings at Double-A Akron last season before being sidelined with knee tendinitis.











            “We've got to remind ourselves like, ‘OK he’s really young,’” Guardians manager Terry Francona said. “So, patience isn’t always the easiest word, but it’s the best word. So, we’re gonna do the right thing.”

            Also, outfielder Chase DeLauter, the team's top draft pick last year, will be out 4-to-5 months with a broken foot. He reported pain while running in December and imaging tests showed a fracture at the base of his toe.

            DeLauter had bone graft surgery on Jan. 10. He's in a walking boot and will be re-examined in several weeks.

            DeLauter played at James Madison. He was the No. 7 overall pick last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816497,"Chartered Association of Building Engineers’ First-ever Asia Pacific Conference ""Constructing our Future"" Chart the way forward","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 21 February 2023 - The Chartered Association of Building Engineers' (CABE), has held its inaugural Conference for Asia Pacific Region in Hong Kong. Hosted at the New Millennium Hotel and live on Zoom on 17 February 2023.   The theme for the conference was Constructing our Future and as we emerge from the pandemic it is essential that we turn our attention to the future. The construction industry is evolving so quickly, and whilst this presents many opportunities, it also presents many challenges.   Our esteemed speakers  Ar. Donald CHOI, Executive Director and CEO at Chinachem Group,  Ir. Professor Thomas CHAN, Executive Director at WSP (Asia) Limited,  Dr. Raymond YAU, General Manager, Technical Services & Sustainable Development at Swire Properties Limited,  Mr. Victor TAI JP , Under Secretary for Housing at HKSAR Government and  Ms. Clarice YU JP , Director of Buildings at HKSAR Government, identified and explored the challenges and presented future solutions and innovations. Sharing their expertise and technical knowledge with the audience they provided information that can be used to implement the necessary changes that will have a real benefit to projects, buildings and buildings users lives.   One of the biggest challenges in the construction industry is its aging workforce– over 40% of those working in the construction industry in Hong Kong are over 55 – and it was acknowledged that we need to do more to encourage young people into the industry, it is an exciting industry, an industry that is embracing modern methods of construction, new technologies and new innovation, but young people are failing to recognise just how exciting the industry is and dismissing it as a career.   It is time to change, and some of this change will come from new, innovative digital technologies – AI, BIM, drones, robotics, computer simulation tools – and as professionals we need to continue to embrace this technology. These opportunities to create a modern culture for the industry, tools that will facilitate modern decision-making, drive efficiencies, improve safety structures and introduce news methods of working will change the face of the construction industry. and digital evolution is now a must to ensure the continual success of the sector.   The speakers explored the opportunities to decarbonise commercial buildings. Looking at how to implement net zero carbon projects into the industry and how to record robust construction data that allows you to identify consumption, to benchmark and compare usage and to identify trends. The audience was reminded that it is only when we can understand what the data is telling us that we can make effective and informed decisions allowing us to create smart energy management platforms and climate resilient designs for all new development projects.   Design for Well Being in public housing was explored in detail. With proven evidence that demonstrates that when you consider the wellness of the building inhabitants you can enrich people's living standards. This should now be a critical consideration in the design of future buildings and is a key focus for CABE and its members.   The future of the construction industry is dependent on professionals collaborating, sharing knowledge and discussing solutions. Collaboration is a key part of CABE's values, and we encourage professionals throughout the industry to embrace as many opportunities to come together - to discover more, to learn more. It is only by collaboration that members and professionals will adapt to the needs of the industry and build a better future for everyone.   Our thanks go to our sponsors Wanson Construction Company Limited, Pruden, S K K (HK) Co Ltd, Shinny Performance Training Centre, and KYSS Properties Limited for their support in delivering this successful conference and gala dinner.

(TSMC) following a quarterly investor letter that cited worries about the stability of the semiconductor supply chain and a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.Amid the revelations of a sell-off of TSMC stock by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Gore's firm has followed suit by selling all 326,654 of its TSMC American depository receipts (ADRs) worth US$22.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, reported Barron's.Generation’s co-chief investment officers Miguel Nogales and Mark Ferguson in a quarterly letter to investors sent in January, expressed concerns about the stability of the semiconductor supply chain: ""Semiconductors are the canary in the coal mine. America depends heavily on East Asia, especially Taiwan, for supplies. To say that disruption to the global supply chain for semiconductors would have ‘profound consequences’ is an understatement. Markets and countries would be roiled.""They also indicated fears of an impending Chinese invasion of Taiwan: ""Depending on who you ask, you should either be worried or very worried about the future of Taiwan. Xi Jinping is clear about his long-term goals"" for the country.Gore's firm also dumped 774,248 ADR shares of Chinese company Alibaba in the fourth quarter to trim its holdings to 3.7 million ADRs. The letter argued that any conflict between China and the West ""would have huge consequences for both sides.""The investment firm expressed its wish to avoid falling into the ""Normal Angell trap,"" referring to the commentator who in 1909 predicted that a world war was impossible due to the economic interdependence of the great powers in Europe.",2023/02/21,5027,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816507,Jesuit barred from artistic activity after new abuse claims,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis' Jesuit religious order has decided to prohibit a prominent Jesuit artist whose mosaics decorate churches around the globe from pursuing his artistic activity after 15 more people came forward with fresh accusations against him of spiritual, sexual and psychological abuse.

            The Jesuits told The Associated Press that they are weighing further disciplinary measures against the Rev. Marko Ivan Rupnik following a third church investigation into allegations he used his exalted status as one of the Catholic Church’s preeminent religious artists to manipulate adult women into sexual activity.

            While defrocking technically remains an option, alternative measures could include removing him from the art community he founded in Rome and isolating him in a monk-like life of penance and prayer so he is no longer a threat to women, said Rupnik’s superior, the Rev. Johan Verschueren.











            “Naturally the first thing for me to be vigilant about is to do everything to prevent similar things from happening in the future,” Verschueren said, adding that he nevertheless hoped that Rupnik would assume responsibility for his actions.

            The Rupnik scandal exploded in December when Italian blogs and websites reported that consecrated women had complained for years about abuse only to have their claims discredited or covered up by Rupnik’s superiors. The case has remained a problem for the Vatican and the Jesuits because of suspicions that the charismatic Slovene priest received preferential treatment by the Holy See, where a Jesuit pope reigns and Jesuit priests help run the sex abuse office.

            Verschueren briefed AP and La Repubblica newspaper ahead of the release Tuesday of conclusions of a new investigation into Rupnik opened in December, after the Jesuits reluctantly admitted Rupnik had been declared excommunicated in 2020 for having committed one of the gravest crimes in church law -- using the confessional to absolve a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity — but had repented and had the sanction quickly removed.

            The next year, Rupnik was accused by nine women of having sexually, psychologically and spiritually abused them in the 1990s at a community he co-founded in Slovenia. Even though the Jesuits recommended a church trial, the Vatican’s sex abuse office refused to waive the statute of limitations and declared the crimes too old to prosecute.

            The outcome underscored how the Catholic hierarchy routinely refuses to consider spiritual and sexual abuse of adult women as a crime that must be punished, but rather a mere lapse of priestly chastity that can be forgiven, without considering the trauma it causes victims.

            
                Amid the scandal, the Jesuits invited anyone with other claims against Rupnik to come forward and 15 people did: 14 women and one man, Verschueren told AP and La Repubblica. The Jesuits’ investigative team determined their claims, which date from 1985-2018, were credible and confirmed a “pattern” of psychological, sexual and spiritual abuse, and abuse of conscience.

            Based on the 15 new claims, Verschueren said he reaffirmed previous bans on hearing confessions or giving spiritual direction, and on leaving the Rome area without permission. But additionally, Rupnik will now be prohibited from exercising his artistic activity, Verschueren said, suggesting that his interactions with people in creating his mosaics became a source of abusive relationships.

            “I only take measures when there are reasons for risk,” he said.

            Rupnik hasn’t responded to the latest allegations: He hasn't responded to requests for interviews, declined to speak with the investigative team and Verschueren said his next task would be to meet with Rupnik to hear his side, insisting that he be given the right to defend himself.

            Verschueren said he would decide on definitive disciplinary measures based on how Rupnik responds, expressing hope that he assumes responsibility for his actions and agrees to undergo psychological therapy.

            “I believe, I hope we can still arrive at a process of finding the truth,” he said. “Only when we enter into the truth with all those involved can we really resolve the problem -- the problem of the victims and entering into a process of reparation with them, but also for him.""

            He acknowledged there are some who want Rupnik removed from the priesthood, given the serial nature of his abuse and more than two dozen victims already identified. But Verschueren noted that kicking Rupnik out of the Jesuits would remove all controls on him, increasing chances that he could continue to be a threat.

            The new accusations don't concern sacramental abuse that would justify forwarding the case to the Vatican’s sex abuse office, known as the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. Verschueren said he was “relieved” that the Dicastery wouldn’t be involved, given its previous decision to not waive the statute of limitations on the 2021 case.

            In a Jan. 24 interview with AP, Pope Francis acknowledged he always waives the statute of limitations for abuse of children cases, but not those involving adults. In that same interview, Francis denied he had anything to do with the Rupnik case other than to intervene on a procedural note.

            In addition to the abuse investigation, a theologian was brought in to study Rupnik’s writings and found some potentially “transgressive” problems with conferences Rupnik gave on sexuality in the 1980s and 1990s, Verschueren said.

            “The theologian I consulted didn't want to call it a heresy, but said it gave an opening to legitimize certain actions that aren’t correct,” he said.

            He denied Rupnik's art was irrevocably tainted, likening it to authors who write great books but are themselves flawed.

            “I asked myself, Johan, is it hard to pray before these mosaics? My response is no,"" he said of Rupnik's chapel mosaics at the Jesuit headquarters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816508,"Dominic Thiem loses at Rio Open, falling to 1-2 in 2023","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Dominic Thiem is once again fighting through his matches and enjoying himself, but confidence is admittedly still lacking for the 29-year-old.

            Thiem lost in the first round of the Rio Open on Monday, falling to Thiago Monteiro 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (2).

            The former world No. 3 and 2020 U.S. Open champion, who came in ranked at No. 96 after battling right wrist and abdominal injuries, fell to 1-2 on the year. He missed the Australian Open and got his first win last week at Buenos Aires, Argentina.











            “I was not convinced enough. It is a so-so leg of confidence. A leg of one match this year,” Thiem said. “Today was a little bit better than I did in Buenos Aires. But still when I step in it is too many mistakes. I need to find the right timing again, find myself closer at the baseline again.”

            Thiem, who won the Rio Open in 2017, dropped the first set against the 83rd-ranked Monteiro in 27 minutes, with the Austrian making a series of unforced errors.

            Thiem righted himself in the second set, relying on his forehand and his patience on the baseline. After a back-and-forth third set, the Brazilian won the tiebreaker comfortably to close out the 2-hour, 46-minute match.

            “I was never injured before. I didn’t know how long it would take. It is taking as long as it takes. I am not stressing out,” Thiem said. “I have the feeling I was defining myself way too long with results. It is very unhealthy, especially mentally, if I define myself only with results.”

            Monteiro will next face either second-seeded Cameron Norrie or Juan Manuel Cerundolo in the clay-court tournament.

            Defending champion and second-ranked Carlos Alcaraz faces Mateus Alves in the first round on Tuesday.

            The heritage brand is best known for its elegant, functional trench coats invented during World War I. But Lee, who joined Burberry in September, took the fashion house in a brand-new direction with a debut collection featuring faux fur and feathers, slogan T-shirts and playful duck prints.

            The 37-year-old British designer was credited with revitalizing Italian luxury brand Bottega Veneta with hugely popular accessories like shoes and handbags during his tenure there, and many in the fashion industry were keen to know if he could work the same magic at Burberry.











            Burberry CEO Jonathan Akeroyd said last year that he was banking on Lee's flair to significantly grow the brand's accessories sales and “dial up on Britishness in a modern way.”

            At Monday's show, the brand's signature check pattern appeared in purple, bottle green and maroon on everything from men's suits to knitwear, skirts, tights and woolly scarves.

            Lee seemed to underline a theme of coziness in the face of British weather: One model was draped in a large white blanket emblazoned with the brand's heritage equestrian knight design, and many of the models clutched hot water bottles with a check print that matched their outfits. Dramatic, oversized faux fur hats and bags adorned with feathers and fur also featured prominently. 

            Male models wore low-slung, baggy trousers worn with skin-tight polo neck tops, and silver chains and hardware, paired with a red and black palette, hinted at a punk-inspired aesthetic. But there were humorous touches, too, such as a woolly trapper hat topped with a knitted duck head. 

            The show drew celebrities including film director Baz Luhrmann, rapper Stormzy and models Naomi Campbell and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to its front row. 

            Burberry is traditionally the biggest draw at London Fashion Week, which also showcases catwalk shows by designers including Christopher Kane, Erdem, Emilia Wickstead and Roksanda Ilincic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816511,Report: Westbrook to sign with Clippers after Jazz waive him,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Russell Westbrook was waived by the Utah Jazz on Monday and the nine-time All-Star is expected to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers, according to a published report.

            The 34-year-old guard was acquired by the Jazz from the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 10. He averaged 15.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.1 assists in 28.7 minutes per game in a rocky tenure with the Lakers.

            ESPN reported that Westbrook's agent, Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports, told the outlet he will sign with the Clippers after completing a contract buyout on the remaining $47 million he's owed on his expiring deal.











            Schwartz did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press. The Clippers had no comment.

            The move would reunite Westbrook with Paul George, his former teammate in Oklahoma City. It also allows Westbrook to stay in Los Angeles. He is from the area and starred at UCLA.

            
                George had lobbied recently for the Clippers to land Westbrook, who won the MVP in 2017 with the Thunder.

            “I’m a big believer and a fan of what Russ’ work is, having one of my best seasons in my career alongside of him. I’ve seen what he can do night in and night out,” George said. “I really think he can improve the team. He’s such a big talent. He rebounds, he finds guys, he makes the game easy for everyone. I think he will come in, he will mesh and he’ll figure out how we play and he’ll adjust to it.”

            Westbrook would join a Clippers team that is fourth in the Western Conference at 33-28 coming out of the All-Star break.

            The Lakers traded Westbrook and a 2027 first-round draft pick to the Jazz as part of a three-team deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816512,"US urges UN to condemn North Korea; China, Russia blame US","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States and its allies urged the U.N. Security Council on Monday to condemn North Korea’s unlawful ballistic missile launches, but China and Russia blamed the U.S. for escalating tensions with stepped-up military exercises targeting Pyongyang.

            At the emergency meeting, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that the United States will propose a presidential statement, saying at a minimum all 15 members should be agreeable to condemning the North’s unprecedented missile launches, to urging Pyongyang to comply with U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions, and “to engage in meaningful dialogue.”

            A presidential statement from the Security Council requires the support of all its members, including North Korea's closest allies, China and Russia.











            Thomas-Greenfield said the United States condemns North Korea’s firing of two short-range ballistic missiles Monday following the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile Saturday “in the strongest terms” as “flagrant violations” of the council’s ban on the country's ballistic missile launches. 

            The launches and North Korea’s threatening rhetoric are undermining international peace and security, Thomas-Greenfield said.

            And she warned the council that its silence and failure to condemn the North’s missile activities “leads to irrelevance.”

            But Pyongyang's allies China and Russia countered that what’s needed now is dialogue between North Korea and the Biden administration, a de-escalation of military exercises, an easing of sanctions on North Korea, and approval of a resolution they circulated in November 2021 aimed at resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 

            That resolution urges the Security Council to end a host of sanctions against North Korea and calls on the U.S. and North Korea to resume dialogue and consider taking steps to reduce tensions and the risk of military confrontation including by adopting a declaration or peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War. The war ended with an armistice, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war.

            China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dai Bing said joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises “on a higher level and a bigger scale,” the deployment of U.S. strategic assets, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s high-profile visit to Seoul and Tokyo two weeks ago, are “”highly provocative” to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, “and aggravate a sense of insecurity.”

            “Since the U.S. has repeatedly expressed its willingness to unconditionally engage in dialogue with the DPRK, it should take tangible steps to start and maintain a dialogue,” he said. “Exclusively pursuing and piling on sanctions will only lead to a dead end.”

            Russia’s deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told the council North Korea is responding with missile tests to “the unprecedented military maneuvers in the region under the United States umbrella which are clearly anti-Pyongyang in nature.”

            Japan’s U.N. Ambassador Kimihiro Ishikane, whose country called the emergency meeting, told the council that Saturday’s ICBM fell in the Japan's exclusive economic zone just 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Hokkaido, where people could see it falling from the sky.

            “I assume we can all imagine how terrifying it must have been to see a missile flying to you,” he said, stressing that it endangered vessels and aircraft and was “an act of intimidation and threatening by force.”

            To those who contend that Security Council meetings provoke North Korea “and hence we should remain silent,” Ishikane retorted that remaining silent “will only encourage rule-breakers to write the playbook as they like.” 

            After the council meeting, Thomas-Greenfield, read a statement on behalf of 10 council nations and South Korea, surrounded by their ambassadors, strongly condemning the latest missile launches and urging the other five council nations to join in condemning “the DPRK’s irresponsible behavior.”

            The 11 countries — Albania, Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, U.S. and South Korea — “remain fully committed to diplomacy and continue to call on the DPRK to return to dialogue,” the statement said.

            “But we will not stay silent as the DPRK advances its unlawful nuclear and missile capabilities, threatening international peace and security,” their statement said.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States and its allies urged the U.N. Security Council on Monday to condemn North Korea’s unlawful ballistic missile launches, but China and Russia blamed the U.S. for escalating tensions with stepped-up military exercises targeting Pyongyang.At the emergency meeting, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that the United States will propose a presidential statement, saying at a minimum all 15 members should be agreeable to condemning the North’s unprecedented missile launches, to urging Pyongyang to comply with U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions, and “to engage in meaningful dialogue.”A presidential statement from the Security Council requires the support of all its members, including North Korea's closest allies, China and Russia.Thomas-Greenfield said the United States condemns North Korea’s firing of two short-range ballistic missiles Monday following the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile Saturday “in the strongest terms” as “flagrant violations” of the council’s ban on the country's ballistic missile launches.The launches and North Korea’s threatening rhetoric are undermining international peace and security, Thomas-Greenfield said.And she warned the council that its silence and failure to condemn the North’s missile activities “leads to irrelevance.”But Pyongyang's allies China and Russia countered that what’s needed now is dialogue between North Korea and the Biden administration, a de-escalation of military exercises, an easing of sanctions on North Korea, and approval of a resolution they circulated in November 2021 aimed at resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula.That resolution urges the Security Council to end a host of sanctions against North Korea and calls on the U.S. and North Korea to resume dialogue and consider taking steps to reduce tensions and the risk of military confrontation including by adopting a declaration or peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War. The war ended with an armistice, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war.China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dai Bing said joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises “on a higher level and a bigger scale,” the deployment of U.S. strategic assets, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s high-profile visit to Seoul and Tokyo two weeks ago, are “”highly provocative” to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, “and aggravate a sense of insecurity.”“Since the U.S. has repeatedly expressed its willingness to unconditionally engage in dialogue with the DPRK, it should take tangible steps to start and maintain a dialogue,” he said. “Exclusively pursuing and piling on sanctions will only lead to a dead end.”Russia’s deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told the council North Korea is responding with missile tests to “the unprecedented military maneuvers in the region under the United States umbrella which are clearly anti-Pyongyang in nature.”Japan’s U.N. Ambassador Kimihiro Ishikane, whose country called the emergency meeting, told the council that Saturday’s ICBM fell in the Japan's exclusive economic zone just 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Hokkaido, where people could see it falling from the sky.“I assume we can all imagine how terrifying it must have been to see a missile flying to you,” he said, stressing that it endangered vessels and aircraft and was “an act of intimidation and threatening by force.”To those who contend that Security Council meetings provoke North Korea “and hence we should remain silent,” Ishikane retorted that remaining silent “will only encourage rule-breakers to write the playbook as they like.”After the council meeting, Thomas-Greenfield, read a statement on behalf of 10 council nations and South Korea, surrounded by their ambassadors, strongly condemning the latest missile launches and urging the other five council nations to join in condemning “the DPRK’s irresponsible behavior.”The 11 countries — Albania, Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, U.S. and South Korea — “remain fully committed to diplomacy and continue to call on the DPRK to return to dialogue,” the statement said.“But we will not stay silent as the DPRK advances its unlawful nuclear and missile capabilities, threatening international peace and security,” their statement said.",2023/02/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816523,Tai Sang Land Development Celebrates Golden Jubilee,"Hong Kong-Rooted．Innovation-Driven．Future-Focused        50th anniversary celebrations include F&B and hotel accommodation giveaways   HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 21 February 2023 - Tai Sang Land Development Limited (Tai Sang Land; Stock Code: 89, Listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited) today celebrates its 50th anniversary as a listed company. Tai Sang Land has sailed through the peaks and troughs alongside Hong Kong for over half a century. In honour of its Golden Jubilee and many more fruitful years to come, the Company is launching a series of giveaways for Hong Kong residents to enjoy free drinks and stays at the Arca hotel in Wong Chuk Hang.              Rooted in Hong Kong; devoted to Hong Kong   Deeply rooted in Hong Kong for over 50 years, Tai Sang Land strongly values stability while also seeking to excel by making proactive changes. It continuously endeavours to develop a wide variety of quality property projects and services, advancing together with the economy of Hong Kong. ""Tai Sang Land Development Limited"" was founded by the late Mr. Ma Kam Chan, and its shares were listed on the Far East Exchange Limited and the Kam Ngan Stock Exchange Limited with a net asset value of approximately HK$160 million on 21st February 1973.   As the Hong Kong economy took off in the 1970s and 1980s, property demand also skyrocketed. Tai Sang Land developed an array of residential, industrial and warehouse, and commercial properties in the districts of North Point, Sai Wan, Aberdeen, Stanley, Kwun Tong and Kwai Chung, etc. Tai Sang Land also expanded into such other businesses as insurance and, in particular, because manufacturing and trading were the pillars of the Hong Kong economy at the time, Tai Sang Land also aggressively expanded into warehousing services, with a network occupying over 1 million square feet of warehouse space to cover the whole territory, and became the single largest operator of warehousing services at the time. Expanding into the international market, in the mid-1980s Tai Sang Land also built Montgomery Plaza, a high-rise office tower constructed atop a historical landmark in San Francisco, California, USA.   Striving for excellence through diversifying business streams    As the economy of Hong Kong gradually moved from manufacturing towards commercialisation in the late 1980s and 1990s, Tai Sang Land also shifted its strategies. Apart from purchasing residential land plots on The Peak, developing a composite building in Sai Wan and a luxury residential project, Floral Villas, in Sai Kung; as well as an industrial building in Shatin for sale and for leasing purposes, the Company gradually moved its strategy towards investment properties, and has amalgamated a quality property portfolio comprising residential, commercial, offices, warehouses and industrial properties as long-term holdings. Towards the end of the 1990s and end of the millennium, the Company progressively optimised and renovated its investment properties in order to enhance values. It carried out a substantial enhancement project for Tai Sang Container and Godown Centre in 2012 and rebranded it as Gateway ts, successfully transforming the property into a mixed-use building to attract professional and high-quality tenants.   Hong Kong's tourism industry stepped into its golden age in 2004-2014, when the number of inbound visitors ballooned from some 21.8 million in 2004 to 60.83 million per annum in 2014. Riding on this momentum and the accelerated market demand, Tai Sang Land expanded into the hospitality industry with some floors of Hollywood Centre in Sheung Wan as its first hotel project, putting it into service in 2011. In order to reposition itself in the hospitality field, Tai Sang Land established Yulan Group Limited to provide a new standard in modern hospitality. Since 2019, Yulan Group has completed another enhancement project for the hotel at Hollywood Centre and rebranded it as the Figo in 2020, and also developed the Arca in 2021, by demolishing an industrial building, as a reflection of its service diversification and continual advancement.   Mr William Ma, Chairman and Chief Executive of Tai Sang Land Development Limited, said: ""Upholding our determination to pursue excellence amidst steady growth, Tai Sang Land has walked hand-in-hand with Hong Kong for over 50 years, with its net worth rising 55 times over the years (to HK$9.03 billion as of 30th June 2022). Looking ahead, we are fully optimistic about the future of Hong Kong and Hong Kong will remain ""Home"" for Tai Sang Land. There will be many mega infrastructure development schemes coming up in Hong Kong. We will remain dedicated to exploring business opportunities, and we will stand strong in delivering exceptional service to exceed expectations, to cater to the ever-changing market demand, and to uphold and enhance values.""

Chuang said a foreigner seated in the back seat had refused to pay the fare, according to LTN.Following an investigation, police found that after a night of drinking in New Taipei City's Yingge District, a 31-year-old Indonesian migrant worker identified as Ah He (阿合) got into Chuang's taxi close to the Taoyuan railway station. However, Ah He was so intoxicated that he vomited inside the taxi halfway to his destination.Chuang then asked Ah He to pay an extra NT$3,000 cleaning fee. Due to his inebriated state and an inability to communicate in Mandarin, Ah He did not understand why he was expected to pay the extra NT$3,000 and began arguing with Chuang.As the argument dragged on, the taxi fare rose from NT$150 to NT$300. During the confrontation, Ah He out of frustration, reportedly said, ""You can just send me back to Indonesia!""After Chuang took Ah He to the police station, officers were able to communicate with him and persuade him to pay the fine. However, he said that he was only carrying NT$1,000.The police then contacted Ah He's employer, who agreed to coordinate with Chuang on providing compensation and the dispute was successfully resolved.",2023/02/21,3578,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816567,Russia plans Belarus 'absorption' by 2030 — media reports,"Russia is planning to absorb neighboring Belarus by 2030, according to a document allegedly leaked from Russia's presidential administration.The document was obtained and reported on by an international consortium of journalists from news organizations including Yahoo News and Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung.The document, which reportedly dates back to the summer of 2021, sets out a plan to infiltrate Belarus politically, economically and militarily. Plans are set out on different stages: short-term or until 2022, medium-term or until 2025 and long-term, meaning 2030.The long-term plan translates into the formation of a common ""union state"" under Russian leadership.Both countries are already formally part of a so-called ""union state,"" as per a 1999 agreement. The agreement sets a legal basis for integration between the two countries.However, media outlets which obtained the document in question suggest Russia's plans are more about annexing Belarus by 2030.Entitled ""Strategic Goals of the Russian Federation in Belarus,"" the 17-page document speaks of pushing back Western influence in the region and fortification against NATO.Should such a plan ever materialize, Russia would become immediate neighbors with Lithuania and Poland, two NATO and European Union members.Once part of the former Soviet Union, Belarus maintained its strong ties with Russia after the collapse of the Union thanks to the policies of Alexander Lukashenko, who has presided over the country since 1994.The country's last elections in 2020 were contested and met with the jailing of opposition candidates and nationwide protests after Lukashenko declared himself victor. Thousands were arrested in an ensuing crackdown.The US and European Union responded by no longer recognizing Lukashenko as the country's president.Both Yahoo News and Süddeutsche Zeitung said they spoke to analysts and experts who confirmed the authenticity of the document.An unnamed Western official was cited by Yahoo News as saying the document was prepared by the Presidential Directorate for Cross-Border Cooperation.The subdivision of Putin's Presidential Administration was set up in October 2018. The source told Yahoo News that the subdivision was tasked with proposing new strategies to achieve Russia's strategic goals in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova.An unnamed Western intelligence officer told Yahoo News the Russian intelligence services and the armed forces all contributed to the plan.Material from the AFP news agency contriibuted to this report.Edited by: Amanda Rivkin",2023/02/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816574,AP source: Bucks give Meyers Leonard chance to resume career,"MIAMI (AP) — Meyers Leonard is getting another chance at the NBA, nearly two years after he used an antisemitic slur while playing a video game that was being livestreamed.

            A person with knowledge of the negotiations said Leonard and the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed on a 10-day contract, opening the door for the 7-foot center to play in an NBA game for the first time since January 2021. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.

            ESPN first reported the agreement between Leonard and the Bucks.











            Leonard's career was jeopardized and his reputation was seriously damaged on March 8, 2021, when it was discovered that he used a slur while playing an online game as others watched on a livestream. The Heat told him to stay away from the team indefinitely, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined him $50,000 and Miami eventually traded him to Oklahoma City.

            Leonard said then that he knew he'd used a bad term but was unaware of the term's meaning. In an apology, he said, “my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong.” He immediately began scheduling meetings with Holocaust survivors, rabbis in South Florida and other community leaders.

            That was the start of him spending much of the last two years trying to atone for what he did — almost all of it quietly, in a deliberate effort to quash any notion his work was simply done to get positive media coverage. He has spoken and worked with several Jewish groups on various things, put on a number of basketball camps for Jewish children and apologized countless times for what he said and his ignorance about what the term meant.

            Leonard was not going to play in the remainder of that 2020-21 season after suffering a shoulder injury in January 2021, two months before the incident. He has since dealt with ankle and other issues but has been working toward an NBA return for months.

            For the Bucks, the move carries almost no risk. They'll get 10 days to see if Leonard — who was with Miami for its run to the 2020 NBA Finals in the restart bubble at Walt Disney World — can help with their playoff push.

            Most players and coaches chose to kneel in that bubble for the playing of the U.S. and Canadian national anthems when the NBA season resumed. Leonard stood instead, his hand over his heart, and did so with the support of Heat teammates.

            “I am a compassionate human being and I truly love all people,” Leonard told the AP at the time.

            For his career, Leonard has averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds on 48% shooting, 39% from 3-point range.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMIAMI (AP) — Meyers Leonard is getting another chance at the NBA, nearly two years after he used an antisemitic slur while playing a video game that was being livestreamed.A person with knowledge of the negotiations said Leonard and the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed on a 10-day contract, opening the door for the 7-foot center to play in an NBA game for the first time since January 2021. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.ESPN first reported the agreement between Leonard and the Bucks.Leonard's career was jeopardized and his reputation was seriously damaged on March 8, 2021, when it was discovered that he used a slur while playing an online game as others watched on a livestream. The Heat told him to stay away from the team indefinitely, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined him $50,000 and Miami eventually traded him to Oklahoma City.Leonard said then that he knew he'd used a bad term but was unaware of the term's meaning. In an apology, he said, “my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong.” He immediately began scheduling meetings with Holocaust survivors, rabbis in South Florida and other community leaders.That was the start of him spending much of the last two years trying to atone for what he did — almost all of it quietly, in a deliberate effort to quash any notion his work was simply done to get positive media coverage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816578,"Duggan prepping for future, not yet reflecting on TCU career","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Max Duggan really hasn't had time to reflect on his career at TCU, where the four-year starting quarterback's final snap came in the national championship game. The Heisman Trophy runner-up hasn't even stopped throwing while getting ready for the NFL combine and draft. 

            The beloved TCU quarterback, who has been in Southern California training since a few days after the national title game loss, was back in Fort Worth on Monday night for the presentation of the Davey O'Brien Award — whose namesake is the school's only Heisman Trophy winner, when leading the Horned Frogs to an undefeated season and their only AP national title in 1938. 

            “It means so much to our program, for TCU, because we obviously understand what Davey O’Brien did for TCU, what he did for just college football,” said Duggan, the first TCU player to win the award given annually to a top quarterback. “There’s so much pride for that he did for our program, and building it up and setting a milestone for TCU programs to strive for.”











            While Duggan and the Horned Frogs lost a lopsided national championship game to Georgia, they tied a school record with 13 wins by beating Michigan in the College Football Playoff semifinal Fiesta Bowl. 

            ""I probably haven’t even done a whole time of reflecting on what happened this season,” he said. “Obviously we’re disappointed what happened in the national championship game. ... But that doesn’t take away from the special season that we had as a program, to be able to share that with players, coaching staff, our fans, the city of Fort Worth and TCU. People are going to remember this season for a long time.”

            Even though he still had another season of eligibility available after starting 43 games for TCU, Duggan decided after extended conversations with his family and coach Sonny Dykes that it was the right time to make himself available for the NFL draft. He graduated from TCU's business school in December. 

            Duggan was at the Senior Bowl and now is among several draft prospects working in California with former NFL quarterback Jordan Palmer. The NFL combine starts next week, before TCU's pro day at the end of March and the draft in late April. 

            Most draft projections have Duggan being a late-round pick on the third and final day. That doesn't bother him. 

            “You’ve just got to have one team that, you know, falls in love with you, that likes your game, likes you as a person, what you do on and off the field. And I think that’s what really matters in my eyes,"" he said. ""I understand I’m not one of the top guys.”

            Four former Big 12 quarterbacks started games in the NFL playoffs this season, including both Super Bowl starters: MVP Patrick Mahomes of the champion Kansas City Chiefs, and Heisman Trophy runner-up Jalen Hurts for the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles. The others were seventh-round draft picks last year.

            Former Kansas State quarterback Skylar Thompson started a playoff game for Miami. Former Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy, the very last player selected in the draft, was the starter for San Francisco as the 49ers made it to the NFC title game. 

            “I’ve been able to compete the last couple of years with Brock, Skylar and Jalen. To see them go have success, you see what type of league that the Big 12 is,” Duggan said. “I think you’ve seen them, whether they are kind of picks towards the end of the draft, they seem to have success, so it’s been fun to watch them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816591,Migrant workers in Taiwan protest 'discriminatory' border policy,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of migrant workers and activists gathered on Monday (Feb. 20) outside Taiwan’s Executive Yuan to protest what they call discriminatory entry restrictions that apply only to them.Migrant workers reported border reentry issues that do not affect white-collar migrant workers, students, and business visitors who hold an Alien Residence Permit (ARC), who can currently enter Taiwan under the “0+7” epidemic prevention scheme.Most ARC holding migrant workers are still required to book seven days stay in a designated quarantine hotel, and those who are not must upload evidence of having a single room with a separate bathroom available for quarantine to a government website prior to entry. All migrant workers must also apply for a separate reentry permit.Tommie, a migrant factory worker in Taoyuan from the Philippines, said that the cost of the quarantine hotel, fees, and plane ticket amounted to two months of his basic salary (about NT$25,000 or US$820 per month), which was unaffordable. He also said that he did not use his hotel for the full seven days, but was denied a refund because he had not purchased an additional insurance policy.“I only used the hotel for two days, but my broker said I cannot refund the hotel payment…,” Tommie said. “(These) kind of rules (are the) broker taking advantage (of us) to earn more money from the migrant worker.”In a statement released on Monday (Feb. 20), the Ministry of Labor said that restrictions on migrant workers were the same as Taiwan nationals or tourists entering the country from Southeast Asia.Wu Jing-ru (吳靜如), a researcher from the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA), said that this was not accurate, and that the process migrant workers and returning Taiwanese from Southeast Asia have to go through is fundamentally different.“It is called a common process, but in detail, every step is different from the others’, like tourists or local people,” Wu said. She pointed to the fact that unlike others entering the country from the same regions, migrant workers have to first upload evidence of a suitable quarantine facility, and apply for reentry permits.Despite home quarantine being an option, Wu says that most migrant workers do not have access to a single private room that has its own bathroom, and they still have to show evidence of where they will stay, regardless of the chosen option, something no other ARC holders have to do. “If family members come back from abroad, they do not have to do this, so why should there be this special kind of regulation and discrimination toward migrant workers,” Wu said.Yvonne, also from the Philippines, is an elder care worker, and said she felt in practice the quarantine system is not effective for preventing the spread of COVID. She said that a swab test was all that was required to leave the quarantine hotel during the seven-day period, rendering the whole exercise pointless.Yvonne said that both she and her employer spent a lot of time and money adhering to the government rules, and that it was not only discriminatory to her, but her employer too.Wu said that while TIWA does help some migrant workers navigate these issues, the Mandarin language only government websites mean nearly all of migrant workers rely on their employers or brokers, who often charge high fees. The majority are not aware help is available, so they can not access it.Wu does not think the government has any plans to change these regulations any time soon. “Since they put out this press release saying that its all the same (for incoming tourists and migrant workers,) I don’t think they plan to,” she said.The Ministry of Labor statement said that between October 2022 and February, over 100,000 migrant workers had entered the country, returning to pre-pandemic levels.",2023/02/21,4626,Society

            Kyle Connor and Pierre-Luc Dubois also scored for the Jets, who are 6-3-0 in their past nine visits to Madison Square Garden. Connor, Josh Morrissey and Mason Appleton each had two assists for Winnipeg, which had lost two straight to open a four-game trip.

            “We needed this win tonight,'' Dubois said. ”Results matter more than anything else.""











            Hellebuyck, playing on back-to-back nights after a 4-2 loss at New Jersey on Sunday, stopped all 20 shots he faced in the first period and 30 more the rest of the way to improve to 26-16-1. 

            “It was a good clean game, a good team game,'' Hellebuyck said. ”We'll take wins any way they come.""

            Vincent Trocheck scored for the Rangers, who lost in regulation for the first time since Jan. 19 when they fell 3-1 at home to Boston. New York was 8-0-2 in their previous 10 games. Igor Shesterkin finished with 17 saves.

            “Every once in a while you run into a goalie that's standing on his head,” Trocheck said of Hellebuyck's stellar performance. “You tip your hat to him.""

            Dubois opened the scoring on the power play at 5:12 of the first, deflecting a shot by Morrissey past Shesterkin for his 24th goal.

            Scheifele made it 2-0 with 3:28 left in the opening period, poking the puck past Shesterkin. 

            The Rangers outshot the Jets 20-9 in the first period and finished with a 51-21 edge. Hellebuyck made two dazzling saves on Rangers forward Chris Kreider in the third period, including a sterling glove stop with just over eight minutes remaining. 

            “He was outstanding tonight,″ Jets coach Rick Bowness said. ”We needed timely saves and we got them.”

            In the second, the Rangers failed to convert on two early power-play chances before the Jets increased the lead to 3-0 when Connor scored his 26th goal at 6:04.

            “They capitalized on their chances and we just didn't put ours in,"" said Rangers captain Jacob Trouba, who played six seasons for Winnipeg before he was traded to the Rangers in June 2019. ”It was just one of those games.""

            Morrissey, who also had an assist on Connor's goal, is second on the Jets with 58 points and third in scoring among NHL defensemen behind San Jose’s Erik Karlsson and Buffalo’s Rasmus Dahlin. 

            The 27-year-old Morrissey also broke Dustin Byfuglien’s franchise record for points in a season (56) by a defenseman with his assist on Dubois' goal. The current Jets franchise history including 11 years as the Atlanta Thrashers before the team relocated to Winnipeg for the 2011-12 campaign.

            “To do this here at Madison Square Garden is special,'' Morrissey said. ”It's a function of us having a great team and great players here.""

            Trocheck ended Hellebuyck’s shutout bid at the 11-minute mark of the second with his 16th goal. Vladimir Tarasenko had the lone assist.

            Scheifele scored his second goal of the game and team-leading 34th of the season with a backhand with 4:31 left in the third. Scheifele also scored twice in the previous game between the teams this season, a 4-1 Jets victory in Winnipeg on Oct. 14.

            “We had 50 shots. Overall we played a good hockey game and didn't win,'' Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said. ”Hellebuyck was great. You've got to give the other team credit.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816598,Islanders rally in the third for 4-2 win over Penguins,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — The New York Islanders are running out of healthy bodies. 

            They're not running out of ways to stun the Pittsburgh Penguins. 

            Bo Horvat and Anders Lee scored less than 2 minutes apart in the third period as New York rallied for a 4-2 victory over the rattled Penguins on Monday.











            The Islanders pulled off their second late comeback over the Penguins in three days when Horvat beat Tristan Jarry to the short side with 11:26 remaining to tie it. Jarry turned it over behind the Pittsburgh net moments later, kickstarting a sequence that ended with Lee jamming it home to give the injury-ravaged Islanders their first lead.

            Brock Nelson's second goal of the game, an empty-netter with 25 seconds left after the Islanders weathered serious pressure, sealed it for New York.

            “That’s a team effort. That’s a full-team win,” Lee said. ""Really proud of our guys tonight. It could’ve gone another way and we pushed through, we took control and we were able to come out with just a big win.”

            Ilya Sorokin made 45 saves for New York and singlehandedly kept the Islanders in the game over the first two periods while the Penguins dominated, just as they did at Nassau Coliseum on Friday.

            And just like the last game, the Islanders found a way in the third despite an injured list that includes center Mat Barzal and forwards Josh Bailey, JP Pageau and Cal Clutterbuck. New York leapfrogged Pittsburgh in the crowded race for the Eastern Conference's two wild-card spots after sending the Penguins to a third straight loss.

            “Belief,"" Horvat said. ""We believe we have done it before and we believed we could do it again. Especially in the second half of that second period ... we were starting to gain momentum. I think it just carried on to the third period there.”

            Jarry, who hadn't been in net since Jan. 22 due to an upper-body injury, played well for the first 45-plus minutes before a pair of miscues dropped Pittsburgh to 0-9 in its last nine games against Metropolitan Division opponents. Jarry finished with 28 saves.

            “It was a similar circumstance to the way the game was played on Long Island,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""Instead of finding a way to win, we found a way to lose. We made a couple of mistakes that ended up in the back of our net.”

            Jake Guentzel scored his 24th for the Penguins. Jason Zucker's 16th goal of the season gave Pittsburgh a 2-1 lead just past the game's midway point.

            The Penguins had their way for much of the night and showed a spark they've lacked for long stretches during their uneven season.

            Pittsburgh led 2-1 late in the second period when all 10 skaters on the ice (minus the goaltenders) exchanged words and occasional punches, with Penguin stars Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in the thick of things.

            So was Zucker, who has spent a large portion of the season serving as the team’s emotional fulcrum. The 5-foot-11 Zucker and 6-5 New York forward Ross Johnston needed to be separated by officials, starting a parade to the penalty box that included all non-goaltenders on the ice.

            The scrum and the sight of an entire line in the box brought PPG Paints Arena to life. The momentum didn't last.

            Horvat's flip from just above the goal line tied it and Jarry's decision to blindly pass the puck from behind his net brought to mind a similar play against the Islanders two years ago that led directly to an overtime goal by New York in a playoff series the Islanders would go on to win.

            The postseason is still eight weeks out. Pittsburgh finds itself in the unusual position of trying to scratch its way into the field, something the franchise has rarely had during its run of 16 straight playoff appearances.

            “We understand every game is important,” Malkin said. ""Jarry’s back. Just stay focused. Stay positive. Support each other. It’s not over. We need to win a lot. I think we’ll be fine.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816599,GEODIS partners with Volvo Australia to pilot electric trucks for freight forwarding,"The pilot program seeks to establish more sustainable road networks for freight forwarding in Australia

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA -  Media OutReach - 21 February 2023 - GEODIS, a global leader in the transport and logistics sector, has joined hands with Volvo Australia to pilot the first Fully Electric (FE) variant truck for freight forwarding within the Australian market. This strategic partnership will deploy Volvo's FE model trucks – powered by both solar energy and energy-efficient charging systems – as part of a concerted effort to support long-term customers with sustainable delivery solutions to complement existing freight forwarding services across the local market.       Tim Camelleri (Electromobility Manager, Volvo Group Australia), Stuart Asplet (sub-regional Managing Director, GEODIS Pacific)     The Volvo FE truck is powered by ABB's state-of-the-art charging infrastructure, which not only accelerates charging but also enables the vehicle to draw power from existing solar infrastructure. As part of the pilot program, GEODIS will be assessing factors, including the driving range, the suitability for heavy loads of up to 7,500 kilograms to be transported across 200-kilometer ranges within metropolitan areas via FE trucks before committing to a larger-scale roll-out across its fleet in Australia. The full integration of these trucks into GEODIS' Australian fleet is set to completely remove fine particles and nitrogen oxide, in addition to ensuring a 95 percent reduction in direct carbon emissions, compared to existing diesel vehicles performing the same function.   ""We recognize the growing importance of integrating both sustainable and innovative solutions into the supply chain ecosystem, especially as more of our customers look to us to transport their cargo in an ethical and sustainable manner,"" said  Stuart Asplet, Sub-Regional Managing Director, Pacific at GEODIS. ""This initiative serves not only as a testament to our long-standing relationship with Volvo but also to our collective vision to decarbonize the supply chain industry, even as we continue to expand our services to meet evolving customer needs. We look forward to formalizing many more of such milestones as we continue to take steps forward to reduce our impact on the environment.""   As part of a long-term plan to decarbonize the supply chain, GEODIS has also built a robust ecosystem to ensure future FE trucks can be fully optimized across its road network. With the support of Volvo Australia's e-mobility team, GEODIS has upskilled its drivers with electric-vehicle training and designed holistic route and load planning processes to get the most efficient use of the assets. Partners like Goodman Group were also brought on board to install solar panels and charging infrastructure across GEODIS' facilities, paving the way for the further electrification of the GEODIS fleet.   ""We are thrilled to be working with GEODIS on this pilot program to extend our Volvo FE fleet within the Australian heavy vehicle market. Bringing low-carbon and more circular transport solutions has always been a key priority for us, and this strategic partnership is one of the many steps that we are taking to build a more energy-efficient transport ecosystem for the market. By developing lower-emissions and safer transport solutions, we hope to be able to provide our customers and their stakeholders the ability to also reach their sustainability targets,"" said. Tim Camilleri, Electromobility Manager, Volvo Group Australia   GEODIS has also been ramping up the implementation of other low-carbon transport systems, including building efficient, multimodal transport networks – that tap into the use of rail, short sea shipping, and inland waterways – and fully optimizing the volume and payload of fleets. GEODIS has also launched its Sustainable Fuel Program worldwide, which aims to accelerate the use of alternative and renewable fuels, including marine fuels, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816615,"New Zealand needs to rebuild for weather resilience, PM says","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — After last week's damaging cyclone, New Zealand needs to rebuild with more resilient infrastructure to cope with more frequent and intense weather events, the prime minister said Tuesday.

            Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has described Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused widespread damage on New Zealand’s North Island and claimed 11 lives, as the country’s most damaging natural disaster in at least a generation.

            The cyclone followed another storm two weeks earlier that swamped New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, and killed four people.











            Hipkins said there had been a nine-fold increase in government spending in the 2021-22 fiscal year on helping farmers cope with floods, storms and drought.

            The number of weather events that require emergency road work more than doubled from an average of 67 a year between 2018 and 2021 to 140 a year, Hipkins said.

            “We know that how we recover has to be done a little bit differently this time,” Hipkins told Parliament. “We’ve got to build back better, we’ve got to build back safer and we’ve got to build back smarter.""

            He added that New Zealand was “without question” experiencing the effects of climate change and extreme weather events were becoming more common and more intense.

            “Business as usual won’t work any more. We have to accept that billions of dollars of additional investment is going to be required not just to fix up what has been damaged but to build more resilience so that we can better cope with these types of events in the future,” Hipkins said.

            The government is making road repair a focus of the recovery effort. Around 250 state highways and local roads remained closed Monday afternoon and crews were repairing 400 kilometers (249 miles) of highway, Hipkins said.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — After last week's damaging cyclone, New Zealand needs to rebuild with more resilient infrastructure to cope with more frequent and intense weather events, the prime minister said Tuesday.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has described Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused widespread damage on New Zealand’s North Island and claimed 11 lives, as the country’s most damaging natural disaster in at least a generation.The cyclone followed another storm two weeks earlier that swamped New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, and killed four people.Hipkins said there had been a nine-fold increase in government spending in the 2021-22 fiscal year on helping farmers cope with floods, storms and drought.The number of weather events that require emergency road work more than doubled from an average of 67 a year between 2018 and 2021 to 140 a year, Hipkins said.“We know that how we recover has to be done a little bit differently this time,” Hipkins told Parliament. “We’ve got to build back better, we’ve got to build back safer and we’ve got to build back smarter.""He added that New Zealand was “without question” experiencing the effects of climate change and extreme weather events were becoming more common and more intense.“Business as usual won’t work any more. We have to accept that billions of dollars of additional investment is going to be required not just to fix up what has been damaged but to build more resilience so that we can better cope with these types of events in the future,” Hipkins said.The government is making road repair a focus of the recovery effort.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816663,Taiwanese doctor dispels myths about MSG,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Taiwanese doctor on Thursday (Feb. 16) debunked popular myths about Monosodium glutamate (MSG).Dr. Chiang Kun-chun, a surgeon who hosts a YouTube channel called Health 2.0, on Thursday uploaded a video addressing the rumors about MSG. Chiang said MSG is also known as sodium glutamate and is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. Chiang said Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University first isolated glutamic acid as a tasty substance from edible seaweed in 1907.In addition to seaweed, Chiang said many natural foods contain MSG, such as corn, tomatoes, and cheese. Chiang said even if consumers specifically try to avoid processed foods with MSG, they will still eat about 20 mg of naturally occurring MSG per day.Regarding claims that consuming MSG can make one thirsty, Chiang said that it is the sodium content that makes people feel thirsty. He said anything that contains sodium can have this effect if eaten in excess.He said when cooking, people tend to notice if they have added too much salt to a dish. However, he said when adding MSG to enhance the flavor of certain dishes, the saltiness is not as readily apparent.He said that it is not until after they eat the meal that they feel thirsty. He advised people who experience dry mouth after eating the dishes to reduce the quantity of MSG used.Regarding fears MSG causes cancer, Chiang said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels the ingredient as generally recognized as safe, while the European Union has approved it as a food additive for certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. He emphasized that researchers have not found a link between the consumption of MSG and cancer.Chiang noted that there is a symptom some attribute to MSG consumption called ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome,"" in which non-Chinese claim to feel unwell after eating at a Chinese restaurant. He says many non-Chinese blamed the MSG in the food and soon stigmatized the ingredient.However, he said that studies found no correlation between MSG use in Chinese food and any health symptoms. Instead, he said it was simply a case of non-Chinese not being accustomed to the cuisine.Chiang said that chicken broth cubes, which some people use as an alternative to MSG, are far worse because they contain salt, MSG, and other ""unknown additives."" He argued that if the ingredients of chicken broth cubes are unclear or not clearly marked, they may be less safe than MSG.He closed by stressing that moderation of MSG is the key and too much of any ingredient can be harmful.",2023/02/21,2508,Food Safety & Health

            The group was one of many U.S. delegations President Tsai Ing-wen has welcomed in recent years even as Beijing has stepped up diplomatic and military harassment of Taiwan. 

            China responded to foreign visits by holding large-scale military exercises seen by some as a rehearsal for a blockade or invasion. Beijing has not ruled out use of force to reunite Taiwan with mainland China, although the sides have been separated since a civil war in 1949, and most Taiwanese prefer to keep the status quo of de-facto independence. 











            Tsai thanked the lawmakers for coming, saying it was a chance to deepen ongoing cooperation in semiconductor chip design and manufacturing, renewable energy and next-generation 5G mobile network.

            “Taiwan and the U.S. (will) continue to bolster military exchanges. Going forward, Taiwan will cooperate even more actively with the U.S. and other democratic partners to confront such bold challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change,” Tsai said. 

            Tensions between the U.S. and China inflated after Washington shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that Beijing maintains was an unmanned weather balloon. Both sides are also in opposition on the war in Ukraine, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Sunday that Beijing could be considering providing weapons to Russia for the war.

            Taiwan remains a flash point. Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, said over the weekend that Taiwan “has never been a country and it will not be a country in the future.” 

            “We are here to affirm the shared values between the U.S. and Taiwan — a commitment to democracy, a commitment to freedom,"" California Rep. Ro Khanna said. “The U.S. under President Biden's leadership seeks peace in the region."" 

            He is accompanied by Reps. Tony Gonzales of Texas, Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Jonathan Jackson of Illinois. The group met with their legislative counterparts Monday, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company founder Morris Chang.

Beijing has not ruled out use of force to reunite Taiwan with mainland China, although the sides have been separated since a civil war in 1949, and most Taiwanese prefer to keep the status quo of de-facto independence.Tsai thanked the lawmakers for coming, saying it was a chance to deepen ongoing cooperation in semiconductor chip design and manufacturing, renewable energy and next-generation 5G mobile network.“Taiwan and the U.S. (will) continue to bolster military exchanges. Going forward, Taiwan will cooperate even more actively with the U.S. and other democratic partners to confront such bold challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change,” Tsai said.Tensions between the U.S. and China inflated after Washington shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that Beijing maintains was an unmanned weather balloon. Both sides are also in opposition on the war in Ukraine, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Sunday that Beijing could be considering providing weapons to Russia for the war.Taiwan remains a flash point. Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, said over the weekend that Taiwan “has never been a country and it will not be a country in the future.”“We are here to affirm the shared values between the U.S. and Taiwan — a commitment to democracy, a commitment to freedom,"" California Rep. Ro Khanna said. “The U.S. under President Biden's leadership seeks peace in the region.""He is accompanied by Reps.

            The Jayhawks, in pursuit of their 21st Big 12 regular-season title, still never trailed after halftime and extended the league's longest active winning streak to five in a row, beating 24th-ranked TCU 63-58 on Monday night. 

            “I’ve said all along, we’ve got five guys that can all go out there and play and take over the game. And that’s the beauty of our team,"" said Wilson, who had 13 rebounds while making only 3-of-11 shots for seven points, more than 13 below his season average. “We’re all going to have some type of effort to win. ... That’s part of a championship team.""











            Damion Baugh missed a potential tying 3-pointer with five seconds left for TCU (18-10, 7-8 Big 12). Shahada Wells missed a follow-up layup before Kevin McCullar, who finished with 15 points, was fouled and made two free throws to seal it for the Jayhawks (23-5, 11-4).

            Kansas began the night tied with idle eighth-ranked Texas for the conference lead. Coach Bill Self's reigning national champions have won seven of eight games since a three-game losing streak that included a 23-point home loss to the Horned Frogs. 

            “We haven’t accomplished jack, but we've put ourselves in a favorable position to maybe do something,” Self said. “Everybody talked about our sky's falling when we lost three in a row. In this league, that can happen easily. But we’ve recovered pretty good since then.""

            
                Not even an appearance from Heisman Trophy runner-up Max Duggan could get the Frogs over the hump. They were within 56-53 with 6:07 left when the four-year starting quarterback, still in his tuxedo after receiving the Davey O’Brien Award in a ceremony about four miles from campus, waved the crowd into a frenzy while going to a courtside seat. 

            “He looked good tonight with the tux on,” Self said. ""I’m just glad he didn’t get here any earlier.”

            Neither team made a field goal in the final 4:19. TCU missed its last six shots over that span, while the Jayhawks were 0-for-4 in the final 4:45. 

            The Frogs tied the game at 48 with 10:13 left when Jakobe Coles made a tough leaner while being fouled, but missed the free throw that would have put them in the lead. 

            Mike Miles Jr. had 13 points for TCU, which has lost five of its last six games. The first four of those losses came when the guard was out with a hyperextended right knee. Coles added 12 points and Baugh had 11. 

            It was only the second game Miles and big man Eddie Lampkin played together for the Frogs since their 83-60 win at Allen Fieldhouse on Jan. 21. That was the second-worst home loss for Kansas in Self’s 20 seasons. 

            With both of them starting again, TCU beat Oklahoma State 100-75 at home Saturday to end a four-game losing streak while hitting the century mark in a Big 12 game for the first time. Lampkin, who missed four of six games after a high left ankle sprain in the first meeting against the Jayhawks, had two points and eight rebounds in the rematch. 

            “It’s disappointing how we played and how we executed and how we handled the situation,” TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. “Obviously played good in our last game, excited about having our guys back. But we just didn’t carry it over.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas: The Jayhawks reached 11 conference wins for the 29th consecutive season, a streak that began in 1994-95 and is the longest active in Division I. They have three regular-season games left, two at home before the finale at Texas. 

            TCU: After shooting a season-high 68.6% against Oklahoma State two days earlier, the Frogs were a season-low 30.3% (20 of 66) from the field against Kansas. They missed their first eight shots in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the game, then missed their last six shots before the break. TCU missed nine of it last 10.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816682,Liberia may have 'parallel system' for illegal log exports,"The lush West African rainforests of Liberia are being cut down and illegally exported with the likely collusion of powerful government officials, according to a diplomatic document obtained by The Associated Press that described an apparent “parallel system” for trade in timber.

            The document is a compilation of reports prepared by independent international monitors over the last three years, made public here for the first time. It includes a table of 39 cases where monitors said they found evidence of lawbreaking or governance failure and no action taken to address any of them. It says the country's chief timber official, Mike Doryen, runs his own “special task force” to bypass the personnel stationed at checkpoints who are there to prevent logging virgin rainforest.

            The U.K. Foreign Office document describes a network of illicit sawmills, off-the-books exports and payments made to the Liberian forestry agency that were not deposited in official accounts, that could amount to a “parallel system” for the timber trade. 











            “Such a system suggests the collusion of individuals at the (forestry agency), the National Port Authority, and Customs,” U.K. diplomats wrote.

            Their document was sent to Liberian ministers last September and was passed to the office of the country’s president, correspondence with his deputy press secretary shows.

            Liberia is West Africa’s most forested country, still home to endangered species including chimpanzees and forest elephants. The U.K. document says up to 70% of Liberia’s timber exports may bypass the official tracking system put in place to protect the forest. If so, Liberia is also losing out on large sums in revenue, diplomats warned.

            Jonathan Yiah, who directs the forest governance program at the Liberian nonprofit Sustainable Development Institute, called it “a breakdown of the rule of law in the forest sector.” He said a shadow system for forest exports does indeed exist in the country.

            He said his group brought to light evidence in one case “and there has been no action by the FDA,” referring to the country's Forestry Development Authority. 

            Responding to the criticisms, Forestry Development Authority Managing Director Doryen disputed the idea that no action has been taken. He said in an email he has ordered all sawmills to be registered. All revenue has gone to proper accounts. He said no parallel logging system exists, although one did before he was appointed.

            “During the early part of my administration and as part of our learning curve, abandoned logs were allowed to use that system,” he said.

            But logs like the ones Doryen describes as abandoned have raised eyebrows even within Liberia's timber trade. 

            When a load of cut trees that had purportedly been lying abandoned for six years was offered to Magna Logging Corporation in Liberia, the logs turned out to be “fresh,” according to an email obtained by the AP sent by CEO Morley Kamara. Concerned, Kamara notified the Swiss certification agency that is supposed to verify the legality of Liberian exports, SGS. “I have never seen something like this ... There’s no payment to LRA (Liberia Revenue Authority) Transit Account. Too many problems!” Kamara's email said.

            A letter signed by Doryen had given permission to export the logs outside Liberia's official log-tracking system. Doryen did not respond to questions about the letter.

            Doryen is widely seen as a close ally of President George Weah. Weah is a former soccer star who won FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995. He has refused to remove Doryen, despite mounting accusations of systemic wrongdoing and at least 18 months of diplomatic pressure from the U.K., U.S., E.U. and Norway to clean up the Liberian forest agency. All the countries donate money to Liberia for conservation. The U.K. has given millions of British pounds (millions of dollars).

            Now pressure appears to be mounting. On Feb. 3, at a meeting in the capital Monrovia focused on the country’s forests and sponsored by the World Bank, E.U. Ambassador Laurent Delahousse called deforestation levels in Liberia “rather dramatic.” He decried an “attitude of casual satisfaction if not denial” by Liberia, “as if everything was fine, as if just having the forest should entitle Liberia to receive funds from the international community, because those funds would somehow be owed to Liberia.”

            “Climate finance doesn’t work like that,” Delahousse warned.

            In one case outlined in the document, a load of illegally-felled trees was headed by truck to Gambia in January 2022, when it was flagged at a checkpoint. The driver had receipts showing fees had been paid to the Liberia forest agency, but the money was not deposited in official accounts. “It is unclear where this money goes,” the document said.

            Police confiscated the logs and took them to a police station. But they disappeared from the station a few days later, the diplomatic missive said, and authorities took no action.

            Asked about the lawbreaking, Doryen said, “There may be persons or businesses trying to evade legal processes, and the FDA, under my watch, has remained active in uncovering these challenges.”

            But Yiah, the forest advocate, called on President Weah to launch a full investigation. It’s not just the natural world suffering, he said. Uncontrolled cutting of the forest hurts local communities “in a very serious way ... They depend on the forest for food.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816686,"Brink, Jones power No. 3 Stanford women past No. 17 UCLA","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Tara VanDerveer asked the crowd to give a standing ovation to her four Stanford seniors, and hundreds of fans who stuck around well past the final buzzer for a postgame ceremony jumped to their feet.

            VanDerveer thanked the players' parents while making something perfectly clear: The Cardinal have plenty of great basketball still to be played with March approaching. Stanford's seniors have already won 116 games during their careers.

            “They call themselves the Funky Four, I call them the Final Four or the Fabulous Four,” the Hall of Fame coach said. “Let's keep it rolling.”











            Cameron Brink scored 25 points and made all 15 of her free throws, the last of which put Stanford ahead for good, and the third-ranked Cardinal beat 17th-ranked UCLA 71-66 on Monday night in their final regular-season home game.

            Brink swatted two more shots to give her 102 blocks for the season, and her 15 free throws were the most without a miss by a Stanford player since at least 1999 — Candice Wiggins went 14 for 14 in 2008. Senior Haley Jones added 18 points and converted a layup with 1:22 remaining to put the Cardinal ahead by three.

            “There were a lot of different moments tonight we had to change our mentality,” Jones said. “We're trying to win a Pac-12 championship and this game was necessary to do that. We had to be the aggressor.”

            Stanford (26-3, 14-2 Pac-12) has won four straight and is closing in on a third straight Pac-12 regular-season title with games remaining this week at No. 21 Colorado and No. 8 Utah.

            Jones hit a go-ahead jumper with 2:45 to play before Lina Sontag answered with a 3 moments later to put UCLA ahead 65-64. Brink's final two free throws made it 66-65 with 1:53 left.

            Freshman Londynn Jones scored 14 points for UCLA (21-7, 10-6), which dropped one spot in the AP Top 25 this week and had its four-game winning streak snapped. UCLA pounded the boards for a 36-33 advantage, getting 17 on the offensive glass.

            “They’re a good team and they’re on a mission,” VanDerveer said.

            Brink also converted a go-ahead three-point play with 8:55 remaining. The 6-foot-4 junior reached 100 blocks for the first time in her stellar career and set the all-time Stanford record during Friday's 50-47 win over Southern California — and she still has another collegiate season left to play. Brink has 280 blocks, having topped Jayne Appel’s mark of 273 set from 2006-10.

            Stanford won the first meeting 72-59 on Jan. 13 after the teams were tied after three quarters. UCLA made it interesting until the end this time.

            “Really proud of our team's response in the second half,” Bruins coach Cori Close said, “their fight, their togetherness, their belief.”

            The cold-shooting Bruins began 3 of 11 and went 5:39 without a basket in the second quarter, missing 10 straight shots as the Cardinal went on a 6-0 run. Christeen Iwuala's putback with 3:36 left in the quarter ended a nearly six-minute stretch without a field goal by UCLA.

            But the Bruins came out energized after halftime, using a 25-point third quarter — they had just 26 points at halftime — while holding Stanford to just four field goals in the period to take a 51-50 lead heading into the final 10 minutes.

            CURRY SUPPORTS

            Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry attended his second straight Stanford game. He has been a regular this season at women's games on The Farm and also at California in Berkeley. He sat on the baseline with Brink's parents, Michelle and Greg.

            The reigning NBA Finals MVP's family is close with the Brinks.

            “When I was growing up I played with a lot of young girls, we played a lot of pickup together,” Curry said. “I love that the game is growing and getting some more exposure. I grew up watching sports and now to drive awareness on how good the women's game is, all that stuff matters. I've had my daughters here with me to watch, I've had my son here with me to watch the game, and they love it. And I'm supporting family, too.”

            SENIOR NIGHT

            The Cardinal also acknowledged each UCLA senior before the game. Senior Charisma Osborne had 11 points, seven rebounds, six assists and a career-best six steals for the Bruins.
