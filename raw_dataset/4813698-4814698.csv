https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813710,Indian authorities accuse BBC of tax evasion after searches,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s Finance Ministry accused the BBC of tax evasion on Friday, saying that it had not fully declared its income and profits from its operations in the country.

            Indian tax authorities ended three days of searches of the British broadcaster's New Delhi and Mumbai offices on Thursday night. Opposition political parties and other media organizations have criticized the searches as an attempt to intimidate the media.

            Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also questioned the timing of the searches, which came weeks after the BBC aired a documentary in the U.K. that was critical of Modi.











            “The department gathered several evidences pertaining to the operation of the organization which indicate that tax has not been paid on certain remittances which have not been disclosed as income in India by the foreign entities of the group,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes said in a statement.

            It said they found “several discrepancies and inconsistencies“ and had gathered “crucial evidence” from statements of employees, digital evidence and documents which would be examined more fully later.

            The statement also accused the BBC of not paying full taxes on the earnings of employees who came from abroad and worked in India for short durations.

            The BBC said in a statement that it would “respond appropriately to any direct formal communication received from the Income Tax Department.”

            “We are supporting staff -– some of whom have faced lengthy questioning or been required to stay overnight -– and their welfare is our priority. Our output is back to normal and we remain committed to serving our audiences in India and beyond,"" it said.

            The Press Trust of India news agency cited unidentified officials as saying on Thursday that investigators collected financial data from select BBC staffers and made copies of electronic and paper data from the news organization. 

            It said the authorities were investigating issues related to international taxation and transfer pricing of BBC subsidiary companies.

            The leader of India's main opposition Congress party, Mallikarjun Kharge, described the search of the BBC offices as an assault on freedom of the press under Modi’s government.

            Reporters Without Borders, an international media watchdog, denounced the government’s action as “attempts to clamp down on independent media.”

            “These raids have all the appearance of a reprisal against the BBC for releasing a documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three weeks ago. They have come at a time when independent media are being hounded more and more, and when pluralism is shrinking in India due to increased media concentration,” the group said in a statement on Thursday.

            The documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” was broadcast in the U.K. last month, examining the prime minister’s role in 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.

            Modi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him. Last year, the court dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim victim questioning Modi’s exoneration.

            The program drew an immediate backlash from India’s government, which invoked emergency powers under its information technology laws to block it from being shown in the country. Local authorities scrambled to stop screenings organized at Indian universities, and social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube complied with government requests to remove links to the documentary.

            The BBC said at the time that the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a wide range of voices and opinions.

            “We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series — it declined to respond,” it said.

            India’s Foreign Ministry called the documentary a “propaganda piece designed to push a particularly discredited narrative” that lacked objectivity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813711,"Battered by Cheneso, Madagascar braces for Cyclone Freddy","MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Two weeks after Tropical Cyclone Cheneso devastated Madagascar, killing 30 people, the Indian Ocean island nation and its neighbors are bracing for a more powerful Cyclone Freddy.

            Meteo France has described Freddy as an “intense tropical cyclone” and a ""particularly powerful and compact tropical system, generating extreme winds near its center.” The much smaller islands of Mauritius and Reunion are on high alert as Freddy — churning westward on Friday about 2,000 kilometers (about 1,242 miles) east of Mauritius — was expected to cause flooding there Sunday and Monday.

            In its latest briefing Friday afternoon, the United Nations regional weather observation center in Reunion said Freddy, which formed two weeks ago near Indonesia, was expected to make landfall early next week with the equivalent strength of a formidable Category 5 hurricane. 











            Another cyclone, Dingani, was weakening.

            The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent in Madagascar said it was mobilizing its teams for the cyclone.

            Madagascar’s General Directorate of Meteorology has issued alerts for the Analanjirofo and Sava regions warning residents to take preventive measures as they expect a more powerful Freddy to make landfall, between Tuesday and Wednesday next week on the country’s east coast. 

            The mainland African coastal nations of Mozambique and South Africa, alongside Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, were on high alert for heavy rains and thunderstorms from Freddy in the coming week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813712,"Power outage cancels, diverts flights at Kennedy Airport","NEW YORK (AP) — A power outage in a terminal of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport stretched into a second day Friday after forcing some flights to be canceled or diverted, including one that was turned around and sent back to New Zealand after nearly making it to the U.S.

            The airport's operator said Terminal 1, which handles some of the airport’s international flights, would remain closed Friday “due to electrical issues,"" but that limited operations could resume Saturday. 

            The outage was caused by an electrical panel failure that led to a small fire, authorities said.











            The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs New York's major airports, said it was working to accommodate affected flights at JFK’s four other active terminals.

            The agency said 39 of the 64 flights scheduled to arrive or depart from Terminal 1 on Friday were canceled, 13 were operating from other terminals and 12 were being routed through other airports.

            “The Port Authority continues to work with Terminal 1’s operator to complete repairs, restore power and resume flight operations at the terminal as soon as possible,"" agency spokesperson Alana Calmi said.

            Yahayra Hunt and her husband were sent to a hotel near the airport after their flight to Rome was canceled Thursday. They’re part of a group of 16 people who booked an 11-day tour to Italy and Israel.

            Hunt, 46, said they were told Friday that their flight to Italy wouldn't leave until Monday and that the airline refused to cover the cost of their weekend stay in New York.

            “Being stuck in a hotel during your vacation is not fair at all,” said Hunt, who owns a beauty salon in North Carolina.

            Some planes were forced to return to their points of origin.

            Kelly Shea, who owns a travel agency in Indianapolis, said she heard from clients Thursday who spent eight hours on a flight from Milan … to Milan.

            The clients, a couple who had gone to the Venice Carnival, were flying home to Indiana through New York when the plane turned around. When they returned to the Milan airport, the couple told Shea that the ticket counter was “chaos,” with people screaming.

            “And of course, by the time they got up to the counter, there were no more seats left on the next flight,” Shea said. “So I immediately tried to put them on the flight the next day, but my computer system already showed big zeros.”

            Shea said the best she could do was book a return flight for them on Sunday, three days after they were supposed to be back in Indiana.

            An Air New Zealand flight was two-thirds of the way across the Pacific Ocean when it had to make a U-turn and head back to Auckland. The flight landed back in New Zealand after more than 16 hours in the air.

            Air New Zealand officials said the flight turned back because diverting it to another U.S. airport could have stranded it where it couldn’t make planned connections with other scheduled passengers. Passengers on the diverted jet were booked on other flights.

            “Our teams have been working through that rebooking process and were on hand to help customers with their travel arrangements when they arrived in Auckland,” the airline's chief operational integrity and safety officer, David Morgan, said.

            Passenger Rosemary Armao, 73, an adjunct journalism professor, said she was awakened by a tap from her friend, who told her the plane was headed back to Auckland.

            “I thought it was a bad Ambien dream,” Armao said by phone.

            After an eight-hour wait back in New Zealand, Armao and her friend, retired music professor David Kechley, were put on a flight to Los Angeles, where they hoped to connect to a flight to New York.

            While stuck in Los Angeles, Armao said she used a $100 voucher from the airline to make her airport stay a little nicer: ordering an expensive dinner and buying out the supply of Cheez Doodles, M&Ms, and Pringles at two shops.

            Alexis Weisman and Ryan Lindgren, both 28, were scheduled to fly out of JFK on Friday for a once-in-a-lifetime ski trip in the Swiss Alps.

            They learned at noon Thursday that the flight was canceled. They found a flight out on Saturday, but only after Weisman and Lindgren — and Weisman’s mother — spent eight hours making phone calls.

            “All day yesterday, in the middle of the workday, we were getting hung up on or disconnected,” Weisman said.

            Weisman and Lindgren are now flying on a different carrier but the booking is still through the original airline, which caused even more headaches. They’re also flying out of Newark, which is at least a 40-minute longer drive from their home.

            “No one is being held accountable,” Weisman said. “We’re just really disappointed in the way that they’re handling things.”

            Terminal 1 at Kennedy opened in the late 1990s. It is scheduled to be replaced by a new, $9.5 billion terminal now under construction. Groundbreaking was initially supposed to happen in 2020 but was delayed until last summer by the COVID-19 pandemic.

They’re part of a group of 16 people who booked an 11-day tour to Italy and Israel.Hunt, 46, said they were told Friday that their flight to Italy wouldn't leave until Monday and that the airline refused to cover the cost of their weekend stay in New York.“Being stuck in a hotel during your vacation is not fair at all,” said Hunt, who owns a beauty salon in North Carolina.Some planes were forced to return to their points of origin.Kelly Shea, who owns a travel agency in Indianapolis, said she heard from clients Thursday who spent eight hours on a flight from Milan … to Milan.The clients, a couple who had gone to the Venice Carnival, were flying home to Indiana through New York when the plane turned around. When they returned to the Milan airport, the couple told Shea that the ticket counter was “chaos,” with people screaming.“And of course, by the time they got up to the counter, there were no more seats left on the next flight,” Shea said. “So I immediately tried to put them on the flight the next day, but my computer system already showed big zeros.”Shea said the best she could do was book a return flight for them on Sunday, three days after they were supposed to be back in Indiana.An Air New Zealand flight was two-thirds of the way across the Pacific Ocean when it had to make a U-turn and head back to Auckland. The flight landed back in New Zealand after more than 16 hours in the air.Air New Zealand officials said the flight turned back because diverting it to another U.S. airport could have stranded it where it couldn’t make planned connections with other scheduled passengers. Passengers on the diverted jet were booked on other flights.“Our teams have been working through that rebooking process and were on hand to help customers with their travel arrangements when they arrived in Auckland,” the airline's chief operational integrity and safety officer, David Morgan, said.Passenger Rosemary Armao, 73, an adjunct journalism professor, said she was awakened by a tap from her friend, who told her the plane was headed back to Auckland.“I thought it was a bad Ambien dream,” Armao said by phone.After an eight-hour wait back in New Zealand, Armao and her friend, retired music professor David Kechley, were put on a flight to Los Angeles, where they hoped to connect to a flight to New York.While stuck in Los Angeles, Armao said she used a $100 voucher from the airline to make her airport stay a little nicer: ordering an expensive dinner and buying out the supply of Cheez Doodles, M&Ms, and Pringles at two shops.Alexis Weisman and Ryan Lindgren, both 28, were scheduled to fly out of JFK on Friday for a once-in-a-lifetime ski trip in the Swiss Alps.They learned at noon Thursday that the flight was canceled. They found a flight out on Saturday, but only after Weisman and Lindgren — and Weisman’s mother — spent eight hours making phone calls.“All day yesterday, in the middle of the workday, we were getting hung up on or disconnected,” Weisman said.Weisman and Lindgren are now flying on a different carrier but the booking is still through the original airline, which caused even more headaches. They’re also flying out of Newark, which is at least a 40-minute longer drive from their home.“No one is being held accountable,” Weisman said. “We’re just really disappointed in the way that they’re handling things.”Terminal 1 at Kennedy opened in the late 1990s. It is scheduled to be replaced by a new, $9.5 billion terminal now under construction. Groundbreaking was initially supposed to happen in 2020 but was delayed until last summer by the COVID-19 pandemic.___Finley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.____ This story has been corrected to show that the Port Authority said it was working to accommodate flights at other terminals, not other airports.",2023/02/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813722,Bamford: Skubala 'taken pressure away' at Leeds after Marsch,"LEEDS, England (AP) — Leeds striker Patrick Bamford says caretaker manager Michael Skubala has “taken the pressure away” following the firing of Jesse Marsch.

            Skubala has overseen a draw and loss — both against Manchester United — since Marsch was fired on Feb. 6 with Leeds hovering just above the relegation zone.

            
                Bamford told BBC Radio in an interview published Friday that the atmosphere “was always good” under Marsch but that Skubala has instilled a sense of calm.











            “Not to the point where you can get away with unnecessary things but he’s just kind of taken the pressure away,” the striker said ahead of Leeds' game at Everton on Saturday.

            Bamford, who has scored one goal in 15 league appearances this season, heard criticism following his comments about Leeds' tactics in the 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest that proved to be the American coach's last game in charge.

            Bamford had said teammates weren't making runs to create space and it left him alone to challenge defenders. He told the BBC he wasn't “having a go” at Marsch.

            “What I said was exactly what he told us to do, we just weren’t doing it. I was actually kind of being self-deprecating toward my performance,” he said.

            Bamford texted the American with regrets after the firing.

            “I was never really fully fit under him,"" Bamford said. ""I texted him after we heard the news and said pretty much that. I actually got on well with him.”

            Leeds confirmed this week that the 40-year-old Skubala, an Englishman who had been coach of the club's youth squad, will continue to lead the team while they search for Marsch's successor.

            “The fact that he got us so organized against Manchester United in the two games in the way that we set up, especially the home game we looked really good, I think that's just made obviously the board more confident but I think that's just put an extreme amount of confidence from his players in him,” Bamford said.

            Skubala's calm personality hasn't changed since taking over, Bamford said.

            “He's remained true to himself,"" he said. ""The lads love him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813724,"Europe's youngest country Kosovo now 15, but problems endure","PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Europe's youngest country, Kosovo, on Friday launched festivities for the 15th anniversary of its independence from neighboring Serbia with a military parade, wreath-laying ceremonies and a special Parliament session.

            But the celebrations are overcast by revived tension with Serbia, despite yearslong Western efforts to reconcile the former foes. Both want into the European Union, and have been told they must first overcome their differences.

            Speaking in the capital Pristina Friday, Prime Minister Albin Kurti steered away from the violence of Kosovo's begetting, describing his country — one of Europe's poorest — as “a project of peace, a contributor to peace and a guarantor of peace.”











            Ethnic-Albanian-dominated Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on Feb. 17, 2008. That came nearly nine years after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999 ended Serbia’s bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that the independence declaration did not violate international law.

            The United States and most Western powers are among the 117 countries that have recognized Kosovo’s statehood, and about 200 international organizations have accepted Kosovo as a member — although not the United Nations.

            Serbia, which for centuries considered Kosovo the cradle of its civilization, still sees it as part of its territory and refuses to recognize its independence, backed by Russia and China.

            That makes for uneasy relations. Underlying tension has flared recently over matters as seemingly trivial as vehicle license plate formats, or the arrest of an ethnic Serb police officer, triggering concern among Western leaders who fear another Balkan conflict amid Russia's war in Ukraine.

            Kosovo's President Vjosa Osmani played to that concern on Friday, urging NATO and the EU to accept Kosovo and other Western Balkan countries “the soonest possible ... as a preventive step toward political, military and economic violation from Russia and its regional satellites.”

            Osmani also said Pristina's negotiations with Belgrade must lead to mutual recognition, adding that Kosovo's “territorial integrity, constitutionality, legal order and sovereignty are non-negotiable.”

            EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell on Friday said Kurti and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic would meet in Brussels on Feb. 27.

            U.S. and EU envoys visited Pristina and Belgrade regularly in recent months with a new proposal for normalizing relations. Its details have not yet been made public. Until now, 12 years of EU-mediated talks produced 33 agreements, which have only been partially implemented or largely ignored.

            In Serbia, pro-Russia nationalist groups have demanded that Belgrade stop all normalization talks. But Vucic said that would isolate Serbia internationally and kill its EU prospects. Vucic has said he is ready to consider the latest Western plan.

            Kosovo is still grappling with the political legacy of the war with Serbia.

            Former President Hashim Thaci and four other wartime leaders from the Kosovo Liberation Army are in the detention center of a tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, facing charges of murder, torture and persecution. All have denied the charges.

            The special court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the actions of the KLA during and after the war.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813725,"Russia, Belarus discuss closer military, economic ties","MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted neighboring ally Belarus' leader on Friday for talks on expanding military and economic cooperation amid the fighting in Ukraine.

            Russia used Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine nearly a year ago at the start of what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation.”

            Russia has maintained troops and weapons in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.











            Speaking at the start of his talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin proposed to discuss security issues, military cooperation and ways to further bolster economic ties.

            Putin noted that Belarus has preserved Soviet-era industrial assets, adding that it offers good opportunities for joint manufacturing programs.

            “By pooling our efforts we will create synergy,” Putin said. “It could be very efficient in some sectors and bring good results for both Belarus and Russia.”

            Russia has been a major sponsor of Belarus’ Soviet-style economy, which relies on cheap Russian energy and loans. 

            The Kremlin also has offered staunch political support to Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for nearly three decades, helping him weather months of massive protests triggered by his re-election in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.

            Last year, Lukashenko and Putin met 13 times.

            Lukashenko noted that Belarusian plants have made components for Russian passenger planes and suggested that with Russian assistance a Belarusian factory could start building Soviet-designed ground attack jets that he said “performed well” in Ukraine.

            A Belarusian factory has repaired a few Soviet-built Su-25 ground attack jets in the past, but it was unclear how it could resume production of the plane that was halted long time ago.

            The continuing deployment of Russian troops to Belarus has fueled concerns in Ukraine about a possible new offensive from the north across the 1,084-kilometer (672-mile) border.

            While hailing the importance of defense ties with Russia and expressing support for the Kremlin's action in Ukraine, Lukashenko has emphasized that he will only send Belarusian troops into Ukraine if his country is attacked.

            “I’m prepared to fight alongside the Russians from the territory of Belarus in one case only: if at least one soldier from there comes to Belarus to kill my people,” Lukashenko told reporters on Thursday. ""If they launch an aggression against Belarus, there will be the toughest response. And the war will take on a whole new character.”

            The Belarusian leader denied plans to mobilize reservists, something Russia did last year to beef up its forces fighting in Ukraine. “But we’re preparing for the war so that aggression isn’t committed against us,” he added, noting that in case of war the Belarusian army could be expanded from 75,000 now to 500,000.MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted neighboring ally Belarus' leader on Friday for talks on expanding military and economic cooperation amid the fighting in Ukraine.Russia used Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine nearly a year ago at the start of what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation.”Russia has maintained troops and weapons in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.Speaking at the start of his talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin proposed to discuss security issues, military cooperation and ways to further bolster economic ties.Putin noted that Belarus has preserved Soviet-era industrial assets, adding that it offers good opportunities for joint manufacturing programs.“By pooling our efforts we will create synergy,” Putin said. “It could be very efficient in some sectors and bring good results for both Belarus and Russia.”Russia has been a major sponsor of Belarus’ Soviet-style economy, which relies on cheap Russian energy and loans.The Kremlin also has offered staunch political support to Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for nearly three decades, helping him weather months of massive protests triggered by his re-election in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.Last year, Lukashenko and Putin met 13 times.Lukashenko noted that Belarusian plants have made components for Russian passenger planes and suggested that with Russian assistance a Belarusian factory could start building Soviet-designed ground attack jets that he said “performed well” in Ukraine.A Belarusian factory has repaired a few Soviet-built Su-25 ground attack jets in the past, but it was unclear how it could resume production of the plane that was halted long time ago.The continuing deployment of Russian troops to Belarus has fueled concerns in Ukraine about a possible new offensive from the north across the 1,084-kilometer (672-mile) border.While hailing the importance of defense ties with Russia and expressing support for the Kremlin's action in Ukraine, Lukashenko has emphasized that he will only send Belarusian troops into Ukraine if his country is attacked.“I’m prepared to fight alongside the Russians from the territory of Belarus in one case only: if at least one soldier from there comes to Belarus to kill my people,” Lukashenko told reporters on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813735,French power giant EDF posts record loss,"The largely state-owned French power producer EDF reported a record net loss of €17.9 billion (roughly $19 billion) for 2022 on Friday. The loss pushed the company's overall debts up to €64.5 billion.The dire 2022 performance was caused by a combination of an unprecedented number of outages at its reactors in France, one of the world's most nuclear-dependent countries, and the French government's cap on electricity prices as market prices soared as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""The 2022 results were significantly affected by the decline in our electricity output, and also by exceptional regulatory measures introduced in France in difficult market conditions,"" chief executive Luc Remont said in a statement.""Today, our priority is to put EDF back on track,"" Remont later told a press conference, having been appointed last November to right the ship.Major repairs to France's large fleet of nuclear reactors had been postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to both economic and health concerns.But as it transpired, waiting for the pandemic to pass ultimately made the problem far worse, not better.For the first time since 1980, France became a net importer of electricity in 2022, during the year when prices in Europe spiked to never-before-seen levels amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and restrictions on imports of Russian gas and oil and coal.A summer drought also led to further reductions in nuclear power output, with too little water available for cooling at some French reactors.The final factor was President Emmanuel Macron's swift move to cap energy prices. In some cases, this left EDF buying in electricity at roughly double the price it was then obliged to charge when selling the power on to other French providers.Further demonstrating the unusual climate for the company, EDF's revenue actually increased by roughly 70% year-on-year in 2022 — again a result of the sky high electricity prices — and yet still the company booked the mammoth net losses.Remont said last year's output of 279 terawatt hours, EDF's lowest in any year since 1988, should recover to between 300 and 330 terawatt hours in 2023.He also said the company was reckoning with ""significantly higher"" 2023 profits than the €18 billion euros booked in 2021, as prices remain high, forecasting a relatively rapid improvement in the balance sheet as a result.In the meantime, 43 of EDF's 56 nuclear reactors are back at full functionality, the company said, compared to just 30 as recently as November.France's strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 rests on a combination of renewable energy and investment in next-generation nuclear reactors. The country plans to construct six new nuclear power plants and is considering another eight besides that.msh/es (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813736,Ukraine updates: Kyiv says Bakhmut residents must leave,"The Ukrainian government has urged all residents of the eastern city of Bakhmut to flee, with heavy fighting expected to continue.Russian troops have been trying to take Bakhmut for months and the city, which once had 70,000 inhabitants, is under virtually constant shelling.""If you are rational, law-abiding and patriotic citizens, you should leave the city immediately,"" said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.
She made the appeal via the Telegram messaging app on Friday to what is believed to be some 6,000 people still in the city, which is in Ukraine's Donetsk region.Vereshchuk said people who stay would endanger themselves and their families, but also hinder the work of those who are trying to help them, such as the defense and security forces or volunteers.Many elderly residents are thought to be staying because they do not want to leave their birthplace and their homes are their only possession. Some also sympathize with Russia.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Friday, February 17.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his doubts on whether a diplomatic solution can be found with Russia in an interview Friday for the newspapers of Germany's Funke Mediengruppe and French daily Ouest-France.""I like anyone who wants to achieve peace through diplomatic initiatives,"" Kuleba said. ""But how can such an initiative work? Should the price for freedom be that Russia stays in the occupied regions?""He said that the Kremlin would have no reason to definitively end the war if it saw it could conquer and annex territory militarily. ""It could take a break and then start another war in around a year,"" Kuleba argued.Any talks with Russia could only start upon the basis of Ukraine's territorial integrity being ""completely restored,"" Kuleba declared, calling this ""non-negotiable.""""We've learnt a difficult lesson: when you give Russia a finger, it'll take the whole hand,"" he said.Kuleba argued that Putin was using ""intimidation tactics"" in stoking Western fears over potential further escalation of the conflict. He urged Western countries not to ""fall for Putin's tricks.""""Many of the people who with pained expressions advocate for peace and diplomacy in reality just want Ukraine to be defeated by Russia,"" he said.Kuleba said that an expected Russian spring offensive had ""already started,"" with Moscow gradually increasing the intensity of the offensive.At the opening of the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged leaders to speed up support for his country.
Ukraine's allies have delivered an array of weapons to Ukraine since Russia invaded almost a year ago.Kyiv says it fears vital hardware will arrive too slowly to defend against major new offensives.""We need to hurry up,"" Zelensky told the start of the three-day gathering via video link. ""We need speed, speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery... speed of decisions to limit Russian potential.""The Ukrainian leader said there was no ""alternative,"" because people's lives were at stake.The conference is being attended by the leaders of France and Germany, as well US Vice President Kamala Harris, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, China's top diplomat Wang Yi.Visiting Kyiv, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte says the first batch of Leopard-1A5 main battle tanks the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are buying for Ukraine will be delivered to the country as soon as possible.""As soon as the first batch [of Leopard tanks] is combat ready, it will be delivered to Ukraine, we want to do that as soon as possible"", Rutte told journalists in Kyiv, speaking alongside Zelenskyy.The three NATO allies say they will buy at least 100 of the tanks for Ukraine.
Zelenskyy said there should be no taboo on supplying arms to Ukraine because it needs weapons to defend its sovereignty.""We have a common understanding with the Netherlands that there should not be any taboo on the supply and support of weapons to our army, to our Ukraine, because it supports and protects our sovereignty,"" he said.Zelenskyy has called for more weapons from its Western allies, and faster deliveries. In particular, Ukraine wants fighter jets, more tanks, and long-range
weapons.The Munich Security Conference kicks off on Friday, involving leaders of dozens of countries and with Ukraine expected to dominate the agenda.US Vice President Kamala Harris Harris, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are set to meet on the sidelines of the conference to discuss support to Kyiv and further sanctions on Moscow.For the first time in two decades, Russian leaders were not invited to the conference. The event is set to open with a video address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Scholz is set to speak immediately afterwards.DW's Maksym Drabok is at the security conference and asked France's president whether he had a message for Zelenskyy, to which Macron responded: ""We stand with you shoulder to shoulder, and we will stand with you to the very end of the war.""The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge has made an appeal for more funding for Ukraine’s health sector.Kluge said more funding was needed for mental health services and rehabilitation, while there was also a need to ensure communities had access to health services.""We aim to reach 13.6 million people with this support this year,"" he said, during an briefing from the Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr.""That's why we have increased our appeal for 2023 to $240 million - $160 million for Ukraine and $80 million for refugee-receiving countries,"" Kluge said.The regional director pointed out that almost 10 million people may currently have a mental health condition in Ukraine.The UK Ministry of Defence said that its likely that Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Wagner forces have suffered between 175,000 to 200,000 casualties since the start of the invasion of Ukraine.In the latest daily briefing, the MOD said that this number included 40 to 60,000 killed and said that the casualty rate ""has significantly increased since September 2022 when 'partial mobilization' was imposed.""The MOD said that by modern standards, these figures represented a high ratio of personnel who had been killed when compared to those injured on the battlefield.""Rudimentary medical care"" and artillery were cited as leading factors in the high casualty rate.The MOD said Wagner forces comprised of large numbers of convict-recruits ""have probably experienced a casualty rate of up to 50%.""Ihor Zhovkva, the Deputy Head of the Office for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told DW that Russia is using balloons to exhaust Ukraine's air defenses.Zhovkva said Russia launched an attack ""across the whole country"" on Wednesday.He said that Moscow was ""combining its efforts"" in the multi-pronged assault, using cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, drones and balloons.The presidential aide claimed that Kyiv is currently intercepting around 75-80% of Russian missiles and drones.Russian opposition figure and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky believes the war is likely to continue as long as Vladimir Putin is in power in Moscow.""As long as Putin's regime is in power, the war will not end,"" Khodorkovsky said in Munich.The war in Ukraine had cause deep divisions within Russia, he said.Khodorkovsky said that ""active support"" for the war and the will to enlist in the Russian military is low.Khodorkovsky, who is now based in London, was the head of the Yukos oil company and spent several years in a prison camp after being convicted of embezzlement in Russia.Russia has said it will cut its oil output in response to Western embargoes and price caps.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813737,Life as art: Yoko Ono celebrates her 90th birthday,"Yoko Ono's life has been indelibly tied to her third husband, John Lennon, and to his band the Beatles after many blamed her for the Fab Four's break-up.But Yoko Ono has always been her own person, and has stamped her own distinctive mark on art and music for over 60 years.The daughter of a wealthy Tokyo family, Ono moved to the US as a young woman and became part of New York's artistic avant-garde in the early 1960s.One of her best-known early performances is 1964's ""Cut Piece,"" in which the artist sat passively on stage in her best suit and allowed the audience to cut off her clothes with scissors.It was a daring piece of participatory art that was soon echoed in the work of conceptual artist, Marina Abramovic.Ono's artistic inspiration came partly through her involvement in the Fluxus movement in New York, including ""Flux Film"" avant-garde filmmaking.Her most famous film from the period is 1966's ""Four,"" which shows the naked buttocks of people drawn from the London intellectual scene as the subject passes the camera on a moving walkway.Yoko Ono has a wide range of influences from French Dada artist Marcel Duchamp to experimental composer John Cage — who she met in New York through Cage's student and Ono's first husband, Toshi Ichiyanagi.But when Ono developed a high-pitched, screeching singing style — a feature of the Plastic Ono Band formed with John Lennon —  she drew the ire of the music press, and the public.Yoko Ono met ohn Lennon at one of her exhibitions in London in 1966.Two years later, they started having an affair, and Ono accompanied Lennon to the studio for the recording of the Beatles' ""White Album"" — breaking an agreement not to bring along female partners. Encouraged by Lennon, Ono is said to have interfered in the recording process.The couple married in 1969. A year later, Paul McCartney announced that he was leaving the Beatles. John's relatiuonship with Ono had played a part in his decision, he said at the time.Decades later in a TV interview with David Frost, McCartney conceded that Yoko Ono's constant presence at the band's studio recordings was not the reason for the breakup. But he did not deny in retrospect that he and the two other Beatles  eyed Yoko Ono with suspicion.Ono and Lennon's relationship at times came across as an art production, including the ""bed-ins"" for peace in a hotel bed and the eighteen-month ""Lost Weekend"" period, a marital time-out that Ono ordered.While Yoko Ono has remained aloof from the public eye, she has admitted in interviews that she had a a distant relationship with her son Sean Lennon from her marriage to John Lennon; and daughter Kyoko Chan Cox from her second marriage to film producer Anthony Cox.Her first pregnancy was not planned and robbed her of her sense of freedom, she said. She left the girl with Cox after she started going out with John Lennon.In 1971 Anthony Cox, who had joined a cult, went into hiding with the girl. It was not until the mid-1990s that Kyoko Chan Cox got in touch with her mother.After Yoko Ono gave birth to Sean Lennon in 1975,John Lennon is said to have been the prime carer of their son in the following years until his murder in 1980.John Lennon and Yoko Ono had just returned from a studio recording session on December 8 that year when Mark David Chapman, an obsessive fan, shot Lennon dead.It was in front of the Dakota Building in New York where Ono still lives today.For Ono, art was life, and death, and in 1981 she placed a photo of her husband's blood-splattered glasses on the cover of her solo album, ""Season of Glass.""In the decades since, her art works are still exhibited all over the world.Most recently, the exhibition ""War is Over! If You Want It — Tribute to Yoko Ono,"" was staged at the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/17,283,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813738,Kosovo: Love across the ethnic and political divide,"Just a stone's throw from the University of Pristina, Suzana M. from Novi Sad in Serbia and Gent S. from Ferizaj in Kosovo have set up home together in a tiny, lovingly furnished flat. The two 25-year-olds have been a couple for just under two years.Theirs is the story of a love that even today seems almost unthinkable in their native countries. It began on the other side of the Balkans in the Croatian port city of Rijeka on the Adriatic coast in May 2021.It was the holiday season, and Suzana had a job as a waitress. Gent was working on a construction site. One day, Suzana and her colleagues were spending a few happy hours relaxing on the beach in Rijeka.Gent was sitting just a few feet away. He caught Suzana's eye. With his brown hair and brown eyes, she found him somehow different, special.Suzana — tall and slim with long, dark blond hair — immediately attracted Gent's attention. He thought she was special, too. When their eyes met, Gent plucked up his courage and asked Suzana if he could buy her an ice-cream.""Normally, I would never accept an invitation like that,"" recalls Suzana, ""because that's the way my parents brought me up, but my colleagues pressed me to accept."" The two got talking. The first thing they found they had in common was that neither of them was remotely interested in discussions or prejudices relating to ethnicity.That first conversation over an ice-cream was followed by many more dates. ""I liked him right from the word go,"" says Suzana. ""He is an honest, kind-hearted person.""Suzana, the only child of a Serbian couple, was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the wars that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the family moved to Novi Sad in the Serbian province of Vojvodina, where ethnic Hungarians and Romanians live alongside Serbs. Suzana's parents wanted to live in a multiethnic, multicultural environment. ""It's no coincidence that I'm called Suzana. My parents didn't want to give me a typically Serbian first name,"" she says.Gent was born the second son of an ethnic Albanian family in Ferizaj in southern Kosovo. He encountered other nationalities and religions from an early age because his family had friends from Bulgaria and several distant relations who were not of the Muslim faith.Nevertheless, recalls Gent, his father was not at all happy when his son first told him about Suzana. Non-Albanian spouses are frowned upon in traditional ethnic Albanian families. What's more, as the head of the family, it is the father who has the last word. Gent risked being cast out by his family.""My father asked why I had a girlfriend from Serbia, when there were thousands of Albanian girls in Ferizaj,"" says Gent. Undeterred, he decided to introduce Suzana to his parents. When they met her, their reservations melted away and they grew fond of her.Getting to know a girl in Kosovo is usually a very different affair. During the summer and winter holidays, many young Kosovar men who live abroad come ""home"" driving powerful — in many cases German — cars in the hope of impressing the girls, getting to know them and maybe even finding a wife.So widespread is the practice that the locals even have a German term for it: ""Schatzi-Zeit"" (sweetheart time). For a while, the practice got so out of hand in Pristina that a famous promenade lined with cafes and restaurants was closed to traffic in one direction because there were just too many cars with German and Swiss license plates driving up and down.Gent has a very different outlook. He's not in the least bit interested in horsepower. In fact, he doesn't even own a car. ""I've learned to tell whether a person is good or bad, what kind of character they have. That's the only thing that matters to me,"" he says. He was drawn to Suzana from the word go. ""I liked her because she was very honest, and you could talk to her about anything,"" he says.While Kosovo Albanian–Serbian marriages were not an everyday occurrence in Yugoslavia, they were certainly not out of the ordinary. After all, religious and ethnic boundaries were largely done away with in the Socialist multiethnic state of Yugoslavia. But all that has changed. Right now, Kosovo and Serbia don't even recognize official documents issued by the other.The rot began to set in in the mid-1980s when Slobodan Milosevic rose to power and eventually became president of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, one of the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia.He pursued an increasingly nationalist, anti-Albanian course, curtailed the rights of the Albanian minority and finally removed the autonomous status of the Province of Kosovo and Metohija, which was at the time part of Serbia.In the 1990s, the increasingly serious human rights violations perpetrated by the Serbian state against Kosovo Albanians led to the Kosovo War of 1998/99. Milosevic later faced charges of war crimes in Kosovo at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, but died before being sentenced.Although the war ended 23 years ago, there is still no peace between Serbia and Kosovo. Unresolved issues such as the mutual recognition of car license plates immediately lead to a rise in tension and escalation, sometimes involving military saber rattling.Suzana and Gent have no time for such political hostilities and social prejudices. ""We've never been interested in the past,"" says Gent calmly, ""we just look to the future."" Suzana agrees, adding, ""We don't even have a television because we can't tell the difference between propaganda and news here.""Suzana had started studying law in Serbia, but after meeting Gent, she realized that it would tie her down more than she wanted. So, the two decided to move to Pristina. Gent still works in construction, and Suzana is now reading Balkan Studies at university. She says that it's a very broad subject that will allow her to work as an advisor, lecturer or translator when she graduates.In their life together, Gent and Suzana still have a lot of friends from their past. Very few turned away from them when they learned of their love. Many of them come from different countries and had no objections to this kind of relationship to begin with.Nevertheless, Suzana is careful — or ""considerate"" as she puts it. She cannot yet speak Albanian, and generally uses English in her everyday life, for example when she goes shopping. This is not a problem in Pristina, where there are a lot of foreigners, and the shopkeepers are used to speaking English. ""I haven't had any problems so far,"" says Suzana. ""But I am very prudent. For example, I avoid areas where people really suffered during the war.""While Gent is confident that Suzana won't have any problems in Pristina, he is afraid of negative attitudes towards his family if it becomes known that he is in a relationship with a Serb. This is why they don't openly speak about being a Serbian–Kosovo Albanian couple and don't want their surnames to be published.Gent and Suzana laugh a lot. They dream of one day having lots of children. It is very important to them that their children will grow up speaking three languages — Albanian, Serbian and English — from the word go. ""We don't want our children to see themselves as belonging to any one nation or ethnicity,"" they say. ""We want them to see themselves as people.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813739,World Cup 2023: German players differ on Saudi Arabia,"Germany midfielder Lina Magull believes nations are going to need to work with Saudi Arabia, as the popularity of women's football continues to grow.The Gulf states' official tourism body, Visit Saudi, will reportedly sponsor the upcoming women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, a potential deal which drew ire from across the world.However, Magull cut a conciliatory figure admitting that, though it may be morally uncomfortable, partnering with countries who have questionable human rights records may be necessary.""It's clear that when women's football grows so much, the interest of other countries like Saudi Arabia will come,"" the Bayern Munich star told DW after their win over Eintracht Frankfurt. ""When there's a lot of money and there's a market that shows high growth, I think those two things simply come together.""I don't think you can avoid it. Whether it makes moral sense, is always another question but we know that money rules the world somehow.""""I don't know if you can really stop that. So perhaps you have to find a way somehow where you try to see it in a positive way and just try and have a good cooperation with Saudi Arabia.""You don't rule out a country, but rather look at how you can benefit from each other, and somehow make the best out of the whole thing.""Yet, earlier this week, Germany captain Alexandra Popp offered an opinion that chimed more with the statement both host nations expressed in a letter to FIFA condemning the potential sponsorship.Alongside numerous Human Rights groups, the Australia and New Zealand Football Associations questioned how the partnership could be possible, particularly given Saudi Arabia's stance on LGBTQ+ rights.""It is not an optimal sponsor for a women's World Cup and for what we women stand for,"" she said. ""That's why we are rather negative about the whole thing.""Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo signing for club Al Nassr on a two-and-a-half-year contract on December 30 signalled another important moment in the country's intent to shift focus solely onto their footballing abilities.The Saudi Pro League are still pursing the signature of Lionel Messi to renew his rivalry with Ronaldo but Visit Saudi have already successfully signed the forward as an ambassador, in an attempt to show tourists what they can expect from the country.FIFA also announced in February that Saudi Arabia will host the 2023 Club World Cup, between December 12-22, handing the country its first major FIFA tournament.The Middle Eastern state are also hoping to build on that success by reportedly preparing a joint-bid with Egypt and Greece to host the 2030 men's World Cup.Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/02/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813740,Infant body found in submerged car in flooded West Virginia,"The body of an infant was found in a submerged car Friday in southern West Virginia after floodwaters swept through the state, authorities said.

            The flooding came amid a string of thunderstorms that inundated the South and dumped nearly 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rain in parts of West Virginia. Thunderstorms were possible Friday from the Florida Panhandle to the North Carolina coast, National Weather Service forecaster Bob Oravec said.

            A woman called 911 saying her car was stuck in high water in the Fayette County town of Pax and she couldn’t find the baby. Sheriff Mike Fridley said in a statement Friday afternoon that the vehicle was found submerged with the 11-week-old boy inside. 











            Investigators determined the woman misjudged the water's depth and drove into the road until she realized it was too deep. She then attempted to remove the baby but the vehicle was swept away. 

            The area in which the vehicle was recovered had water as deep as 18 feet (5.5 meters). Visibility in the water was near zero due to muddy conditions, hampering the search. The incident remains under investigation, the statement said.

            West Virginia, where towns located along narrow river valleys dot the landscape, is no stranger to devastating floods. In June 2016, 23 people were killed in flooding statewide.

            “We cannot stress enough, the importance of not driving through flood waters,” Fridley said. “Water depth is very hard to judge, as well as it is hard to judge the speed of moving water.”

            In Mingo County, along West Virginia’s border with Kentucky and Virginia, a mudslide knocked over a few train cars loaded with coal, the county emergency services office said. 

            The mudslide was caused by the failure of a sediment ditch berm at a coal mining operation run by Coal-Mac LLC, state Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Terry Fletcher said in an email.

            The mudslide also uprooted one home and surrounded another with mud and water and at least one resident had to be assisted from their home. No injuries were reported and state police were investigating.

            The DEP ordered the coal operator to find temporary housing for impacted residents, stabilize and repair the area around the slide and remove mud and debris from the homes, Fletcher said. Equipment has been brought to the site to begin remediation.

            Officials called off school classes Friday in 10 counties in West Virginia. In Kanawha County, the state’s largest, school bus routes were changed or closed because of flooded roads. Gov. Jim Justice declared a state of emergency Thursday as the storms rolled through.

            In Lincoln County, floodwaters forced about 170 students from three different schools to hunker down Thursday night in an impromptu slumber party. 

            Schools in the county in the southern part of the state were dismissed two hours early on Thursday because of high water, which made many roads impassable. Parents who were able to drive to the schools were allowed to pick up their children, but many students were forced to stay put.

            Community members, stores and churches donated cots, blankets, pillows and other supplies and staff members stayed on site to supervise the students, school officials said. 

            Photos on Lincoln County High School’s Facebook page showed students playing board games in the cafeteria at the school in Hamlin. They watched a movie and some tossed a football and played basketball in the gymnasium. Pizza, juice boxes and other donated foods were spread out across tables. A similar situation played out among students from two elementary-middle schools in the county.

            After breakfast and lunch were served Friday, the floodwaters over roads still had not sufficiently receded, so school officials decided to make plans to serve dinner again. By Friday night, it was determined the water levels had fallen far enough to allow the students to leave.

            “We just put our last students on buses to go home, so we’re waiting to get confirmation that we delivered all those students,” Lincoln County school Superintendent Jeffrey Kelley said by telephone Friday night. “We've got a bunch of great people who are committed to kids and doing the right thing. That makes these tough situations a lot easier.”

            In Kansas City, Kansas, doctors at the University of Kansas issued a public caution after spending Thursday treating people who suffered broken wrists and concussions from falling after a freezing drizzle lasting eight to 10 hours coated pavement across the area with a thin glaze of ice. 

            Some parents had children in their arms when they tumbled, causing injuries to the youngsters, the hospital said in a news release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813741,Barcelona's rep jeopardized by payments to former referee,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona, the team that once awed the soccer world with its beautiful style on the field and its social commitment to being “more than a club,” is in danger of tarnishing its reputation with a scandal of its own making.

            Although the club denies doing anything wrong, a Spanish state prosecutor is probing Barcelona's payment of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain.

            Spanish soccer has been reeling since the story broken by radio station SER Catalunya earlier this week said Barcelona had paid 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million) from 2016-18 to a company belonging to former referee José María Enríquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish soccer federation’s refereeing committee from 1994-2018. Barcelona says the money was for techincal reports on referees and youth players. Those payments, which have yet to be linked to any illegal or improper activity by the club, came to light as part of a tax probe into the company.











            In response to that initial report, Barcelona issued a statement saying it was “aware of the investigations into payments of external companies.” The club said it had hired the company as an external consultant to produce “reports in video format of youth players from other clubs in Spain” and for “reports related to professional refereeing.”

            Getting reports on referees is common practice and clubs can pay other companies or have them prepared internally, as Barcelona now does. It’s not known if other clubs also got them from Enríquez Negreira's company.

            But new reports of even more money flowing from Camp Nou’s coffers to Enríquez Negreira emerged Friday in leading Spanish newspapers El Pais and El Mundo.

            According to El Pais, the payments by Barcelona to Enríquez Negreira reached 7 million euros ($7.5 million) and started back in 2001. If so, that would mean Barcelona kept paying Enríquez Negreira during different club presidents, including from 2003-10 under the first term of current president Joan Laporta, who again took charge in 2021.

            Meanwhile, El Mundo reported that Enríquez Negreira had threatened then-Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu to create a “scandal” when the club decided to stop paying for his company's services in 2018.

            In an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC on Friday, Bartomeu said he ended the contract with the company to reduce costs and that the club never tried to seek favor from referees. He added that in exchange for the money the club received referee reports “in written form and in DVD” for every game for its first team and its “B” team.

            “It looks like with this service we were asking for more penalties in our favor or that we wanted to condition the referees’ decision, but it is not true. This person (Enríquez Negreira) had zero power of the referees,” Bartomeu said.

            Former club president Joan Gaspart, who ran Barcelona from 2000-03, when the payments allegedly started, has denied any knowledge of them.

            Barcelona told The Associated Press it has started its own investigation with outside help to “guarantee maximum efficiency.”

            The state prosecutors office would not confirm the information published by El Pais and El Mundo when asked by the AP. It limited its response to saying that official investigations have been ongoing for months.

            Laporta has defended his club and said it is ""not a coincidence that this comes out now when the things are going well for the team,” which leads the Spanish league and is seeking its first league title since 2019.

            Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez even weighed in on the case.

            “We are going to wait for the governing bodies of the Spanish league to clarify the situation that unfortunately we are learning about through the media,” Sánchez said when asked about the matter while in Slovenia on Friday.

            The Spanish soccer federation and its referee committee have said that they will fully collaborate with the investigation. The federation said Enríquez Negreira has had no role in the organization since it changed administration in 2018.

            Luis Medina, who refereed from 1998-2009 and is now head of the committee that assigns referees to games, said this was a terrible moment for his guild.

            “I have been involved in refereeing for 40 years and this is the saddest moment I have gone through,” Medina said Thursday, adding ""I will put both my hands in the fire for every generation of referees that have given it their all on the field.”

            Medina said while he was actively refereeing he never received any pressure of any type from Enríquez Negreira or anyone else to influence a result or favor a team. He said Enríquez Negreira had a minor role and that “he was a man in the shadows, and we did not know exactly what his responsibilities were.”

            League president Javier Tebas said sporting sanctions such as loss of points or relegation would not be possible if any wrongdoing were proven because a three-year statute of limitations has already lapsed. Separate corruption charges, which would be criminal charges, would depend on the outcome of the investigation being conducted by prosecutors.

            Even so, the potential reputational damage could threaten to further mar the image of a club that rose to the top of the sport under Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola more than a decade ago.

            Back in 2006, Laporta agreed to pay Unicef, the United Nations Children’s Fund, to become the first sponsor name on Barcelona’s shirt while spurning lucrative deals, thus adding socially-minded luster to the winning club. But in recent years the Catalan club has been mired in scandals and the poor management of Bartomeu’s board, which left it so heavily indebted that it could no longer pay Messi’s salary.

            Current Barcelona coach Xavi Hernández, a leading player for the club from 1998-2015, defended the honor of the club and its players.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona, the team that once awed the soccer world with its beautiful style on the field and its social commitment to being “more than a club,” is in danger of tarnishing its reputation with a scandal of its own making.Although the club denies doing anything wrong, a Spanish state prosecutor is probing Barcelona's payment of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain.Spanish soccer has been reeling since the story broken by radio station SER Catalunya earlier this week said Barcelona had paid 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million) from 2016-18 to a company belonging to former referee José María Enríquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish soccer federation’s refereeing committee from 1994-2018. Barcelona says the money was for techincal reports on referees and youth players. Those payments, which have yet to be linked to any illegal or improper activity by the club, came to light as part of a tax probe into the company.In response to that initial report, Barcelona issued a statement saying it was “aware of the investigations into payments of external companies.” The club said it had hired the company as an external consultant to produce “reports in video format of youth players from other clubs in Spain” and for “reports related to professional refereeing.”Getting reports on referees is common practice and clubs can pay other companies or have them prepared internally, as Barcelona now does. It’s not known if other clubs also got them from Enríquez Negreira's company.But new reports of even more money flowing from Camp Nou’s coffers to Enríquez Negreira emerged Friday in leading Spanish newspapers El Pais and El Mundo.According to El Pais, the payments by Barcelona to Enríquez Negreira reached 7 million euros ($7.5 million) and started back in 2001. If so, that would mean Barcelona kept paying Enríquez Negreira during different club presidents, including from 2003-10 under the first term of current president Joan Laporta, who again took charge in 2021.Meanwhile, El Mundo reported that Enríquez Negreira had threatened then-Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu to create a “scandal” when the club decided to stop paying for his company's services in 2018.In an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC on Friday, Bartomeu said he ended the contract with the company to reduce costs and that the club never tried to seek favor from referees. He added that in exchange for the money the club received referee reports “in written form and in DVD” for every game for its first team and its “B” team.“It looks like with this service we were asking for more penalties in our favor or that we wanted to condition the referees’ decision, but it is not true. This person (Enríquez Negreira) had zero power of the referees,” Bartomeu said.Former club president Joan Gaspart, who ran Barcelona from 2000-03, when the payments allegedly started, has denied any knowledge of them.Barcelona told The Associated Press it has started its own investigation with outside help to “guarantee maximum efficiency.”The state prosecutors office would not confirm the information published by El Pais and El Mundo when asked by the AP. It limited its response to saying that official investigations have been ongoing for months.Laporta has defended his club and said it is ""not a coincidence that this comes out now when the things are going well for the team,” which leads the Spanish league and is seeking its first league title since 2019.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez even weighed in on the case.“We are going to wait for the governing bodies of the Spanish league to clarify the situation that unfortunately we are learning about through the media,” Sánchez said when asked about the matter while in Slovenia on Friday.The Spanish soccer federation and its referee committee have said that they will fully collaborate with the investigation. The federation said Enríquez Negreira has had no role in the organization since it changed administration in 2018.Luis Medina, who refereed from 1998-2009 and is now head of the committee that assigns referees to games, said this was a terrible moment for his guild.“I have been involved in refereeing for 40 years and this is the saddest moment I have gone through,” Medina said Thursday, adding ""I will put both my hands in the fire for every generation of referees that have given it their all on the field.”Medina said while he was actively refereeing he never received any pressure of any type from Enríquez Negreira or anyone else to influence a result or favor a team. He said Enríquez Negreira had a minor role and that “he was a man in the shadows, and we did not know exactly what his responsibilities were.”League president Javier Tebas said sporting sanctions such as loss of points or relegation would not be possible if any wrongdoing were proven because a three-year statute of limitations has already lapsed. Separate corruption charges, which would be criminal charges, would depend on the outcome of the investigation being conducted by prosecutors.Even so, the potential reputational damage could threaten to further mar the image of a club that rose to the top of the sport under Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola more than a decade ago.Back in 2006, Laporta agreed to pay Unicef, the United Nations Children’s Fund, to become the first sponsor name on Barcelona’s shirt while spurning lucrative deals, thus adding socially-minded luster to the winning club. But in recent years the Catalan club has been mired in scandals and the poor management of Bartomeu’s board, which left it so heavily indebted that it could no longer pay Messi’s salary.Current Barcelona coach Xavi Hernández, a leading player for the club from 1998-2015, defended the honor of the club and its players.“I am a fair person and I want to win games on the field,” Xavi said after Thursday’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United in the Europa League. “If I see that we cheat to win, I'm going home.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813742,"José Alvarado, Phillies agree to $22 million, 3-year deal","CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — Reliever José Alvarado and the Philadelphia Phillies agreed Friday to a $22 million, three-year contract, superseding a $3.45 million, one-year deal reached a week earlier that avoided salary arbitration.

            Alvarado gets a $50,000 signing bonus and a $3.45 million salary this year, then receives $9 million in each of the following two seasons. The Phillies have a $9 million option for 2026 with a $500,000 buyout.

            A 27-year-old left-hander, Alvarado would have been eligible for free agency after this season.











            He went 4-2 with a 3.18 ERA and two saves in 59 relief appearances last year.

            Alvarado had a 5.56 ERA in 12 postseason appearances for the NL champions, getting the win in the Game 5 pennant-clincher against San Diego. Alvarado failed to hold a one-run lead in the sixth inning of World Series Game 6, relieving Zack Wheeler with two on and giving up a long three-run homer to Houston’s Yordan Alvarez. The Astros went on to a 4-1 victory that won the title.

            Alvarado's deal calls for a $100,000 bonus for winning the World Series MVP or the Mariano Rivera/Trevor Hoffman reliever of the year award, and $50,000 for finishing second or third for the reliever honor. He would get $50,000 for making the All-Star team, winning an MVP or winning a Gold Glove.

            Alvarado had filed for $3.7 million and the Phillies for $3.2 million when teams and players exchanged proposed arbitration salaries last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813760,"Ex-PMs of UK, Australia, Belgium urge tough action on China","TOKYO (AP) — Former leaders from Australia, Britain and Belgium called Friday for a tougher international approach to China to reduce the possibility of war over Taiwan and respond to human rights violations.

            Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison linked human rights violations in China with security in the Indo-Pacific as he spoke at an Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China conference in Tokyo. He was joined by two other former leaders — Liz Truss from Britain and Guy Verhofstadt from Belgium.

            The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of lawmakers from more than 30 nations concerned about how democratic countries approach Beijing, hopes the event will spur more coordinated diplomacy toward China ahead of the next Group of Seven industrialized nations summit, scheduled in Hiroshima in May. 











            Morrison urged the Australian government to consider sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses against Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang autonomous region while also working on broader security issues.

            “My reason for highlighting these broader initiatives is to highlight that any attempts to address human rights violations in China will never be achieved in a region where China enjoys strategic hegemony,” Morrison said. 

            “It is only from the platform of a free and open Indo-Pacific that such worthy and important objectives can be practically pursued in a region that upholds and respects the global rules-based order.”

            Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Friday that she would not speculate on the likelihood of her government following Morrison’s advice. “I’m not sure how much advice it would be sensible to take from Mr. Morrison on foreign policy,” Wong told reporters in the Australian capital, Canberra.

            Truss urged the international community to coordinate defense, economic and political measures and take a tougher approach toward China to defend Taiwan “before it is too late.”

            “When it comes to China, a failure to act now could cost us dearly in the long run. Our governments must signal to (China) that military aggression towards Taiwan would be a strategic mistake,"" Truss said.

            China claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened to retake it by force if necessary.

            “We need this first and foremost to protect the interests of the people of Taiwan but it’s also to protect our interests, to ensure trade and free navigation with Taiwan can continue unimpeded,” Truss said. “We need it now, before it is too late.” 

            She said she regretted that Western nations were not fast and tough enough in taking action against Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year and that the world should learn a lesson from it.

            Truss also called for the use of economic power “for the good of freedom and democracy” and urged the Group of Seven nations and their allies to act as an economic version of NATO.

            “That economic weight means that we can influence other countries. It means we can make decisions about how we trade, where we invest, what technology we export,” she said. 

            Vehofstadt suggested a “new style” NATO that can contribute to global security by having a European defense union as a pillar to serve as a counter to China's assertiveness.

            “If we have the same interests from some of China’s unacceptable ambitions, then we need to link forces to face them together, and not separately,” Vehofstadt said. “Therefore, my plea today, NATO should evolve from an ‘Atlantic Treaty Organization’ into a ‘World Treaty Organization.'""

He was joined by two other former leaders — Liz Truss from Britain and Guy Verhofstadt from Belgium.The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of lawmakers from more than 30 nations concerned about how democratic countries approach Beijing, hopes the event will spur more coordinated diplomacy toward China ahead of the next Group of Seven industrialized nations summit, scheduled in Hiroshima in May.Morrison urged the Australian government to consider sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses against Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang autonomous region while also working on broader security issues.“My reason for highlighting these broader initiatives is to highlight that any attempts to address human rights violations in China will never be achieved in a region where China enjoys strategic hegemony,” Morrison said.“It is only from the platform of a free and open Indo-Pacific that such worthy and important objectives can be practically pursued in a region that upholds and respects the global rules-based order.”Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Friday that she would not speculate on the likelihood of her government following Morrison’s advice. “I’m not sure how much advice it would be sensible to take from Mr. Morrison on foreign policy,” Wong told reporters in the Australian capital, Canberra.Truss urged the international community to coordinate defense, economic and political measures and take a tougher approach toward China to defend Taiwan “before it is too late.”“When it comes to China, a failure to act now could cost us dearly in the long run. Our governments must signal to (China) that military aggression towards Taiwan would be a strategic mistake,"" Truss said.China claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened to retake it by force if necessary.“We need this first and foremost to protect the interests of the people of Taiwan but it’s also to protect our interests, to ensure trade and free navigation with Taiwan can continue unimpeded,” Truss said. “We need it now, before it is too late.”She said she regretted that Western nations were not fast and tough enough in taking action against Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year and that the world should learn a lesson from it.Truss also called for the use of economic power “for the good of freedom and democracy” and urged the Group of Seven nations and their allies to act as an economic version of NATO.“That economic weight means that we can influence other countries. It means we can make decisions about how we trade, where we invest, what technology we export,” she said.Vehofstadt suggested a “new style” NATO that can contribute to global security by having a European defense union as a pillar to serve as a counter to China's assertiveness.“If we have the same interests from some of China’s unacceptable ambitions, then we need to link forces to face them together, and not separately,” Vehofstadt said. “Therefore, my plea today, NATO should evolve from an ‘Atlantic Treaty Organization’ into a ‘World Treaty Organization.'""___Associated Press writer Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this report.",2023/02/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813785,Man United sale set to test UEFA rules on multi-club owners,"GENEVA (AP) — The sale of Manchester United is set to test European rules designed to protect soccer from the integrity risks of owners controlling multiple clubs.

            Three widely expected bids to buy the most storied brand in English soccer are closely tied to clubs already established in UEFA competitions like the Champions League, or have ambitions to break into the elite.

            State sovereign wealth funds from Qatar and Saudi Arabia already bought Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle, respectively, and British industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, a lifelong Man United fan, owns French club Nice.











            UEFA first fought a legal case against ""multi-club ownership” 25 years ago, and only this month warned of the risks this industry model poses for collusion on the field and in player transfers.

            The European soccer body has rules to bar clubs from its competitions in any season if owners have “decisive influence” over two clubs which qualify. A key test case was resolved in June 2017 after an investigation into Red Bull’s ownership of Leipzig and Salzburg. UEFA let both clubs enter the next Champions League.

            Other UEFA cases on separate matters in recent years involving PSG and Manchester City, plus the French club’s president, either were closed or ended with less severe consequences than had seemed possible during investigations.

            UEFA declined comment Friday and likely won't take a position on Man United’s next owner until the season ends. Entries for next season’s competitions will be clear after the Champions League final on June 10.

            UEFA RULES

            
                Article 5 of regulations in each UEFA competition — the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League — is about integrity and multi-club ownership.

            Clubs cannot hold shares or have management control in another club taking part in a UEFA competition, nor can individuals and legal entities have ownership or management control over more than one club.

            It is defined as “being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club.”

            Ratcliffe’s company, INEOS, would have a clear conflict. The Qatari proposal revealed Friday is led by Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) who is the son of a former prime minister.

            It could be difficult to prove Sheikh Jassim's investment vehicle is entirely separate from state-backed interests that fund Qatar Sports Investments at PSG.

            UEFA requires the club that qualified for “the most prestigious” competition to take its place while the other is excluded. The next tiebreaker is which club finished higher in its domestic league.

            A loophole to let both clubs play is if one qualified directly to the Champions League and the other qualified for the Europa Conference League. In that scenario, the two teams could not cross paths in the same competition.

            PREVIOUS CASES

            In the quarterfinals of the 1997-98 European Cup Winners’ Cup, three of the eight teams — AEK Athens, Slavia Prague and Vicenza — were part-owned by the same investor, known as ENIC. The company best known for owning Tottenham also had stakes in Rangers and Basel.

            Weeks later, the UEFA executive committee introduced the multi-club ownership rule. Slavia was accepted in the next UEFA Cup and AEK was excluded.

            The clubs appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled in their favor, saying UEFA “violated its duties of good faith and procedural fairness” enacting the rule so quickly.

            Enforcement was delayed, and in 2001 a conflict with Canal+ owning stakes in two UEFA Cup teams, PSG and Servette, led the broadcaster to sell the Swiss club.

            The anticipated potential conflict between Leipzig and Salzburg arrived in 2017. UEFA’s club finance investigators highlighted the “unusually high level of player loans/transfers” between the clubs and their “common visual identity/similar branding.”

            However, Salzburg said it “removed certain individuals who were allegedly linked to Red Bull,” a cooperation deal with Leipzig was ended, and sponsorship by Red Bull was scaled back.

            UEFA then accepted there was “insufficient evidence” of shared ownership. The teams eventually met in the 2018-19 Europa League and Salzburg won both games.

            If Man United’s new ownership ties are examined, the UEFA club investigation panel is now led by Sunil Gulati, an economics professor and former president of United States soccer federation.

            CURRENT POSITION

            Tough words from UEFA came last week in its annual financial study of clubs and leagues.

            “The rise of multi-club investment has the potential to pose a material threat to the integrity of European club competitions, with a growing risk of seeing two clubs with the same owner or investor facing each other on the pitch,” UEFA wrote.

            They identified “more than 180 clubs worldwide” in multi-club investment structure projects — about a five-fold increase in a decade — involving the careers of more than 6,500 players.

            The trend “has the potential to distort transfer activity,” the UEFA document said, with a risk of transfer fees set “at prices that suit investors, rather than at fair values.”

A key test case was resolved in June 2017 after an investigation into Red Bull’s ownership of Leipzig and Salzburg. UEFA let both clubs enter the next Champions League.Other UEFA cases on separate matters in recent years involving PSG and Manchester City, plus the French club’s president, either were closed or ended with less severe consequences than had seemed possible during investigations.UEFA declined comment Friday and likely won't take a position on Man United’s next owner until the season ends. Entries for next season’s competitions will be clear after the Champions League final on June 10.UEFA RULESArticle 5 of regulations in each UEFA competition — the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League — is about integrity and multi-club ownership.Clubs cannot hold shares or have management control in another club taking part in a UEFA competition, nor can individuals and legal entities have ownership or management control over more than one club.It is defined as “being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club.”Ratcliffe’s company, INEOS, would have a clear conflict.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813786,1979 Daytona 500 picked as NASCAR's most memorable race,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Take a ride through Daytona International Speedway’s main tunnel and photos of some of the most celebrated events in track history line the walls.

            One can’t be missed.

            It shows Cale Yarborough, helmet in hand, ready to unload on Bobby Allison and ignite a muddy, bloody slugfest in the 1979 Daytona 500 that turned the highly anticipated first live flag-to-flag broadcast of a race into a spectacle that stamped NASCAR on the national sports map.











            Who were these good ol’ boys on TV fighting instead of racing?

            The seminal moment legitimized the Daytona 500 in a flash — more like in a punch — and suddenly even traditional stick-and-ball fans were buzzing over NASCAR and the brawl that changed it all.

            
                The fight was a viral clip before such a term was even a thing and it's stood for 44 years near the top of the short list of most talked about, dissected and still-can’t-believe-it days over NASCAR’s first 74 years.

            As part of the celebration of NASCAR’s 75th season, The Associated Press interviewed 12 veteran contributors to the industry on topics ranging from the greatest drivers to key challenges ahead.

            With big names, a throwdown and a nation of viewers, the 1979 Daytona 500 was the winner in the AP survey as the most memorable race for its role as perhaps the most pivotal industry-changer in NASCAR history.

            “While there are dozens of potential honorable mentions, this one seems to be replayed in highlight films more than any other, which helps it qualify as most memorable in addition to most pivotal,” said longtime Motor Racing Network announcer Winston Kelly.

            Among the other races mentioned were Dale Earnhardt’s breakthrough 1998 Daytona 500 victory and Richard Petty’s 200th win in 1984 in the July Daytona race attended by President Ronald Reagan. Heck, Edsel Ford, long-time executive at the company that bears the name of his great-grandfather Henry Ford, couldn't narrow it down to just one.

            “I would say that any race that a Ford Motor Co. product won is my most memorable race,” Ford said.

            All suitable nominees. But the 1979 Daytona 500 race — it was Petty’s sixth win in the crown jewel race — was something special. More than 15 million people watched the race and all its aftermath. It stood as the highest-rated NASCAR race until 2001.

            The mayhem was triggered early in the race when Yarborough came up on brother Bobby and Donnie Allison and tapped Bobby’s rear bumper, sending all three cars careening through a muddy infield. All three drivers recovered, and Yarborough and Donnie Allison eventually battled for the lead before spinning out. 

            Yarborough later said Bobby Allison had slowed down to block him, then claimed Donnie knocked him into the grass. Bobby Allison had stopped his car near the crashed cars to see if Donnie needed a ride back to the garage. Yarborough confronted him through his window.

            “He ran toward me and started yelling at me,” Bobby told the AP in 2019 for a 40th-anniversary remembrance. “And then he hit me in the face with his helmet, which really surprised me. I still had my seatbelts on. I had my helmet on, and that shielded me a little bit, but it cut my nose and my lips.

            “By then, blood was dripping in my lap. I’ve either got to get out of the car and handle this or run from him the rest of my life. So I got out of my car and he went to beating on my fists with his nose.”

            While Yarborough and Allison traded haymakers in the Florida sun, it was actually a snowstorm that helped broaden the race’s exposure.

            The Daytona 500 was broadcast live in its entirety for the first time, reaching markets that knew little, if anything, about stock car racing. There was a blizzard that forced a large portion of the country inside. Cities were shut down, and TVs were turned on. 

            Deb Williams, an AP panelist now in her fourth decade of racing coverage, was pressed into service in her first year writing for UPI. She watched the race on TV at her parents' home in North Carolina — snow blanketed the house outside — and later wrote the story from the Raleigh bureau about fans that had banded together to pay Donnie Allison’s $6,000 fine.

            “There was just so much raw emotion of elements that people saw for the first time,” said Williams, who is covering her 29th Daytona 500 this year, for Autoweek.

            And not for the last.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813787,"Taliban claim attack on police in Pakistan's Karachi, 7 dead","KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Militants launched a deadly suicide attack on the police headquarters of Pakistan's largest city on Friday, officials said, as the sound of gunfire and explosions rocked the heart of Karachi for several hours.

            Three security forces and a civilian were killed and 18 security forces wounded, according to government officials and Ghulam Nabi Memon, police chief for the southern Sindh province where Karachi is located. Two suicide bombers were killed and at least one blew himself up after entering the police building, officials added.

            Pakistani Taliban in a brief statement claimed responsibility.











            Murtaza Wahab, a government adviser, confirmed that police and paramilitary forces in a joint operation had cleared the police building within three hours of the attack late Friday.

            “I confirm that the operation against the terrorists is over,” said Wahab.

            President Arif Alvi in a statement condemned the attack in Karachi, which is Pakistan's chief commercial city, while Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces for the successful operation.

            Earlier, TV footage showed officers surrounding the city’s central police station as residents reported the sound of explosions and gunfire. 

            Pakistan's Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan said some of the militants threw hand grenades as they tried to force their way into the police headquarters.

            Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since November when Pakistani Taliban ended a monthslong cease-fire with the government. 

            Pakistan's outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban is a separate group but are allies of the Taliban in Afghanistan, who seized power there more than a year ago as U.S. and NATO troops withdrew. The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan emboldened Pakistani militants, whose top leaders and fighters are hiding across the border.

            The brazen assault on Karachi's police headquarters comes two weeks after a suicide bomber disguised as a policeman killed 101 people at a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar.

            Authorities blamed the TTP for orchestrating last month’s mosque bombing and Sarbakaf Mohmand, a TTP commander, claimed responsibility for it.

                Posts misuse Ohio River map to distort contamination area
              











            CLAIM: Everyone living in the Ohio River basin, as shown in the yellow area of a map, should be concerned about the safety of their drinking water after the derailment of a train in East Palestine, Ohio, contaminated the river.

            THE FACTS: The map shows the region of land whose surface water drains into the Ohio River, not the region that gets its drinking water from the river. A Feb. 3 train derailment in Ohio, and the decision to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five of its cars to avoid an uncontrolled explosion, have sparked worries in local residents over whether their air and drinking water are safe. They’ve also generated a number of misleading and hyperbolic online claims about the degree to which the Ohio River and its surrounding states are affected. Social media posts with tens of thousands of shares this week used a map of the Ohio River drainage basin, which touches parts of 14 states, to falsely claim that the entire region needed to be concerned about contaminants that had been detected in the river after the derailment. Ohio officials in a news conference Tuesday did urge people in the East Palestine community to drink bottled water, especially if they use a private water source, until their water source can be tested. However, officials said, areas in Central Ohio were unlikely to be impacted. And water quality experts say the idea that the entire Ohio River basin needs to worry about its drinking water is wrong. The concentration of butyl acrylate, the only contaminant of concern that has been detected in the Ohio River, is much lower than the threshold considered hazardous, according to Patrick Ray, assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Cincinnati. That concentration will continue to decrease as it moves downstream, Ray said. It’s likely to be nearly undetectable when it reaches Cincinnati, he added. The Ohio EPA agreed that the contaminant amounts found so far don’t pose a risk for cities that rely on the river for its drinking water. What’s more, the use of a map of the entire Ohio River basin to suggest all areas are affected is misleading, according to Ray and Paul Ziemkiewicz, the director of the West Virginia University Water Research Institute. “Indeed, last time I checked water still flows downhill,” Ziemkiewicz said. “So, only water supplies downstream and within the Ohio River’s pool elevations would be potentially affected.” The Ohio River valley is the lowest point of the region pictured in the map, Ray explained. As a result, areas whose water flows downhill into the river, such as Kentucky, wouldn’t be affected by its contamination. Many areas pictured in the map also get their water from sources besides the Ohio River, he said. “This map is showing an extremely large region that includes many, many counties that have nothing to do with the Ohio River at all,” Ray said. The map’s creator, Karl Musser, confirmed to the AP in an email that it showed the Ohio River drainage basin, not areas that get their drinking water from the river. Even as the state EPA says cities that rely on Ohio River drinking water are not at risk, some water companies have shut off their intakes or increased treatment processes as a precaution, the AP has reported.

                Oregon cloud video misrepresented as Ohio derailment aftermath
              

            CLAIM: A video of a purple cloud looming over a street as a car drives underneath shows East Palestine, Ohio, after a recent freight train derailment and intentional burning of some of the hazardous chemicals on board.

            THE FACTS: The video was filmed in Portland, Oregon, and appeared online months before the February 2023 derailment. Local weather experts said that it resembled clouds they had seen before in Oregon, and that they could have been associated with a thunderstorm. Days after the train came off the tracks on Feb. 3 in the community near the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line, officials opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five of its rail cars, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky. While plenty of real photos and videos captured the sight, the video of a large, dark purple cloud overwhelming a dim blue and pink sky above an outdoor shopping center was filmed in Oregon, not Ohio. A reverse image search traced the video back to a TikTok user who posted it twice, first in November 2022. In a February video on her page, she explains that she filmed the clip herself in Jantzen Beach, Portland and that it is “several months old.” The video was filmed from North Tomahawk Island Drive at the Jantzen Beach Center shopping mall, a geolocation search confirms. The video captures a crosswalk and the hardware store Home Depot, which can also be seen on Google Street View. Meteorologists in Oregon said it looked like clouds they had seen in the state before. Larry O’Neill, associate professor and director of Oregon Climate Services at Oregon State University, said the cloud could have been associated with a thunderstorm, or could be a deck of altostratus clouds, a type of middle-altitude cloud that often takes up the whole sky. “Near sunrise or sunset, they can look dramatic from the lighting even though they are completely innocuous clouds,” he said. The East Palestine train derailment and burn did result in large plumes of smoke and released some hazardous gases into the surrounding air. Environmental officials said monitors detected toxins in the air at the site during the burn and that officials kept people away until that dissipated. They say continuing air monitoring done for the railroad and by government agencies — including testing inside nearly 400 homes — hasn’t detected dangerous levels in the area since residents were allowed to return.

                Posts misidentify Michigan State gunman amid shooting
              

            CLAIM: A photo shows 21-year-old Lynn Dee Walker, the suspect in the Michigan State University shooting.

            THE FACTS: The person in the image is not the gunman and has no connection to the shooting. Authorities have confirmed that the gunman who killed three students and wounded five before fatally shooting himself was 43-year-old Anthony McRae. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Monday night, some social media users shared an image of a man unrelated to the fatal shooting at the university and falsely identified him as the suspected gunman. “#BREAKING: Michigan State University SHOOTING SUSPECT is 21 year old ‘Lynn Dee Walker’ according to dispatch audio. He is still on the loose and considered armed and dangerous,” wrote one Twitter user shortly after news of the shooting broke. The post included two images of a man with brown hair, a beard and glasses. However, the person identified in the post is not the gunman, nor is his name Lynn Dee Walker, a moniker derived from an internet meme. The photo actually shows a writer based in Massachusetts who identified himself as Cameron Fuller in a phone interview with the AP. He said his image was being shared with the false claims. Fuller posted one of the photos of himself on his Twitter account on Oct. 3, 2020. Fuller said he’s been the target of false claims and attempts to reveal his personal information before because of his online presence and political ideology. The actual gunman was identified on Tuesday as McRae, a Lansing man who had a previous gun violation. He fatally shot himself after an hourslong manhunt. Investigators were still trying to determine a motive as of Friday.

            CLAIM: Statistics show that among members of Congress, 117 have bankrupted at least two businesses, 71 can’t receive credit cards due to bad credit and, in the last year, 84 have been arrested for drunk driving.

            THE FACTS: Those purported statistics have circulated via email and social media posts for years, but are not backed by evidence. In a TikTok video viewed by millions and also shared on Instagram, a 2012 video clip shows Mark Bailey, now chancellor of the Dallas Theological Seminary, relaying a text from a son and asking whether the statistics are “NBA or NFL?” “Thirty-six have been accused of spousal abuse. Seven have been arrested for fraud. Nineteen have been accused of writing bad checks,” he says. “One-hundred seventeen have directly or indirectly been bankrupted at least two businesses. Three have done time for assault. Seventy-one, I repeat 71, cannot get a credit card due to their bad credit. Fourteen have been arrested on drug-related charges. Eight have been arrested for shoplifting. Twenty-one currently are defendants in lawsuits and 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year.” Bailey adds: “How many of you think NBA? How many of you think NFL? Well the answer is neither. It’s the 435 members of the United States Congress.” But there is no factual support for those statistics, which have been routinely recycled in emails and social media posts for years — long before Bailey rattled them off in 2012. The purported numbers are largely lifted from a political blog post, whose author isn’t named, that was published in 1999. That post claimed to have scoured public records, media reports and court records, but it offered no specific sources for the information and didn’t offer details about the lawmakers supposedly accused of each crime. Experts contacted by the AP said they were unaware of any sources or databases that track crimes among members of Congress in such a way. “In general, I’ve never heard of such a list and doubt that one exists,” said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist and professor in Dartmouth College’s Department of Government. Bailey told the AP in an email that he was surprised to learn that people were circulating the video of him speaking in 2012 and reiterated that he was reading from a piece that a son passed along to him. “I haven’t used the piece since and with the information you sent – I wouldn’t unless I could fact check it,” he said.

            Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheckA roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___Posts misuse Ohio River map to distort contamination areaCLAIM: Everyone living in the Ohio River basin, as shown in the yellow area of a map, should be concerned about the safety of their drinking water after the derailment of a train in East Palestine, Ohio, contaminated the river.THE FACTS: The map shows the region of land whose surface water drains into the Ohio River, not the region that gets its drinking water from the river. A Feb. 3 train derailment in Ohio, and the decision to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five of its cars to avoid an uncontrolled explosion, have sparked worries in local residents over whether their air and drinking water are safe. They’ve also generated a number of misleading and hyperbolic online claims about the degree to which the Ohio River and its surrounding states are affected. Social media posts with tens of thousands of shares this week used a map of the Ohio River drainage basin, which touches parts of 14 states, to falsely claim that the entire region needed to be concerned about contaminants that had been detected in the river after the derailment. Ohio officials in a news conference Tuesday did urge people in the East Palestine community to drink bottled water, especially if they use a private water source, until their water source can be tested. However, officials said, areas in Central Ohio were unlikely to be impacted. And water quality experts say the idea that the entire Ohio River basin needs to worry about its drinking water is wrong. The concentration of butyl acrylate, the only contaminant of concern that has been detected in the Ohio River, is much lower than the threshold considered hazardous, according to Patrick Ray, assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Cincinnati. That concentration will continue to decrease as it moves downstream, Ray said. It’s likely to be nearly undetectable when it reaches Cincinnati, he added. The Ohio EPA agreed that the contaminant amounts found so far don’t pose a risk for cities that rely on the river for its drinking water. What’s more, the use of a map of the entire Ohio River basin to suggest all areas are affected is misleading, according to Ray and Paul Ziemkiewicz, the director of the West Virginia University Water Research Institute. “Indeed, last time I checked water still flows downhill,” Ziemkiewicz said. “So, only water supplies downstream and within the Ohio River’s pool elevations would be potentially affected.” The Ohio River valley is the lowest point of the region pictured in the map, Ray explained. As a result, areas whose water flows downhill into the river, such as Kentucky, wouldn’t be affected by its contamination. Many areas pictured in the map also get their water from sources besides the Ohio River, he said. “This map is showing an extremely large region that includes many, many counties that have nothing to do with the Ohio River at all,” Ray said. The map’s creator, Karl Musser, confirmed to the AP in an email that it showed the Ohio River drainage basin, not areas that get their drinking water from the river. Even as the state EPA says cities that rely on Ohio River drinking water are not at risk, some water companies have shut off their intakes or increased treatment processes as a precaution, the AP has reported.— Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report.___Oregon cloud video misrepresented as Ohio derailment aftermathCLAIM: A video of a purple cloud looming over a street as a car drives underneath shows East Palestine, Ohio, after a recent freight train derailment and intentional burning of some of the hazardous chemicals on board.THE FACTS: The video was filmed in Portland, Oregon, and appeared online months before the February 2023 derailment. Local weather experts said that it resembled clouds they had seen before in Oregon, and that they could have been associated with a thunderstorm. Days after the train came off the tracks on Feb. 3 in the community near the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line, officials opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five of its rail cars, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky. While plenty of real photos and videos captured the sight, the video of a large, dark purple cloud overwhelming a dim blue and pink sky above an outdoor shopping center was filmed in Oregon, not Ohio. A reverse image search traced the video back to a TikTok user who posted it twice, first in November 2022. In a February video on her page, she explains that she filmed the clip herself in Jantzen Beach, Portland and that it is “several months old.” The video was filmed from North Tomahawk Island Drive at the Jantzen Beach Center shopping mall, a geolocation search confirms. The video captures a crosswalk and the hardware store Home Depot, which can also be seen on Google Street View. Meteorologists in Oregon said it looked like clouds they had seen in the state before. Larry O’Neill, associate professor and director of Oregon Climate Services at Oregon State University, said the cloud could have been associated with a thunderstorm, or could be a deck of altostratus clouds, a type of middle-altitude cloud that often takes up the whole sky. “Near sunrise or sunset, they can look dramatic from the lighting even though they are completely innocuous clouds,” he said. The East Palestine train derailment and burn did result in large plumes of smoke and released some hazardous gases into the surrounding air. Environmental officials said monitors detected toxins in the air at the site during the burn and that officials kept people away until that dissipated. They say continuing air monitoring done for the railroad and by government agencies — including testing inside nearly 400 homes — hasn’t detected dangerous levels in the area since residents were allowed to return.— Associated Press writers Ali Swenson and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed this report.___Posts misidentify Michigan State gunman amid shootingCLAIM: A photo shows 21-year-old Lynn Dee Walker, the suspect in the Michigan State University shooting.THE FACTS: The person in the image is not the gunman and has no connection to the shooting. Authorities have confirmed that the gunman who killed three students and wounded five before fatally shooting himself was 43-year-old Anthony McRae. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Monday night, some social media users shared an image of a man unrelated to the fatal shooting at the university and falsely identified him as the suspected gunman. “#BREAKING: Michigan State University SHOOTING SUSPECT is 21 year old ‘Lynn Dee Walker’ according to dispatch audio. He is still on the loose and considered armed and dangerous,” wrote one Twitter user shortly after news of the shooting broke. The post included two images of a man with brown hair, a beard and glasses. However, the person identified in the post is not the gunman, nor is his name Lynn Dee Walker, a moniker derived from an internet meme. The photo actually shows a writer based in Massachusetts who identified himself as Cameron Fuller in a phone interview with the AP. He said his image was being shared with the false claims. Fuller posted one of the photos of himself on his Twitter account on Oct. 3, 2020. Fuller said he’s been the target of false claims and attempts to reveal his personal information before because of his online presence and political ideology. The actual gunman was identified on Tuesday as McRae, a Lansing man who had a previous gun violation. He fatally shot himself after an hourslong manhunt. Investigators were still trying to determine a motive as of Friday.— Associated Press writers Graph Massara in San Francisco and Sophia Tulp in New York contributed this report.___Video recycles dubious statistics about lawmakers’ crimesCLAIM: Statistics show that among members of Congress, 117 have bankrupted at least two businesses, 71 can’t receive credit cards due to bad credit and, in the last year, 84 have been arrested for drunk driving.THE FACTS: Those purported statistics have circulated via email and social media posts for years, but are not backed by evidence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813789,Nigeria police deploy for security before presidential vote,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria will deploy more than 400,000 security personnel ahead of the presidential election next week amid fears that Islamic extremists or secessionists could try to disrupt the vote.

             The security forces also will be on hand in case of violent protests, Usman Baba, Nigeria’s Inspector-General of Police, told reporters.

            “The Nigeria police with the support of other security agencies have perfected plans to deploy in a coordinated and collaborative manner,"" he said.











            The West African nation is set to elect a new president as it is confronted by a myriad of security problems: an Islamic extremist insurgency linked to the Islamic State group in the northeast, armed rebels in the northwest, and secessionists in the southeast.

            The security challenges bring a “critical, serious threat to Nigeria’s democracy,” according to Bulama Bukarti, a senior fellow with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. 

            “The non-state armed groups are going to do whatever they can do — using every arm in their arsenal — to see that Nigeria’s election gets disrupted,” Bukarti said.

            At least two security operatives will guard each of the more than 175,000 polling stations across the country's 36 states, Nigeria’s police chief said.

            In southeastern Nigeria, a series of attacks already have targeted dozens of election commission offices and security posts, raising fears that voters will be afraid to cast their ballots on election day. The southeast region is home to a separatist movement blamed for the recent violence.

            “We have made adequate arrangements to mark our presence in those areas in a lot of ways,” said police chief Baba, adding that more officers are being deployed there and that tents will be used in place of the destroyed offices.

            Nigeria’s security forces are also anticipating post-election violence once results are announced.

            “We are prepared to confront any situation that will need special intervention,"" he said.

            The police chief also expressed concerns about the ongoing shortage of cash and petrol in many Nigerian states. There already have been violent protests and attacks on banks, and the situation could mean more work for already overstretched security forces, he said.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria will deploy more than 400,000 security personnel ahead of the presidential election next week amid fears that Islamic extremists or secessionists could try to disrupt the vote.The security forces also will be on hand in case of violent protests, Usman Baba, Nigeria’s Inspector-General of Police, told reporters.“The Nigeria police with the support of other security agencies have perfected plans to deploy in a coordinated and collaborative manner,"" he said.The West African nation is set to elect a new president as it is confronted by a myriad of security problems: an Islamic extremist insurgency linked to the Islamic State group in the northeast, armed rebels in the northwest, and secessionists in the southeast.The security challenges bring a “critical, serious threat to Nigeria’s democracy,” according to Bulama Bukarti, a senior fellow with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.“The non-state armed groups are going to do whatever they can do — using every arm in their arsenal — to see that Nigeria’s election gets disrupted,” Bukarti said.At least two security operatives will guard each of the more than 175,000 polling stations across the country's 36 states, Nigeria’s police chief said.In southeastern Nigeria, a series of attacks already have targeted dozens of election commission offices and security posts, raising fears that voters will be afraid to cast their ballots on election day.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813793,Everything you need to know about the 2023 Academy Awards,"NEW YORK (AP) — Hollywood is gearing up for the 95th Academy Awards, where “Everything Everywhere All at Once” comes in the lead nominee and the film industry will hope to move past “the slap” of last year’s ceremony. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2023 Oscars, including when they are, where to watch the live show and this year’s controversies. 

            ___

            WHEN ARE THE OSCARS?











            The Oscars will be held Sunday, March 12, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The ceremony is set to begin at 8 p.m. EST and be broadcast live on ABC. 

            CAN YOU STREAM THE OSCARS?

            The broadcast can be streamed with a subscription to Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, AT&T TV and Fubo TV. Some of these services offer brief free trials. You can also stream the show on ABC.com and on the ABC app by authenticating your provider. 

            WHO’S HOSTING?

            
                Jimmy Kimmel will host for the third time and his first time since 2018. That was also the last Oscars to feature a solo host. The show went hostless for several years after Kimmel's last outing. Last year, Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes hosted as a trio. In an ad for this year’s show styled after “Top Gun: Maverick,” Kimmel made his humble case for being the right person for the job while noting that he can’t get slapped because “I cry a lot.”

            WHAT’S NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE AT THE 2023 OSCARS?

            The 10 movies competing for best picture are: “All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “The Banshees of Inisherin,” “Elvis,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “The Fabelmans,” “Tár,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “Women Talking.” Here's a guide to how you can watch them. 

            WHAT’S IN STORE FOR THE SHOW?

            The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences is yet to announce presenters. But it has said that winners to all categories will be announced live on the show. (Last year, some categories were taped in a pre-show, something that caused an uproar among academy members.) Nominees for best song are often performed, and the academy confirms that Rihanna will perform “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” on the show. There's no word yet on whether the show will feature Lady Gaga’s “Hold My Hand,” from “Top Gun: Maverick” or Kala Bhairava’s “Naatu Naatu,” from “RRR” — two other buzzy original song nominees.

            WHO ARE THE FAVORITES?

            Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s indie sci-fi hit “Everything Everywhere All at Once” comes in with a leading 11 nominations. Close on its heels, though, is the Irish friends-falling-out dark comedy “The Banshees of Inisherin,” with nine nods, a total matched by Netflix’s WWI film “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) may have a slight edge on Cate Blanchett (“Tár”) for best actress. Best actor is harder to call, with Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”), Colin Farrell (“Banshees”) and Austin Butler (“Elvis”) in the mix. In the supporting categories, Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”) and Ke Huy Quan (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) are the frontrunners. Steven Spielberg (“The Fabelmans”) may win his third best director Oscar, though the Daniels could also pull off the upset.

            WHAT’S BEEN CONTROVERSIAL THIS YEAR?

            Aside from the usual snubs and surprises, this year’s biggest to-do has been the debate surrounding Andrea Riseborough’s unexpected nomination for best actress. Riseborough was nominated for the little-seen Texas-set drama “To Leslie” after many A-list stars rallied around her performance. When two other best-actress contenders — Danielle Deadwyler (“Till”) and Viola Davis (“Woman King”) — were snubbed, some saw that as a reflection of racial bias in the film industry. The academy launched an inquiry into the star-studded, grassroots campaign for Riseborough but found no reason to rescind her nomination. 

            WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR?

            Just the reading of the title to one of this year’s short film nominees should prompt a wave of giggles. John Williams (“The Fabelmans”), up for best score, is the oldest nominee ever, at 90 years old. After historic back-to-back best-director wins by Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”), no women were nominated this year for best director. Also don’t expect to see Will Smith at the Oscars anytime soon. After striking Chris Rock at last year’s ceremony, Smith was banned by the film academy from attending for 10 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813795,Bodies of 18 migrants found in abandoned truck in Bulgaria,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Police in Bulgaria on Friday discovered an abandoned truck containing the bodies of 18 migrants, who appeared to have suffocated to death.

            The Interior Ministry said that according to initial information, the truck was carrying about 40 migrants and the survivors were taken to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment. 

            Bulgarian Health Minister Assen Medzhidiev said most of the survivors were in very bad condition.











            “They have suffered from lack of oxygen, their clothes are wet, they are freezing, and obviously haven’t eaten for days,” Medzhidiev said.

            The truck was found abandoned on a highway near the capital, Sofia. The driver was not there, but police discovered the passengers in a secret compartment below a load of timber.

            Authorities did not immediately give the nationalities of the migrants. Bulgarian media reported they all were from Afghanistan.

            Bulgaria, a Balkan country of 7 million and the poorest member of the European Union, is located on a major route for migrants from the Middle East and Afghanistan seeking to enter Europe from Turkey. Very few plan to stay, with most using Bulgaria as a transit corridor on their way westward. 

            Bulgaria has erected a barbed-wire fence along its 259-kilometer (161-mile) border with Turkey, but with the help of local human traffickers many migrants still manage to enter.

            In Britain in October 2019, police found the bodies of 39 people inside a refrigerated container that had been hauled to England. British police said all the victims, who ranged in age from 15 to 44, came from impoverished villages in Vietnam and were believed to have paid smugglers to take them on a risky journey to better lives abroad.

            Police said they died of a combination of a lack of oxygen and overheating in an enclosed space. The truck discovered in the town of Grays, east of London, had arrived in England on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813796,Russia expels 4 Austrian diplomats in retaliatory move,"MOSCOW (AP) — Moscow has asked four Austrian diplomats to leave Russia in retaliation for the expulsion earlier this month of four Russian diplomats from Vienna.

            Austria had accused the Russian diplomats of spying, and Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Friday defended their Feb. 2 expulsion. He said Austria would not watch idly “while espionage occurs in our country and hospitality is abused.”

            In announcing the expulsion of the Austrian diplomats on Thursday, Russia's Foreign Ministry called the earlier act by Austria “unfriendly and unreasonable,"" calling into question Austria's “previously positioning itself as an unbiased and neutral state.”











            Nehammer rejected the claim that Austria isn’t neutral anymore.

            Western European nations and Russia have expelled each others' diplomats on several occasions following the Russian military operation in Ukraine that started nearly a year ago. Austria, a European Union member that has a policy of military neutrality, was initially hesitant to take such action, but expelled four Russian diplomats in April after pressure from the public and EU partners.

            The Russian diplomats had been given a week to leave Austria. Russia said the Austrian diplomats had until Feb. 23 to go.

            Moscow also said Vienna was making it difficult for Russian officials to obtain visas, “which contradicts Austria’s obligations as a venue for international meetings.”MOSCOW (AP) — Moscow has asked four Austrian diplomats to leave Russia in retaliation for the expulsion earlier this month of four Russian diplomats from Vienna.Austria had accused the Russian diplomats of spying, and Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Friday defended their Feb. 2 expulsion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813798,"US ends search for objects shot down over Alaska, Lake Huron","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday that it has ended its search for airborne objects that were shot down near Deadhorse, Alaska, and over Lake Huron on Feb. 10 and 12.

            The statement released late Friday came hours after officials said the U.S. has finished efforts to recover the remnants of the large balloon that was shot down Feb. 4 off the coast of South Carolina, and analysis of the debris so far reinforces conclusions that it was a Chinese spy balloon.

            Officials said the U.S. believes that Navy, Coast Guard and FBI personnel collected all of that balloon's debris off the ocean floor, which included key equipment from the payload that could reveal what information it was able to monitor and collect. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said a significant amount of debris was recovered and it included “electronics and optics” from the payload. He declined to say what, if anything, the U.S. has learned from the wreckage so far.











            U.S. Northern Command said in a statement that the recovery operations ended Thursday and the final pieces are on their way to the FBI lab in Virginia for analysis. It said air and maritime restrictions off South Carolina have been lifted. 

            Northern Command said later that the decision to end the search for the objects shot down over Alaska and Lake Huron came after the U.S. and Canada “conducted systematic searches of each area using a variety of capabilities, including airborne imagery and sensors, surface sensors and inspections, and subsurface scans, and did not locate debris.” Northern Command said air and maritime safety perimeters were also being lifted at both those sites.

            The announcements capped three dramatic weeks that saw U.S. fighter jets shoot down four airborne objects — the large Chinese balloon on Feb. 4 and three much smaller objects about a week later over Canada, Alaska and Lake Huron. They are the first known peacetime shootdowns of unauthorized objects in U.S. airspace.

            While the military is confident the balloon shot down off South Carolina was a surveillance airship operated by China, the Biden administration has admitted that the three smaller objects were likely civilian-owned balloons that were targeted during the heightened response, after U.S. homeland defense radars were recalibrated to detect slower moving airborne items.

            Much of the Chinese balloon fell into about 50 feet (15 meters) of water, and the Navy was able to collect remnants floating on the surface, and divers and unmanned naval vessels pulled up the rest from the bottom of the ocean. Northern Command said Friday that all of the Navy and Coast Guard ships have left the area.

            On Thursday, President Joe Biden directed national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead an interagency team to establish “sharper rules” to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects.

            Meanwhile, key questions about the Chinese balloon remain unanswered, including what, if any, intelligence it was able to collect as it flew over sensitive military sites in the United States, and whether it was able to transmit anything back to China.

            The U.S. tracked it for several days after it left China, said a U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. It appears to have been blown off its initial trajectory, which was toward the U.S. territory of Guam, and ultimately flew over the continental U.S., the official said.

            Balloons and other unidentified objects have been previously spotted over Guam, a strategic hub for the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the western Pacific.

            It’s unclear how much control China retained over the balloon once it veered from its original trajectory. A second U.S. official said the balloon could have been externally maneuvered or directed to loiter over a specific target, but it’s unclear whether Chinese forces did so.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813800,Spain orders extradition of British alleged hacker to U.S.,"MADRID (AP) — Spain’s National Court has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. of a British citizen who allegedly took part in computer attacks, including the July 2020 hacking of Twitter accounts of public figures such as Joseph Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Gates.

            A court statement Friday said requirements had been met for handing over Joseph James O’Connor to U.S. authorities for 14 charges covering crimes such as revelation of secrets, membership of a criminal gang, illegal access to computer systems, internet fraud, money laundering and extortion.

            O’Connor, 23, from Liverpool, England was arrested in the southern Spanish coastal town of Estepona in July 2021.











            He is accused of hacking some 130 Twitter accounts. The court document said he is also wanted for hacking the Snapchat account of an unidentified public figure whom he allegedly tried to extort with the threat of publishing nude photographs of the person.

            He is also wanted for several cases of “swatting,” prank calls to emergency services aimed at getting large numbers of police to be sent to different locations.

            The court rejected arguments by O’Connor’s lawyers that he should be tried in Spain since the servers he used were located there.

            The statement said he is wanted by courts in the Northern District of California and the Southern District of New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813801,Taliban: Former Afghan female lawmaker’s killer arrested,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Security forces have arrested a man allegedly behind the killing of former Afghan female lawmaker Mursal Nabizada, a Taliban spokesman said Friday.

            Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the capital Kabul's police chief, claimed that the arrested man had “confessed to his crime” of killing Nabizada and her bodyguard earlier this year. The police investigation was ongoing, he added.

            Nabizada was among the few female parliamentarians who stayed in Kabul after the Taliban seized power in August 2021. Nabizada’s brother was also wounded in the attack. It was the first time a lawmaker from the previous administration was killed in the city since the Taliban takeover. 











            Nabizada was elected in 2019 to represent Kabul and stayed in office until the Taliban takeover. She was originally from eastern Nangarhar province. She also worked at a private non-governmental group, the Institute for Human Resources Development and Research.

            But they have progressively imposed more restrictions, particularly on women. They have banned women and girls from schooling beyond the sixth grade, barred them from most jobs and demanded they cover their faces when outside.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Security forces have arrested a man allegedly behind the killing of former Afghan female lawmaker Mursal Nabizada, a Taliban spokesman said Friday.Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the capital Kabul's police chief, claimed that the arrested man had “confessed to his crime” of killing Nabizada and her bodyguard earlier this year. The police investigation was ongoing, he added.Nabizada was among the few female parliamentarians who stayed in Kabul after the Taliban seized power in August 2021. Nabizada’s brother was also wounded in the attack. It was the first time a lawmaker from the previous administration was killed in the city since the Taliban takeover.Nabizada was elected in 2019 to represent Kabul and stayed in office until the Taliban takeover. She was originally from eastern Nangarhar province. She also worked at a private non-governmental group, the Institute for Human Resources Development and Research.After their takeover, the Taliban initially said they would not impose the same harsh rules over society as they did during their first rule of Afghanistan in the late 1990s.But they have progressively imposed more restrictions, particularly on women.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813802,Flurry of activity signals deal is near on Brexit trade feud,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K, the European Union and Northern Ireland’s bitterly divided political parties said Friday that progress was being made on resolving a post-Brexit trade dispute that brought economic headaches and political turmoil to the region.

            A flurry of political and diplomatic activity signaled a potential breakthrough after months of talks and political gridlock. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak flew to Belfast for talks with political leaders, and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly met EU chief negotiator Maroš Šefčovič in Brussels.

            “Intensive work continues,” Cleverly tweeted. Šefčovič posted: “Constructive engagement. Good progress.”











            Sunak was upbeat after a day of meetings, but said “there’s work to do.”

            “We haven’t got a deal yet,” he said.

            Sunak is also due to discuss Brexit with other European leaders this weekend on the margins of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

            Any deal faces a tough audience: unionist politicians who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K. collapsed the Belfast power-sharing government almost a year ago because of their opposition to the existing trade arrangements with the EU.

            However, Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the biggest unionist group, the Democratic Unionist Party, was unusually upbeat after his meeting with Sunak in Belfast.

            “On some very important issues, I think there has been real progress, but there remain some outstanding issues that we need to get over the line,” Donaldson said. “We will then examine the final text of any agreement and come to our decision.”

            Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein generally approves of the post-Brexit trade rules. But party leader Mary Lou McDonald said Friday it was “very much game on” for a deal to resolve the dispute over them.

            “It’s clear now that significant progress has been made, and we’re very heartened by that,” she said.

            Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member nation, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the British government and the EU agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of the peace process that ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.

            Instead, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. British unionist politicians there are fiercely opposed to the arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Unionists say the new trade border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom, and are refusing to return to government until the trade rules are redrawn.

            Britain has sought to change the agreement to eliminate most of the customs checks. For months, U.K.-EU talks went nowhere in an atmosphere of mistrust and recrimination. Britain threatened to unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, and the EU accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.

            But the mood has improved since Sunak, a pragmatic supporter of Brexit, took office in late October, replacing pugnacious predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, who delighted in riling the EU.

            The U.K. hopes to resolve the dispute and restore Northern Ireland’s government before the 25th anniversary in April of Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace accord. The British government hopes U.S. President Joe Biden will visit to mark the peace milestone.

            However, any compromise by Sunak is sure to anger staunch Brexiteers, who form a powerful faction inside the prime minister's Conservative Party.

            The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules. That role was agreed by Britain and the EU in the Brexit divorce deal, but the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the European court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters.

            Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a deal was “not there yet” but he was “quietly confident” one would be struck.

            “I do believe the prospect is there of having an agreement possibly within a week,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813804,"Fed's Barkin: 'Slow progress' on inflation, sees more hikes","WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Federal Reserve official downplayed recent signs that the economy is strengthening, but also said he is prepared to keep raising interest rates in smaller increments as often as needed to quell inflation. 

            Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said Friday that recent data showing an unusually robust job gain and a spike in retail sales last month reflected in part the impact of warm weather and the government's seasonal adjustment process, rather than an acceleration of growth that could push inflation higher. 

            “I'm not taking as much signal from the data that we’ve gotten recently,"" Barkin said in a roundtable with reporters. Though he added that could change ""if you start to see it for multiple months."" Barkin is a member of the Fed's 19-person interest rate setting committee.











            The strong jobs and retail sales reports, along with hotter-than-expected inflation figures, have prompted several Wall Street economists to pencil in more interest rate hikes by the Fed this year. Those increases will likely raise borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and for business loans.

            Economists from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs both now expect the Fed will lift rates to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, a quarter-point higher than the Fed itself projected at its December meeting. Its rate is currently 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years. 

            Barkin's comments follow tougher talk from other Fed officials earlier this week, such as Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, which has pushed stock and bond prices lower as investors increasingly expect more rate hikes. 

            In his remarks, Barkin also cautioned that measures of underlying inflation remain high and may require additional rate increases. He said he was comfortable with raising rates a quarter-point at a time, rather than moving back to the larger increases of a half-point or more that the Fed implemented last year. 

            “I like the (quarter-point) path because I believe it gives us the flexibility to respond to the economy as it comes in,” he said. “And that means that I’m comfortable raising rates potentially more often to a higher level.” 

            On Thursday, Mester said that she had seen a “compelling” case to raise the Fed’s benchmark rate by a half-point at its Feb. 1 meeting, the same increase it implemented in December. Instead, the Fed put in place a quarter-point hike. 

            Inflation accelerated from December to January, and core prices excluding food and energy also rose more quickly than economists expected. Overall, prices were 6.4% higher last month compared with a year ago, barely below December’s 6.5% reading. 

            “It is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of inflation matters and it is still too high,” Mester said. Last month’s report showed “no improvement in underlying inflation.” 

            St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also said Thursday he would have preferred a half-point hike Feb. 1, according to news reports. He said he wanted to move the Fed’s rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% as fast as possible. 

            Barkin, however, said he did not support quickly pushing rates to a specific point and then pausing. He said there is too much uncertainty about the economy's future path and what impact the Fed's rate increases will have and when to take that approach. Instead, he prefers quarter-point hikes as needed to bring down inflation.WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Federal Reserve official downplayed recent signs that the economy is strengthening, but also said he is prepared to keep raising interest rates in smaller increments as often as needed to quell inflation.Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said Friday that recent data showing an unusually robust job gain and a spike in retail sales last month reflected in part the impact of warm weather and the government's seasonal adjustment process, rather than an acceleration of growth that could push inflation higher.“I'm not taking as much signal from the data that we’ve gotten recently,"" Barkin said in a roundtable with reporters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813805,Indonesian police fire tear gas to disperse soccer fans,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian police fired tear gas outside a soccer stadium to disperse fans who were trying to force their way into a match in Central Java province on Friday, months after the use of tear gas in another stadium caused one of the world's worst sporting disasters.

            No injuries were reported on Friday, when thousands of supporters of PSIS Semarang fled tear gas at the entrance to Jatidiri Stadium in Semarang city after they attempted to enter the closed-door match to support their team against Persis Solo, a team from Surakarta city.

            Organizers and police had decided to hold the match without spectators to avoid possible violence. 











            Semarang Police Chief Irwan Anwar said the decision was made because of the experience from the previous match between the two teams in Surakarta, when PSIS Semarang supporters were attacked as they returned home.

            Fans attempting to enter the stadium pushed and then threw objects at police officers who tried to hold them back. The officers first used a water cannon and then fired tear gas.

            “The use of tear gas was carried out in accordance with the procedures for using force and was outside the match venue, not inside the stadium,” said Semarang Deputy Police Chief Yuswanto Ardi. 

            Last October, police used tear gas to halt fans from rushing onto the pitch in a stadium in East Java's Malang city, setting off a panicked run for the exits in which 135 people died.

            Prosecutors charged five men — three police officials who allowed or ordered officers to use tear gas, the chair of the organizing committee and the security chief — with criminal negligence causing death and bodily harm, which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail. 

            An investigation team set up by President Joko Widodo in response to a national outcry over the deaths concluded that the tear gas was the main cause of the crowd surge. It said police on duty had no knowledge that the use of tear gas is prohibited at soccer stadiums and used it “indiscriminately” on the field, in the stands and outside the stadium, causing more than 42,000 spectators inside the 36,000-seat stadium to rush to the exits — several of which were locked.

            It was among the deadliest soccer-related tragedies since a 1964 crush in Peru killed over 300 people.

            Soccer is the most popular sport in Indonesia and the domestic league is widely followed. Fans are strongly attached to their clubs, and the fanaticism often results in violence and hooliganism.JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian police fired tear gas outside a soccer stadium to disperse fans who were trying to force their way into a match in Central Java province on Friday, months after the use of tear gas in another stadium caused one of the world's worst sporting disasters.No injuries were reported on Friday, when thousands of supporters of PSIS Semarang fled tear gas at the entrance to Jatidiri Stadium in Semarang city after they attempted to enter the closed-door match to support their team against Persis Solo, a team from Surakarta city.Organizers and police had decided to hold the match without spectators to avoid possible violence.Semarang Police Chief Irwan Anwar said the decision was made because of the experience from the previous match between the two teams in Surakarta, when PSIS Semarang supporters were attacked as they returned home.Fans attempting to enter the stadium pushed and then threw objects at police officers who tried to hold them back.

            Lanao del Sur Governor Mamintal Alonto Adiong Jr. was shot in the waist, an aide was injured in the feet, and four bodyguards were killed by heavily armed men as their convoy passed through a village on the boundary of Lanao del Sur and Bukidnon provinces, police said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813808,Hurricanes' outdoor game marks another Sun Belt push for NHL,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Hurricanes were days away from hosting an NHL Stadium Series outdoor game and Don Waddell was feeling the stress of hoping that everything goes smoothly and the thrill of the opportunity ahead.

            It’s the same mix of emotions for NHL organizers, too.

            “It’s very exciting because we’re going to expose the game of hockey to a lot of people in the region here that have never been exposed to our game,” said Waddell, Carolina’s president and general manager.











            The Hurricanes face the Washington Capitals in Saturday night’s game at Carter-Finley Stadium, home to North Carolina State's college football team and just across the street from their home ice at PNC Arena. The game, delayed two years because of COVID-19 attendance restrictions, is set to draw a sellout crowd of roughly 57,000.

            Beyond Saturday, there is additional significance: It marks another season that the league known for its “Original Six” roots in cities like New York, Chicago and Toronto is holding marquee outdoor events in a so-called “nontraditional” market within its southern footprint.

            Three years ago was Dallas. Last year was Nashville. Now it’s North Carolina’s capital city grabbing a spotlight for professional hockey in a region long associated with college football.

            “This city has embraced us,” said Steve Mayer, the NHL’s chief content officer and event producer. “I think one of the things we’ve noticed being here is just the talk everywhere we go. We’re in a restaurant and the waiter or waitress comes up and they’re talking about the game, an Uber driver talking about the game, at our hotel. The buzz is really out there.”

            Sean Henry, president and chief executive of the Nashville Predators, understands that feeling.

            The Predators hosted last year’s Stadium Series game at the home of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. Nashville had previously hosted the 2016 All-Star game and reached the Stanley Cup Final a year later. And this summer, the Predators will host the NHL draft, 20 years after first hosting the event.

            Meanwhile, the NHL brought its All-Star game earlier this month to the Sunrise, home of the Florida Panthers and held one in Tampa in 2018.

            “We’re kind of the go-to markets now, which is really nice,” Henry said.

            “It allows you to elevate conversations,” he said. “It’s like a stamp of approval … It’s that statement of, everything’s happening in the right way. It’s like winning that blue ribbon, if you will. And you get to talk about it for years and years to come.”

            At the minimum, it represents another highlight for the former Hartford Whalers franchise since relocating to North Carolina for the 1997-98 season.

            The Hurricanes have hosted two Stanley Cup Final series, winning in 2006. They hosted the 2004 draft and 2011 All-Star Weekend. And after a nine-year playoff drought, they have reached four consecutive postseasons with two division titles under coach and 2006 captain Rod Brind’Amour. 

            They also have a devoted fan base known for rarely passing up the opportunity to tailgate or create the roaring, festive environments now common at Carolina's home playoff games.

            “I think they deserve it,” Brind’Amour said. “We’ve got a great fan base down there. We know about it. I’m there every day with them and they pack the place and they’re loud and they support the team in a small market as well as any in the NHL.”

            It also marks one of the handful of outdoor games to be held in a college venue rather than a professional stadium. There was an existing partnership between the Hurricanes and N.C. State considering the Wolfpack's men’s basketball program shares PNC Arena, so athletics director Boo Corrigan said officials there jumped to join schools like Air Force (2020), Notre Dame (2019), Navy (2018), Minnesota (2016) and Michigan (2014) in getting exposure that comes with being an outdoor-game host.

            “When it first came up, we were all like, ‘Yeah, let’s do this,’” Corrigan said.

            The NHL needed more convincing.

            Tom Dundon became majority owner in 2018 near the end of the playoff drought and started pushing to host an outdoor game, but Waddell said league officials were “a little concerned” by the team’s attendance dip at the time. 

            And now?

            “The game sold out really quickly,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said at All-Star Weekend. “I was surprised at how quickly — one of the fastest sellouts.”

            There are numerous events scheduled around the game, including a pregame fan event with live music as well as a Hurricanes alumni game followed by a club-hockey matchup for rival colleges N.C. State and North Carolina on Monday.

            Mayer said the NHL even plans to go “all-in on N.C. State” on Saturday night, referencing the marching band and other elements typical for Wolfpack home games.

            The way he sees it, this is all part of one wide-ranging showcase: for the NHL, the Hurricanes, N.C. State and Raleigh.

            “People are intoxicated by the fact that we’re here and they love the fact we’re here,” Mayer said. “Let’s play some hockey.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813809,Bruce Willis has frontotemporal dementia. What is FTD?,"Bruce Willis’ family has announced that he has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. 

            The announcement Thursday came about a year after his family said that Willis would step away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a brain disorder that leads to speaking, reading and writing problems.

            Here's some details on the condition:











            WHAT IS FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA?

            There are different types of dementia, and the frontotemporal form affects regions in the front and sides of the brain. Because it causes problems with behavior and language, aphasia can be a symptom.

            It’s caused by damage to neurons, the brain’s information carriers, but the underlying reasons for a particular case are often unclear. People with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it. It’s rare and tends to happen at a younger age than other forms of dementia, between ages 45 and 65. 

            The terms frontotemporal disorders and frontotemporal dementia are sometimes shortened to FTD. 

            WHAT ARE OTHER SYMPTOMS OF FTD?

            Symptoms can include emotional problems and physical difficulties, such as trouble walking. Symptoms tend to worsen over time, though progression varies by person. 

            The statement from the actor's family said communication problems “are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces.”

            CAN FTD BE TREATED?

            There are no treatments to slow or stop the disease, but some interventions can help manage symptoms.

            Some patients receive antidepressants or drugs for Parkinson's, which has some overlapping symptoms with frontotemporal dementia. Many also work with speech therapists to manage communication difficulties and physical therapists to try to improve movement.

            People with the condition are more likely to have complications from things like falls, injuries or infections. The average life expectancy after symptoms emerge is seven to 13 years, according to researchers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813814,"EU, China relaunch human rights talks amid tensions","The European Union and China on Friday resumed talks focusing on human rights at a meeting in Brussels, two years after they stalled following rounds of tit-for-tat sanctions.Relations between both sides have been icy since March 2021, when the EU levied sanctions on four Chinese government officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang province and Beijing retaliated by sanctioning 10 individuals and 4 entities in the EU, including members of the European Parliament and of the European Council's Political and Security Committee.The decision to resume the dialogue was taken at the EU-China Summit in April 2022.After meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping last December, European Council President Charles Michel said restarting the talks was ""an important signal.""""Human rights are universal. I welcome the readiness to resume the EU-China human rights dialogue,"" he said in a statement.But rights groups have slammed the talks, labeling them ""meaningless.""""It is not a real dialogue, because it is ineffective, and because it is counterproductive,"" Claudio Francavilla, senior EU advocate at Human Rights Watch, told DW.""It's a box-ticking exercise, held with no expectation that the concerns and recommendations expressed there will be positively received and translated into any concrete policy change,"" he added.""In fact, its only practical effect is relieving leaders from the 'burden' of having to meaningfully discuss human rights during summits and other high-level engagements.""Both EU and Chinese officials have spent the past year trying to figure out how to improve their ties.A number of EU leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, visited Beijing last year and China's top foreign policy official Wang Yi is currently in Europe visiting Russia and four EU countries: France, Germany, Italy and Hungary.Wang is also expected to speak at the Munich Security Conference, an annual event bringing together security experts and politicians, military leaders and the defense industry from around the world.Reinhard Butikofer of the Green Party, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation for relations with China, welcomed in-person engagements to boost ties, although he stressed that when it comes to EU-China human rights talks, it is a ""dialogue of the dead.""He said the EU should, instead of trying to placate Beijing, impose more sanctions on Chinese officials for abusing human rights in Xinjiang, rolling back rights in Hong Kong, restricting fundamental rights in Tibet, cracking down on human rights defenders within the country and also curtailing the fundamental freedoms of women and girls.""I haven't seen much progress made through this human rights dialogue and the Chinese side has signaled that they want to use the dialogue to quash public criticism,"" Butikofer, who has also been sanctioned by Beijing, underlined.""Basically, they're signaling to European leaders, if you want to have a human rights dialogue, you should not be publicly critical of what we do.""The EU's foreign affairs spokesperson, Nabila Massrali, told DW that the EU and China have different views on human rights, and this is exactly why the dialogue is important, ""to have a frank discussion.""Rights groups accuse Beijing of violating the rights of Uyghurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority of around 10 million people in Xinjiang, including the mass use of forced labor in internment camps. The United States has accused China of genocide.The Chinese government's actions in the province ""may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity,"" according to a 2022 UN report.Koen Stoop, the EU representative and policy coordinator at the World Uyghur Congress, urged Brussels to impose more sanctions rather than hold talks with Chinese officials.Pointing out that the human rights situation in Xinjiang has worsened over the past five years, he said EU sanctions against Chinese authorities ""will speak louder than words"" for the Uyghur community.The EU also came under sharp criticism recently following the announcement of a trip to Paris and Brussels by Erkin Tuniyaz, the governor of Xinjiang.Amid outrage from rights groups and some lawmakers, the trip has been canceled.Tuniyaz has defended Chinese policies in Xinjiang, including the use of detention facilities.He was sanctioned by the US in 2021, but not yet by the EU.""I think it's to do with political will mostly because of the negative effect that the previous 2021 sanctions have had on the EU-China relationship,"" Stoop said, adding: ""But given the urgency of the human rights situation in China, the EU should develop a tougher stance.""In addition to sanctions, Brussels is also considering a proposed ban on products made using forced labor, which, if passed, could force European companies to end their economic engagement with Xinjiang.""The EU should ensure robust adoption of this legislation because it would significantly hamper the possibility to continue the business-as-usual approach with China, where Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims are reportedly subject to forced labor as part of the government's abusive policies,"" said HRW's Francavilla.Chinese government officials have lambasted the UN report, describing itas ""a farce"" and saying that ""respecting and protecting human rights is a basic principle enshrined in the Constitution of China.""Over the past year, Chinese officials in the West have also raised the prospect of easing the tensions and lifting the sanctions, in an effort to ensure that trade and other business agreements are not impacted.Butikofer believes that the planned and now-scrapped visit by the Xinjiang governor was an attempt by China to try and have a fresh start with the EU.He noted that despite being canceled for now, Beijing could announce the trip again.At an event organized by the European Policy Centre in Brussels on February 8, Fu Cong, the head of the Chinese mission to the EU, called for resolving both sides' differences over human rights through talks.He also stressed that these differences should not affect other aspects of the relationship.For Francavilla, this is an easy pass to try and build back good relations with the EU.""If all Beijing has to suffer in order to cozy up with the EU and talk trade, business and cooperation, is sending some of its diplomats to be yelled at in a closed-door meeting for a day, they'll do that eagerly,"" he said.Edited by: Srinivas MazumdaruEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813815,The de-Russification of Ukrainian art,"Barley two months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, London's National Gallery responded to criticism on social media and changed the name of a work by French impressionist artist, Edgar Degas, from ""Russian Dancers"" to ""Ukrainian Dancers.""Now, in response to ongoing pressure to recognize Ukrainian culture that had been colonized under the Tsarist and Soviet regimes, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) has renamed another Degas work.The artwork known as ""The Russian Dancer"" was officially changed to ""Dancer in Ukrainian Dress"" last week as the MET also designated nineteenth-century painters Ivan Aivazovsky, Illia Repin, and Arkhyp Kuindzhi as Ukranian, not Russian, artists.""Step by step, Ukraine reclaims our cultural identity,"" tweeted Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, in response to the retitling of the Degas work almost a year since the Russian invasion.The recognition of Ukrainian artists at the MET was accompanied with the redrafting of captions on artworks.""Kuindzhi was born along the coast in Mariupol, when the Ukrainian city was part of the Russian Empire,"" reads the changed caption accompanying Arkhyp Kuindzhi's circa 1905-08 painting, ""Red Sunset"" — which includes a view of Ukraine's Dnipro river.Mariupol was the site of fierce fighting during the initial invasion, and the destruction of cultural heritage including a museum named after the artist.""In March 2022, the Kuindzhi Art Museum in Mariupol, Ukraine, was destroyed in a Russian airstrike,"" the painting caption in the MET now reads.A Met spokesperson told DW that it continually researches and examines objects in its collection in order to determine the most appropriate and accurate way to catalogue and present them.""The cataloging of these works has been updated following research conducted in collaboration with scholars in the field,"" read a statement.Yet at time of publication, the MET is still to change the name of another Degas work in his series currently titled ""Russian Dancers,"" that is a very similar to the ""Ukrainian Dancers"" retitled by London's National Gallery last year.""Dancer in Ukrainian Dress"" is part of a series of pastel drawings that the French impressionist created between around 1890 and the early 1900s.The series portrays Ukrainian women in traditional folk costumes with blue and yellow ribbons in their hair — the Ukrainian national colors.Fascinated by dancers as a painting subject, it is believed that Degas was inspired by Ukrainian dancers he had encountered while they were touring Paris.At the time, France had entered an alliance with the Russian empire that included Ukraine, and whose art and culture was on display in the French capital.When Ukraine was subjugated by the Russian and Soviet empires, so was its culture and heritage.As part of what is known as the Ukrainian genocide, the Soviet regime lead by Joseph Stalin quashed a rising independence movement by purging cultural figures and outlawing Ukrainian language.The Russification of Ukraine meant that it was difficult to discern Ukrainian culture following independence in the early 1990s, notes Daria Badior, a Ukrainian journalist and editor.""In the media mainstream, few can discern whether an artwork was created in the Ukrainian, Georgian, Estonian, or the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic,"" she wrote in the online art magazine, Hyperallergic. ""It just seems, to the general public, like Soviet art and therefore Russian.""""Every trip to a gallery or museum in London with exhibits on art or cinema from the USSR reveals deliberate or just lazy misinterpretation of the region as one endless Russia,"" historian, writer and director of the Ukranian Institute London, Olesya Khromeychuk, wrote in German magazine, Der Spiegel, in March 2022.""Curators have no problem presenting Jewish, Belarusian, or Ukrainian art and artists as Russian,"" she added, ""much like the current president of the Russian Federation would like to see it.""""Putin has one of the largest armies in the world, but he has other weapons too,"" Khromeychuk wrote, adding that ""culture and history take a prominent place in his arsenal.""A report by the European Parliament also noted how Russia's appropriation of Ukrainian culture has been a central part of the ongoing invasion.""Russian aggressors have looted artefacts from public and private collections, added them to Russian collections and declared them part of Russian history and culture,"" stated the report.The renaming of the Edgar Degas series on Ukrainian dancers — which includes around 18 works — will depend on private owners and other museums who hold the works.Two are at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and one is in Sweden's Nationalmuseum in Stockholm — which according to the museum has not been on display since 2019.""Based on the information that is now available about the entire series of drawings that Degas made, there is reason for us to consider changing the title as well,"" the Swedish museum told DW in a statement.""First, we need to go through the information that the other museums have based their changes on and what a new title in that case would be.""Ukraine's struggle to de-Russify Ukrainian heritage and art is set to continue.Edited by Stuart Braun",2023/02/17,,

(AP) — An 18-year-old Kansas man has been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter after a crash that killed a Kansas City police office r, a pedestrian and the officer's K-9 police dog, the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office announced Friday.

            Jerron Allen Lightfoot, of Tonganoxie, was speeding and ran a red light at an intersection Wednesday night before colliding with a patrol car driven by officer James Muhlbauer, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

            Online court records do not name an attorney for Lightfoot. 











            Muhlbauer was found unconscious in the front seat, wearing his seat belt. He was transported to a hospital, where he later died. A pedestrian, a man in his 50s who has not been identified, was found deceased under Muhlbauer's patrol car. The officer's K-9 partner, Champ, died in the collision.

            Video surveillance of the intersection showed Muhlbauer had a green light when he drove into the intersection, according to court documents. 

            Lightfoot, who was not injured, was speeding and drove through the red light before the collision, according to the documents.

            Lightfoot told officers he tried to stop but his car's brakes did not work, prosecutors said. Lightfoot said he felt “a lot of vibration” when he applied the brakes.

            A check of Lightfoot's vehicle showed the vehicle’s brakes were working and the vehicle was traveling at 85 mph or more just before impact, prosecutors said. 

            Police said Muhlbauer, who was married and a father, was a 20-year veteran of the force. Champ had been a K-9 with the force for a year. 

            In 2014, Muhlbauer arrested Brandon Howell, a suspect in the deaths of five people in a Kansas City neighborhood, said Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Howell, who previously was acquitted in the killings of two Kansas teens, is serving multiple life terms, with no chance of parole, in the quintuple homicide.KANSAS CITY, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813819,Moltzan to miss slalom at skiing worlds with broken hand,"MERIBEL, France (AP) — American skier Paula Moltzan will miss the slalom race at the world championships on Saturday after breaking her left hand again.

            Moltzan was injured while helping the United States win the gold medal in the team event on Tuesday, having already competed for most of last season with the same hand broken — in a different place.

            Having sat out the individual parallel race, Moltzan competed in the giant slalom on Thursday with her pole taped to her glove but went out in the first run after getting spun around.











            “My team and I have done everything to make the slalom happen tomorrow, but it isn’t enough. The pain is too much when I ski,” Moltzan wrote Friday on Instagram. “I am headed to Vail tomorrow to have it operated on.”

            Moltzan earned her first career podium in slalom in December when she finished second behind Mikaela Shiffrin in Semmering, Austria — marking the first 1-2 finish in women’s slalom for the U.S. in more than half a century.

            Consistently solid results this season have earned Moltzan a spot in the top seven of the slalom start-list rankings and the race at worlds was to be her first event with that status. Now she likely won’t compete again until technical races in Are, Sweden, next month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813821,"US says IS commander killed, troops wounded in NE Syria raid","BEIRUT (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday a helicopter raid led by its forces in northeast Syria left a senior leader with the Islamic State group dead and four American service members wounded.

            Separately, local media and a monitor group said an IS attack on Friday in central Syria killed dozens of civilians. 

            The U.S. military said in the short statement that its operation was conducted Thursday night in partnership with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which is allied with the U.S.











            It added that “an explosion on target resulted in four U.S. service members and one working dog wounded."" It did not say in which part of northeast Syria the raid was conducted.

            It identified the killed IS commander as Hamza al-Homsi.

            Despite their defeat in Syria in March 2019, IS sleeper cells still conduct attacks around Syria and Iraq where they once declared a “caliphate.”

            On Friday, IS gunmen in central Syria shot dead at least 36 people south of the town of Sukhna, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor. 

            Pro-government radio station Sham FM reported the militants ambushed people who were foraging for wild truffles in the desert. State television put the death toll at 53.

            Joint operations between the U.S. military and SDF fighters are common in northeast and eastern Syria along the border with Iraq.

            The statement said the service members and working dog are receiving treatment in a U.S. medical facility in neighboring Iraq.

            The U.S. military killed two IS leaders in Syria over the past few years.

            In February 2021, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, was killed in a U.S. raid in northwest Syria. IS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hunted down by the Americans in a raid in October 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813822,"Elgar out as South Africa test captain, replaced by Bavuma","CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Dean Elgar was removed as South Africa test captain on Friday and replaced by Temba Bavuma in a leadership “restructure” under new head coach Shukri Conrad, Cricket South Africa said.

            The change will come into effect immediately, with Bavuma appointed to lead the team in a two-test home series against West Indies starting later this month.

            Opening batter Elgar will remain available as a player for the series, CSA said.











            “The call was clearly in terms of the new direction we are going as a team, as a system, and we all felt that the change in the leadership was needed,” South Africa director of cricket Enoch Nkwe said.

            Bavuma was appointed South Africa's limited-overs captain at the same time that Elgar was given the test captaincy in March 2021. Bavuma will retain the ODI captain's job but give up the Twenty20 role, with a new T20 captain to be announced later.

            Elgar was a popular choice as test captain but the team has lost back-to-back series in England and Australia under his leadership.

            Still, the move was unexpected and part of changes made by the newly appointed pair of Conrad and Nkwe. CSA also said that head selector Victor Mpitsang had been removed from his role.

            Batter Tony de Zorzi earned his first call-up to the South Africa squad for the series against West Indies, while batter Aiden Markram and allrounder Senuran Muthusamy were recalled.

            Batter Rassie van der Dussen, one of the Proteas' form players over the last few years, was surprisingly left out of the squad.

            The first test starts at Centurion on Feb. 28.

Bavuma will retain the ODI captain's job but give up the Twenty20 role, with a new T20 captain to be announced later.Elgar was a popular choice as test captain but the team has lost back-to-back series in England and Australia under his leadership.Still, the move was unexpected and part of changes made by the newly appointed pair of Conrad and Nkwe. CSA also said that head selector Victor Mpitsang had been removed from his role.Batter Tony de Zorzi earned his first call-up to the South Africa squad for the series against West Indies, while batter Aiden Markram and allrounder Senuran Muthusamy were recalled.Batter Rassie van der Dussen, one of the Proteas' form players over the last few years, was surprisingly left out of the squad.The first test starts at Centurion on Feb. 28.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813823,U-Haul rampage victim died striving for 'American dream',"NEW YORK (AP) — Three years ago, YiJie Ye was on a routine delivery run in Brooklyn on his motorized scooter when he was in a crash with another vehicle. The collision left the father of three injured and unable to work, but soon he was back on the road supporting his children.

            On Monday, he was hit again, though this time it was no accident. Ye was one of nine people struck by a U-Haul driven by a man who authorities said went on a nearly hourlong rampage, barreling into bicyclists, moped riders, a police car and one pedestrian before he was captured.

            Eight people survived the attack. Ye did not.











            By his relatives’ account, Ye was a devoted single father who worked day and night to support his twin sons and a daughter, all teenagers. He died doing a dangerous job, one of the legions of takeout food workers zipping 24-hours a day through New York City's sometimes inhospitable streets. 

            “He’s a first generation immigrant who was pursuing the American Dream for his kids,” said Mike Chen, whose wife, Jessy, is Ye's cousin.

            Ye arrived from China 18 years ago and made a living scooting from place to place to deliver food. When business was slow, he’d collect recyclables from city streets to supplement his income, said Chen, who owns the Brooklyn apartment building where Ye lived with his children, 2 miles (3 kilometers) from where he was run down.

            It was just weeks ago when Ye and his relatives had gathered for a meal to celebrate the Lunar New Year.

            “He had a lot of big plans for his kids, like going to college and be able to support themselves and make great contributions to society. But right now, everything just shattered,"" said Chen, whose wife set up a gofundme fundraiser to help Ye's family.

            Mayor Eric Adams called the incident a “horrific story.”

            “A father was raising his children, young children, and he was the one that died in this incident,” the mayor said earlier this week.

            Authorities arrested Weng Sor, 62, and charged him with murder in Ye's death.

            Police said Sor was suffering from an apparent mental health crisis when he mowed down bicyclists, moped riders and at least one pedestrian over 48 minutes. After his arrest, Sor told police he believed it was “judgment day” and that he had driven the truck at “the people that disturbed him the most,” a prosecutor said during Sor's initial court appearance.

            That many of the U-Haul’s victims were on bikes or scooters was not lost on those who make a living delivering food and groceries.

            Dachuan Nie, the president of the International Alliance of Delivery Workers, expressed sympathy for Ye’s family.

            Everyday, he said, delivery workers face danger from cars, trucks and buses.

            “They will face accidents everyday, every time they are working,” Nie said.

            Ye was injured on Feb. 18, 2020, in a collision with a car less than 2 miles (3 kilometers) from home, according to a police report. He sued the motorist, claiming the driver ran a red light. The case was still pending when he was killed Monday. His attorney did not respond to requests for an interview.

            After he was struck by the U-Haul, Ye wasn't able to speak and authorities had trouble tracking his next of kin.

            “I was reading the news about the U-Haul rampage in the morning and I never associated anything with my cousin until I received a phone call from a police officer,” Chen said.

            He was told that Ye had been critically injured. By the time relatives and Ye's children arrived at the hospital, he was dead.

            “We missed the chance to have a last word,” Chen said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813824,Trump lawyers try to ban 'Access Hollywood' tape from trial,"NEW YORK (AP) — Attorneys for Donald Trump want to ban from his upcoming civil rape trial the “Access Hollywood” tape in which the former president boasts graphically about how celebrities can molest women.

            Trump attorneys Alina Habba and Michael Madaio filed papers in Manhattan federal court late Thursday seeking to block references to the 2005 taped encounter and the tape itself from an April trial stemming from the claims of longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll.

            They called the tape “irrelevant and highly prejudicial” and said it might unjustly be used to suggest to jurors that Trump had a propensity for sexual assault and therefore must have raped Carroll. They also asked to prevent testimony from two women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct and to ban references to his campaign speeches.











            Carroll, 79, sued Trump in November after New York state temporarily changed laws to allow adult rape victims to sue their abusers, even if the attacks occurred decades ago. A trial is set for April 25, and Trump and Carroll are both expected to testify.

            Carroll, a former columnist for Elle magazine, said in her 2019 memoir, “What Do We Need Men For?” that Trump raped her in late 1995 or early 1996 in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store.

            Trump has denied it, sometimes angrily, in public statements.

            
                In an October deposition for the upcoming trial, Trump was dismissive of Carroll's claims, saying: “Physically she's not my type,” though he misidentified her as an ex-wife of his when he was shown a photograph.

            Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, confronted him with claims that two dozen other women have made against him, asking if any are true.

            ""I would say. I mean, I don’t see any. I mean, you haven’t shown me anything,” Trump responded, according to the transcript.

            His answers might increase the relevance of lewd comments he made on the “Access Hollywood” tape, which was revealed just weeks before he won the November 2016 presidential election.

            In the tape, he said that sometimes when he sees beautiful women: “I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.” And he added that, “When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,” including grabbing women between their legs.

            Afterward, he issued a rare apology, saying the comments were “locker room banter” caught on a hot mic.

            In excerpts of his deposition placed in the public record late Thursday, Trump said it's been largely true “over the last million years” that celebrities can grab at women they find attractive. “Unfortunately or fortunately,” he added.

            “And you consider yourself to be a star?” Kaplan asked.

            “I think you can say that, yeah,” Trump responded.

            In her lawsuit, Carroll said she had a chance encounter with Trump that escalated into playful banter as he asked her to help him pick out lingerie for a friend. She said they teased each other to try on a piece of lingerie and went into the dressing room, where Trump became violent and raped her.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813825,Judge rules PGA Tour can depose Saudi backers of LIV Golf,"A federal judge has ruled the head of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the financial backer of LIV Golf, must sit for depositions and produce documents in LIV Golf's antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.

            Lawyers for the Public Investment Fund and its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, had sought to quash subpoenas claiming sovereign immunity.

            U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen ruled late Thursday that PIF's involvement falls under the commercial activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.











            Her decision allows the PGA Tour to seek documents and any communication related to such matters as LIV Golf's recruiting and negotiating with players, its business plans and its involvement in the new league.

            If the ruling holds, it could pull back the curtain on the PIF's business dealings.

            The ruling, seen as a victory for the PGA Tour, comes one week before LIV Golf is set to begin its second season offering $25 million in prize money at its 13 events, with $50 million for the team championship finale.

            Any trial in the lawsuit would not be until at least January 2024.

            Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau were among 11 players who originally filed the antitrust lawsuit in August. LIV Golf joined the lawsuit, and eventually all but three players — DeChambeau, Matt Jones and Peter Uihlein — removed themselves as plaintiffs.

            In her 58-page ruling, some of which was heavily redacted, van Keulen said PIF's involvement was of commercial interest to Saudi Arabia.

            “It is plain that PIF is not a mere investor in LIV; it is the moving force behind the founding, funding, oversight, and operation of LIV,” she wrote in her decision. “PIF's actions are indisputably the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.”

            She also said al-Rumayyan was “personally involved in and himself carried out many of PIF's activities"" related to establishing, funding and operation of the rival league.

            LIV Golf has accused the PGA Tour of using monopolistic powers to squash competition.

            The Saudi-backed league has 48 players that compete individually for $20 million in prize money and through four-man teams that offer an additional $5 million purse.

            With bonus money involved, Dustin Johnson made $35.6 million last year in eight tournaments. Johnson, Mickelson, DeChambeau and four-time major champion Brooks Koepka were some of the biggest names to join with signing fees reported to be in the range of $150 million.

            The PGA Tour has responded to LIV’s threat by created “elevated” events that offer $20 million in prize money, such as the Genesis Invitational this week in Los Angeles. Top players, led by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, are involved in building a new model for the PGA Tour aimed at bringing the top players together more often.

            The PGA Tour suspended the players for violating its membership regulations, which include requiring a release to play in overseas events. The tour does not allow players to compete in other tournaments in North America.

            LIV Golf has eight events in the United States this year.

            The offseason for LIV Golf included a television contract with The CW, giving its tournament a broadcast partner for U.S. markets. Previously, tournaments were available only through YouTube or live streaming.

            But the league has gone through its share of shakeups from within.

            Majed Al Sorour, the CEO of Golf Saudi and managing director of LIV Golf, was transitioned out of that role last month. It was one of many changes at LIV Golf during the offseason in which its chief operating officer, chief marketing officer and chief communications officer have left the circuit.

            LIV Golf has announced the addition of two more players for the second season — Mito Pereira of Chile, who is No. 46 in the world ranking; and Sebastian Munoz of Colombia, who is at No. 96.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813826,GOP opens another investigation of Afghanistan withdrawal,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Several Biden Cabinet members, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, received a letter Friday from House Republicans as they launched the second investigation into the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

            Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a series of letters to senior leadership at the White House, Department of Defense, State Department and others requesting a tranche of documents related to the end of America's longest war. 

            “The Biden Administration was tragically unprepared for the Afghanistan withdrawal and their decisions in the region directly resulted in a national security and humanitarian catastrophe,” Comer said in a statement. “Every relevant department and agency should be prepared to cooperate and provide all requested information.”











            Republicans have been vowing to press President Joe Biden’s administration on what went wrong as the Taliban swept to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 and the U.S. left scores of Americans and thousands of Afghans who helped them over the years in grave danger. Now with the power of the gavel, GOP lawmakers are elevating that criticism into aggressive congressional oversight, and on a topic that has been met with bipartisan support in the past. 

            In a statement, the State Department said that while it does not comment on congressional correspondence, the agency is committed to working with congressional committees. 

            “As of November 2022, the Department has provided more than 150 briefings to bipartisan Members and staff on Afghanistan policy since the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan,” the statement continued. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

            The letters Friday come nearly one month after Rep. Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened his own investigation into the deadly withdrawal, requesting documents from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 

            McCaul’s letter outlined a request for all communications around the lead-up to pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. He also made it clear that his committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, also plans to investigate the after-effects of the withdrawal, including on the hundreds of thousands of Afghan allies left behind. 

            The Trump administration agreed late in its term to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan in May 2021, with the former president saying in 2020, “Now it’s time for somebody else to do that work.” But Republicans are intent on reminding Americans that it was Biden who was in charge when the Taliban took over.

            And the criticism over the issue began in a bipartisan manner, with several Democrat-led committees pledging to investigate what went wrong in the days and weeks after the withdrawal. 

            U.S. officials have said they were surprised by the quick collapse of the military and the government, prompting sharp congressional criticism of the intelligence community for failing to foresee it.

            In a congressional hearing last spring, senators questioned whether there is a need to reform how intelligence agencies assess a foreign military’s will to fight. Lawmakers pointed to two key examples: U.S. intelligence believed that the Kabul government would hold on for months against the Taliban, and more recently believed that Ukraine’s forces would quickly fall to Russia’s invasion. Both were wrong.

            Military and defense leaders have said the Afghanistan collapse was built on years of missteps, as the U.S. struggled to find a successful way to train and equip Afghan forces.

            Last year, a watchdog group concluded it was decisions by Trump and Biden to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan that were key factors in the collapse of that nation’s military.

            The report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, mirrors assertions made by senior Pentagon and military leaders in the aftermath of the withdrawal. Military leaders have made it clear that their recommendation was to leave about 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, but that plan was not approved.

            In February 2020, the Trump administration signed an agreement with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, in which the U.S. promised to fully withdraw its troops by May 2021. The Taliban committed to several conditions, including stopping attacks on American and coalition forces. The stated objective was to promote a peace negotiation between the Taliban and the Afghan government, but that diplomatic effort never gained traction before Biden took office in January 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813838,MATCHDAY: Arsenal faces Emery; Bayern visits Gladbach,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Saturday:

            ENGLAND

            Arsenal has to regroup quickly after losing Wednesday's Premier League meeting with Manchester City as the London club travels to Aston Villa for a lunchtime kickoff against its former manager Unai Emery's team. Man City then plays Nottingham Forest as one of six 3 p.m. kickoffs, with the defending champions looking to stay atop the table after going ahead of Arsenal on goal difference. Chelsea tries to arrest its recent slump when it hosts struggling Southampton, while Newcastle hopes to strengthen its bid for a top-four finish when it hosts Liverpool in the late game.











            SPAIN

            Karim Benzema will rest ahead of Real Madrid’s trip to Anfield when it visits Osasuna needing a win to keep in sight of Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league. Benzema was dropped from Carlo Ancelotti’s squad because of fatigue. Toni Kroos will also rest this weekend before Madrid's round-of-16 game at Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. But goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is back after recovering from an injury that had sidelined him for four games. Top scorer Vinícius Júnior also returns after a one-game suspension. Third-place Real Sociedad hosts Celta Vigo and fifth-place Real Betis welcomes Valladolid. Villarreal is at Mallorca.

            GERMANY

            Bayern Munich goalkeeper Yann Sommer makes a quick return to Borussia Mönchengladbach one month after his switch between the sides. Bayern, which leads the Bundesliga by a point from Union Berlin, hasn’t won any of its last four games against Gladbach, including the 5-0 rout in the German Cup last season. But Sommer is on the other side now. Earlier this season, he made a Bundesliga record 19 saves for Gladbach to keep Bayern at bay in a 1-1 draw. Wolfsburg hosts Leipzig, Freiburg visits Bochum, and Stuttgart welcomes Cologne before Eintracht Frankfurt hosts Werder Bremen in the late game.

            ITALY

            Monza owner Silvio Berlusconi prepares to welcome his old team AC Milan in Serie A. Berlusconi, along with current Monza CEO Adriano Galliani, oversaw 29 trophies in 31 years at Milan before selling the club in 2017. He bought Monza the following year. Milan received a much-needed confidence boost by beating Tottenham in the Champions League midweek. That came after it beat Torino to end a seven-match winless run. Milan is fifth in Serie A but below Roma and Atalanta on goal difference alone. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker at the end of the season. Milan is three points below second-place Inter Milan, which hosts Udinese. Inter was held to a 0-0 draw at struggling Sampdoria on Monday. Sampdoria will be hoping to build on that result and inch closer to safety when it hosts Bologna. 

            FRANCE

            Nice will again be missing striker Nicolas Pepe, who is out with a knee injury, against Reims in the French league. Nice has won five of its last six league matches and is aiming for a fifth consecutive victory in its bid to qualify for a European competition next season. Just four points behind Nice in the standings, 10th-place Reims has also been enjoying a good run of form and is unbeaten in 13 games since appointing Will Still as coach. Strasbourg hosts Angers in Saturday's other match.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813839,33 million kids vaccinated against polio in southern Africa,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — More than 33 million children in several southern African countries have been vaccinated against polio, part of ongoing efforts to eradicate the infectious paralytic disease that has been largely contained in much of the world, the World Health Organization announced on Friday.

            About 80 million drops of the inoculation have been placed in the mouths of children across Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe since the launch of an emergency response in March last year, WHO said in a statement.

            Malawi detected the wild poliovirus disease in a young child in its capital, Lilongwe, in February last year — the first time the strain was reported in Africa in five years. The virus spread to neighboring Mozambique, causing other countries in the region to be on alert.











            Africa was certified as free of indigenous wild polio in 2020, according to WHO, which says the recent strain originated from Pakistan. The South Asian country and its neighbor, Afghanistan, are the only two countries where the virus is still entrenched.

            In the latest outbreak, Malawi has reported one case while Mozambique has recorded eight. Mozambique recorded the last confirmed case in August 2022, said WHO.

            Although polio has been spreading in numerous African countries in recent years, those outbreaks were linked to viruses originally contained in vaccines, not to the wild virus. In very rare instances, the live virus in the oral polio vaccine can mutate into a version capable of causing epidemics, particularly in populations that haven’t been immunized.

            Polio spreads mostly from person to person or through contaminated water. It attacks the nervous system and can sometimes paralyze people within hours. The disease mostly affects children under five.

            Vaccinations will continue in southern Africa “so that every child receives the protection they need,” WHO's Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said. 

            At least five vaccination rounds are planned for this year following 19 that took place last year, she said, adding that the region has “made huge efforts” to strengthen polio detection and control the spread of the virus.HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — More than 33 million children in several southern African countries have been vaccinated against polio, part of ongoing efforts to eradicate the infectious paralytic disease that has been largely contained in much of the world, the World Health Organization announced on Friday.About 80 million drops of the inoculation have been placed in the mouths of children across Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe since the launch of an emergency response in March last year, WHO said in a statement.Malawi detected the wild poliovirus disease in a young child in its capital, Lilongwe, in February last year — the first time the strain was reported in Africa in five years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813840,Padres' Machado says he plans to opt out after this season,"Manny Machado says he plans to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract with the San Diego Padres after this season.

            
                Machado signed a 10-year, $300 million deal with the Padres in February 2019, a deal that gives him the right to terminate the agreement after this season and become a free agent. The third baseman, who turns 31 in July, would forfeit $150 million from his current deal, which calls for a $30 million annual salary through 2028.

            “Obviously the team knows where I stand, my situation with the opt-out coming,” Machado told reporters Friday at the Padres’ spring-training camp in Peoria, Arizona. “I think I’ve expressed that I will be opting out after this year, but I think my focus is not about 2024. I think my focus is about 2023, what I can do to this ballclub, what I’ve done for this organization and what we’re going to continue to do here. I think we’ve got something special here growing and I don’t think anything’s going to change.”











            Machado’s contract was a record for a free agent when he agreed to it and the second-largest in the major leagues behind Giancarlo Stanton's $325 million. But he is now tied for the 11th-highest after an offseason topped by AL MVP Aaron Judge's $360 million, nine-year contract to stay with the New York Yankees. The Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout leads the major leagues at $426.5 million.

            “Markets change,” Machado said. “From when I signed five years ago. It’s changed tremendously. Things change and evolve. As a player who’s about to opt out, it’s pretty good to see.”

            A six-time All-Star, Machado is coming off a season in which he finished second in the NL MVP voting. He batted .298 with 32 homers, 102 RBIs, a .366 on-base percentage and a .531 slugging percentage.

            His presence helped the Padres go 89-73 and reach the NL Championship Series before falling to Philadelphia.

            Machado declined to comment on negotiations for a reworked deal.

            “I’m just here to play baseball and continue to do what I’ve got to do,” Machado said. “I let my agent, front office and (general manager) A.J. (Preller) and (owner) Peter (Seidler) handle that.”

            
                Padres manager Bob Melvin said that “I don’t want to know” what it would be like to have Machado playing elsewhere.

            “That provision’s in his contract,” Melvin said. “It’s in his right to opt out, but we’ve also shown a willingness to keep the important guys here.”

            KERSHAW TO MISS WBC

            
                Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw says he won’t be pitching for the U.S. at the World Baseball Classic and called the situation “super disappointing.”

            “Probably my last chance to get to do it, so I really wanted to do it, but it just didn’t work out for a number of reasons,” Kershaw told reporters Friday at the Dodgers’ camp in Glendale, Arizona. “Disappointing, but that’s OK. I’ll be ready for the season. I’ll be ready to go.”

            The three-time Cy Young Award winner didn’t specify what is preventing him from participating. Kershaw, who turns 35 on March 19, added that Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has been helpful throughout the process.

            Kershaw signed a $20 million, one-year contract to remain with the Dodgers this season. He went 12-3 with 2.28 ERA in 22 starts and had two stints on the injured list last season.

            NO BITTERNESS FOR ROJAS AFTER ARBITRATION

            Arizona Diamondbacks utilityman Josh Rojas said he had no hard feelings toward team management after attending and losing an arbitration hearing this week. Rojas will get $2,575,000 instead of his $2.9 million asking price.

            Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said he and Rojas spoke Friday to clear the air.

            “There’s definitely some playing with the numbers, some things they throw out there you disagree with, but that’s what they’re in there to do,"" Rojas said. ""They’re there to show the judges that you are worth less than the middle number. Our job on our side is to show we’re worth more than the number. When you sign up for the process, you know what you’re signing up for.”

            Rojas made his comments one day after 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes said “there’s no denying that the relationship is definitely hurt” from his own arbitration hearing with the Milwaukee Brewers. Burnes lost his arbitration case and will make $10.01 million rather than the $10.75 million he was seeking.

            HAMSTRING TIGHTNESS FOR SOROKA

            Atlanta right-hander Michael Soroka’s comeback from two Achilles surgeries is being slowed by tightness in his left hamstring. Manager Brian Snitker told reporters on Friday Soroka is being held back from throwing as a precaution after reporting to camp with the hamstring issue.

            Soroka was an All-Star as a rookie in 2019 and was Atlanta’s opening day starter in 2020. He hasn't pitched in the majors since suffering his first torn right Achilles three starts into the pandemic-delayed 2020 season. He suffered another tear in 2021 and had a 5.40 ERA in six minor league starts last season.

            CORTES THROWS BULLPEN SESSION

            New York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes had a 24-pitch bullpen session after 10 days of not throwing due to a strained right hamstring. Cortes remains optimistic about being ready for opening day on March 30.

            “It went better than I expected, actually,” Cortes said. “No issue as far as throwing and landing. As of right now there is no pain.”

            Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts during an All-Star season last year.

            “Nestor was really sharp,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I was really encouraged.”

            Yankees reliever Michael King threw 25 pitches over two innings of a simulated game. He didn’t pitch after July 22 because of a fractured right elbow that required surgery.

            EARLY START FOR LYNN

            Chicago White Sox pitcher Lance Lynn had a pretty good idea at the end of last season that he was going to play for the U,S. in the World Baseball Classic.

            So he prepared accordingly.

            “Throwing-wise, it was normal,” Lynn said Friday after a bullpen session in White Sox camp. “If you don’t make the playoffs, you get that time off during the playoffs to rest. So November 1 was when I started throwing. ... Jumped on the mound a little earlier than I normally would have, but that’s about it really.”

            The 35-year-old missed last season's start after he had right knee surgery, one of a series of injuries for the White Sox that contributed to a disappointing 81-81 finish.

            Chicago hired Pedro Grifol for its manager job in November, and Lynn said he sees it as part of his responsibility to help the skipper with his new role.

            “We have some guys in here that have been around and done some things,” Lynn said, “and he’s able to reiterate what he wants and how we want to go about our business. That’s our job as players to go out there and work as hard as we can, and that’s what we’re doing.”

            ORIOLES' HALL FEELING BETTER

            Orioles left-hander DL Hall has dealt with some back issues but says he’s ready to compete for a rotation spot.

            “It was just some minor discomfort in my low back. Nothing too crazy,” the 24-year-old said. “Obviously I’m already on the way back up. I’ve already started back throwing and everything. So I just shut down for a couple weeks. I’m good to go now.”

            Hall made his big league debut last year, starting one game and making 10 relief appearances. He was 1-1 with a 5.93 ERA.

            Baltimore has quite a few choices for its starting spots. The Orioles acquired Kyle Gibson and Cole Irvin in the offseason. Prospect Grayson Rodriguez figures to arrive before too long.

            Hall didn’t express a preference between starting in the minors or making the Orioles as a reliever, if it comes to that. He left no doubt about where he sees his long-term future.

            “I’m going to be a starter,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813842,Pitt's surprising first-place ACC run fueled by disrespect,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — The anger is still tangible to Greg Elliott and the rest of the Pittsburgh Panthers. Accessible, too. 

            A couple of swipes on Elliott's phone takes him back to the preseason poll that picked Pitt to finish 14th in the 15-team Atlantic Coast Conference. Four months, 19 wins and one surprising sprint to the top of the ACC later, it still makes the guard shake his head.

            “I think our whole team, put together, felt disrespected,” the Marquette transfer said. “Everyone felt like they had a chip on their shoulder and had something to prove.”











            The edge has not dulled even with Pitt (19-7, 12-3 ACC) inching toward its first NCAA tournament berth since 2016 — maybe because the slights continue to pile up.

            Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim claimed earlier this month the Panthers were among the teams that “bought” players to help turn their programs around, a comment the Hall of Famer quickly walked back.

            And Pitt is still waiting to return to the AP Top 25 poll, nibbling at the fringe recently but struggling to impress voters despite a resume that includes a sweep of North Carolina and home upsets over Virginia and Miami that restored some of the swagger to the Petersen Events Center.

            A venue that was among the rowdiest in the nation more than a decade ago during the program's Big East power years has had more of a library-like feel in recent years. But there are signs of life: The “Oakland Zoo” student section that sits — well, OK, stands — courtside during games has been packed almost all season. The paying customers that avoided the program in droves as it plummeted to the bottom of the ACC are returning. The first sellout since 2019 watched the Panthers stun the Hurricanes in the final seconds. 

            Coach Jeff Capel is taking none of it for granted. Neither are his players, some of whom began their careers at higher-profile destinations before alighting to Pitt in search of opportunity.

            Do-everything guard Jamarius Burton, who is mounting a serious bid for ACC Player of the Year, bounced from Wichita State to Texas Tech before landing at Pitt in 2021. Elliott made all of 11 starts in four seasons at Marquette before taking a chance on Pitt. Blake Hinson didn't play at all during two lost years at Iowa State, and now is averaging 15.9 points after being given the green light by Capel to let it fly from wherever he wants, whenever he wants.

            Six of Pitt's top seven scorers have resumes with at least one other stop. The only Panther that signed here out of high school — forward John Hugley — is sitting out the rest of the season to focus on his mental health.

            The pieces that look thrown together on paper seem to fit at Pitt, which Elliott ascribes to a “connectivity” that is difficult to describe but invaluable both on the floor and off. Multiple times this season Capel has attributed his team's success to a lack of ego, a humbleness that came from being spending years being humbled elsewhere.

            It's not uncommon for the Panthers to gather at someone's apartment or house to watch an upcoming opponent. It's not uncommon for Capel to ask his players what they think about something, be it during practice or a timeout in the middle of a game — a courtesy he doesn't remember extending to any of his four previous teams at Pitt.

            Maybe because he's never had a team that exudes maturity the way this group does, staying calm when things get tight. It's not a coincidence that Pitt is 6-1 in conference games decided by three points or less.

            Another test awaits Saturday at Virginia Tech (15-11, 5-10), which has already knocked off Duke and Virginia at home. If Pitt survives, a favorable schedule down the stretch offers the possibility that the regular-season finale at Miami on March 4 could be for the ACC title. 

            Not bad for a team picked to finish at the other end of the spectrum, a team that knows a reminder of the program's forgettable recent past — Pitt entered the year 25-83 in ACC play since the start of the 2016-17 season — is only one or two clicks away.

            It's a past the current Panthers are distancing themselves from 40 competent, cohesive minutes at a time.

            “We got into every game (knowing) there was only one team (the experts) had under us (in the preseason) and that was Georgia Tech,” Elliott said. “So everybody else is ahead of us (in our minds) and we've got to get ahead of them. That's how we think about it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813843,"Fetterman case highlights common stroke, depression link","Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman is seeking treatment for severe depression months after having a stroke. 

            Here's what's known about the conditions. 

            WHAT IS A STROKE?











             Strokes are a leading cause of death worldwide and affect almost 800,000 Americans each year. The World Health Organization estimates that about 1 in 4 people will have a stroke at some point in their lives.

            Fetterman had the most common kind of stroke, caused by clots that block a blood vessel to the brain. The less common kind is due to a a burst or bleeding blood vessel.

            Brain cells can begin to die within minutes. There can be one-sided paralysis and problems with speech and cognition, but quick treatment with clot-busting medication can lead to a full or partial recovery.

            Fetterman, 53, had a serious stroke last May, and went on to win a highly publicized Senate race against GOP challenger Mehmet Oz. The aftereffects include difficulty processing spoken conversation, but his doctor has said his thinking ability is intact. 

            WHAT IS DEPRESSION?

            Depression is a mood disorder that can cause intense feelings of persistent sadness, anxiety and hopelessness. It is thought to impair the function of chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. 

            Depression affects about 16 million Americans every year, or about 1 in 6 adults globally.

            Fetterman had bouts of depression before his stroke and his office announced Thursday that he had checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to treat his depression, which worsened recently. 

            Depression is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy. Studies have shown both can help post-stroke depression, but more research is needed to determine which antidepressants are most effective after strokes, according to guidance from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association. 

            IS THERE A LINK BETWEEN STROKES AND DEPRESSION?

            Depression occurs after a stroke in about 1 in 3 patients, said Dr. Will Cronenwett, psychiatry chief at Northwestern University’s Feinberg medical school. 

            There may be a biological reason, with some evidence suggesting that strokes might cause brain changes that lead to thinking difficulties affecting how people perceive the world, and that in turn could lead to depression, Cronenwett said.

            Strokes can also have a psychological impact, making it hard for some people to accept that they may have new limitations. In some people, that adjustment can lead to depression.

            “Depression doesn’t have to happen immediately after a stroke; it can happen years later. But living as a stroke survivor does raise your risk for having depressive episodes,’’ Cronenwett said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813844,"John Paramor, longtime European tour referee, dies at 67","VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) — John Paramor, the mustachioed European tour rules official whose career spanned six decades, has died after a bout with cancer. He was 67.

            The European tour confirmed the death of Paramor, who retired in 2020 as chief referee. He had officiated at dozens of major championships over the years and was recognizable on every circuit in the world.

            “One of the all-time best rules officials,” Tiger Woods said Friday. “John was around when I first turned pro and had been a staple obviously on the European tour and all the World Golf Championships.”











            In a statement Friday, the European tour said it was “today deeply saddened by the passing of John Paramor, one of the most respected rules officials in the history of golf and a hugely popular figure across the entire tour family.”

            The tour planned a moment of silence Saturday in the third round of tournaments in Thailand and South Africa. The PGA Tour was working on a similar tribute. Paramor was a large presence in all of golf’s biggest events.

            “I said in 2020 that ‘legend’ is a word used too often in sport but in terms of golf, and the administration of the rules of our sport, it perfectly describes John Paramor,” said Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European tour. “Quite simply, he was a leader in his field, the guru of referees, and someone who commanded the absolute respect of the players and of his peers.”

            Some of his most famous rulings involved Seve Ballesteros. Paramor once said he gave Ballesteros a favorable ruling that might not have applied to others because the Spaniard was capable of so much creativity. But he also could draw the line.

            During one of his more famous incidents, in 1994 at the season-ending Volvo Masters at Valderrama, Ballesteros was under a tree and felt he should get relief because of a small hole the Spaniard claimed was made by a burrowing animal.

            “One, that was questionable. And two, I couldn’t find any evidence to suggest what he was claiming. He had to prove his case,” Paramor recalled years later. “Anyway, there was a small hole within the big hole. When I went to stick my finger in the small hole to see what was down there, Seve put his hand on my shoulder and said, ‘Be careful, it might bite.’

            “I almost started to chuckle,” Paramor said. “He could be intimidating, but I had to put that to the back of my mind.”

            Relief was denied.

            Paramor joined the European tour as an administrator in April 1976, having previously spent a year working as a caddie for Peter Butler. 

            He went on to become the tour’s chief referee in 1989 and became a central figure in changes to the Rules of Golf over the years.

            “Even before I came on tour, John was a beloved character,” Rory McIlroy said. “He was always a friendly face to see out on tour and I always loved my conversations with him. Yeah, it’s a sad day, but he’ll be very fondly remembered by the whole golf community.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813846,NJ uses new law to bypass local OK for offshore wind project,"OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey utility regulators used a controversial law Friday enabling them to bypass local authorities and grant approvals needed for an offshore wind project to proceed.

            The state Board of Public Utilities granted Orsted, the Danish wind energy developer, approvals toward several easements and permits that authorities in Cape May County had refused to grant the company.

            They used an amendment to New Jersey's offshore wind law passed in 2021 and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy removing most local control over where offshore wind projects come ashore. The law enables an offshore wind developer to apply to the utilities board for an order superseding local control over such projects.











            “I just want to assure the public that we don't take these kinds of actions lightly,” said Joseph Fiordaliso, the board's president. “There has to be a definite public need for the board to even consider this kind of action. This is something that the majority of us believes will benefit the citizens of New Jersey.""

            Fiordaliso said the route of the proposed transmission line will not harm Ocean City or Cape May County aesthetically or economically. The power cable will run from wind turbines that the company says will be located 15 miles offshore and come ashore in Ocean City, where it will run underground along existing roadways and connect to the electrical grid at the site of the former B.L. England power plant in Upper Township.

            The vote marked the second time the board acted under the amended law to grant approvals to Orsted when local officials had refused to do so. In September 2022, the board granted the company an order superseding the authority of Ocean City in granting numerous wetlands and other environmental approvals for the same project.

            Commissioner Dianne Solomon voted against the measure Friday, calling it “clearly a contentious matter,” adding she believes the board erred in overriding Ocean City's authority in September.

            “We should be seeking more information, not less,” she said.

            In its petition to the board, Ocean Wind said it had tried numerous times to obtain approvals directly from Cape May County officials.

            “After all the discussions, meetings, and letters exchanged by Ocean Wind and Cape May County, there has been no indication that the county will voluntarily provide Ocean Wind with any of the necessary approvals or consents for environmental permitting, or the required easements,” the applicants wrote.

            The project, one of three approved so far for the waters off southern New Jersey, still needs numerous additional state and federal approvals.

            The law angered many Jersey Shore communities and residents who objected to their leverage over offshore wind projects being taken away. But state lawmakers defended the law as necessary to ensure that such projects can be completed and help New Jersey move away from the burning of fossil fuels to generate energy.

            Cape May County officials said they are reviewing the ruling.

            Orsted's head of government affairs and market strategy in New Jersey, Maddy Urbish, said in an emailed statement that the Board of Public Utilities' decision allows the project to take another step forward. 

            Using the petition process to seek that decision “does not limit our continued conversations with Cape May County, and we remain committed to that community partnership while providing both environmental and economic benefits to its residents,” Urbish said. 

            The most commonly voiced objections from opponents include the unknown effect hundreds or even thousands of wind turbines might have on the ocean, fears of higher electric bills as costs are passed on to consumers, and a sense that the entire undertaking is being rushed through with little understanding of what the consequences might be.

            Recently, offshore wind opponents have seized on the deaths of 10 whales that have washed ashore in New Jersey and New York since December to demand investigations into whether ocean floor preparation work for offshore wind projects caused the animals' deaths. The most recent death came Friday in New York's Rockaway Beach.

            Two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey said Friday they are introducing legislation to pause work on all current offshore wind projects, prohibit future ones, and investigate the environmental approval process for such projects.

            But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said last month there is no evidence that offshore wind projects have had anything to do with the whale deaths.

            “I want to be unambiguous: There is no information supporting that any of the equipment used in support of offshore wind development could directly lead to the death of a whale,” Benjamin Laws, deputy chief for permits and conservation with NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, said during a Jan. 18 media briefing. “There are no known connections between any offshore wind activities and any whale strandings.”

But state lawmakers defended the law as necessary to ensure that such projects can be completed and help New Jersey move away from the burning of fossil fuels to generate energy.Cape May County officials said they are reviewing the ruling.Orsted's head of government affairs and market strategy in New Jersey, Maddy Urbish, said in an emailed statement that the Board of Public Utilities' decision allows the project to take another step forward.Using the petition process to seek that decision “does not limit our continued conversations with Cape May County, and we remain committed to that community partnership while providing both environmental and economic benefits to its residents,” Urbish said.The most commonly voiced objections from opponents include the unknown effect hundreds or even thousands of wind turbines might have on the ocean, fears of higher electric bills as costs are passed on to consumers, and a sense that the entire undertaking is being rushed through with little understanding of what the consequences might be.Recently, offshore wind opponents have seized on the deaths of 10 whales that have washed ashore in New Jersey and New York since December to demand investigations into whether ocean floor preparation work for offshore wind projects caused the animals' deaths. The most recent death came Friday in New York's Rockaway Beach.Two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey said Friday they are introducing legislation to pause work on all current offshore wind projects, prohibit future ones, and investigate the environmental approval process for such projects.But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said last month there is no evidence that offshore wind projects have had anything to do with the whale deaths.“I want to be unambiguous: There is no information supporting that any of the equipment used in support of offshore wind development could directly lead to the death of a whale,” Benjamin Laws, deputy chief for permits and conservation with NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, said during a Jan. 18 media briefing. “There are no known connections between any offshore wind activities and any whale strandings.”___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813847,"Off camera, Fox hosts doubted 2020 election fraud claims","WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — To millions of viewers, Fox News hosts gave allies of former President Donald Trump a platform to champion false claims that he lost the 2020 election because of voter fraud. To one another, they expressed doubts about the claims and mocked the people making them.

            Private exchanges between Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, and other network bigwigs — including the chairman of Fox Corporation, Rupert Murdoch — show a wide chasm between what the network promoted in primetime and the doubts that its stars held behind the camera, according to new court filings in a defamation lawsuit being waged by a company whose voting systems were regularly maligned on air.

            “Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence for election fraud, Carlson said via text on Nov. 16, 2020 to a Fox News producer, referring to one of Trump’s lawyers.











            Ingraham texted Carlson that Powell is “a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy,” referring to the former New York mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani.

            These and other internal communications were included in a redacted brief filed Thursday by attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems, which is suing Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, for $1.6 billion.

            In a deposition, host Sean Hannity said “that whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, I did not believe it for one second,” according to Dominion’s filing.

            Murdoch, meanwhile, in a Nov. 19 email, described what he saw in a press conference that day featuring Giuliani and Powell as “Really crazy stuff. And damaging.” 

            Dominion's legal case rests on its belief that Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims that the company had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements.

            Attorneys for Fox argued in a counterclaim unsealed Thursday that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. They said Dominion has advanced “novel defamation theories” and is seeking a “staggering” damage figure aimed at generating headlines, chilling protected speech and enriching Dominion’s private equity owner, Staple Street Capital Partners.

            “Dominion brought this lawsuit to punish FNN for reporting on one of the biggest stories of the day — allegations by the sitting President of the United States and his surrogates that the 2020 election was affected by fraud,” the counterclaim states. “The very fact of those allegations was newsworthy.”

            Fox attorneys have noted that Carlson repeatedly questioned Powell’s claims in his broadcasts. “When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,” Carlson told viewers on Nov. 19, 2020.

            Fox attorneys say Dominion’s own public relations firm expressed skepticism in December 2020 as to whether the network’s coverage was defamatory. They also point to an email from Oct. 30, 2020, just days before the election, in which Dominion’s director of product strategy and security complained that the company’s products were “just riddled with bugs.”

            In their counterclaim, Fox attorneys wrote that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations. 

            “Freedom of speech and freedom of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,"" Fox attorneys wrote.

            Fox attorneys warn that threatening the company with a $1.6 billion judgment will cause other media outlets to think twice about what they report. 

            Responses by both sides to the briefs made public on Thursday remain under seal. Fox has said Dominion's filing includes “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context,” and that it has refused to allow Fox to make its response to Dominion's brief public. Attorneys for Fox and Dominion told The Associated Press on Friday that responses to the briefs will remain under seal until Feb. 27.

            Dominion on Friday filed its own challenge to the redactions in the briefs, including its own. “Dominion’s position is that nothing in these three briefs warrants confidential treatment,” attorneys for the company wrote, adding that all redactions were done at Fox's request.

            If either side can persuade Superior Court Judge Eric Davis to grant summary judgment in its favor, the case will end without a jury trial. If not, the trial is scheduled to begin in mid-April. 

            In its 192-page brief, Dominion said the judge should rule in its favor because “no reasonable juror could find in Fox’s favor on each element of Dominion’s defamation claim.” Dominion attorneys also assert that no reasonable juror could find in favor of Fox’s “neutral reportage” and “fair report” defenses. 

            “Recounts and audits conducted by election officials across the U.S. repeatedly confirmed the election’s outcome, including specifically that Dominion’s machines accurately counted votes,” Dominion’s filing states. 

            Fox News attorneys argue the network’s coverage and commentary are not defamatory and that there is no evidence the hosts had any malicious intent behind what they said about Dominion — an important legal standard in First Amendment cases.

            Davis ruled last month that, for the purposes of the defamation claims, he will consider Dominion to be a public figure. That means Dominion must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Fox defendants acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.WILMINGTON, Del.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813848,Dog vs shark standoff thrills tourists on Bahamas boat tour,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The sight of a massive hammerhead shark was a rare treat for 32 travelers on a tour boat in the Bahamas this week. But then, something stranger still: A dog dove from a nearby dock to confront the monstrous sea creature.

            Tourists aboard the four-hour excursion can be heard shouting and pleading with the dog to turn back, in a video circulating on social media. “Oh my god!” and “Get out baby!” and “Stop going after it!”

            The dog ignored them and paddled after the 12-foot shark, which thrashed as the two animals circled each other in transparent turquoise waters near a private island in the southern Bahamas. Then the shark swam away slowly, much to the delight and surprise of the crowd.











            “I don’t think the shark is going to mess with him!” exclaimed one man.

            The shark had emerged from under the boat during a tour Wednesday in the southern Bahamas organized by Exuma Water Sports. 

            Company reservations manager Rebecca Lightbourn told The Associated Press on Friday that the black-and-tan dog always runs along the shore to greet the boat when it passes that island. But it’s the first time it was seen diving in.

            “I guess this time the dog decided he wanted to protect his house or play with a really big fish in the water, so he went after it,” Lightbourn said.

            When the shark swam away from the pier, the medium-sized dog scrambled back onto the rocks and loped away, earning applause from the tourists. The boat then headed to a popular area where tourists jump into the water with the renowned Bahamian swimming pigs.SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The sight of a massive hammerhead shark was a rare treat for 32 travelers on a tour boat in the Bahamas this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813849,Rampant Rossouw leads Multan to 56-run win over Peshawar,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Rilee Rossouw smashed another half-century in an exhibition of power-hitting as Multan Sultans beat Peshawar Zalmi by 56 runs in the Pakistan Super League on Friday.

            The South African followed his unbeaten 78 runs in 42 balls against Quetta Gladiators with an impeccable 75 off just 36 deliveries in Multan’s strong total of 210-3 in 20 overs after being asked to bat first. Captain Mohammad Rizwan scored 66 off 42.

            Despite the tough chase, left-hander Saim Ayub briefly threatened with a 37-ball knock of 53 before Peshawar lost its last seven wickets for only 24 runs and was dismissed for 154 with seven balls to spare. 











            Peshawar opener Mohammad Haris (40) also showed early aggression and smashed four sixes but was run out in the ninth over to a brilliant direct throw by Abbas Afridi at the non-striker’s end when Ayub declined to go for a quick single.

            Multan go top with four points with its second win in three games. Peshawar has two points from two matches after beating Karachi Kings in the opening game of the season.

            Leg-spinner Usama Mir's 3-22 included the wickets of Bhanuka Rajapaksa (1) and Ayub in the same over, while Multan’s 20-year-old pace bowler Ihsanullah continued to impress by wrapping up the game with 3-24.

            Ihsanullah, who picked up 5-12 against Quetta, dismissed Babar Azam — who is leading his new team Peshawar — off his first ball in the batting powerplay. He returned in the death overs and claimed the wickets of tailenders Khurram Shahzad and Salman Irshad. 

            Earlier, Rossouw hit 12 fours and two sixes with frontline fast bowlers Wahab Riaz (0-44) and James Neesham (0-40) both returning expensive figures without claiming a wicket.

            Rossouw plundered boundaries at will after Rizwan was caught off a top-edged sweep against emerging spinner Sufiyan Muqeem (1-36) in the 14th over.

            Rossouw finally was dismissed in the penultimate over when he went for a reverse sweep against fast bowler Salman Irshad (2-38) and was out leg before wicket. 

            David Miller (23 not out) and Kieron Pollard (15 not out) propelled Multan’s total beyond the 200-run mark. Pollard hammered Wahab for two fours and a six in the last over which went for 19 runs. Multan scored 70 runs off the last five overs.

            Two winless teams, Karachi Kings and Quetta Gladiators, meet Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813850,White House defends response to Ohio toxic train derailment,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Friday defended its response to a toxic freight train derailment in Ohio two weeks ago, even as local leaders and members of Congress demanded that more be done.

            The Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, left toxic chemicals spilled or burned off, prompting evacuations and fears of contamination by wary residents distrustful of the state and federal response.

            The White House said it has ""mobilized a robust, multi-agency effort to support the people of East Palestine, Ohio,'' and noted that officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies were at the rural site near the Pennsylvania line within hours of the derailment of the Norfolk Southern train carrying vinyl chloride and other toxic substances.











            “When these incidents happen, you need to let the emergency response take place,'' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday. “We did take action and folks were on the ground.''

            
                EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited the site Thursday, walking along a creek that still reeks of chemicals as he sought to reassure skeptical residents that the water is fit for drinking and the air safe to breathe.

            “I’m asking they trust the government,” Regan said. “I know that’s hard. We know there’s a lack of trust.” Officials are “testing for everything that was on that train,” he said. 

            No other Cabinet member has visited the rural village, where about 5,000 people live, including many who were evacuated as crews conducted a controlled burn of toxic chemicals from five derailed tanker cars that were in danger of exploding. 

            Administration officials insisted their response has been immediate and effective.

            “We’ve been on the ground since February 4 ... and we are committed to supporting the people of East Palestine every step of the way,'' Jean-Pierre said.

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has faced criticism from lawmakers and the mayor of East Palestine for not visiting the site, said the Ohio disaster was just one of many derailments that occur each year. A train hauling hazardous materials derailed Thursday near Detroit, but none spilled, officials said.

            ""There's clearly more that needs to be done, because while this horrible situation has gotten a particularly high amount of attention, there are roughly 1,000 cases a year of a train derailment,'' Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance.

            He tweeted Friday that his department “will hold Norfolk Southern accountable for any safety violations found to have contributed to the disaster” and will be guided by the findings of the transportation safety board's independent investigation.

            President Joe Biden has offered federal assistance to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been coordinating with the state emergency operations center and other partners, the White House said.

            In response to a request from DeWine and Ohio's congressional delegation, the Health and Human Services Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sending a team of medical personnel and toxicologists to Ohio to conduct public health testing and assessments. 

            The team will support federal, state and local officials already on the ground to evaluate people who were exposed or potentially exposed to chemicals, officials said.

            Since the derailment, residents have complained about headaches and irritated eyes and finding their cars and lawns covered in soot. The hazardous chemicals that spilled from the train killed thousands of fish, and residents have talked about finding dying or sick pets and wildlife. 

            Residents also are frustrated by what they say is incomplete and vague information about the lasting effects from the disaster, which prompted evacuations.

            Regan said Thursday that anyone who is fearful of being in their home should seek testing from the government. 

            “People have been unnerved,"" he said. “They’ve been asked to leave their homes.” He said that if he lived there, he would be willing to move his family back into the area as long as testing shows it’s safe. 

            Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he was glad that Regan visited the site, but called it ""unacceptable that it took nearly two weeks for a senior administration official to show up'' in Ohio. 

            Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who toured the crash site with Regan on Thursday, said he spoke with Biden on Friday and was assured that any assistance the state needs will be given.

            “The president is all in on getting FEMA"" to provide direct assistance and is ""all-in on holding Norfolk Southern accountable,'' Brown told an online news conference.

            Ohio state Sen. Michael Rulli, a Republican whose district includes East Palestine, said Buttigieg should resign over the Transportation Department’s inaction. “He has not even come close to being near ground zero and he should be ashamed,” Rulli said.

            Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, who toured the site with Regan and Brown on Thursday, has generally supported the federal response but joined other Ohio officials in calling for more help from FEMA. Johnson sent a letter Friday asking EPA to provide detailed information about the derailment, including the controlled burn conducted last week and testing plans for air and water quality.

            “The community must be able to trust their air, water, and soil is not a threat to their health following this train derailment,"" Johnson said.

            David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, said there's been a ""breach of public trust” in the wake of the disaster, stemming from lax oversight of freight rail and weak notification requirements for hazardous cargo, as well as lingering uncertainties about air and water quality and whether evacuated residents were allowed to return home too soon.

            “Because there have been so many missteps, you can understand that the public is skeptical,’’ said Masur, who co-authored a report that detailed risks that trains carrying explosive and toxic materials pose to nearby communities. The report came after a 2015 CSX oil train disaster near Mount Carbon, West Virginia. A train derailed, exploded and burned for days, contaminating the Kanawha River.

            While Regan’s visit was helpful, officials need to offer more than words or sympathy — and instead implement policies to protect the public health and prevent this from happening again, he said.

Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who toured the crash site with Regan on Thursday, said he spoke with Biden on Friday and was assured that any assistance the state needs will be given.“The president is all in on getting FEMA"" to provide direct assistance and is ""all-in on holding Norfolk Southern accountable,'' Brown told an online news conference.Ohio state Sen. Michael Rulli, a Republican whose district includes East Palestine, said Buttigieg should resign over the Transportation Department’s inaction. “He has not even come close to being near ground zero and he should be ashamed,” Rulli said.Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, who toured the site with Regan and Brown on Thursday, has generally supported the federal response but joined other Ohio officials in calling for more help from FEMA. Johnson sent a letter Friday asking EPA to provide detailed information about the derailment, including the controlled burn conducted last week and testing plans for air and water quality.“The community must be able to trust their air, water, and soil is not a threat to their health following this train derailment,"" Johnson said.David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, said there's been a ""breach of public trust” in the wake of the disaster, stemming from lax oversight of freight rail and weak notification requirements for hazardous cargo, as well as lingering uncertainties about air and water quality and whether evacuated residents were allowed to return home too soon.“Because there have been so many missteps, you can understand that the public is skeptical,’’ said Masur, who co-authored a report that detailed risks that trains carrying explosive and toxic materials pose to nearby communities. The report came after a 2015 CSX oil train disaster near Mount Carbon, West Virginia. A train derailed, exploded and burned for days, contaminating the Kanawha River.While Regan’s visit was helpful, officials need to offer more than words or sympathy — and instead implement policies to protect the public health and prevent this from happening again, he said.____Associated Press writer Patrick Orsagos in East Palestine, Ohio, contributed to this story.",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813851,Ukraine peewee hockey team knocked out of tournament,"QUEBEC CITY (AP) — Ukraine Team Select’s dream run at the Quebec International Peewee Hockey Tournament came to an end Friday with a 2-1 loss to Vermont Flames Academy. 

            After the game, a Ukrainian flag was displayed on the ice with the name of one of the players' fathers who died in combat and the name of another father who is currently fighting on the front lines. 

            The team of young refugees will remain in the province until Monday and have a full schedule of winter activities before returning to their war-torn country or to neighboring countries. 











            Coach Evgheniy Pysarenko said that although the team is are upset about losing, the players had a great experience. 

            “They represented their country in this difficult situation. That is why they wanted to win so hard. We missed a couple of chances, and I don’t know — luck wasn’t on our side, unfortunately,” Pysarenko said. “But they fought until the end. And they didn’t give up. It’s great. Strong characters.

            ""They also represent the people who are fighting now.”

            Phillip Groeling and Kuba Pavlik staked Vermont to a 2-0 lead before Oleksii Shkrabak answered for Ukraine late in the third period.

            The Ukrainian team's presence has placed a larger global spotlight on the 63-year-old tournament with the nearly yearlong war showing signs of once again escalating. The Selects are regarded as symbol of peace for Ukraine and hope for a better future, and they’ve merited mention from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

            Quebec City businessman Sean Bérubé, who helped get the Ukrainian team to Quebec, said the purpose was for them to have fun and forget about the hardships back home.

            “They are such a great group of kids. I found them very mature for their age, and I have been quite impressed by them,” Bérubé said. “And going through all of the media attention that they had and how they stayed focused, and to see them training so hard during practice, they earned my respect. And I am pretty proud they call me Uncle Sean.”

            The Ukrainian team of 11- and 12-year-olds became the toast of the tournament after scoring a pair of victories in the tournament’s Class AA division.

            “The best memory is probably when they smile and laugh and when they feel good and forget about the war,” Pysarenko said. “That is the best.”

            The squad defeated Team Romania Wolves 2-0 on Monday after handing the Boston Junior Bruins a 3-1 loss on Saturday. Following the victory over the Wolves, the team was hosted by the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday at practice and at their game against the Chicago Blackhawks.

            The Ukrainian players got to sit on the Canadiens’ bench for pre-game warmups and received fist bumps and pucks from players. The Canadiens also presented a welcome video in the first period highlighting the youngsters’ path through the tournament, and the Ukrainian team received an ovation from the crowd.

            “People welcomed us very warmly,” Pysarenko said. “We saw a lot of things, (we saw) the NHL game and the kids had a great experience. Thank you.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813852,Judge: Canada right to invoke emergency act in truck protest,"TORONTO (AP) — A public commission announced Friday that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government met the “very high threshold” for invoking the Emergencies Act to quell the protests by truckers and others angry over Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions last winter. 

            For weeks, hundreds and sometimes thousands of protesters in trucks and other vehicles clogged the streets of Ottawa, the capital, and besieged Parliament Hill, railing against vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 precautions and condemning Trudeau’s Liberal government. 

            Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded various U.S.-Canadian border crossings. And police arrested 11 people at the blockaded border crossing at Coutts, Alberta, opposite Montana, after learning of a cache of guns and ammunition.











            Justice Paul Rouleau concludes most of the emergency measures were appropriate. He said he does not accept the testimony of protest organizers who described the demonstrations as lawful and peaceful. 

            “The measures taken by the federal government were for the most part appropriate and effective and contributed to bringing a return to order without loss of life or serious injury to people or property,"" Rouleau said. 

            Rouleau said Cabinet had reasonable grounds to believe that their existed a national emergency. 

            The Public Emergency Commission examined the basis for the decision to declare the public order emergency, the circumstances that led to it and the the appropriateness and effectiveness of the measures. Trudeau, Cabinet ministers, protesters and others testified last fall.

            Trudeau noted guns were found at the border blockade in Alberta.

            “There was a real risk that people promoting ideologically motivated extremism could act or that they could inspire others,” Trudeau said. “The situation was volatile and out of control.” 

            Trudeau said he regrets calling the protestors a “fringe minority.""

             “I wish I had said it differently,” Trudeau said. “If I had chosen my words more carefully or been more specific I think things might have been a bit easier.”

             He said it is important to speak out against a very small number of people who deliberately spread misinformation and disinformation

            The emergencies act allowed authorities to declare certain areas as no-go zones. It also allowed police to freeze truckers’ personal and corporate bank accounts and compel tow truck companies to haul away vehicles.

            Rouleau said there was a failure to provide a clear way for those people who had assets frozen to have them unfrozen when they were no longer engaged in illegal conduct. But he concluded that freezing assets was appropriate to prevent the protests from being financially sustained over the long term. 

            “It was a powerful tool to discourage participation and to incentivise protesters to leave. I am satisfied that it played a meaningful role in shrinking the footprint of the protests, and in doing so, made a meaningful contribution to resolving the Public Order Emergency,"" he writes. 

            The trucker protest grew until it closed a handful of Canada-U.S. border posts and shut down key parts of the capital for more than three weeks. The border blockades eventually ended and the streets around the Canadian Parliament were cleared after authorities launched the largest police operation in Canadian history. 

            The protests, which were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers but also encompassed fury over the range of COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflected the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.

            The self-styled Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted trade, causing economic damage on both sides of the border. Hundreds of trucks eventually occupied the streets around Parliament, a display that was part protest and part carnival.

            For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing, the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, was blocked. The crossing sees more than 25% of the trade between the two countries.

            Rouleau said a series of police failures contributed to a “situation that spun out of control.” He said governments and police forces should have better anticipated it, especially in an environment where misinformation and disinformation is so prevalent today. 

            The 2,000-page report calls the “Freedom Convoy” a “singular moment in history” exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as online misinformation and disinformation.

            “We live in a Banana Republic - Officially. Today, Canadians were robbed of Accountability,"" Tom Marazzo, one of the leaders of the protests, tweeted. 

            Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said the federal government had overwhelming support to invoke the Emergencies Act. 

            “The public didn’t care about whether the technical criteria were met,” Wiseman said. “What most people wanted was an end to the lawlessness and it only occurred after the Liberals invoked the Act.""TORONTO (AP) — A public commission announced Friday that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government met the “very high threshold” for invoking the Emergencies Act to quell the protests by truckers and others angry over Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions last winter.For weeks, hundreds and sometimes thousands of protesters in trucks and other vehicles clogged the streets of Ottawa, the capital, and besieged Parliament Hill, railing against vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 precautions and condemning Trudeau’s Liberal government.Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded various U.S.-Canadian border crossings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813855,Siegrist's scoring touch has Villanova near top of Big East,"NEW YORK (AP) — Villanova's Maddy Siegrist signed autographs and took selfies with adoring young fans for about 30 minutes after helping her No. 14 Wildcats beat St. John's this week, a sign of the increased attention she's been getting on and off the court.

            She leads the nation in scoring with an average of 29.4 points per game (last year, she was No. 2 behind Iowa’s Caitlin Clark, averaging about four points less), and set Big East and school records this season. 

            “You can just see that transformation of Maddy’s game,” Villanova coach Denise Dillon said. “I think the schedule we put together where we played some of the national contenders helped.”











            Siegrist scored a career-best 50 points against Seton Hall on Feb. 11 — the game before the St. John’s win — to set the single-game and career scoring record in the conference. But she's quick to deflect talk of where she fits in with the best players in the country, focusing more on how she can help Villanova (23-4) keep winning. 

            “You’re aware of it,” Siegrist said. “Honestly, you want to do whatever you have to do for your team to win. Sometimes it’s scoring.”

            The team has won 14 of its last 15 games with the lone loss coming against UConn — a five-point defeat — and its best ranking since 2003, 

            Villanova has a chance to move into a first-place tie in the Big East with a victory over No. 6 UConn on Saturday. The game will played on national television in a sold-out arena, the second time that's ever happened.

            “It’s awesome. It’s so exciting to see all the attention our program has gotten over the last month,” Siegrist said. “We're not doing anything different than we’ve been doing.”

            Siegrist is a huge reason why. Her efforts have impressed Villanova alums, including Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who had his jersey retired earlier this month.

            “Maddy? She’s unbelievable. She’s unbelievable. She had 50 points,” the former Wildcats guard said. “I think she’s the all-time leading scorer, men’s and women’s, so she’s unbelievable. And, just wow. As soon as her last game ends, they should just hang (her jersey) up right there. As soon as she’s done, just hang it up.”

            When she was in New York, Siegrist's family hosted their annual dinner for the team. Her mom grew up near St. John's and the family spent summers in the area. She became friends with the community youth teams and many of them came out to support her against St. John's, wearing shirts with Siegrist's name and number on the back.

            “Looking back to when I was a little kid, you tried to get a pamphlet signed by a player and hang it in your room,"" Siegrist said. ""Now I want to take the time and sign all the autographs and take all the pictures I can.”

            Her fans weren't disappointed in the game: Siegrist scored 39 points against the Red Storm, including 19 in the third quarter. That scoring effort put her atop the Philadelphia record books as the city's all-time women's Division I leading scorer.

            “For what she’s done for the league and for them, she’ll be remembered for a long time. I don’t know if we’ll see another one like her,” St. John’s coach Joe Tartamella said. “I’ve been in the league 20 years and I’ve watched (Diana) Taurasi, Maya (Moore), (Breanna) Stewart and all those guys at Connecticut. They are all different and difficult to stop and she is as difficult as anyone I’ve seen in my time here.”

            Siegrist still has another year of eligibility left at Villanova because of the pandemic, but won't decide until after the season whether she'll come back. 

            “I kind of am going in that this might be it,” she said. “I kind of had that mentality all year. I'll sit with my parents and decide. My time at Villanova has been great; if it's time for me to move on, I'll know.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813856,AP source: QB Derek Carr meeting with Jets this weekend,"Free agent quarterback Derek Carr is meeting with the New York Jets this weekend, according to a person familiar with the situation.

            The 31-year-old Carr, who spent his first nine NFL seasons with the Raiders, was released by Las Vegas on Tuesday after he declined to waive the no-trade clause in his contract. Las Vegas needed to trade or release him by Wednesday or $40.4 million of his contract over the next two years would have become fully guaranteed.

            The Jets are looking for a veteran quarterback to lead their offense after Zach Wilson struggled mightily after being the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft. Carr is a potential replacement and New York is bringing him in for a visit, the person told The Associated Press on Friday on condition of anonymity because the team didn't announce its plans. 











            NFL Network first reported Carr will visit with the Jets, who are the second team that the quarterback has met with; he also visited New Orleans shortly before his release. 

            New York is also expected to be interested in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers if he is made available. The four-time NFL MVP told “The Pat McAfee Show” earlier this week he was going to spend four days in isolation on a personal retreat and determine whether he wants to continue his playing career. 

            Carr, the Raiders’ second-round pick in 2014, threw 24 touchdown passes with 14 interceptions this season. After struggling late in the season, Carr was benched with two games remaining and acknowledged he was angry about the decision. 

            He said in a social media post “it breaks my heart” to stay away from the team as the season ended.

            “I once said that if I’m not a Raider, I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way,” Carr wrote.

            Carr confirmed he wasn’t retiring from playing and “that fire burning inside me to win a championship still rages.” 

            The Jets are looking for a quarterback who can team with new offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett to jumpstart an offense that was among the NFL’s worst during the last two years under Mike LaFleur. 

            If he signs with New York, Carr would also be reunited with Todd Downing, the former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator who was recently hired by the Jets as their passing game coordinator. Downing was the Raiders' quarterbacks coach from 2015-16 before serving as offensive coordinator in 2017.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLFree agent quarterback Derek Carr is meeting with the New York Jets this weekend, according to a person familiar with the situation.The 31-year-old Carr, who spent his first nine NFL seasons with the Raiders, was released by Las Vegas on Tuesday after he declined to waive the no-trade clause in his contract. Las Vegas needed to trade or release him by Wednesday or $40.4 million of his contract over the next two years would have become fully guaranteed.The Jets are looking for a veteran quarterback to lead their offense after Zach Wilson struggled mightily after being the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft. Carr is a potential replacement and New York is bringing him in for a visit, the person told The Associated Press on Friday on condition of anonymity because the team didn't announce its plans.NFL Network first reported Carr will visit with the Jets, who are the second team that the quarterback has met with; he also visited New Orleans shortly before his release.New York is also expected to be interested in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers if he is made available. The four-time NFL MVP told “The Pat McAfee Show” earlier this week he was going to spend four days in isolation on a personal retreat and determine whether he wants to continue his playing career.Carr, the Raiders’ second-round pick in 2014, threw 24 touchdown passes with 14 interceptions this season. After struggling late in the season, Carr was benched with two games remaining and acknowledged he was angry about the decision.He said in a social media post “it breaks my heart” to stay away from the team as the season ended.“I once said that if I’m not a Raider, I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way,” Carr wrote.Carr confirmed he wasn’t retiring from playing and “that fire burning inside me to win a championship still rages.”The Jets are looking for a quarterback who can team with new offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett to jumpstart an offense that was among the NFL’s worst during the last two years under Mike LaFleur.If he signs with New York, Carr would also be reunited with Todd Downing, the former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator who was recently hired by the Jets as their passing game coordinator.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813857,Fan sentenced for kicking Arsenal goalkeeper Ramsdale,"LONDON (AP) — A 35-year-old London man has been banned from attending soccer games for four years after pleading guilty to assaulting Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale at the end of a match in January.

            Ramsdale was kicked in the back shortly after Arsenal beat fierce rival Tottenham 2-0 in the north London derby in the Premier League.

            Joseph Watts pleaded guilty Friday at Uxbridge Magistrates Court to three charges including assault by beating.











            Watts, a Tottenham fan, was also given a community-service order and instructed to pay Ramsdale 100 pounds ($120) in compensation.

            Watts had climbed over a barrier before kicking the goalkeeper, who had gone behind one of the goals at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to pick up his water bottle.

            Ramsdale in a victim-impact statement read to the court said he saw a masseuse because his back felt “heavy.” The goalkeeper said he's also wary of similar incidents happening in the future.

            Watts has apologized to Ramsdale and both clubs.

            “He takes full responsibility for those actions, which were deplorable and which no football player should ever have to endure from a fan,” Football Law Associates attorney Robert Perkins, who represented Watts, said in a statement. “He accepts the punishment of the court and now wishes to move on with his life.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813860,Clinic to open near Ohio derailment as health worries linger,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — A plume of chemicals that spilled into the Ohio River after a fiery train derailment  has broken up and is no longer a concern, Ohio's governor said Friday. But worries remain near the disaster site among residents who have complained about lingering headaches and irritated eyes. 

            Despite repeated assurances that air and water testing has shown no signs of contaminants, some around East Palestine, along the Pennsylvania state line, are still skeptical and afraid to return to their homes. 

            Early next week, the state plans to open a medical clinic in the village to evaluate those who are worried and analyze their symptoms, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced. The clinic will include a team of experts in chemical exposures that is being deployed to eastern Ohio. 











            “These are very legitimate questions, and residents deserve an answer,” DeWine said while also emphasizing that testing inside and outside of homes in the village have no found no signs of toxins that were on the train. 

            “We're doing absolutely everything we can to assure residents to what the situation is,” he said. “I understand people have been traumatized. I understand skepticism.” 

            Nick Patrone, who lives four miles outside the village, said there is definitely an irritant in the air. 

            “You feel it,” he said. “A lot of my friends have children who have rashes that are unexplained all over their bodies. They have sore throats, they have congestion, they have ear irritation.” 

            Earlier this week, hundreds of people showed up at a public meeting to voice concerns and get answers from not only state and local leaders but also railroad operator Norfolk Southern. But representatives of the railroad were absent, saying they were worried about physical threats. 

            DeWine was upset by the no-show and said Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw needs to go to East Palestine and answer questions.

            At least five lawsuits have been filed against the railroad, and lawyers have been showing up in the area to offer advice and legal options.

            Two weeks have now passed since the freight train carrying a variety of hazardous chemicals derailed, but the stench of what spilled hasn't left. In the aftermath, residents have complained about finding their cars covered in soot, their homes filled with overpowering odors and their pets getting sick or dying. 

            The chemicals also spilled into nearby creeks, killing thousands of fish, and a smaller amount eventually made their way into the Ohio River. 

            While environmental officials said the contaminant amounts in the river were low enough that they did not pose a threat, cities in Ohio and West Virginia that get their drinking water from the river had been monitoring a slow-moving plume and a few temporarily switched to alternative water sources.

            Water samples on Friday showed the plume is now completely gone, DeWine said. 

            The governor also said that air testing inside 500 homes hasn’t detected dangerous levels in the village since residents were allowed to return after the controlled release and burn of five tanker cars filled with vinyl chloride, which is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. 

            DeWine said the derailment has been traumatic for the village of just under 5,000 people. But he said “no one is trying to downplay anything.”

            Ohio Health Department Director Bruce Vanderhoff said the extensive testing of air and water that has been in place the past two weeks should be reassuring. 

            “We have been guided from the beginning by people who are national experts on what to test for,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813861,1st class of Ukraine fighters finishes advanced US training,"ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT (AP) — The first class of 635 Ukrainian fighters has finished a five-week advanced U.S. training course in Germany on sophisticated combat skills and armored vehicles that will be critical in the coming spring offensive against the Russians, the Pentagon said Friday.

            Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said that additional training is already underway at the Grafenwoehr training area, and will involve about 1,600 more Ukrainian troops. The completion of the first class coincided with a visit to the base by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, giving him his first chance to see Ukrainian soldiers training there.

            The first group of Ukrainian forces arrived at the base on Jan. 15 and was put through an intense course that prepared them to take Bradley fighting vehicles and M109 Paladins into battle. The Bradleys and Paladins are two of the many armored vehicles and tanks that the U.S. and allies have pledged to the Ukrainians to help them punch through entrenched Russian troop lines. The Paladin is a self-propelled howitzer that runs on tracks rather than wheels.











            Ryder said another battalion of Ukrainian troops began training on the Bradley fighting vehicle two weeks ago, and a field artillery battalion started instruction on the Paladin. Those two units total about 710 troops. Another field artillery unit and a Stryker battalion will start training next week, involving about 890 troops. That will be the first Ukrainian battalion to get training on the Stryker, an armored personnel carrier.

            Defense leaders have called the latest training program key to expanding Ukraine's ability to launch a coordinated offensive, teaching its military to effectively move and coordinate its company- and battalion-size units in battle, using combined artillery, armor and ground forces.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has continually pressed Western allies to hasten their military support. Speaking at a major international security conference in Munich on Friday, Zelenskyy said delays would play into Russia’s hand as the war approaches its first anniversary.

            During a visit to the Grafenwoehr training base last month, U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the new skills will better prepare Ukrainian troops to counter any surge in Russian attacks. 

            “This is not a run of the mill rotation,” he said when meeting with U.S. commanders there. “This is one of those moments in time where if you want to make a difference, this is it.”

            The training, which is being done by the 7th Army Training Command, includes classroom instruction, field work and larger combat exercises.ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT (AP) — The first class of 635 Ukrainian fighters has finished a five-week advanced U.S. training course in Germany on sophisticated combat skills and armored vehicles that will be critical in the coming spring offensive against the Russians, the Pentagon said Friday.Pentagon press secretary Brig.

            “This measure, necessary for the time of mourning, is essential to analyze the risks to which our teams are currently exposed,” the group said on Twitter, adding that it will only respond to life-saving emergencies in Burkina Faso for an indefinite period.

            The 21-year-old Southern California native will play right back for Barcelona’s “B” team.

            Barcelona said earlier this month that it had tried to sign Araujo but that an unspecified technical glitch meant it had missed the winter market deadline by 18 seconds.











            At that point, Barcelona’s director of soccer, Mateu Alemany, said the Spanish club was talking to FIFA to see whether the transfer could still be completed. Barcelona was able to finish the deal after reportedly appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

            Barcelona said Araujo has agreed to a contract for the remainder of this season plus three more. The Galaxy will retain a sell-on percentage of the transfer fee if Araujo is sold to another club.

            “He went up through every emotion there was through the process. From being flattered and excited to a club like Barcelona wants you to the possibility that the deal wasn't going to be in place to negotiation,” Galaxy coach and sporting director Greg Vanney said. “This is a big move to a club like Barcelona. He has an opportunity to get settled in.”

            Araujo came up through the LA Galaxy’s academy program before playing four seasons in MLS. He made 89 starts in 100 regular-season appearances with LA and has been a two-time All-Star selection.

            Araujo played in 39 games last season with 35 starts. He had one goal with a career-high nine assists.

            Araujo has also made two starts and three appearances for Mexico.

            “This was a move that was too good to decline. We knew that he was going to be leaving at some point. The timing was great because it was at the end of the window,"" Vanney said. “There is a real understanding that players can develop and get better and move on to a world-class club.”

From being flattered and excited to a club like Barcelona wants you to the possibility that the deal wasn't going to be in place to negotiation,” Galaxy coach and sporting director Greg Vanney said. “This is a big move to a club like Barcelona. He has an opportunity to get settled in.”Araujo came up through the LA Galaxy’s academy program before playing four seasons in MLS. He made 89 starts in 100 regular-season appearances with LA and has been a two-time All-Star selection.Araujo played in 39 games last season with 35 starts. He had one goal with a career-high nine assists.Araujo has also made two starts and three appearances for Mexico.“This was a move that was too good to decline. We knew that he was going to be leaving at some point. The timing was great because it was at the end of the window,"" Vanney said. “There is a real understanding that players can develop and get better and move on to a world-class club.”___AP MLS: https://apnews.com/hub/major-league-soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813875,"NBA keeps eye on regional networks, unveils new app options","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The NBA is keeping a constant eye on the status of the financial problems that some regional sports networks are trying to address, and there does not appear to be immediate concern about what will happen if the owner of those networks files for bankruptcy.

            Los Angeles Clippers chairman Steve Ballmer said Friday that the league provides teams with updates on the situation involving Diamond Sports Group — the largest owner of regional sports networks that owns broadcast rights to 42 professional teams, including 16 NBA clubs.

            Diamond, the parent company of 19 Bally Sports networks, skipped about $140 million in interest payments that were due Wednesday, starting a 30-day grace period that could be the prelude to a bankruptcy filing. 











            Ballmer cautioned that the specifics of what may be happening behind the scenes “changes day to day, minute to minute.”

            “Will there be distribution of NBA games? Yes. Will that happen through the RSNs? I actually hope so. I hope so,” Ballmer told The Associated Press. “Will their bankruptcy be friendly enough for that to happen? I hope so. Will the creditors probably want our games to continue to get distributed? I think so. So somehow, I have faith without knowledge that we’ll get through this.”

            Ballmer spoke Friday on a panel that discussed how the rise in streaming services is creating additional competition for consumer attention as part of the NBA's Tech Summit, an annual part of the league's All-Star weekend. The panel discussion was off the record, but he spoke to AP after the event.

            Commissioner Adam Silver did publicly unveil new personalized options that the league intends to have as part of the future live-game streaming experience — including a feature where fans can scan their own avatar into a live NBA game and have that image replace an actual player by using the league app.

            The NBA is also planning more customized experiences for those choosing to stream games through the app, including alternate languages, integrated betting and enhanced camera angles.

            The challenge for cable is not a new issue: Cord-cutting has become more and more prevalent in recent years, with some industry experts suggesting that two of every five U.S. television households right now are going the streaming route instead of traditional cable or satellite providers.

            Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday that games could be offered digitally in conjunction with MLB.TV if Bally Sports regional networks are no longer broadcasting them – even pointing out that a silver lining of sorts could be baseball getting a chance to address blackout restrictions.

            The National Hockey League said it, too, is monitoring the situation and “will be prepared to address whatever circumstances dictate to provide our fans with access to our games.”

            The NBA has been looking for ways to ensure its fans — the overwhelming majority of whom never go to a game — remain connected. Part of that strategy was a reimagined app offering better streaming options and access to more highlights.

            And in October, the Clippers came out with their own first-of-its-kind answer -- a direct-to-consumer product featuring six different stream options, with more in the planning stages, and without any pay-television subscription required. 

            The NBA’s digital platform, which powers the league’s updated app, was the vehicle the Clippers leveraged to make their idea for what they call ClipperVision happen.

            “I think it’s important that we be able to distribute our games digitally,” Ballmer said.

(AP) — Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw says he won’t be pitching for the United States at the World Baseball Classic and called the situation “super disappointing.”

            “Probably my last chance to get to do it, so I really wanted to do it, but it just didn’t work out for a number of reasons,” Kershaw told reporters Friday from the Dodgers’ spring training camp. “Disappointing, but that’s OK. I’ll be ready for the season. I'll be ready to go.”

            The three-time Cy Young Award winner didn’t specify the reasons that would prevent him from participating. A replacement was not announced.











            “There were some factors that were making it hard for me to play,” Kershaw said. “I tried to work it out on my own, tried to work it out with MLB, union, the team. Everybody worked hard to try to make it work. Just wasn’t able to.""

            Kershaw, who turns 35 on March 19, added that Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has been helpful throughout the process.

            “Obviously it’s not the first choice of any team to let their guy play for somebody else, but they were great about it,"" Kershaw said.

            
                Kershaw signed a $20 million, one-year contract to return to the Dodgers this season. He went 12-3 with 2.28 ERA in 22 starts and had two stints on the injured list last season.

(AP) — Pittsburgh beat first baseman Ji-Man Choi in salary arbitration on Friday while Seattle outfielder Teoscar Hernández and St. Louis pitcher Génesis Cabrera went to the last two hearings of the year.

            Choi got a raise from $3.2 million to $4.65 million instead of his $5.4 million request in a decision by Jeanne Charles, Allen Ponak and Melinda Gordon, who heard the case a day earlier. The 31-year-old hit .233 with 11 homers and 52 RBIs for Tampa Bay and made $3.2 million, then was traded to the Pirates in November for a minor leaguer.

            Teams hold an 8-5 lead with six decisions to be issued Saturday.











            Hernández will set a record win or lose for highest salary awarded in arbitration, though there have been larger deals in negotiated agreements. He asked for a raise from $10.65 million to $16 million, and the Mariners argued for $14 million in a case heard by Mark Burstein, John Woods and Howard Edelman. The previous high for an arbitration award was $13.5 million by pitcher Gerrit Cole in his 2019 win over Houston and by pitcher Max Fried in his loss to Atlanta this year.

            An All-Star in 2021, Hernández hit .267 with 25 home runs and 77 RBIs in 131 games last season for Toronto, then was traded to Seattle in November for right-hander reliever Erik Swanson and minor league lefty Adam Macko. Hernández, 30, is eligible for free agency after this year’s World Series.

            Cabrera asked for a raise from $719,200 to $1.15 million, and the Cardinals argued for $950,000 during a hearing before Jules Bloch, Scott Buchheit and Fredric Horowitz. The 26-year-old left-hander was eligible for arbitration for the first time after going 4-2 with a 4.63 ERA in 39 relief appearances.

            Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe ($11.9 million vs. $11.25 million) and infielder Gio Urshela ($10 million vs. $8.4 million) will learn the decisions of their cases on Saturday along with Tampa Bay relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1,175,000).

            The 19 hearings this year were up from 13 last year and the most since 22 in 2018.

            Arizona pitcher Josh Rojas lost his case on Thursday and will get $2,575,000 rather than $2.9 million. Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen attended the hearing.

            “Even the fact he was there, that’s a rarity,” Rojas said Friday. “GMs and front office people try to stay away from that situation, just because it’s tough to bash a player when you’re paying them to perform on the field. So it meant a lot for him to show up.”

            “There’s definitely some playing with the numbers, some things they throw out there you disagree with, but that’s what they’re in there to do. They’re there to show the judges that you are worth less than the middle number. Our job on our side is to show we’re worth more than the number.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813878,Murdaugh prosecutors reveal flurry of steps after killings,"Alex Murdaugh's cellphone showed a sudden flurry of activity just before he drove away in his SUV some 16 minutes after investigators think his wife and son were killed, a state agent testified Friday at the disgraced South Carolina lawyer's double murder trial.

            GPS data from Murdaugh's SUV and cellphone data also shows Murdaugh tried to call 911 but misdialed less than 20 seconds after he arrived at the kennels where the bodies of his son and wife were, a short distance from their home. After about another 20 seconds, Murdaugh completed the emergency call and told the 911 operator he checked them to see if they were alive.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the killings of his 52-year-old wife Maggie and their 22-year-old son Paul on June 7, 2021, at their home in Colleton County. He faces 30 years to life in prison if he is convicted.











            Prosecutors rested their case Friday after presenting 61 witnesses and introducing more than 550 pieces of evidence over 17 days of testimony.

            They ended with a detailed to-the-second, 43-page color-coded timeline of everything that happened with the cellphones of Murdaugh, his wife and son during the six hours leading up to and after their deaths. Murdaugh's phone settings didn't record specific location data,

            The timeline includes the 16 minutes between when investigators think Paul Murdaugh was killed at close range with two shotgun blasts and Maggie Murdaugh was shot four or five times with a rifle — because their cellphones stopped being used at that point — and when the GPS data in his SUV showed Murdaugh left the home to visit his ailing mother.

            Prosecutor Creighton Waters pointed out that Murdaugh's phone had shown no activity for an hour, and then suddenly came back to life before he drove away. It showed him taking more than 70 steps a minute for about four minutes, well over the pace he had walked any other time that evening. Exactly where he was walking wasn't captured.

            “He was a busy guy right then, was he?"" Waters asked State Law Enforcement Division agent Peter Rudofski.

            “It appears,"" Rudofski replied.

            In cross examination, defense attorney Phillip Barber pointed out the step data didn't include the distance walked and criticized the analysis of how fast Murdaugh was walking since it wasn't compared to data any other day.

            “He was going particularly fast for him, unusually slow for him or the same speed which he usually goes — did anyone look at that?” Barber asked.

            “All we have here is the data that is on that sheet,"" Rudofski said.

            The timeline also marked that the backlight on Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone turned off at about the same time Alex Murdaugh's SUV drove by the spot on the two lane highway not far from the family's home where his wife's phone was found the next day.

            Murdaugh told police that he tried to call and text his wife and son after he returned home that night and didn't see them, so he got back into the SUV to go down to the kennels to look for them, a drive that can take a minute or more.

            Prosecutors pointed out Murdaugh unsuccessfully tried to call 911, but put in an extra one, 20 seconds after he SUV stopped at the kennel. He retried and was successful about 20 seconds later.

            Barber played a 20-second timer on his phone to show how long that was and pointed out the SUV's headlights likely illuminated the bodies before Murdaugh stopped the vehicle.

            Barber spent much of his cross-examination asking Rudofski questions like when Murdaugh's SUV data showed he going 80 mph, could he be passing a car? Rudofski said he couldn't know. Several other questions by the defense specified that data can be interpreted in different ways. 

            Earlier Friday, defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian, for the first time in front of the jurors, mentioned that Murdaugh has been held in jail without bail for nearly two years and won't walk free even if he is found not guilty of murder because of all the other crimes he is charged with, ranging from stealing from clients and his family law firm to money laundering to tax evasion.

            “Was he indicted on 90 charges of financial fraud for which he faces life without parole?” Harpootlian asked another state agent.

            Prosecutors objected and the judge sustained it, meaning jurors are supposed to ignore the question. But it was already out there.

            Prosecutors ended their questioning of Rudofski by asking him to identify a few other items agents pulled off Maggie Murdaugh's iPhone.

            The first was a recent picture of her and her sister in evening dresses. The second was a photo of her and her two sons — the first one introduced in the trial that didn't also include Alex Murdaugh.Alex Murdaugh's cellphone showed a sudden flurry of activity just before he drove away in his SUV some 16 minutes after investigators think his wife and son were killed, a state agent testified Friday at the disgraced South Carolina lawyer's double murder trial.GPS data from Murdaugh's SUV and cellphone data also shows Murdaugh tried to call 911 but misdialed less than 20 seconds after he arrived at the kennels where the bodies of his son and wife were, a short distance from their home.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813880,Iowa school closed after shooting could reopen next week,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — At-risk highschoolers in Des Moines could return to an alternative education program as soon as next week amid enhanced security, a month after a shooting killed two of their classmates, the program's founder said Friday.

            Will Keeps, who founded Starts Right Here, was shot in the hip and right hand as he tried to intervene to stop the violence. Although he's still recovering, he says the Jan. 23 shooting left him more motivated to resume his work with teens who dropped out or were suspended from traditional schools.

            When students return, however, there will be armed guards and metal detectors.











            “Safety is number one,"" Keeps said.

            The students who died were Gionni Dameron, 18, and Rashad Carr, 16. Police allege that student Preston Walls, 18, fired the shots before fleeing in a car driven by Bravon Michael Tukes, 19. Walls and Tukes, both of Des Moines, were each charged with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of criminal gang participation. They are being held in jail with bail set at $2.5 million for each.

            Keeps, an activist and rapper whose given name is Will Holmes, spoke with reporters about the shooting for the first time. Keeps must use a walker and has a bright orange cast on his right hand, but said he's feeling better physically.

            Still, he finds it nearly impossible not to dwell on what happened.

            “I can vividly see what happened every time I close my eyes,” Keeps said. “I have to fight and tell myself, ‘Think of something else.’”

            Most painful, Keeps said, is thinking about the students killed and the student now facing a charge that could keep him prison for the rest of his life. Keeps noted that Walls was only days away from graduating high school.

            Keeps, who was in a gang as a teen growing up in Chicago before moving to Des Moines and later starting the school, said the program focuses on helping students gain patience and see a future for themselves.

            “You had three young men who actually were doing better, and that street life, that street mindset took it all away,” he said. “I lost three kids that day.”

            In the wake of the shootings, students have been able to continue their education at another school district site, but Keeps said they and their parents are eager for Starts Right Here to reopen.

            “That situation is a reason why we keep going,” Keeps said. “It's not the reason why we stop, it's the reason why we keep fighting, because we don't want that type of situation to happen again.”DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — At-risk highschoolers in Des Moines could return to an alternative education program as soon as next week amid enhanced security, a month after a shooting killed two of their classmates, the program's founder said Friday.Will Keeps, who founded Starts Right Here, was shot in the hip and right hand as he tried to intervene to stop the violence. Although he's still recovering, he says the Jan. 23 shooting left him more motivated to resume his work with teens who dropped out or were suspended from traditional schools.When students return, however, there will be armed guards and metal detectors.“Safety is number one,"" Keeps said.The students who died were Gionni Dameron, 18, and Rashad Carr, 16. Police allege that student Preston Walls, 18, fired the shots before fleeing in a car driven by Bravon Michael Tukes, 19. Walls and Tukes, both of Des Moines, were each charged with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of criminal gang participation. They are being held in jail with bail set at $2.5 million for each.Keeps, an activist and rapper whose given name is Will Holmes, spoke with reporters about the shooting for the first time. Keeps must use a walker and has a bright orange cast on his right hand, but said he's feeling better physically.Still, he finds it nearly impossible not to dwell on what happened.“I can vividly see what happened every time I close my eyes,” Keeps said. “I have to fight and tell myself, ‘Think of something else.’”Most painful, Keeps said, is thinking about the students killed and the student now facing a charge that could keep him prison for the rest of his life. Keeps noted that Walls was only days away from graduating high school.Keeps, who was in a gang as a teen growing up in Chicago before moving to Des Moines and later starting the school, said the program focuses on helping students gain patience and see a future for themselves.“You had three young men who actually were doing better, and that street life, that street mindset took it all away,” he said. “I lost three kids that day.”Starts Right Here has a contract to work with Des Moines schools students, typically 40 at a time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813882,"At New York Fashion Week, music can be as crucial as clothes","NEW YORK (AP) — The carpets have been rolled up and the racks of clothes have disappeared, leaving only a few stray feathers and sequins behind, but some New York Fashion Week guests may still be humming the tunes they heard on the runways for days to come.

            That’s actually a goal for many designers when they choose the precious few songs played as models strut the runway, wearing their latest lines.

            “It’s a quick movie that we’re doing when we put a fashion show together,” Michael Kors told The Associated Press in an interview this week at his fall/winter show. “The soundtrack is so important.”











            Kors’ latest collection featured some bohemian flair: miniskirts, big belts and high boots, made of suede, and fringe accents with a modern sensibility. It was an ode to strong women who influenced him in his early life, like Tina Turner, Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, who sat in the front row.

            In a nod to them, Kors’ team created an all-female soundtrack, much of it played by a live string orchestra in the center of the runway. 

            ”You’re going to hear Joan Baez, a little Stevie Nicks, and then Grace Slick,"" Kors said, adding that his anthem was “always” Jefferson Airplane's “Somebody to Love.” “I always think what hits me emotionally in the gut, but then I always find a different way to do it. Jefferson Airplane done orchestrally is definitely a spin on things.”

            Designer David Blond of The Blonds brand agrees that he and his partner Phillipe Blond are inspired by film and music and see their shows as pieces of art. 

            “All of our soundtracks are cinematic in scope and they really do … support the show. And it wouldn’t be the same without it, not just the visual, but the sound is really important,” David Blond said.

            For Wes Gordon, the creative director for Carolina Herrera, this season’s playlist was personal. Models walked the runway at The Plaza Hotel to “Georgia on My Mind,” among other songs.

            “'Georgia' was a nod to my newborn daughter. Her name is Georgia. She’s far too young to know or appreciate it but someday I’ll tell her,” Gordon said as his eyes lit up.

            There are many elements competing for attention at fashion shows — the clothes, hair and makeup, celebrity and industry guests in the front row, and often dramatic venues. But the music can set a tone or underscore a theme the designer is trying to convey.

            Many of the Herrera designs had a feminine, romantic essence. 

            “I kind of did a love theme because tomorrow is Valentine’s Day,” Gordon said on Monday. “The opening was ‘Say a Little Prayer.’ We did Rihanna of course because, Rihanna is Rihanna! And the finale was Whitney Houston’s ‘I Wanna Dance with Somebody.’""

            Tory Burch is a longtime women's empowerment advocate and chose her playlist to include iconic female voices. 

            “I wanted to think about women vocalists and singers … starting with Tammy Wynette,” Burch said after her show. “The idea of ‘Stand by Your Man’ and clearly, you know, I believe in women’s empowerment, so it’s a bit ironic, although I think Tammy Wynette was an amazing, strong woman.”

            
                Models at her show also walked to opera and the Eurythmics, and ended with Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain.” When asked why that song, Burch smiled and — much like Simon’s reluctance to fully divulge the song's inspiration — Burch said she wanted her choice to use it to be “left to interpretation.”

            Many designers were eager to discuss their music choices, seeing it as part of their message when putting out a new collection.

            “Fashion and music, there’s a blur where one leaves off and one begins,” Mark Badgley of Badgley Mischka said. “There’s a lot of designers whose soundtracks inspire every detail on the runway. It definitely has an influence over what we do.”

            James Mischka takes the lead on choosing music for their shows and this season was influenced by travel to Italy and a film the two liked.

            “We started off with a lot of retro ‘60s Italian music,"" Mischka said. ""We used a little bit of the music from ‘The Menu’ … which is one of our favorite movies and the music is entrancing and hypnotic to give a sort of hypnotic feeling to the whole show.”

            Much like designing clothes, music is subjective so designers can’t always please their audience with the songs they choose. 

            “Some people are more judgmental about the music than they are about the clothes,” Badgley says with a laugh. “We’re up against that all the time.”

            The fashion week schedule is typically jampacked with several shows happening each day, so music is one way to remain memorable. That’s one of Gordon’s objectives when scoring his shows. 

            “My hope is always that you leave and by the end of the day, you hate me so much because the song is stuck in your head and you can’t get it out!” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813884,Sen. Rick Scott alters policy plan causing heartburn for GOP,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida has amended his plan to overhaul how the federal government works after Democrats, including President Joe Biden, repeatedly invoked it to accuse Republicans of looking to cut Medicare and Social Security.

            Scott unveiled his original plan last year when serving as chair of the campaign committee for Senate Republicans. It called for all federal legislation to sunset in five years, and if a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.

            His revised plan specifies exceptions for Social Security, Medicare, national security, veterans benefits, and other essential services. The change comes as Democrats work to drive a wedge between GOP lawmakers and their base of older voters who rely on government programs for income and health insurance.











            Biden held up a pamphlet of Scott's original plan when he visited the senator's home state of Florida last week, saying “I know that a lot of Republicans — their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. If that’s your dream, I’m your nightmare.”

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has also been highlighting Scott’s proposals to criticize the GOP's budgetary demands. And Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has consistently sought to distance Senate Republicans from Scott, telling reporters this week: “Let me say one more time, there is no agenda on the part of Senate Republicans to revisit Medicare or Social Security, period.""

            Scott's new plan takes a shot at his critics, saying in bold typeface: “Note to President Biden, Sen. Schumer, and Sen. McConnell – As you know, this was never intended to apply to Social Security, Medicare, or the US Navy.""

            Scott explained the changes he made in a Washington Examiner op-ed that lashed out at Biden as well as McConnell.

            “I have never supported cutting Social Security or Medicare, ever. To say otherwise is a disingenuous Democrat lie from a very confused president. And Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is also well aware of that. It’s shallow gotcha politics, which is what Washington does,"" Scott wrote.

            The White House wasn’t buying Scott’s explanation, though. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said cutting Medicare and Social Security was a “longstanding passion” for Scott.

            “Make no mistake, his true colors are undeniable and on the record,” Jean-Pierre said.

            McConnell and Scott have been at odds for some time now. Scott challenged McConnell in November to become the chamber's minority leader, but McConnell easily prevailed in the first attempt to oust him. The vote was 37-10, senators said, with one other senator voting present. 

            House Republicans have been calling for reducing government spending as part of any agreement to increase the nation's borrowing authority in the coming months. Democrats have been calling for a clean debt ceiling with no strings attached and are challenging Republicans to spell out any cuts they propose to make. Scott's overhaul Friday signals the difficulty Republicans will have in answering that challenge.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813889,Protesters storm Suriname parliament over high fuel prices,"PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators stormed Suriname’s parliament, broke windows and looted nearby businesses Friday to protest high fuel and electricity prices in the South American nation.

            Protesters in the capital, Paramaribo, overwhelmed police who had fired tear gas to try to control the crowd. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were injuries in the melee.

            The protesters demanded the resignation President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, who recently ended the state subsidies for fuel and electricity on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund. Demonstrators also were upset about inflation in the prices of other basic goods and the weakening of the Suriname dollar.











            Authorities condemned the attack and said those responsible would be brought to justice.

            “The government respects everybody’s right to protest but will not tolerate actions like the ones demonstrated today,” Santokhi's administration said in a brief statement.

            At least two labor unions called for strikes that prompted banks, ports and schools to shut down.

            The protest in the capital ended by early Friday afternoon, with calm returning to the streets.

            The change in subsidies policy also has led to turmoil within the government. On Wednesday, members of the Suriname National Party withdrew from the ruling coalition of Santokhi, who is from the Progressive Reform Party.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813892,Twins' Correa: `Money is just a number in your bank account',"FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — Carlos Correra sat at an interview table, wearing a dark T-shirt with the Twins logo across his chest and a Minnesota spring training cap with an “M.""

            That look didn't seem possible two months ago.

            After his $350 million, 13-year deal with San Francisco came undone over his surgically repaired right ankle and his $315 million, 12-year contract with the New York Mets collapsed over the same issue, Correa stayed with the Twins for $200 million over six seasons.











            “Money is money, brother. If money is what makes you happy then you’ve got to re-evaluate your life,” Correa said Friday after reporting to spring training. “You will never hear me bragging about being the richest man in the room or anything like that. Money is just a number in your bank account.” 

            Correa can earn $270 million over 10 years as part of his deal with the Twins, far less than he would have been guaranteed by the Giants or Mets. 

            He left Houston after the 2021 season and joined the Twins for a $105.3 million, three-year deal that included opt-outs after each season. He pulled out of the deal after making $35.1 million in 2022.

            “Absolutely. It feels completely different,"" he said. ""You go in and now you know you’re going to be here for a long time. You want to put all your effort and everything I have is to make everyone in that room better from the front office to the coaching staff to the players; to make sure the player communication is there and to make sure we achieve the goals we want to achieve.” 

            He entered the clubhouse shortly before 9 a.m. with two baseball gloves hanging off his bag, then he walked around shaking hands and hugging both his old and new teammates. About 90 minutes later, he took some swings in an indoor batting cage.

            The 28-year-old Correa started slowly last season and finished with a .291 average and 22 homers and 64 RBIs.

            Minnesota was tied for the AL Central lead before play on Sept. 5 but lost 20 of its last 30 games and finished 78-84. The Twins wound up 14 games behind AL Central champion Cleveland and eight games back for the last AL wild card.

            “I know the seeds I’m going to plant here are the seeds that are going to grow and make us an organization that can win for a long time,” Correa said. “That’s what I want. When you have a short-term deal and you probably end up with another team, you have to be with that team and help build up. Now, it’s good to know and feel that I’m going to be here for a long time and be a part of the process.”

            A 2017 World Series champion with Houston and the AL Rookie of the Year in 2015, Correa was among a stellar group of free-agent shortstops. Xander Bogaerts left Boston for a $280 million, 11-year deal with San Diego and Trea Turner departed the Los Angeles Dodgers for $300 million over 11 years with NL champion Philadelphia.

            “Winning the division is not going to be enough,” he said. “We’ve got to set goals that are really high. That way, when you accomplish them, you’ll be really satisfied. That’s the plan here, man, we want to win. We want to win big.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813897,Pierce to pay $1.4M to settle with SEC on crypto violations,"Former NBA player Paul Pierce has agreed to pay about $1.4 million to settle charges that he touted EMAX tokens on social media without disclosing the payment he received for the promotion and for making false and misleading promotional statements about the same crypto asset, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.

            EMAX tokens are crypto asset securities offered and sold by EthereumMax. In afternoon trading, each token was down more than 8% to a fraction of a penny. 

            The SEC’s order found that Pierce failed to disclose that he was paid more than $244,000 worth of EMAX tokens to promote the tokens on Twitter. The SEC’s order also found that Pierce tweeted misleading statements related to EMAX, including tweeting a screenshot of an account showing large holdings and profits without disclosing that his own personal holdings were in fact much lower than those in the screenshot. In addition, one of Pierce’s tweets contained a link to the EthereumMax website, which provided instructions for potential investors to purchase EMAX tokens.











            The SEC’s order found that Pierce violated the anti-touting and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 

            Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Pierce agreed to pay a $1,115,000 penalty and approximately $240,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Pierce also agreed to not promote any crypto asset securities for three years.Former NBA player Paul Pierce has agreed to pay about $1.4 million to settle charges that he touted EMAX tokens on social media without disclosing the payment he received for the promotion and for making false and misleading promotional statements about the same crypto asset, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.EMAX tokens are crypto asset securities offered and sold by EthereumMax.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813898,Amazon asks corporate staff to be in offices 3 days a week,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon will require its corporate employees to return to the office at least three days a week.

            CEO Andy Jassy announced the policy Friday in a memo to staff. It marks a shift from Amazon's current policy of allowing leaders to determine how their teams worked. The change will go into effect May 1. 

            Many companies have been calling their employees back to the office after the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to operate virtually. 











            Last month, Starbucks told its corporate employees to plan to work from the office three days a week. Disney is asking employees to plan for four in-office days starting in March. And Walmart said this week that it would require its tech teams to plan regular in-office work days. 

            Jassy said in his memo that Amazon made its decision after observing what worked during the pandemic. Among other things, he said the senior leadership team watched how staff performed and talked to leaders at other companies. He said they concluded employees tended to be more engaged in person and collaborate more easily. 

            The move could help local economies, he said.

            “I’m also optimistic that this shift will provide a boost for the thousands of businesses located around our urban headquarter locations in the Puget Sound, Virginia, Nashville, and the dozens of cities around the world where our employees go to the office,” Jassy wrote.

            Jassy said the details of the policy haven’t been finalized. He said he wanted to share the decision — made at a meeting of the company's senior leadership team this week — as early as possible. He said there will be certain roles that will be exempted from the policy, “but that will be a small minority.”

            Last month, Amazon announced it would trim 18,000 corporate positions in its efforts to prune payrolls that rapidly expanded during the pandemic lockdown. Other big tech companies, including Salesforce and Google, have been doing the same.NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon will require its corporate employees to return to the office at least three days a week.CEO Andy Jassy announced the policy Friday in a memo to staff. It marks a shift from Amazon's current policy of allowing leaders to determine how their teams worked. The change will go into effect May 1.Many companies have been calling their employees back to the office after the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to operate virtually.Last month, Starbucks told its corporate employees to plan to work from the office three days a week. Disney is asking employees to plan for four in-office days starting in March. And Walmart said this week that it would require its tech teams to plan regular in-office work days.Jassy said in his memo that Amazon made its decision after observing what worked during the pandemic. Among other things, he said the senior leadership team watched how staff performed and talked to leaders at other companies. He said they concluded employees tended to be more engaged in person and collaborate more easily.The move could help local economies, he said.“I’m also optimistic that this shift will provide a boost for the thousands of businesses located around our urban headquarter locations in the Puget Sound, Virginia, Nashville, and the dozens of cities around the world where our employees go to the office,” Jassy wrote.Jassy said the details of the policy haven’t been finalized.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813900,DOJ search of Pence's office turns up no new classified docs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department searched the office of former Vice President Mike Pence 's Washington advocacy group for several hours Friday as part of its investigation into the discovery of sensitive documents at the homes and offices of current and former top U.S. officials.

            Pence adviser Devin O’Malley said no additional documents with classified markings were discovered during a “thorough and unrestricted search” of the office of Advancing American Freedom, the nonprofit group launched by Pence in 2021. One binder — believed to be part of Pence's 2020 debate preparations — “with approximately three previously redacted documents” was taken by agents.

            The search, described by both parties as consensual, came after negotiations between Pence’s representatives and the Justice Department and a week after the FBI searched Pence’s Indiana home and discovered one additional document with classified markings. That was after lawyers hired by Pence last month discovered what aides have described as a “small number” of potentially sensitive documents they say were inadvertently transported to Pence's home in boxes at the end of the Trump administration. 











            Pence had asked his lawyers to conduct the search after an outcry over the discovery of classified documents at President Joe Biden's Delaware home and office. He's said repeatedly he was unaware they were there.

            The willingness of Pence and Biden to permit the FBI to search their homes and offices stands in contrast to former President Donald Trump, who is under federal investigation for own handling of classified information and whose refusal to cooperate with officials last year resulted in the Justice Department having to get an unprecedented warrant to inspect his Florida property.

            It also comes after Pence, who is widely expected launch a campaign for president in the coming months, announced that he will fight a subpoena to appear before a grand jury in a separate investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

            Pence has described the subpoena as “unprecedented” and “unconstitutional” and argues that he is protected from being called to appear because he was acting in his capacity as president of the Senate when he presided over the certification of the vote on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day that a Trump-supporting mob violently stormed the Capitol building.

            “The vice president has consistently cooperated with appropriate authorities, has been fully transparent, and looks forward to the imminent conclusion of this matter,” O’Malley said.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department searched the office of former Vice President Mike Pence 's Washington advocacy group for several hours Friday as part of its investigation into the discovery of sensitive documents at the homes and offices of current and former top U.S. officials.Pence adviser Devin O’Malley said no additional documents with classified markings were discovered during a “thorough and unrestricted search” of the office of Advancing American Freedom, the nonprofit group launched by Pence in 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813901,Richmond's Mooney stepping away to undergo heart surgery,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Richmond coach Chris Mooney said Friday he is stepping away from the Spiders for the remainder of the season to undergo heart surgery.

            Mooney, 50, said the procedure will be performed next week at the University of Virginia Medical Center to remove an aneurysm in his ascending aorta. Recovery is expected to take four to eight weeks.

            A problem was first detected during a routine physical about a month ago, Mooney said at a news conference, and doctors were able to pinpoint the aneurysm during subsequent testing.











            Assistant coach Peter Thomas will guide the Spiders for the rest of the season, and Mooney said he's confident Thomas “will do a great job.”

            Mooney admitted to being “very nervous and a little scared,” but added, “I hope that this will be something that I can recover well from and I do turn my focus to that right now.”

            He told his team early Friday afternoon and described them as being “shocked,” but said they would all have dinner together later in the day so he can answer any questions and possibly ease their concern.

            Mooney is in his 18th season as coach of the Spiders, during which time he became their career victories leader with a 367-297 record. 

            He signed a three-year extension in June after guiding the Spiders to four straight victories in the Atlantic-10 Tournament — the last three against the top three seeds in succession — and an upset over Big Ten champion Iowa in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

            The Spiders (13-14) were picked to finish seventh in the conference this season when they had to replace three of their top four scorers and brought in four freshmen and three unheralded transfers.

            They have four regular season games remaining.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813902,"Sheriff: Gunman kills 6, including ex-wife, in Mississippi","ARKABUTLA, Miss. (AP) — A lone gunman killed six people including his ex-wife and stepfather Friday at multiple locations in a tiny rural community in northern Mississippi, the sheriff said, leaving investigators searching for clues to what motivated the rampage.

            Armed with a shotgun and two handguns, 52-year-old Richard Dale Crum, who a family friend said had a history of mental illness, opened fire at about 11 a.m. and killed a man in the driver's seat of a pickup truck parked outside a convenience store in Arkabutla, near the Tennessee state line, Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance said.

            Deputies were working the crime scene when a second 911 call alerted authorities to another shooting a few miles away. After arriving at a home, they found a woman, whom the sheriff identified as Crum's ex-wife, shot dead and her current husband wounded.











            Lance said deputies caught up with Crum outside his own home and arrested him. Behind the residence they found two handymen slain by gunfire — one in the road, another in an SUV. Inside a neighboring home, they discovered the bodies of Crum's stepfather and his stepfather's sister.

            “Everybody has crime, and from time to time we have violent crime, but certainly nothing of this magnitude,” Lance said in an interview. He added: “Without being able to say what triggered this, that’s the scary part.”

            Crum, 52, was jailed without bond on a single charge of capital murder, and Lance said investigators were working to bring additional charges. It was not immediately known if Crum had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

            That initial murder charge was for the killing of Chris Eugene Boyce, 59, the man who was shot outside the store. Boyce's brother was in the truck with him at the time and fled, according to the sheriff. Lance added that Crum chased the brother through a wooded area before he escaped unharmed. 

            Deputy Tate County Coroner Ernie Lentz identified the others killed as Debra Crum, 60; Charles Manuel, 76; John Rorie, 59; George McCain, 73; and Lynda McCain, 78. Lentz also said Boyce was from Lakeland, Florida.

            Ethan Cash, who lives near the store, told WREG-TV he heard a gunshot from inside his house. 

            “I had just woken up and I look back here, and I see dude walking back here with a shotgun,” he said.

            Cash added that he went to the scene and found one person who had been shot. He checked for a pulse, but found none. 

            In the lobby of the Sheriff’s Office, Norma Washington told The Associated Press that Boyce was her nephew. She said he and the brother, Doug, who lives in Alaska, had been in town cleaning up a property they inherited from their deceased uncle.

            “I lost my brother, and now this one,” Washington said. “This has been something else.”

            It was unclear whether Crum knew either of the brothers.

            Ashley McKinney, a 38-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee, dated Debra Crum’s son, Sid Furniss, when the two were teens and has remained friends with the family ever since.

            She recalls when Debra Crum started dating Richard Dale Crum. At first all was well, but then signs of Richard Dale Crum’s mental illness became apparent, with him suddenly imitating the moves of Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan. Sometimes he even had swords.

            “He ain’t never been right,” McKinney said.

            Debra Crum was hopeful that the psychiatric facilities could fix him. But eventually she grew uncomfortable working her overnight shifts at the Waffle House restaurant alone, unsure what Richard Dale Crum would do, and asked McKinney to keep her company.

            McKinney had no knowledge he was physically abusive, saying, “I don’t know how to put it other than that he wasn’t all there.”

            She said that Richard Dale Crum largely worked odd jobs, like cutting firewood. McKinney said he told Debra Crum that when he qualified for disability that he would leave her. And that is exactly what happened, said McKinney, adding that he was living with his stepfather. 

            Debra Crum had survived breast cancer and was getting ready to undergo surgery in March for another medical condition. But McKinney said she was the “sweetest person"" and happy with her fiancé.

            The killings stunned residents of Arkabutla, home to 285 people and located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Memphis, Tennessee. It's the hometown of famed actor James Earl Jones, and nearby Arkabutla Lake is a popular fishing and recreational destination.

            An elementary school and a high school in nearby Coldwater both went on lockdown while the suspect was being sought, according to the Coldwater Elementary School Facebook page. A short time later, a second post on the page said the lockdown had been lifted and “all students and staff are safe.” 

            April Wade, who lives in Arkabutla and grew up in Coldwater, said both are small communities where most people know each other, “but if you don’t, you know somebody who knows somebody.” 

            Speaking from a local tire store in the afternoon, Wade said she and her husband were aware of the shootings but had not yet heard the names of the suspect or victims.

            “I think it’s crazy,” Wade said. “You do not expect something like that to happen so close to home.”

            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said its agents were providing assistance to the sheriff’s department and state investigators. Lance said one of their top priorities was to determine a motive.

            The sheriff, who has lived in the area his entire life and served in law enforcement for 25 years, said he could recall no prior problems with Crum.

            The U.S. has seen a deadly start to 2023, including six mass killings in a three-week period in January, according to an Associated Press/USA Today database. It defines a mass killing as four or more people dead, not including the perpetrator.

            There have also been a number of mass shootings in which fewer people were slain, such as Monday’s shooting at Michigan State University in which three people were killed and five were wounded.

            In a statement, President Joe Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden were mourning the six victims and praying for the survivors. He urged Congress to act now on gun law reforms to address what he called “an epidemic” of gun violence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813905,FIA clarifies ban on drivers making political statements,"The governing body for Formula One issued guidance Friday on a rule recently introduced that prohibited drivers from speaking out on political and controversial issues. 

            The FIA's original rule barred “political, religious and personal statements” without prior consent, and expressed no limitations on where that restriction applied. Drivers were nearly unanimous in their criticism of the ruling and seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton said he would not follow the ban. 

            The guidance issued Friday puts limits on when the FIA can apply the rules — and the restrictions will be upheld during pre- and post-race events and on the track.











            The guidance noted drivers “can express their views on any political, religious or personal matter before, during and after” the race “in their own space, and outside the scope of the international competition.”

            The FIA will permit the freedom of speech “through their own social media, during interviews with accredited media and during the FIA press conference, only in response to direct questions from journalists.”

            The FIA will allow “exceptional” circumstances in which it could grant a driver the ability to make a political statement ""at an international competition that would otherwise be prohibited” if that request is submitted to the governing body four weeks in advance of an event.

            The driver must “provide reason(s) why such permission should be granted."" 

            The FIA noted ""the updates cement the FIA’s longstanding commitment to protecting motor sport’s neutrality, and will particularly ensure neutrality during key moments across all motor sport competitions, such as podiums, national anthems and official activities ‘on the field of play’ - it does not impose any additional restrictions on individuals expressing their views outside of these times.

            “It was necessary to provide a separate guidance document to facilitate the implementation of the principles of neutrality across the many different motor sport disciplines.”

            Hamilton this week said ""nothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I am passionate about and the issues that there are.

            “I feel the sport does have a responsibility to speak out on things and raise awareness on certain topics, particularly as we travel to all these places, so nothing changes for me,"" he added. 

            George Russell, his teammate at Mercedes and a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, has called the rule “silly” and “totally unnecessary.”

Drivers were nearly unanimous in their criticism of the ruling and seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton said he would not follow the ban.The guidance issued Friday puts limits on when the FIA can apply the rules — and the restrictions will be upheld during pre- and post-race events and on the track.The guidance noted drivers “can express their views on any political, religious or personal matter before, during and after” the race “in their own space, and outside the scope of the international competition.”The FIA will permit the freedom of speech “through their own social media, during interviews with accredited media and during the FIA press conference, only in response to direct questions from journalists.”The FIA will allow “exceptional” circumstances in which it could grant a driver the ability to make a political statement ""at an international competition that would otherwise be prohibited” if that request is submitted to the governing body four weeks in advance of an event.The driver must “provide reason(s) why such permission should be granted.""The FIA noted ""the updates cement the FIA’s longstanding commitment to protecting motor sport’s neutrality, and will particularly ensure neutrality during key moments across all motor sport competitions, such as podiums, national anthems and official activities ‘on the field of play’ - it does not impose any additional restrictions on individuals expressing their views outside of these times.“It was necessary to provide a separate guidance document to facilitate the implementation of the principles of neutrality across the many different motor sport disciplines.”Hamilton this week said ""nothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I am passionate about and the issues that there are.“I feel the sport does have a responsibility to speak out on things and raise awareness on certain topics, particularly as we travel to all these places, so nothing changes for me,"" he added.George Russell, his teammate at Mercedes and a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, has called the rule “silly” and “totally unnecessary.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813908,Meat plant cleaning service fined $1.5M for hiring minors,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — One of the country's largest cleaning services for food processing companies employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country, the U.S. Department of Labor said Friday as it announced over $1.5 million in civil penalties.

            The investigation into Packers Sanitation Services Inc., or PSSI, began last summer. Department officials searched three meatpacking plants owned by JBS USA and Turkey Valley Farms in Nebraska and Minnesota, and found 31 underage workers as young as 13. They also searched PSSI's headquarters in Kieler, Wisconsin. Underage workers were found at plants in eight states.

            The department went on to review records for 55 locations where PSSI provided cleaning services and found even more violations, involving children ages 13 to 17. The agency obtained a temporary restraining order in November and a permanent injunction in December, when PSSI entered into a consent judgment that committed the company to no longer employ minors illegally.











            Over the past three years, children were found to be using caustic cleaning chemicals and cleaning “dangerous power-driven equipment, like skull-splitters and razor-sharp bone saws,"" Jessica Looman, principal deputy administrator of the department’s Wage and Hour Division, told reporters.

            At least three of those minors, including a 13-year-old, suffered burns from the chemicals used for cleaning at the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, officials said.

            Some of the children worked overnight shifts and were also enrolled in schools during the day, department spokeswoman Rhonda Burke said in an email. 

            The fine PSSI paid on Thursday, $15,138 for each minor, is the maximum allowed under federal law. But investigators believe the company actually employed many more than the 102 children they verified. Under the consent judgment, Looman said, PSSI must identify and remove them from dangerous work.

            “Make no mistake, this is no clerical error, or actions of rogue individuals or bad managers,"" Looman said. ""These findings represent a systemic failure across PSSI's entire organization to ensure that children were not working in violation of the law. PSSI's systems in many cases flagged that these children were too young to work, and yet they were still employed at these facilities.""

            The company's vice president of marketing, Gina Swenson, said in a statement Friday that the company has ""a zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under the age of 18.” 

            As soon as PSSI became aware of the allegations, she said, it conducted audits and hired an outside law firm to help strengthen its policies. PSSI has also conducted additional training for hiring managers, including on spotting identity theft, she said.

            None of the minors identified by federal investigators still work for PSSI, and the Department of Labor “has also not identified any managers aware of improper conduct that are currently employed"" by the company, Swenson added.

            PSSI has said it employs about 17,000 people working at more than 700 locations nationwide, making it one of the largest food-processing-plant cleaning companies.

            The 13 plants where violations were found were in Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas. The ones with the most violations were the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, where PSSI employed 27 minors; the Cargill plant in Dodge City, Kansas, where 26 children worked; and a JBS plant in Worthington, Minnesota, where 22 minors worked. The Labor Department also searched a Tyson facility in Sedalia, Missouri, but found no verifiable violations there.

            The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents meatpacking plant workers, called PSSI “one of the worst actors” in the industry.

            “Paying a simple fine is not enough, their entire business model relies on the exploitation of workers, vicious union-busting tactics, and the violation of human rights,” Marc Perrone, the union's international president, said in a statement. He called on the meatpacking industry to use its power over contractors like PSSI to end the exploitation of children for good.

            Asked about the immigration status of the children, Labor Department solicitor Seema Nanda said the department focuses only on whether they are minors.

            And because the department is a civil law enforcement agency, officials can't comment on whether any of the plants might face criminal charges or whether any of the children were victims of labor trafficking, said Michael Lazzeri, regional administrator of the department's Wage and Hour Division. He said any detected trafficking is referred to other agencies.

            Looman said the Wage and Hour Division has seen around a 50% increase in child labor violations since 2018, including minors working more hours than permitted in otherwise legal jobs, using types of equipment they shouldn’t while doing legal jobs, and children working where they should never be employed in the first place.

            “Nobody under 18 should be working in a meat processing plant,” she said.MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — One of the country's largest cleaning services for food processing companies employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country, the U.S. Department of Labor said Friday as it announced over $1.5 million in civil penalties.The investigation into Packers Sanitation Services Inc., or PSSI, began last summer.

He said any detected trafficking is referred to other agencies.Looman said the Wage and Hour Division has seen around a 50% increase in child labor violations since 2018, including minors working more hours than permitted in otherwise legal jobs, using types of equipment they shouldn’t while doing legal jobs, and children working where they should never be employed in the first place.“Nobody under 18 should be working in a meat processing plant,” she said.",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813909,EPA moves to restore rule on mercury from power plants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday reaffirmed the basis for a rule that requires “significant reductions” in mercury and other harmful pollutants from power plants, reversing a move late in former President Donald Trump's administration to roll back emissions standards. 

            The EPA said it found it “appropriate and necessary” to regulate emissions of toxic air pollution under the Clean Air Act, setting the stage to restore protections enacted when President Barack Obama's EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

            “For years, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards have protected the health of American communities nationwide, especially children, low-income communities, and communities of color who often and unjustly live near power plants,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. “This finding ensures the continuation of these critical, life-saving protections while advancing President Biden’s commitment to making science-based decisions and protecting the health and wellbeing of all people and all communities.”











            The move is in line with a larger push by the EPA under President Joe Biden to restore the numerous federal environmental protections that were rolled back by Trump's administration, like reinstating rigorous environmental reviews for large infrastructure projects, protecting thousands of waterways and preserving endangered species.

            Coal-fired power plants are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants, which enter the food chain through fish and other items that people consume. Mercury can affect the nervous system and kidneys; the World Health Organization says fetuses are especially vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb.

            “The concern largely is the brain development of young children ... and also (it) has effects on adults that contributes to heart attacks. It’s a highly toxic substance,” Charles T. Driscoll, an environmental scientist at Syracuse University who studies mercury pollution, said.

            Public health professionals and environmentalists praised the restoration of the Obama-era rule, saying it protects Americans, especially children, from some of the most dangerous forms of air pollution. But many also said the administration could go further by requiring even greater reductions in toxic air pollution from power plants.

            “Retaining these protections is a critical first step; we now urge EPA to strengthen them. We need stronger standards to protect all communities from these pollutants, especially those living near power plants,"" said Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

            Michael Panfil, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, also urged the Biden administration to strengthen the protections, but said the restoration of the rule “should be a relief to all Americans.”

            Most coal-fired power plants have already made upgrades to their facilities required when the regulation first went into effect in 2012. The Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying group that represents investor-owned electric companies, thanked the EPA for restoring the rule.

            “EEI’s member companies, and the electric power industry collectively, have invested more than $18 billion to install pollution control technologies to meet these standards,” Tom Kuhn, president of the lobbying firm, said in a statement. “Since 2010, our industry has reduced its mercury emissions by more than 91 percent, and we have seen a significant change in our nation’s energy mix, which is getting cleaner and cleaner every day.”

            Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the announcement resolves whether the EPA should regulate mercury and other toxic air pollution.

            “When the previous administration chose to remove the legal underpinnings of the MATS rule, they ignored the irrefutable science on the devastating impacts that mercury has on children’s health,” Carper said.

            But Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the committee's ranking Republican, warned the rule is part of Biden's goal “to shut down American coal plants.”

            “We’ve experienced the damage these regulations have done across our country, including in West Virginia,"" Capito said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813910,Former Theranos exec seeks to avoid lengthy prison sentence,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Former Theranos executive Ramesh “Sunny"" Balwani returned to federal court Friday in a last-ditch attempt to stay out of prison while appealing a jury's verdict convicting him of orchestrating a blood-testing hoax with his former boss and lover, Elizabeth Holmes.

            Besides overseeing arguments about Balwani's attempt to delay the start of his nearly 13-year prison sentence, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila also heard a vigorous debate about how much money Balwani should pay investors and patients duped by the Theranos blood tests that never worked as promised. The deceit resulted in Balwani's conviction on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy.

            Davila didn't issue any rulings at the end of the 90-minute hearing. His decision on whether Balwani can remain free on bail while he appeals his conviction, however, is likely to come soon. That's because Balwani, 57, is scheduled to report to prison in Lompoc, California, on March 15.











            The judge said he doesn't expect to decide on the question of how much Balwani should pay in restitution until another hearing on the same issues is held for Holmes, Theranos' disgraced CEO, on March 17. 

            Holmes, 38, also is seeking to remain free on bail while she appeals her conviction on four counts of fraud and conspiracy. She is scheduled to report to a prison in Bryon, Texas, on April 27 to begin a sentence of more than 11 years.

            In Friday's hearing, one of Balwani's lawyers sought to deflect the blame for Theranos' eventual collapse to Holmes. In her presentation, Amy Walsh asserted Theranos still had $350 million in cash and intellectual property worth about $100 million in May 2016 when Holmes fired Balwani as the company's chief operating officer and ended their romantic relationship.

            “When he walked out the door, the company was extremely valuable,"" Walsh said in Balwani's defense.

            Davila seemed skeptical of that rationale, asking Walsh: “Are you saying his conduct was completely divorced from Theranos' demise?""

            Federal prosecutors are seeking a court order that would saddle Balwani with a restitution bill of nearly $900 million — a figure that would likely be largely symbolic. It would also be far larger that than the $120 million loss estimate that Davila used in calculating Balwani's prison sentence.

            Prosecutor Robert Leach openly scoffed at Walsh's contention that Balwani should owe nothing, calling it a “remarkable position.""

            The two sides also painted radically different pictures in their arguments about whether Balwani should be allowed to remain free during his appeal.

            Balwani attorney Mark Davies alleged that government misconduct in the presentation of evidence during Balwani's trial makes it likely he will prevail in the appeal of his convictions. But federal prosecutor Kelly Volkar repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

            Davies also stressed Balwani's compliance with all bail requirements since he was indicted in 2018 as evidence that he isn't a flight risk. The lawyer also pointed to Balwani's non-violent history and past charity work in India as evidence he poses no danger to the community.

            Volkar suggested Balwani may have more incentive to flee with his lengthy prison sentence now less than a month away and argued he remains a potential menace. 

            “Damage can come in the form of economic harms as much as it can come in the form of violent harm,"" Volkar said.SAN JOSE, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813911,Louisiana officer freed on $25K bond after fatal shooting,"SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) — A white Louisiana police officer is free on $25,000 bond following his arrest for fatally shooting an unarmed Black man who was trying to flee police responding to a domestic disturbance call earlier this month, authorities said Friday.

            After reviewing evidence and footage from officers’ body cameras, state troopers charged Shreveport Police Officer Alexander Tyler, 23, with negligent homicide in the death of Alonzo Bagley, 43. Louisiana State Police released body camera footage Thursday of the fatal Feb. 3 encounter, as well as audio from the 911 recording reporting the initial disturbance. 

            “We are disappointed that Louisiana State Police brought charges against Officer Tyler,” his attorney, Dhu Thompson, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press. 











            Thompson said they are prepared to defend the case in court. 

            “As the evidence has shown, Officer Tyler was placed with an unfortunate split-second decision in a highly charged atmosphere,"" Thompson said. “We feel that the initial evidence shown at Thursday's bond hearing supports his position in this case.""

            Thompson told KSLA-TV it's now up to the Caddo Parish District Attorney's office to decide whether to present charges to a grand jury. 

            “We're hopeful that a thorough review of the evidence will show that Officer Tyler didn't do anything wrong,” he said.

            Thompson said he'd seen the camera footage and some of the press conferences since the shooting.

            “I'm saddened to see some of the irresponsible narratives that's been put out through social media and other means,” he said. “Whenever this occurs a lot of incorrect information gets put into the public arena which inflames emotions and compounds the tragedy. We've urged the public and the media to let the process play out here. Let the case be judged by the facts and evidence and not be influenced by other cases because each case should stand on its own circumstances."" 

            Thompson said Tyler is obviously “upset” and “shook” from the incident. 

            “It's an unfortunate situation for all involved,” Thompson said.

            Family members of Bagley have filed a $10 million lawsuit against Tyler, who's been on the force for about two years. 

            “The lethal force used against Mr. Bagley was unjustified, unreasonable, excessive, and in violation of Mr. Bagley’s rights under the United States Constitution and the laws of the State of Louisiana,” according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Bagley’s wife, mother and stepdaughter. 

            The family has hired Louisiana attorney Ronald Haley, who has represented other high-profile clients including the family of Ronald Greene, a Black motorist whose 2019 death in state police custody in north Louisiana prompted lawsuits and criminal charges against law enforcement officers.

            Thompson said he was not currently involved with the civil lawsuit. 

            Arraignment is set for April 3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813912,"Wrongfully convicted man, now free: ‘I was finally heard’","ST. LOUIS (AP) — As he languished in a Missouri prison for nearly three decades, Lamar Johnson never stopped fighting to prove his innocence, even when it meant doing much of the legal work himself.

            This week a St. Louis judge overturned Johnson’s murder conviction and ordered him freed. Johnson closed his eyes and shook his head, overcome with emotion. Shouts of joy rang out from the packed courtroom, and several people — relatives, civil rights activists and others — stood to cheer. Johnson’s lawyers hugged each other and him.

            “I can’t say I knew it would happen, but I would never give up fighting for what I knew to be the right thing, that freedom was wrongfully taken from me,” Johnson said.











            Thanks to a team of lawyers, a Missouri law that changed largely because of his case, and his own dogged determination, he can start to put his life back together. “It’s persistence,” the 49-year-old said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press. 

            “You have to distinguish yourself. I think the best way to get (the court's) attention, or anyone’s attention, is to do much of the work yourself,"" Johnson said. “That means making discovery requests from law enforcement agencies and the courts, and that’s what I did. I wrote everybody.”

            He said that he was able to contact people ""who were willing to come forward and tell the truth.”

            Johnson was just 20 in 1994 when his friend, Marcus Boyd, was shot to death on Boyd's front porch by two masked men. Police and prosecutors arrested Johnson days later, blaming the killing on a dispute over drug money; both men were drug dealers.

            From the outset, Johnson said he was innocent. His girlfriend backed his alibi that they were together when the killings occurred. The case against him was built largely on the account of an eyewitness who picked Johnson out of a police lineup, and a jailhouse informant who told a police detective that he overheard Johnson discussing the crime.

            Decades of studies show that eyewitness testimony is right only about half the time — and since Johnson's conviction, across the country there has been a reexamination of eyewitness identification procedures, which have been shown to often reproduce racial biases.

            At a December hearing on Johnson's innocence claim, eyewitness James Gregory Elking testified that the detective had “bullied” him into naming Johnson as a shooter, allegedly telling Elking, “I know you know who it is,” and urging him to “help get these guys off the street.”

            St. Louis Circuit Judge David Mason also heard testimony calling into question the informant's integrity. Even more, an inmate at South Central Correctional Center in Licking, Missouri — James Howard — came forward to tell the judge that he and another man were the shooters — and that Johnson wasn't involved. Howard is currently serving a life term for an unrelated murder.

            After two months of review, Mason announced his ruling Tuesday.

            ""It felt like a weight had been lifted off me,"" Johnson said. “I think that came out in how emotional I got afterward. I was finally heard.”

            It was a moment that he wasn't sure would ever come.

            A connection to another wrongfully convicted man also played a pivotal role in Johnson's eventual freedom.

            
                Ricky Kidd was convicted of killing two men in Kansas City in 1996. He was sent to the Potosi Correctional Center, where he and Johnson became friends. One day, in the prison yard, Johnson turned to Kidd.

            ""He said, ‘You might not believe me, but I’m innocent,'"" Kidd recalled. ""I said, ‘Oh yeah? You might not believe me but I’m innocent, too!’”

            The two became cellmates. Eventually, the Midwest Innocence Project agreed to take on Kidd's case. Meanwhile, Johnson's effort was going nowhere. Kidd recalled a night when he was awakened by Johnson’s quiet sobs and the sound of his feet pacing the floor.

            “He said, ‘Man, I don’t think I’m going to make it out. I keep getting these doors shut,'"" Kidd said. ""I said, ‘You got to hang in there.’”

            Johnson tried to stay busy. That included working in the prison hospice unit. It gave him a new perspective.

            “Growing up where I grew up, death, shootings, all those kinds of things are kind of normal,"" he said. Working in hospice, ""You develop a greater appreciation of life, as you see someone go through that death process.”

            Meanwhile, Kidd talked to an investigator with the Innocence Project and made the case that since Johnson had already done so much background work himself that the process would have a head start. The organization took on his case.

            Lindsay Runnels, a Kansas City attorney who partners with the Innocence Project, said Johnson’s work was vital. For example, she said his Freedom of Information Act requests uncovered the extensive criminal background of the jailhouse informant, which called into question the man’s integrity.

            “He just did all of that groundwork on his own from his jail cell, with nothing but paper and stamp,” Runnels said.

            St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner believed Johnson was innocent. But her efforts to help him were blocked when the Missouri Supreme Court, in March 2021, ruled that Gardner lacked the authority to seek a new trial 28 years after the conviction.

            Missouri lawmakers, disturbed that an innocent person could remain in prison on the technicality that too much time had passed since his conviction, passed a law enacted in August 2021 that allows prosecutors to request a hearing before a judge in cases of potential wrongful conviction. That law freed another longtime inmate, Kevin Strickland, in 2021. He had served more than 40 years for a Kansas City triple-killing.

            Some states, including California and Hawaii, are also wrestling with how to handle wrongful convictions cases. In California, Attorney General Rob Bonta is setting up a commission to review criminal cases for possible wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project's website says that across the U.S., it has helped free or exonerate more than 240 people, 58% of whom are Black.

            The vast majority of their clients were exonerated by DNA evidence.

            Now, Kidd is a public speaker who also works with prosecutors to help them avoid convicting innocent people. He hopes Johnson will join him in his effort. What Johnson chooses to do next as a free man is unclear. 

            “I think we can move the needle, prevent wrongful convictions in the first place and help extricate more individuals on the back end,"" Kidd said.

            Johnson said he's thankful to be free, even if he's unsure what the future holds.

            “It’s exciting and a little intimidating,"" he said. ""I have to go out there and learn, and survive, and get my life back in order.”

Howard is currently serving a life term for an unrelated murder.After two months of review, Mason announced his ruling Tuesday.""It felt like a weight had been lifted off me,"" Johnson said. “I think that came out in how emotional I got afterward. I was finally heard.”It was a moment that he wasn't sure would ever come.A connection to another wrongfully convicted man also played a pivotal role in Johnson's eventual freedom.Ricky Kidd was convicted of killing two men in Kansas City in 1996. He was sent to the Potosi Correctional Center, where he and Johnson became friends. One day, in the prison yard, Johnson turned to Kidd.""He said, ‘You might not believe me, but I’m innocent,'"" Kidd recalled. ""I said, ‘Oh yeah? You might not believe me but I’m innocent, too!’”The two became cellmates. Eventually, the Midwest Innocence Project agreed to take on Kidd's case. Meanwhile, Johnson's effort was going nowhere. Kidd recalled a night when he was awakened by Johnson’s quiet sobs and the sound of his feet pacing the floor.“He said, ‘Man, I don’t think I’m going to make it out. I keep getting these doors shut,'"" Kidd said. ""I said, ‘You got to hang in there.’”Johnson tried to stay busy. That included working in the prison hospice unit. It gave him a new perspective.“Growing up where I grew up, death, shootings, all those kinds of things are kind of normal,"" he said. Working in hospice, ""You develop a greater appreciation of life, as you see someone go through that death process.”Meanwhile, Kidd talked to an investigator with the Innocence Project and made the case that since Johnson had already done so much background work himself that the process would have a head start. The organization took on his case.Lindsay Runnels, a Kansas City attorney who partners with the Innocence Project, said Johnson’s work was vital. For example, she said his Freedom of Information Act requests uncovered the extensive criminal background of the jailhouse informant, which called into question the man’s integrity.“He just did all of that groundwork on his own from his jail cell, with nothing but paper and stamp,” Runnels said.St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner believed Johnson was innocent. But her efforts to help him were blocked when the Missouri Supreme Court, in March 2021, ruled that Gardner lacked the authority to seek a new trial 28 years after the conviction.Missouri lawmakers, disturbed that an innocent person could remain in prison on the technicality that too much time had passed since his conviction, passed a law enacted in August 2021 that allows prosecutors to request a hearing before a judge in cases of potential wrongful conviction. That law freed another longtime inmate, Kevin Strickland, in 2021. He had served more than 40 years for a Kansas City triple-killing.Some states, including California and Hawaii, are also wrestling with how to handle wrongful convictions cases. In California, Attorney General Rob Bonta is setting up a commission to review criminal cases for possible wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project's website says that across the U.S., it has helped free or exonerate more than 240 people, 58% of whom are Black.The vast majority of their clients were exonerated by DNA evidence.Now, Kidd is a public speaker who also works with prosecutors to help them avoid convicting innocent people. He hopes Johnson will join him in his effort. What Johnson chooses to do next as a free man is unclear.“I think we can move the needle, prevent wrongful convictions in the first place and help extricate more individuals on the back end,"" Kidd said.Johnson said he's thankful to be free, even if he's unsure what the future holds.“It’s exciting and a little intimidating,"" he said. ""I have to go out there and learn, and survive, and get my life back in order.”_________A headline on an earlier version of this story has been corrected to show that Johnson was imprisoned for 28 years, not 30.",2023/02/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813919,White Sox CF Luis Robert Jr. still looking for healthy year,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — In the aftermath of another lost season, another year derailed by injuries, Luis Robert Jr. changed his offseason routine.

            He spent more time on a field for running, hitting and defensive work. It's all in an effort to smooth his transition into a big year for the dynamic center fielder and the Chicago White Sox.

            “In the past I just went to the gym, hit in the cage and, just a couple days, actually went to a field,” Robert said Friday through a translator, “and then when I got here at spring training, things were slow or different.











            ""I wanted to change things this year. That is why I made the decision to spend more time on the field.”

            Robert's health is one of the biggest keys for Chicago as it tries to rebound from a disappointing 2022 season. The White Sox went 81-81 and missed the playoffs after beginning the year with World Series aspirations.

            The 25-year-old Robert played in just 98 games last season, hitting .284 with 12 homers, 56 RBIs and 11 steals. He had trouble with blurred vision and lightheadedness because of a virus that led to vitamin deficiencies. He was sidelined by a right groin strain and left wrist and hand injuries.

            He also missed three months in 2021 with a torn hip flexor.

            “Due to the injuries, I couldn’t play as many games as I wanted to,"" Robert said, looking back on last season. ""Unfortunately, that has been the case the last couple years. But I think in the time I spent on the field, I had good results, had good stats. The team, too many ups and downs. We never figured out how to be consistent. But I think this year is going to be a better year for us.”

            When Robert is healthy, he is one of Chicago's most gifted players. After he returned from his hip injury in 2021, he batted .350 with 12 homers and 35 RBIs in his last 43 games of the regular season. Then he hit .467 (7 for 15) during the team’s division series loss to Houston.

            Robert broke into the majors during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, hitting 11 homers and winning a Gold Glove. He batted .316 with 39 RBIs during one 54-game stretch last year.

            “This guy has an opportunity to win an MVP in my opinion,” first-year manager Pedro Grifol said. “If he puts it all together, it's special. We've all seen the power. We've seen the speed. We've seen the way he runs out there in center field and how he plays defense and steals bases. So definitely nothing he can't do on a baseball field. We just have to keep him out there for 162 (games).""

            It's a different Robert this year in a variety of ways. He is going by Luis Robert Jr. now after a discussion with his father. It's his first major league camp without José Abreu, who signed with Houston in free agency. He also is preparing to play for Cuba in the World Baseball Classic.

            Abreu had been a mentor for Robert and several other players with the White Sox. Robert said it's going to be weird not having Abreu around, but he still remembers everything he learned from the big first baseman.

            “He always told me to work every day, to work hard. Even if the results aren’t there, just keep working,"" Robert said. ""That’s the only way that you can get the results that you are expecting.”

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — In the aftermath of another lost season, another year derailed by injuries, Luis Robert Jr. changed his offseason routine.He spent more time on a field for running, hitting and defensive work. It's all in an effort to smooth his transition into a big year for the dynamic center fielder and the Chicago White Sox.“In the past I just went to the gym, hit in the cage and, just a couple days, actually went to a field,” Robert said Friday through a translator, “and then when I got here at spring training, things were slow or different.""I wanted to change things this year. That is why I made the decision to spend more time on the field.”Robert's health is one of the biggest keys for Chicago as it tries to rebound from a disappointing 2022 season. The White Sox went 81-81 and missed the playoffs after beginning the year with World Series aspirations.The 25-year-old Robert played in just 98 games last season, hitting .284 with 12 homers, 56 RBIs and 11 steals. He had trouble with blurred vision and lightheadedness because of a virus that led to vitamin deficiencies. He was sidelined by a right groin strain and left wrist and hand injuries.He also missed three months in 2021 with a torn hip flexor.“Due to the injuries, I couldn’t play as many games as I wanted to,"" Robert said, looking back on last season. ""Unfortunately, that has been the case the last couple years. But I think in the time I spent on the field, I had good results, had good stats. The team, too many ups and downs. We never figured out how to be consistent. But I think this year is going to be a better year for us.”When Robert is healthy, he is one of Chicago's most gifted players. After he returned from his hip injury in 2021, he batted .350 with 12 homers and 35 RBIs in his last 43 games of the regular season. Then he hit .467 (7 for 15) during the team’s division series loss to Houston.Robert broke into the majors during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, hitting 11 homers and winning a Gold Glove. He batted .316 with 39 RBIs during one 54-game stretch last year.“This guy has an opportunity to win an MVP in my opinion,” first-year manager Pedro Grifol said. “If he puts it all together, it's special. We've all seen the power. We've seen the speed. We've seen the way he runs out there in center field and how he plays defense and steals bases. So definitely nothing he can't do on a baseball field. We just have to keep him out there for 162 (games).""It's a different Robert this year in a variety of ways. He is going by Luis Robert Jr. now after a discussion with his father. It's his first major league camp without José Abreu, who signed with Houston in free agency. He also is preparing to play for Cuba in the World Baseball Classic.Abreu had been a mentor for Robert and several other players with the White Sox. Robert said it's going to be weird not having Abreu around, but he still remembers everything he learned from the big first baseman.“He always told me to work every day, to work hard. Even if the results aren’t there, just keep working,"" Robert said. ""That’s the only way that you can get the results that you are expecting.”Robert will have at least one familiar teammate when he joins Cuba for the WBC. White Sox third baseman Yoán Moncada also plans to play.“I was pretty close to going to the World Baseball Classic last time. That was the year that I made the decision to come here,” Robert said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813920,Patriots captain Matt Slater returning for 16th NFL season,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — After the New England Patriots' season came to an end last month, Matt Slater said he'd given everything he had during his 15 years in the NFL. 

            But for now, retirement can wait.

            The Patriots announced Friday that the 37-year-old and two-time All-Pro has decided to return for his 16th season in 2023.











            “I thank God for His continued grace and provision over my career,"" Slater said in a statement. “I look forward to continuing to play under the leadership of coach (Bill) Belichick. Thank you to the Kraft family and the entire Patriots organization for allowing me to continue to pursue my childhood dream.”

            A fifth-round draft pick by New England in 2008 and son of Hall of Famer Jackie Slater, he has grown into a locker room leader and embodiment of Belichick's “Patriot Way” culture. Along the way Slater has been voted as the special team captain 12 times while winning three Super Bowl rings.

            “Matt’s incredible career is a testament to his preparation and will to succeed,” Belichick said. “We are thrilled he will be playing this season.”

            The longest-tenured player on the 2022 roster, he has appeared in 222 games and is second only to Tom Brady in games played for the Patriots. He hasn’t missed a game over the past five seasons.

            Last season Slater finished with 13 special teams tackles. His 11 seasons with double-digit special teams tackles is the most in the NFL since 2000.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813921,West Indies and New Zealand get 1st wins at T20 World Cup,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — West Indies ended a 15-match losing run in Twenty20 internationals when captain Hayley Matthews launched a four over backward point to clinch a thriller against Ireland with one ball to spare at the Women's World Cup on Friday.

            Matthews went to 66 not out with the match-winning boundary and batted all the way through after opening. West Indies finished on 140-4 to chase down Ireland's 137-9 and win by six wickets.

            The West Indies earned its first points of the World Cup in its third game, as did New Zealand, which beat Bangladesh comfortably by 71 runs earlier Friday.











            Another opener played the match-winning role for New Zealand when Suzie Bates hit 81 not out, although she had good support from Bernadine Bezuidenhout (44) and Maddy Green (44 not out).

            New Zealand's 189-3 was way too good for Bangladesh, which only managed 118-8 in reply.

            The victories gave New Zealand and West Indies outside chances of still making the semifinals. New Zealand is fourth in Group 1 and needs to beat Sri Lanka in its last game and hope other results go its way to make the top two in the group and the semis.

            West Indies needs to beat Pakistan and also get some help from others to qualify from Group 2.

            Even with Matthews going well, West Indies still needed a testing 17 from the last two overs to beat Ireland.

            Shabika Gajnabi helped by hitting fours off the second and third balls she faced and even though she was run out in the last over, West Indies scrambled enough singles to set up Matthews to apply the finishing touch.

            Matthews' anger at Gajnabi's run out turned to joy two balls later as she carved a wide delivery from Laura Delany over the in-field for a long-awaited victory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813922,Tiger Woods goes viral for all the wrong reasons at Riviera,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods had some explaining to do Friday, about a putter so cold he nearly missed the cut at Riviera, and about a chauvinist prank he played on Justin Thomas in the Genesis Invitational.

            In his return to elite competition for the first time in seven months, Woods caused quite a buzz in the opening round for all the wrong reasons.

            It started when he ripped a 323-yard drive, some 10 yards longer than the 29-year-old Thomas. Walking off the tee, Woods discreetly put something in Thomas' hand, which Thomas tossed to the ground when he realized what it was — a tampon, to remind him that Woods hit it farther. Woods laughed and put his arm around Thomas.











            Social media came to life when the moment was posted. On Friday, one fan shouted, “Tampon!” at Woods after he made a rare putt.

            Woods apologized after his bogey-bogey finish for a 74 in the second round, which left him over the projected cut line. By the end of the day, he moved up enough spots that he was certain to be around for the weekend. He was 11 shots behind Max Homa.

            “It was supposed to be all fun and games and obviously it hasn’t turned out that way,"" Woods said. ""If I offended anybody in any way, shape or form, I’m sorry. It was not intended to be that way. It was just we play pranks on one another all the time and virally I think this did not come across that way.""

            Outside of swearing following bad shots, Woods rarely brings this kind of attention to himself inside the ropes.

            The golf wasn't much better, either.

            He missed birdie chances early and par chances late, and the finish was a polar opposite from his opening round when he closed with three straight birdies for a 69.

            Woods came within inches of an ace on the par-3 14th, his fifth hole of the round, but he missed a 5-foot birdie chance two holes later.

            “I did not putt well today,” Woods said. “I blocked a lot of putts early, and this is probably the highest score I could have shot today. Probably should have shot probably five or six better than this easily. Just didn’t make the putts early and the middle part of the round when I had those opportunities. And they weren’t very hard putts.”

            He still was 2 under for the tournament, even for his round, when he came up short of his target on the par-3 sixth hole, the famous green with a bunker in the middle. The ball rolled down the edge to the front of the green, and the pin was cut to the top left.

            Arms crossed and a lob wedge in his hands, he studied multiple options. He could have pitched it to the back of the green and up the slope and let it run back toward the hole.

            “If I chipped it up on top, there’s a chance that it could actually come back to the front part of the green,” Woods said, adding that's what happened when he tried it Wednesday during the pro-am.

            He changed to the putter to rip up the slope, left of the pin to leave himself about 10 feet away for a chance at par. One problem.

            “The hill caught it more than I thought it would,” he said.

            It took speed off the ball and it turned right, down the edge of the bunker and into the sand. He blasted out to 5 feet and made a fast putt with enough break that he had to start it outside the cup.

            That was the start of a bad finish. On the eighth, his tee shot found a bunker and he caught it heavy, hit his third over the green and did well to putt from the first cut of turf to tap-in range for bogey.

            On his final hole at No. 9, he came up short and plugged into the bunker. All he could do with a front pin was blasted out through the green, and his par putt caught the lip. Another bogey left him at 1-over 143, outside the top 65 when he signed his card.

            “I had two bad calls on the wind on 6 and 9 and end up costing me two shots there,” Woods said.

            The tournament host is playing for the first time since 2020 because of injuries to his right leg from a car crash a year later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813926,$1.17M settlement approved in Alton Sterling protest lawsuit,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The city of Baton Rouge will pay a $1.17 million settlement to 14 people who accused local law enforcement of using excessive force and violating their First Amendment rights at a protest over Alton Sterling’s death in 2016. 

            The city's Metro Council approved the settlement in a 7-4 decision Wednesday, five-and-a-half years after the protest in which the plaintiffs say they were wrongly arrested. 

            “This settlement should send a message to all law enforcement agencies,” William Most, attorney for the plaintiffs, told WAFB-TV Thursday. “If you won’t hold your officers accountable, we will.”











            The 2017 lawsuit states the 14 plaintiffs — two of whom were identified as journalists — attended the July 10, 2016, protest in downtown Baton Rouge when they were arrested for allegedly obstructing a highway or public passageway. 

            Widespread protests occurred following the fatal shooting of Sterling, a 37-year-old Black man, who was shot six times by a white Baton Rouge police officer outside a convenience store. The deadly interaction was caught on cellphone video. The officer was never charged.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813927,Matarazzo's Hoffenheim loses again after late Augsburg goal,"AUGSBURG, Germany (AP) — Fredrik Jensen scored late for Augsburg to beat Hoffenheim 1-0 in the Bundesliga on Friday and deal American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo his second defeat in two games since taking over.

            Augsburg captain Jeffrey Gouweleeuw headed on a corner that Jensen converted at the far post in the 88th minute to lift the home team five points clear of Hoffenheim.

            Hoffenheim, which hasn’t won a game since October, is just two points above the relegation zone before the rest of the 21st round is played. Hoffenheim has six defeats and one draw from seven games in 2023.











            The New Jersey-born Matarazzo was hired by Hoffenheim last week to replace the fired André Breitenreiter but the team lost 3-1 to Bayer Leverkusen on his debut.

            Augsburg forward Ermedin Demirovic thought he’d scored after the break when his shot crashed off the crossbar and back off his left boot into the goal.

            But the goal was ruled out through VAR because Kelvin Yeboah unintentionally struck Kevin Vogt in the face beforehand. The Hoffenheim defender went down holding his nose and looked shaken as he walked off the field for treatment. Hoffenheim’s medical staff decided he was not fit to continue, much to Vogt’s own annoyance.

            Hoffenheim substitute Andrej Kramaric had the visitors’ best chance late only to be thwarted by a fine save from Rafal Gikiewicz.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813939,Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate worked for Republicans,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — One of the two conservative candidates for an open Wisconsin Supreme Court seat was paid by state and national Republicans to advise on election issues, including the plan to have fake GOP electors cast ballots for Donald Trump even though he lost the state.

            Dan Kelly is a former state Supreme Court Justice who is one of four candidates in Tuesday's primary. The top two vote-getters will advance to the April 4 general election, with the winner determining whether the court remains 4-3 majority conservative or flips to liberal control.

            Kelly was a justice on the court from 2016 to 2020. He was endorsed by Trump during his unsuccessful run for the court in 2020. 











            After Kelly left the court in August 2020, he went on to be paid nearly $120,000 by the Wisconsin Republican Party and the Republican National Committee to work on election issues, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported Friday.

            Kelly's work for the state GOP was revealed in testimony that former party Chairman Andrew Hitt gave the U.S. House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol.

            Hitt, according to his testimony that was released by the committee last month, said that Kelly was working as a “special counsel” and had “pretty extensive conservations” about the fake Republican electors. Hitt testified that he brought in Kelly to “kind of advise on election law matters.”

            The Republican fake electors met in the Wisconsin Capitol building on the same day that Democrats cast the state's 10 electoral votes for Biden. Hitt and others who cast ballots for Trump said they were doing so in case courts overturned Biden's win and gave the state to Trump.

            Biden won the state by nearly 21,000 votes, and every attempt by Trump and his allies to overturn the results failed.

            Kelly's campaign spokesperson, Jim Dick, said Kelly ""took a call from RPW Chairman Hitt on the subject of Republican electors and was asked if he was in the loop about this issue and Justice Kelly stated he was not.”

            Dick said that after Kelly left the state Supreme Court in August 2020, he “provided legal counsel to several clients, amongst which were the RNC and RPW. It is a maxim in the legal profession that the views of clients are not attributable to their attorneys.”

            Kelly faces conservative Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow and two liberal candidates, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz and Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell. 

            “There’s no doubt Dan Kelly is a partisan extremist, as much as he’d like to dishonestly pretend otherwise,"" Sam Roecker, a spokesperson for Protasiewicz, said in a statement to the AP. “His continued efforts to overturn Wisconsin’s 2020 presidential election results are disqualifying.”

            Mitchell said in a statement to the AP that “I believe that just as we have a separation of church and state, we need a separation between partisanship and justice. Because when partisanship invades our court system, it leads to pre-determined outcomes, the diminishing of justice, and the destruction of equity.”

            Dorow did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

            Kelly has been critical of Protasiewicz for publicly stating her support for abortion rights and saying that Republican-drawn legislative maps were “rigged.” Mitchell has also voiced support for abortion rights and been critical of the GOP-drawn maps.

            In addition to advising the state party on the fake elector scheme in 2020, federal elections records show that the Republican National Committee paid Kelly and his firm, Daniel Kelly Consulting, $110,000 from March to December 2022 for “legal and compliance services,"" the Journal Sentinel first reported. That included a $40,000 payment he received after he announced his run for the state Supreme Court in September.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813940,Judge denies Baffert request to reverse Churchill Downs ban,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A federal judge denied Bob Baffert’s request to lift his two-year suspension by Churchill Downs Inc., ruling Friday that the Hall of Fame trainer did not prove its discipline hurt his business and reputation.

            Baffert will miss his second consecutive Kentucky Derby, and per a Churchill Downs rule, he has until Feb. 28 to transfer his Derby contenders to other trainers in order for them to possibly run in the May 6 race. Horses earn Derby qualifying points by finishing in the top five of designated races; any horse trained by Baffert after the February deadline is ineligible to earn points. 

            Baffert last year transferred Taiba and Messier to former assistant Tim Yakteen for the Derby. Taiba finished 12th and Messier was 15th among 20 horses.











            Baffert had sued Churchill Downs following his banishment in June 2021 after a failed postrace drug test by now-deceased colt Medina Spirit, who crossed the finish line first in the 147th Derby. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission ultimately disqualified the colt in February 2022 and suspended Baffert for 90 days for a series of failed tests by his horses.

            Baffert argued that Churchill Downs did not give him notice nor explain the suspension. His attorney, Clark Brewster, contended earlier this month that the historic track was subject to state guidelines for due process. U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings ultimately rejected that argument and said that, as privately owned company, Churchill Downs can set its own disciplinary policies.

            “Failing to punish trainers whose horses test positive in marquee races could harm (Churchill Downs, Inc.'s) reputation and the integrity of their races,” Jennings wrote. 

            A message left with Brewster was not immediately returned.

            Among Baffert’s top 3-year-olds this season are Arabian Knight and Cave Rock. Arabian Knight is owned by Saudi Arabian businessman Amr Zedan. Jennings wrote that an affidavit given to the court states that Zedan will move his horses to another trainer if Baffert remained banned by Churchill Downs. 

            While Baffert is banned from the first of the Triple Crown races, he's eligible to run horses in Maryland at the Preakness and in New York at the Belmont Stakes. His one-year suspension by the New York Racing Association expired in January.

            Churchill Downs had wanted the case dismissed, citing nine failed tests by Baffert-trained horses as justification for disciplining horse racing’s most visible figure. The list of violators includes 2020 Kentucky Oaks third-place finisher Gamine, who was ultimately disqualified.

            Medina Spirit failed his test for having in his system the regulated medication corticosteroid betamethasone, which Baffert and Brewster have argued came from an ointment rather than an injection. 

            Track president Mike Anderson said the decision by Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen stemmed from Baffert’s “refusal to take responsibility for repeat violations.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813942,Updated Next Gen car to get real-world test in Daytona 500,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The latest version of NASCAR’s Next Gen car is still awaiting a real-world test. It’s sure to come in the Daytona 500.

            
                Reacting to driver complaints and concussions to Kurt Busch and Alex Bowman, the sanctioning body made changes to the crumple zones in the backend of Cup Series cars in hopes of reducing the effects of rear-impact collisions.

            The revisions received mixed reviews following the Clash exhibition at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum two weeks ago — fan favorite and 2020 series champion Chase Elliott said he “didn’t think it was a ton different” — but those punishing hits came in tight turns and amid aggressive, short-track driving that involved widely varying speeds.











            Daytona’s high-banked tri-oval might provide a better evaluation, where bumping and banging — while somewhat tempered — are an integral part of superspeedway racing and often result in more violent crashes.

            “Do I think it was everything that could be done? No,” 2012 series champion Brad Keselowski said. “But I think there was significant progress. I suspect this conversation will be one that doesn’t go away for quite some time. The level of severity and the frequency we discuss it may perhaps diminish over time.”

            Keselowski said the Gen 7 car was designed to handle “worst-case survivability"" crashes often seen at Daytona, pointing to harrowing wrecks involving Austin Dillion, Ryan Newman, Kyle Larson and Kyle Busch.

            “The changes that were made have real potential to move the needle forward,"" Keselowski said. ""It’s fair to say we are not where we want to be with the medium- to low-severity impacts compared to the Gen 6 cars. Hopefully, that will be just a quick footnote, and we’ll find some ways around it.”

            NASCAR has worked tirelessly to find solutions and believes, in time, the revamped car will prove safer. 

            “Safety and competition, those are the two factors that we are always chasing and we’re going to continue to do so,"" NASCAR President Steve Phelps said.

            Busch, a two-time series champ, was the first involved in a high-speed wreck at Daytona International Speedway this year, but his No. 8 Chevrolet went nose-first into the outside wall during a qualifying race Thursday. 

            In replays, Busch’s helmet could be seen traveling what appeared to be a significant distance considering he was tethered to a head-and-neck restraint system. But he declined to provide insight into whether the crash felt any different than the ones he was part of in 2022.

            “I don’t think any wreck feels good,” Busch said. “You wanna ride with me?”

            NASCAR's completely redesigned car led to two documented concussions in 2022: Kurt Busch was forced to retire following a July crash in qualifying and Bowman missed five races after a September hit at Texas. NASCAR responded by trying to soften impacts when cars back into walls. 

            Bowman didn't think there had been much of a difference at the Clash. 

            “That’s such a unique environment the way we run into each other there and the way everybody stacks up,” he said, cautioning the comparison between the half-mile Coliseum and the 2 1/2-mile Daytona track. ""You’d like it to be better. If you took the old cars there, I don’t think half the guys who finished would have finished. It’s just different and part of adapting to this race car.” 

            Specifically, NASCAR made several bars in the rear clip smaller in diameter, thinned surrounding walls and added holes (triggers) in other bars to make them bend more upon impact. It also removed two other support bars and angled two more that allows them to bend more.

            The changes should reduce the car's rear rigidness and redirect some of the energy that was landing directly on drivers.

            “The simulation that NASCAR’s done, the crash-testing that NASCAR’s done, the engineering that NASCAR’s done is all positive and sound,” said David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development. “Like anything else, the real experience is going to be in what happens on the racetrack. 

            “We’re going to see that — good, bad or otherwise. It’s going to happen, and we’re going to continue to collect data. We’re satisfied that NASCAR continues with the mentality that there’s no such thing as a perfectly safe racecar and it’s something that all of us as an industry have to remain focused on and committed to continual improvement.”

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The latest version of NASCAR’s Next Gen car is still awaiting a real-world test. It’s sure to come in the Daytona 500.Reacting to driver complaints and concussions to Kurt Busch and Alex Bowman, the sanctioning body made changes to the crumple zones in the backend of Cup Series cars in hopes of reducing the effects of rear-impact collisions.The revisions received mixed reviews following the Clash exhibition at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum two weeks ago — fan favorite and 2020 series champion Chase Elliott said he “didn’t think it was a ton different” — but those punishing hits came in tight turns and amid aggressive, short-track driving that involved widely varying speeds.Daytona’s high-banked tri-oval might provide a better evaluation, where bumping and banging — while somewhat tempered — are an integral part of superspeedway racing and often result in more violent crashes.“Do I think it was everything that could be done?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813945,"Mets' Scherzer, Verlander together for 1st time since 2014","PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are back together for the first time in nearly a decade.

            The pair of three-time Cy Young Award winners threw off adjacent bullpen mounds Friday at the New York Mets training complex. The 38-year-old Scherzer and Verlander, who turns 40 on Monday, were teammates on the Detroit Tigers from 2010-14.

            “They’re going to make the club,” manager Buck Showalter quipped.











            Showalter hasn't announced which will start the March 30 opener at Miami.

            “What’s driving them?” Showalter said. “What keeps them chasing perfection every time they cock their arm? Because they have ‘it.’ What drives? Is it a fear of failure? I don’t know. Who cares? But they got ‘it.’”

            The manager wasn't paying close attention to the bullpen sessions.

            “I’m not a lurker who stands behind them like, ooh, ahh,” Showalter said. “I’m behind a wall, behind a bush, watch a little video of it.”

            Scherzer, an eight-time All-Star, signed with the Mets before last season for a $130 million, three-year contract. 

            After winning the AL Cy Young Award and helping the Houston Astros to their second World Series title, Verlander joined New York for a two-year deal worth $86.67 million, matching Scherzer's average salary. The nine-time All-Star fills an opening created when Jacob deGrom left for Texas.

            “He’s a winning pitcher,” said Scherzer, a World Series champion with Washington in 2019. “We’re trying to win the whole thing. You need good pitchers on your staff in order to win. He fits that bill.”

            Finishing his bullpen session first, Verlander leaned back against the bullpen fence watching Scherzer complete his work.

            Scherzer’s wife Erica gave birth on Jan. 30 to daughter Nikki, who joined daughters Brooklyn and Kacey, and son Derek. All the children are under 6.

            “Dad duty,” Scherzer said. “I’m working two jobs here right now. Baseball during the day, parenting at night.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813946,"Ohio ex-speaker ill, corruption trial pauses after big week","CINCINNATI (AP) — The racketeering trial of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges was cancelled due to illness again Friday, giving jurors a long holiday weekend to mull striking new details revealed this week by players directly involved in an alleged $60 million bribery scheme.

            It marked the third time since the largest corruption trial in state history began Jan. 23 that U.S. District Judge Timothy Black in Cincinnati has postponed proceedings. Two previous pauses involved jurors testing positive for COVID-19; on Friday, Householder himself was sick, though apparently not with the coronavirus.

            Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday, after the Presidents Day holiday. Before being slowed by illnesses, the trial was expected to last about six weeks.











            The jury must decide whether Householder, 63, and Borges, 50, are guilty of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise involving bribery and money laundering. Both have pleaded not guilty and maintain innocence. Each faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

            An indictment alleges Householder, Borges, three other people and a dark money group called Generation Now orchestrated an elaborate scheme, secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies, pass legislation containing a $1 billion bailout for two aging nuclear power plants, and then vex a ballot effort to overturn the bill with a dirty tricks campaign. The arrests happened in July 2020.

            Juan Cespedes, a former lobbyist who has pleaded guilty in the case, provided the most gripping testimony of the week, if not the entire trial. 

            It amounted to the first time Cespedes had spoken publicly since the arrests. Jeff Longstreth, a longtime Householder associate who was also arrested and charged, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify soon. The third man arrested along with Householder and Borges, long-powerful Statehouse lobbyist Neil Clark, pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in March 2021.

            “I’m here to tell the truth and be accountable for it,” Cespedes said as his testimony began. 

            He said he worked for FirstEnergy Solutions and coordinated tens of millions in donations steered to Generation Now, which he described as controlled by Householder and Longstreth. 

            Cespedes testified Monday to directing a client to give Householder, through Generation Now, a $500,000 campaign contribution in exchange for legislation bailing out two aging nuclear plants owned by his company, which the Ohio House would eventually pass under Householder's watch.

            He said that at an Oct. 10, 2018, meeting, another Columbus lobbyist, Robert Klaffky, slid a $400,000 check across to Householder while emphasizing the importance of the legislation. 

            “Our client cares very much about this issue,” Klaffky said. 

            Householder looked into the envelope containing the check, made out from FirstEnergy to Generation Now, and said, “Well yes, they do.” Klaffky told cleveland.com he does not recall saying those things. 

            The remaining $100,000 was given to Longstreth to give to Householder, Cespedes said.

            Householder's lawyers argued during opening statements that he was not part of any criminal conspiracy but was engaging in politics as usual. 

            Cespedes described the contribution as a clear pay-to-play scheme. 

            “We were trying to establish the fact that our support was specifically tied to the legislation,” Cespedes said.

            Generation Now has pleaded guilty to its role in the scheme. In a deal to avoid prosecution, Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. has admitted to using dark money groups to fund the bribery scheme and agreed to pay $230 million and other conditions.

            Cespedes testified Tuesday that he and Borges paid $15,000 off the books in 2019 to referendum operative Tyler Fehrman to try to get inside information on a campaign to repeal the nuclear bailout bill, known as House Bill 6. 

            The alleged $15,000 bribe is key to the government's case against Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party. His attorneys describe the payment as a loan to help a friend.

            Cespedes testified that it was for a spying effort on behalf of FirstEnergy Solutions, a then-subsidiary of FirstEnergy. He said he tried to keep the firm's executive chair, John Kiani, in the dark because he believed Kiani would apply pressure to go through with the bribe. After Kiani learned of the plan, that came to pass, Cespedes said. 

            “(W)hat happened to the black ops,” Kiani asked in an Aug. 31, 2019, text, a reference Cespedes testified was to the plan to get inside information. On Sept. 2, 2019, Cespedes said he told Borges that Kiani “reiterated to do whatever it takes to get this information.”

            Cespedes testified that Kiani had plans to operate the two Ohio nuclear plants for a short period, get a government bailout, then sell them in a deal that could have netted him $100 million. On cross-examination, Borges’ attorneys got Cespedes to concede that he, too, could have gotten rich off the planned sale.

            Jurors also heard hours of tapes this week of the voice of the late Clark, which were gathered by two undercover FBI agents posing as developers who had hired him as their lobbyist. 

            Clark took the pair to a dinner at the Aubergine Private Dining Club in suburban Columbus on Sept. 23, 2019, to meet Householder — and advised them to bring a $50,000 check made out to Generation Now. Republican state Rep. Jay Edwards, of Athens County in southeastern Ohio, and a House staffer also attended.

            In the recordings, Clark described himself as Householder's “proxy” and told the agents that, for getting attention, “a noticeable number is $15,000, $20,000 or $25,000.” He said “it goes into a (c)(4),” referring to Generation Now by the IRS code section — 501(c)(4) — that sets the rules for a category of tax-exempt organizations that can raise and spend unlimited amounts without disclosing their donors.

            “It’s the speaker’s (c)(4). That’s how it works,” he told them.

It was updated on February 19, 2023 to correct how witness Juan Cespedes reiterated an executive’s desire “to do whatever it takes to get this information” on a referendum effort to defendant Matt Borges. Cespedes testified that he told Borges verbally; it was not contained in a text message.CINCINNATI (AP) — The racketeering trial of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges was cancelled due to illness again Friday, giving jurors a long holiday weekend to mull striking new details revealed this week by players directly involved in an alleged $60 million bribery scheme.It marked the third time since the largest corruption trial in state history began Jan. 23 that U.S. District Judge Timothy Black in Cincinnati has postponed proceedings. Two previous pauses involved jurors testing positive for COVID-19; on Friday, Householder himself was sick, though apparently not with the coronavirus.Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday, after the Presidents Day holiday. Before being slowed by illnesses, the trial was expected to last about six weeks.The jury must decide whether Householder, 63, and Borges, 50, are guilty of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise involving bribery and money laundering. Both have pleaded not guilty and maintain innocence. Each faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.An indictment alleges Householder, Borges, three other people and a dark money group called Generation Now orchestrated an elaborate scheme, secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies, pass legislation containing a $1 billion bailout for two aging nuclear power plants, and then vex a ballot effort to overturn the bill with a dirty tricks campaign. The arrests happened in July 2020.Juan Cespedes, a former lobbyist who has pleaded guilty in the case, provided the most gripping testimony of the week, if not the entire trial.It amounted to the first time Cespedes had spoken publicly since the arrests. Jeff Longstreth, a longtime Householder associate who was also arrested and charged, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify soon. The third man arrested along with Householder and Borges, long-powerful Statehouse lobbyist Neil Clark, pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in March 2021.“I’m here to tell the truth and be accountable for it,” Cespedes said as his testimony began.He said he worked for FirstEnergy Solutions and coordinated tens of millions in donations steered to Generation Now, which he described as controlled by Householder and Longstreth.Cespedes testified Monday to directing a client to give Householder, through Generation Now, a $500,000 campaign contribution in exchange for legislation bailing out two aging nuclear plants owned by his company, which the Ohio House would eventually pass under Householder's watch.He said that at an Oct. 10, 2018, meeting, another Columbus lobbyist, Robert Klaffky, slid a $400,000 check across to Householder while emphasizing the importance of the legislation.“Our client cares very much about this issue,” Klaffky said.Householder looked into the envelope containing the check, made out from FirstEnergy to Generation Now, and said, “Well yes, they do.” Klaffky told cleveland.com he does not recall saying those things.The remaining $100,000 was given to Longstreth to give to Householder, Cespedes said.Householder's lawyers argued during opening statements that he was not part of any criminal conspiracy but was engaging in politics as usual.Cespedes described the contribution as a clear pay-to-play scheme.“We were trying to establish the fact that our support was specifically tied to the legislation,” Cespedes said.Generation Now has pleaded guilty to its role in the scheme.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813947,"Stella Stevens, star of 'The Nutty Professor,' is dead at 84","Stella Stevens, a prominent leading lady in 1960s and 70s comedies perhaps best known for playing the object of Jerry Lewis’s affection in “The Nutty Professor,” has died. She was 84.

            Stevens’ estate said she died Friday in Los Angeles after a long illness.

            Born Estelle Caro Eggleston in Yazoo City, Mississippi in 1938, she married at 16 and gave birth to her first and only child, actor/producer Andrew Stevens in 1955 when she was 17, and divorced two years later. She started acting and modeling during her time at Memphis State University and made her film debut in a minor role in the Bing Crosby musical “Say One for Me” in 1959, but she considered “Li’l Abner” her big break.











            “The head of publicity at Paramount basically made me a worldwide sex symbol,” Stevens told FilmTalk in 2017. “He had me doing a lot of layouts with photographers — indoors, outdoors, here and there — being seen in different places, going to the best restaurants, meeting with wonderful actors and directors … those were the golden years of Hollywood. It was a very exciting time.""

            Soon after, she won the New Star Golden Globe, was named Playboy’s Playmate of the Month and got a contract with Paramount Pictures, leading to film work and “Girls! Girls! Girls!” with Elvis Presley, which she only agreed to do because she was promised to a Montgomery Clift movie if she did it. It was a miserable six days of filming, she said, due to the temper of director Norman Taurog, though she said Presley was nice. The Clift picture didn’t pan out either, at least with her promised co-star. It turned into John Cassavetes’ “Too Late Blues,” with Bobby Darrin.

            “Bobby was a very fine actor, but as you can imagine, he was no Montgomery Clift,” she said.

            Next came “The Nutty Professor” as Lewis’ student, Stella Purdy, who he is infatuated with.

            “Jerry Lewis had told the bosses at Paramount he wanted to cast the most beautiful ingénue working at the studio — or something like that — and so I got the gig,” she said. “We all tried to make the characters he had created in the script special, wonderful, unique — and if you ask me, I do believe that’s why the film still holds up after all those years.”

            At Columbia Pictures, she’d appear in “The Secret of My Success,” “The Silencers,” with Dean Martin, and “Where Angels Go Trouble Follows,” as a nun opposite Rosalind Russell. Other notable roles include “Slaughter,” with Jim Brown, the Sam Peckinpah television film “The Ballad of Cable Hogue” and “The Poseidon Adventure” in which she played Linda Rogo, Ernest Borgnine’s character’s wife.

            Stevens worked steadily in television in the 1970s and 80s, appearing in the pilots for “Wonder Woman,” “Hart to Hart” and “The Love Boat” and in series like “Night Court,” “Murder She Wrote” and “Magnum, P.I.”

            In 2017, she’d say that her favorite director that she worked with was Vincente Minnelli on “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father,” from 1963. She also directed several films, the documentary “An American Heroine,” which never got distribution, and “The Ranch.” She retired in 2010.

            In an interview in 1994, Stevens said that she worried that she didn’t succeed in bringing out the best in her directors and that her ambitions changed.

            “I wanted to be like my favorite actresses: Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. I wanted to be like a burst of youth and then when I got a little crow’s feet or age, I’d be off the screen,” she said.” But I also had the plan of being a director ... I saw (Bob Hope) at 83 cracking jokes and having fun. I said then that I never wanted to quit. I want to be like this man. I want to go on forever. I want to die on a movie set.”Stella Stevens, a prominent leading lady in 1960s and 70s comedies perhaps best known for playing the object of Jerry Lewis’s affection in “The Nutty Professor,” has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813948,Illinois man pleads guilty in Planned Parenthood clinic fire,"CHICAGO (AP) — A central Illinois man has pleaded guilty to setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic last month, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday.

            Tyler W. Massengill, 32, of Chillicothe admitted to setting fire to the Peoria clinic with an explosive on Jan. 15, two days after Illinois approved expansive reproductive health care legislation aimed at protecting abortion patients and providers.

            Massengill, who pleaded guilty Thursday, is in jail awaiting sentencing scheduled for July 6 at the federal courthouse in Peoria. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to the U.S. attorney's office. 











            Security cameras caught him approaching the building with a bottle, lighting a rag on one end of it, smashing a window and putting the incendiary device inside before quickly fleeing on foot. No patients or staff were inside.

            When Massengill was arrested on Jan. 24, he told investigators that he set fire to the building because he was reminded of an abortion his ex-girlfriend had three years ago, according to the criminal complaint.

            A lawyer for Massengill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The Molotov cocktail-induced blaze caused more than $1 million in damage, according to Jennifer Welch, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Illinois. 

            ""We're extremely pleased Tyler Massengill has pleaded guilty to setting our Peoria health center on fire and that there is a quick resolution to the case,"" Welch said Friday. “However, the fact still remains that the Peoria community has been robbed of equitable access to reproductive heath care until we can rebuild.”

            Planned Parenthood of Illinois spokesperson Mary Jane Maharry said that the Peoria clinic is still closed and “won't be open for several months.”

            According to the criminal complaint, Massengill told investigators he thought that if his actions caused “a little delay” in a patient receiving services at the health center, it may have been “all worth it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813949,Lawsuit is latest evidence of bogus 'stolen election' claims,"Two years after former President Donald Trump's false claims about widespread election fraud sparked an attack on the U.S. Capitol, more evidence is piling up that those who spread the misinformation knew it was false.

            On Thursday, the voting machine company Dominion filed court papers documenting that numerous Fox News personalities knew there was no evidence to support the claims peddled by Trump's allies, but aired them anyway on the nation's most-watched cable network. The same day, a special grand jury in Atlanta concluded there was no evidence of the fraud that Trump alleged cost him Georgia during the 2020 election.

            In December, the congressional Jan. 6 committee disclosed that Trump's top advisers and even family members repeatedly warned him that the allegations he was making about fraud costing him reelection were false — only to have the president continue making those claims, anyway.











            The latest revelations are not just historical curiosities. They add to the wealth of evidence that there was no widespread fraud during the 2020 presidential election and that even some of Trump’s most prominent supporters were aware of that fact at the time.

            Trump has announced he's running for president again in 2024 and continues to repeat the lie that he lost in 2020 only because of fraud and irregularities.

            “It demonstrates a profound cynicism about the political process and the gullibility of Trump's supporters,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has followed the election falsehoods closely since 2020.

            “It's really playing with fire,"" Hasen said. “It's one thing to make extravagant and unsupported statements about someone's position on taxes or immigration.” But doing the same about the actual process of voting and counting ballots is different, he said: “Lies about elections are much more dangerous than lies about actual policy.”

            From the beginning, it was clear that Trump's assertions of widespread fraud were false.

            Trump's own attorney general told him there was no evidence of significant wrongdoing related to the election. He and his supporters filed dozens of lawsuits and lost all but one of them — a bid to reduce the time voters had to correct errors on Pennsylvania mail ballots.

            Trump claimed that fraud cost him wins in key swing states that determined the White House — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But, repeatedly, reviews of the vote tallies or Republican-controlled investigations in those states turned up no evidence that had happened.

            In Michigan, an investigation by the GOP-controlled state Senate found no widespread fraud and debunked several false claims of irregularities from Trump allies. In Nevada, the Republican secretary of state said there was no evidence of significant errors in the election. In Wisconsin, an audit from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau — which reports to the Republican-controlled Legislature — found the election there was “safe and secure.”

            In Georgia, where Trump's efforts to overturn the results is being investigated, the 2020 ballots were counted three times — each tally confirming Biden's win. That included a hand recount of the 5 million ballots cast in the presidential race.

            In Arizona, a months-long, error-riddled review of ballots in the state's largest county, Maricopa, that was run by election conspiracy theorists ended by finding that Biden had won by a slightly larger margin than official results showed. The review was not more reliable than the official tally by Republican-run Maricopa County, which has repeatedly said there were no irregularities in the 2020 election there.

            The latest revelation that people spreading Trump's false claims knew there was no evidence to support them comes from a court filing in a defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News. Dominion's machines were the targets of Trump and other conspiracy theorists' allegations in late 2020 and last year, including the contention that they had been rigged by an international cabal seeking to defeat Trump.

            In its latest filing, Dominion cites texts and emails between prominent Fox personalities who did not believe the allegations or the people closest to Trump who spread them most aggressively, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and attorney Sidney Powell.

            The Dominion filing alleges that the network was initially cautious about fraud claims, with its top anchor, Bret Baier, privately stating two days after the 2020 election “there is NO evidence of election fraud.”

            But after Powell and Giuliani began making allegations about fraud that were picked up by conservative competitors, executives and top hosts started worrying about losing viewers to the conservative network Newsmax, which repeatedly aired unrebutted allegations from Trump's side. Fox started inviting the two Trump allies on their shows and top executives pushed back on news reporters who tried to fact-check the allegations.

            “Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence of election fraud, Tucker Carlson told a producer about the attorney on Nov. 16, 2020, according to an excerpt from an exhibit that remains under seal. Two days later, according to the filing, Carlson told fellow Fox News host Laura Ingraham, “Our viewers are good people and they believe it.”

            The next day, the lawsuit notes, Carlson addressed the issue on his show less bluntly: “Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened, and precisely who did it. ... We are certainly hopeful that she will.”

            Fox, in response, filed a counterclaim against Dominion alleging it was trying to chill coverage of a political controversy and that it aired denials of the allegations from Dominion and its representatives.Two years after former President Donald Trump's false claims about widespread election fraud sparked an attack on the U.S. Capitol, more evidence is piling up that those who spread the misinformation knew it was false.On Thursday, the voting machine company Dominion filed court papers documenting that numerous Fox News personalities knew there was no evidence to support the claims peddled by Trump's allies, but aired them anyway on the nation's most-watched cable network.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813954,'NATO is determined to make sure that Ukraine wins this war',"DW: One year ago, Russian President Putin started his war against Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just ruled out giving up any of his country's territory in a potential peace deal with Russia. But what about NATO? Will the alliance support Ukraine as long as Russian troops are controlling parts of the country, including Crimea?Mircea Geoana: We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and also make sure that Ukraine wins this war. So Mr. Putin can stop this war any second. If he decides to stop the war, there will be no more war. There will be peace discussions.And I believe that Ukrainians are the ones who need to define what victory represents and what the preconditions for a political solution will be. So, we are helping Ukraine, and by helping Ukraine we help ourselves. And we are here to stay for the long run with the Ukrainians.NATO has significantly boosted its presence on its eastern flank. What will the alliance do to protect the Black Sea region (including your home country, Romania) and why is this region so important in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine?Let me give you just a small historical reminder. You remember 2008 in Georgia — it was on the Black Sea. You remember Crimea in 2014 – it is in the Black Sea. So you see how Russia is using the Black Sea military capabilities to project power all the way to Africa and the Mediterranean. So that's also the Black Sea.That's why in the strategic concept of NATO that our leaders approved in Madrid, we consider and we recognize the Black Sea as a strategic region, of strategic relevance to us. Not the only one: the Baltic Sea is important, the Adriatic Sea is important, the North Sea is important, the North Atlantic is important. But the Black Sea has a specificity with so much Russian presence, with so much pressure that they're putting on Ukraine. And also we have Ukraine and Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, who are partners of NATO's.So the Black Sea is very important. And we take specific steps. In my home country, Romania, France is leading the battle group. In the neighboring country, Bulgaria, Italy is leading the battle group. So we are paying attention and we are investing in the deterrence and defense of the Black Sea countries.The pressure on Moldova is growing, and Russian missile strikes on Ukraine are a direct threat to Moldova's security. How can NATO help the country guarantee its independence and sovereignty?Moldova is a partner of NATO. For three decades now, we've been assisting Moldova in many ways. Of course, we know that the Republic of Moldova is a neutral country by constitution and we respect that. But we see an intensification of the partnership between the Republic of Moldova and NATO. We are responding to the requests that the government and the president of Moldova are making to us, both to NATO as an organization and to individual allies.(Moldovan) President Maia Sandu is right: Being neutral doesn't mean you are weak in terms of defense. There is something interesting about the Republic of Moldova: The country is a joint partner of both NATO and the European Union. The fact that the EU has given to Ukraine, but also to Moldova, a clear path towards EU membership is, in a way, helping Moldova to resist this huge pressure from Russia. Because against the Republic of Moldova, Russia has waged its whole arsenal of hybrid war.It's not an open war like in Ukraine, but nonetheless, the pressure on Moldova is immense, as the pressure on Georgia is very high, or on Bosnia-Herzegovina. That's why we are helping even more these partners that are under big pressure from Russia.The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has been prepared ,but some member states are still delaying the ratification of the accession protocol — like Hungary. What do you think is behind this?First of all, the process of getting these two new members into NATO has been the most compressed and the most accelerated of all the other enlargements of NATO after the Cold War. So that's fast by any standard. Secondly, they're already invitees in NATO, so they take part in many, many things, including in NATO defense planning and exercising. So they are basically around the table most of the time.We are confident that the two national parliaments that are still to ratify the accession protocols of Sweden and Finland — which is the Hungarian parliament and the Turkish parliament — will do this expeditiously. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was in Ankara just a few hours back, and he again made the point to President Erdogan. We are also making the point to our Swedish future allies.So we are optimistic that even these two countries will be full members of NATO. And we are also confident that the two remaining parliaments will expedite the process of ratifying them. And then, without any other decision, the moment the two remaining allies will ratify, the instrument of membership will be presented to the State Department in Washington. That's the rule.And we will become, hopefully, on the way to Vilnius [NATO summit, July 11–12, 2023 – Editor's Note], an alliance of 32 nations, the most powerful and the most relevant alliance in human history. Finland and Sweden will add a great deal of sophistication, of democratic and military and resilience, and added value to us.NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana, a former head of the Social Democratic Party in Romania, has served as Romanian minister of foreign affairs (2000–2004) and president of the Romanian Senate (2008–2011).",2023/02/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813955,2nd shooting this year at largest Indiana mall wounds 1,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A male was shot Friday at an Indianapolis shopping mall in the second shooting there this year, police said.

            The victim was discovered with a gunshot wound inside the Castleton Square mall, and mall security gave him medical attention before police arrived, Officer William Young, of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, said at the scene.

            “He is stable, awake and breathing,” Young said. ""We do not believe there are any other injuries at this time.”











            IMPD tweeted shortly after the shooting that “officers used a tourniquet on the victim for first aid. The suspect is no longer on scene.”

            The male who was shot was taken to a hospital. No additional information was immediately available about his condition. His age hasn’t been disclosed.

            The mall was placed on a quick lockdown moments after the shooting and later closed for the rest of the evening, Young said.

            Investigators were speaking with “persons of interest,” Young said.

            “We will be out here for some time trying to piece together what exactly occurred,” he said.

            The mall, on the far northeast side of Indianapolis, is the largest mall in the state of Indiana, according to its website. Mall representatives and the mall’s owner, Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group, did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the shooting.

            Fed’s Barkin: ‘Slow progress’ on inflation, sees more hikes

            WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Federal Reserve official is downplaying recent signs that the economy is strengthening, but also said he is prepared to keep raising interest rates in smaller increments as often as needed to quell inflation. Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said Friday that recent reports showing an unusually robust job gain and a spike in retail sales last month reflected in part the impact of warm weather and the government’s seasonal adjustment process, rather than an acceleration of growth that could push inflation higher.

            NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street closed another bumpy week with a mixed performance. The S&P fell 0.3% Friday after paring a bigger loss from the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose modestly, while the Nasdaq fell 0.6%. Stocks have hit turbulence in February after shooting higher in January on hopes that cooling inflation could get the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates and that the economy could avoid a severe recession. Recent economic reports have raised worries that inflation is not cooling as quickly and as smoothly as hoped.

            Facebook ran ads in Moldova for oligarch sanctioned by US

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook allowed a Moldovan oligarch with ties to the Kremlin to run ads on its platform urging protests against that country’s government — even though he and his political party are subject to U.S. sanctions. The ads were removed, but not before they were seen millions of times in Moldova. They were bought by Ilan Shor, a pro-Russian politician who fled his country after he was implicated in a $1 billion theft from Moldovan banks. The U.S. sanctioned Shor last year for his role in Russian efforts to destabilize Moldova. Meta, which owns Facebook, said it follows all U.S. sanctions laws and removed the ads as soon as it identified them.

            TikTok plans 2 more European data centers amid privacy fears

            LONDON (AP) — TikTok is planning two more European data centers, as the popular Chinese-owned video sharing app seeks to allay growing concerns about data privacy for its users in the West. The company said in a blog post Friday that it’s finalizing a plan for a second data center in Ireland, following its first announced there last year. TikTok also reported that it had 125 million monthly active users in the European Union, putting it over the threshold for extra scrutiny under the bloc’s new digital rules set to take effect later this year. Google, Twitter, Apple and Facebook and Instagram will also face the stricter EU scrutiny, according to monthly user numbers they released in time for a Friday deadline.

            Former Theranos exec seeks to avoid lengthy prison sentence

            SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Former Theranos executive Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani has returned to federal court in a last-ditch attempt to stay out of prison while he’s appealing a jury’s verdict convicting him of orchestrating a blood-testing hoax with his former boss and lover, Elizabeth Holmes. A judge on Friday oversaw arguments about Balwani’s attempt to delay the start of his nearly 13-year prison sentence. The judge also heard a vigorous debate about how much money Balwani should pay investors and patients duped by the Theranos scam. The judge didn’t rule Friday, but a decision on Balwani’s bid to remain free is expected before March 15 when he is scheduled to report to prison.

            Tank plant in small Ohio city plays big role in Ukraine war

            LIMA, Ohio (AP) — Thousands of miles from the front lines, a sprawling manufacturing plant in the small midwestern city of Lima, Ohio, is playing a critical role in the effort to arm Ukraine as it fends off the Russian invasion. The plant is owned by the Army and operated by General Dynamics. Army officials say it is expected to refurbish Abrams tanks that the U.S. can send to Ukraine, and is already preparing to build an updated version of the vehicle for Poland. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth toured the facility with other Army leaders. She says it’s highly likely the plant will provide the tanks for Ukraine.

            EPA moves to restore rule on mercury from power plants

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reaffirming the basis for a rule that requires “significant reductions” in mercury and other harmful pollutants from power plants. The EPA’s announcement Friday reverses a move late in former President Donald Trump’s administration to roll back emissions standards. The EPA said it found it “appropriate and necessary” to regulate emissions of toxic air pollution under the Clean Air Act. Coal-fired power plants are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants, which enter the food chain through fish and other items that people consume. The EPA’s finding puts back into place air quality protections enacted when President Barack Obama was in office.

            Thousands of flights canceled as German airport staff strike

            BERLIN (AP) — Thousands of flights to and from German airports were canceled Friday as workers walked out to press their demands for inflation-busting pay increases. The strikes at seven German airports, including Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg, affected almost 300,000 passengers and forced airlines to cancel more than 2,300 flights. Christine Behle of the Verdi labor union told public broadcaster RBB-Inforadio that failure to reach a meaningful deal with employers on pay could result in a “summer of chaos” at German airports. The union is seeking a 10.5% increase for its members, or at least 500 euros, to make up for high inflation seen in Germany and elsewhere last year due to the knock-on effects Russia’s attack on Ukraine has had on global food and energy prices.

            Off camera, Fox hosts doubted 2020 election fraud claims

            WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — To millions of viewers, Fox News hosts gave allies of former President Donald Trump a platform to champion false claims that he lost the 2020 election because of voter fraud. To one another, they expressed doubts about the claims and mocked the people making them. Private exchanges between Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, and other network bigwigs — including Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch — show a wide chasm between what the network promoted in primetime and the doubts that its stars held behind the camera. That’s according to new court filings in a defamation lawsuit being waged by a company whose voting systems were regularly maligned on air.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813960,Decision to shoot down balloons puts spotlight on hobbyists,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Decisions to shoot down multiple unidentified objects over the U.S. and Canada this month have put a spotlight on amateur balloonists who insist their creations pose no threat.

            Over the last three weeks, U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered fighter jets to shoot down three objects detected in U.S. air space — a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the South Carolina coast as well as smaller unidentified objects over Alaska and Lake Huron. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week ordered another object to be shot down over the Yukon; a U.S. fighter jet carried out that mission.

            U.S. government officials have yet to definitively identify the objects, but Biden said Thursday that they were probably balloons linked to private companies, weather researchers or hobbyists.











            Tom Medlin, the owner of the Tennessee-based Amateur Radio Roundtable podcast and a balloon hobbyist himself, said he's been in contact with an Illinois club that believes the object shot down over the Yukon was one of their balloons. No one from the club responded to messages left Friday, but Medlin said the club was tracking the balloon and it disappeared over the Yukon on the same day the unidentified object was shot down.

            The incidents have left balloonists scrambling to defend their hobby. They insist their balloons fly too high and are too small to pose a threat to aircraft and that government officials are overreacting. 

            “The spy balloon had to be shot down,” Medlin said. “That's a national security threat, for sure. Then what happened is, I think, the government got a little anxious. Maybe the word is trigger-happy. I don't know. When they shot them down, they didn't know what they were. That's a little concerning.”

            White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that the Biden administration wasn't able to confirm reports that the object belonged to the Illinois club. He said the debris has yet to be recovered and “we all have to accept the possibility that we may not be able to recover it.”

            U.S. officials said Friday that they've stopped searching for debris from the objects shot down over Alaska and Lake Huron after finding nothing. Search efforts for debris from the Yukon object are ongoing.

            Kirby pushed back at the notion that Biden's decision to use missiles costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to shoot down what were most likely balloons that cost less than $20 was an overreaction.

            “Absolutely not,” Kirby said. “Given the situation we were in, the information available, the recommendation of our military commanders — it was exactly the right thing to do at exactly the right time.”

            Medlin said the balloons he's flying right now cost about $12 and are about 32 inches in diameter. 

            
                The balloons carry solar-powered transmitters that weigh less than 2 grams and that broadcast a signal every 10 minutes or so that ham radio operators around the world can use to track the balloons' locations, he said. He has a balloon up right now that’s been in the air for 250 days and has circled the globe 10 times, he said.

            The fun is watching the balloon circle the globe and building the tiny transmitters, said Medlin, adding that the devices are so small he needs a microscope to construct them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been collecting data from ham radio operators to track wind patterns, he said.

            The balloons are so light that the Federal Aviation Administration doesn't regulate them and doesn't require balloonists to file flight plans, Medlin said. He inflates his balloons with enough hydrogen to ensure they'll fly at about 50,000 feet. That is well above most commercial aircraft, he said. 

            Current regulations posted on the FAA’s website state that no one can operate an unmanned balloon in a way that creates a hazard, and agency regulations apply only to balloons that carry a payload of more than four pounds.

            Medlin speculated that after U.S. officials detected the suspected Chinese balloon, they adjusted their radar to pick up very small objects. But the hobbyists' balloons don't pose a threat to aircraft, he said.

            “We're following FAA rules and regulations,” Medlin said. “They're the experts on whether this should or should not be done. Take a cork and drop it in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Is a ship going to hit it? Probably not. And if it did it wouldn't do any damage to the ship.”

            Ron Meadows co-founded San Jose-based Scientific Balloon Solutions with his son, Lee. He said the company produces balloons as large as 8 1/2 feet in diameter for university and middle school science students. He said those balloons carry a payload weight of around 10 to 20 grams, with transmitters the size of a popsicle stick. Some balloons feature a 20-foot (6-meter) antenna, he said.

            He understands that government officials are trying to keep people safe, he said, but they don't understand that the balloons are totally benign and there's no question they're overreacting. Jet engines likely ingest far larger objects, such as birds, and most pilots probably wouldn't even know it if they hit a balloon, Meadows said.

            He said he has tried to contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense to educate officials about the balloons, but that his calls went to voicemail.

            “It would have been nice to get our government the information they needed,” he said. 

            Meadows said he anticipates that after this month's incidents, the FAA will come out with tighter restrictions on balloons. He said he's not overly concerned, since his balloon business is a side job; he also runs a swimming pool repair service. 

            “We are in this (balloon) business more for the students, not for making money,” he said. “This is for education. When we build these things, the time it takes to build them, we can make more at our day job.”

            Medlin said balloons can reach speeds of up to 130 mph (210 kmh) if they get caught up in the jet stream. But Bob Boutin, a Chicago flight instructor, said its unlikely that such balloons pose much of a threat to aircraft.

            Most commercial jets fly between 25,000 and 45,000 feet, below the balloons' level, he said. Some corporate jets climb higher than 50,000 feet, but at that altitude skies are typically clear with visibility of 20 to 40 miles, Boutin said.

            The White House's Kirby said that the objects shot down were traveling low enough to pose a risk to civilian aircraft, but Boutin said even at lower altitudes, a small balloon wouldn't merit a military strike. 

            “Birds and planes are a heck of a lot more issue than a balloon would be,” he said. Even if the balloon were to enter a jet engine, “most jets have two engines, and if you lost one, technically it’s an emergency but not one that means the plane is going crash,” Boutin said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813963,Lawsuit: Mentally ill man froze to death in Alabama jail,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A mentally ill man froze to death at an Alabama jail, according to a lawsuit filed by the man's family who say he was kept naked in a concrete cell and believe he was also placed in a freezer or other frigid environment.

            Anthony Don Mitchell, 33, arrived at a hospital emergency room with a body temperature of 72 degrees (22 degrees Celsius), and was pronounced dead hours later, according to the lawsuit. He was brought to the hospital on Jan. 26 from the Walker County Jail, where he'd been incarcerated for two weeks. 

            An emergency room doctor, who tried unsuccessfully to revive Mitchell, wrote, “I do believe hypothermia was the ultimate cause of his death,” according to the lawsuit filed Monday by Mitchell's mother in federal court. 











            Mitchell, who had a history of drug addiction, was arrested Jan. 12 after a cousin asked authorities to do a welfare check on him because he was rambling about portals to heaven and hell in his home and appeared to be suffering a mental breakdown. Jail video shows Mitchell was kept naked in a concrete-floored isolation cell, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit speculates that Mitchell was also placed in the jail kitchen’s “walk-in freezer or similar frigid environment and left there for hours” because his body temperature was so low.

            “It is clear that Tony’s death was wrongful, the result of horrific, malicious abuse and mountains of deliberate indifference,” Jon C. Goldfarb, a lawyer representing the family, wrote in the lawsuit. “Numerous corrections officers and medical staff wandered over to his open cell door to spectate and be entertained by his condition.” 

            The lawsuit also accuses the sheriff’s office of a cover-up. The sheriff’s office issued a statement after the death saying Mitchell “was alert and conscious when he left the facility."" Jail security footage provided to The Associated Press by lawyers for Mitchell’s mother shows officers carrying Mitchell’s limp body to a transport car, then putting him on the ground before placing him in the car. 

            The suit names Walker County Sheriff Nick Smith and jail officers as defendants. 

            Lawyers representing the Walker County Sheriff's Office said it could not comment before the conclusion of a requested investigation. The sheriff's office, following routine procedures, contacted the State Bureau of Investigation after Mitchell's death to ask for the investigation, according to a statement from Jackson, Fikes & Brakefield.

            “The WCSO offers and extends its condolences to the family of Mr. Mitchell and asks for your support and patience for the men and women of the WCSO,” the firm wrote in the statement. 

            A photo of of Mitchell being arrested was posted by the sheriff’s office on its Facebook page, adding that Mitchell “brandished a handgun, and fired at least one shot at deputies” before running into the woods. 

            The photo shows Mitchell’s face is painted black. According to the lawsuit, officers told a family member that Mitchell said he spray painted his own face black in preparation to enter the portal to hell. An officer told family members they planned “to detox him and then ‘we’ll see how much of his brain is left,’ or words to that effect,” according to the suit.

            According to the lawsuit, a doctor wrote in emergency room notes that Mitchell was “unresponsive apneic and pulseless and cold to the touch” when he arrived.

            “I am not sure what circumstances the patient was held in incarceration but it is difficult to understand a rectal temperature of 72° F 22° centigrade while someone is incarcerated in jail. The cause of his hypothermia is not clear. It is possible he had a underlying medical condition resulting in hypothermia. I do not know if he could have been exposed to a cold environment,” the lawsuit quotes the doctor as writing. 

            Cameron Mixon, a spokesperson for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, said the office is aware of the matter and it's “being investigated by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” He said the office will ensure that any appropriate action is taken after the investigation is complete. 

            The allegations of death by hypothermia come as the state prison system also faces a lawsuit over the death of a mentally ill man who “baked to death” in an overheated prison cell. Thomas Lee Rutledge died of hyperthermia on Dec. 7, 2020, at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer. Rutledge had an internal temperature of 109 degrees when he was found unresponsive in the mental health cell, according to the suit filed by his sister. It names prison staff, wardens and contractors as defendants.MONTGOMERY, Ala.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813964,Napoli increases lead at top of Serie A to 18 points,"SASSUOLO, Italy (AP) — Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Victor Osimhen scored first-half goals as Napoli opened an 18-point lead in Serie A with a 2-0 win at Sassuolo on Friday.

            Giovanni Simeone, the son of Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone, thought he’d made it 3-0 in injury time but his goal was ruled out for offside.

            Simeone had come on late for Osimhen as Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti made his five substitutions presumably with Tuesday’s visit to Eintracht Frankfurt in mind.











            His team had shown no sign of conserving any energy for the Champions League clash.

            Kvaratskhelia got the visitors off to a great start in the 12th minute when he won the ball in the center circle and tore off toward goal, skipping over a challenge and then finding the space to shoot through a defender’s legs and inside the left post.

            Armand Laurienté struck the post in response for Sassuolo before Osimhen took over. The Nigeria striker scored a hat trick in Napoli’s 4-0 win over Sassuolo in October and seemed keen to repeat the feat.

            Osimhen hit the left post in the 27th, then scored in the 33rd, when he squeezed the ball inside the near post from a narrow angle despite facing two defenders.

            Osimhen almost made it 3-0 minutes later when he headed just wide from Kvaratskhelia’s cross.

            Laurienté replied with a fine finish for Sassuolo, but the goal was ruled out after a VAR check as teammate Gregoire Defrel was offside when he impeded Napoli defender Mathias Olivera.

            Osimhen could have scored again after the break. He had an uncharacteristically poor touch with only goalkeeper Andrea Consigli to beat, then Consigli pulled off a good save as the visitors kept pushing forward.

            Osimhen had to be content with one goal. He now has nine in his last seven league matches and 18 in Serie A this season.

            Second-place Inter Milan hosts Udinese on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813967,Auxerre ends 10-match winless run in French league,"AUXERRE, France (AP) — Auxerre ended its 10-match winless streak in the French league by coming from behind to beat seven-time champion Lyon 2-1 on Friday.

            After striker Moussa Dembele had put the visitors in front with a header from Corentin Tolisso's cross in the 36th minute, Auxerre replied with two goals in the space of two minutes after the interval.

            After struggling to create chances throughout the first half, the hosts were awarded a penalty in the 50th minute when Han-Noah Massengo was fouled in the box by Sinaly Diomande. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes picked the correct side but could not stop Gaetan Perrin's strike.











            Left alone at the far post, Brazilian defender Jubal then headed home the winner from a corner for Auxerre's fourth win in 24 league games this season.

            Lyon, which failed to win a third match in a row, pressed hard toward the end without being a real threat.

            Auxerre remained 19th but moved one point from safety. Lyon sits in ninth place, 19 points behind leader PSG, with its hopes of qualifying for a European competition next season fading away.

            PSG hosts Lille on Sunday, with second-place Marseille traveling to Toulouse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813968,Suspect in shooting of 2 Jewish men in LA faces hate crimes,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man who allegedly shot and wounded two Jewish men as they left synagogues in Los Angeles this week was charged Friday with federal hate crimes.

            Jaime Tran, 28, allegedly carried out the attacks on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said at a news conference.

            “For the past two days, our community has experienced two horrific acts,"" Estrada said. ""An individual motivated by antisemitism, hatred for people in the Jewish community, committed two tremendously horrible acts targeting individuals because of their Jewish faith.”











            Both victims wore clothing that identified their faith, including black coats and head coverings, Estrada said. Tran, arrested Thursday evening, told law enforcement that he looked online for a “kosher market” and decided to shoot someone nearby, according at an affidavit filed by the FBI. He also admitted to shooting someone the previous day, the affidavit said.

            Tran was scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court Friday afternoon but was not expected to enter a plea, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.

            Tran's federal public defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The first victim was shot at close range in the lower back, Estrada said. The second victim was shot in the upper arm, also at close range. In both cases the shots were fired from a car. 

            Tran said he selected the victims because of what they wore on their heads, the FBI affidavit said.

            Tran has “history of antisemitic and threatening conduct,” the affidavit said, citing a review of emails, text messages and unspecified reports. In 2022, he emailed former classmates using insulting language about Jewish people, and he threatened a Jewish former classmate, repeatedly sending them messages like “Someone is going to kill you, Jew” and “I want you dead, Jew,” according to the affidavit.

            “We were lucky that we’re not going to funerals. That’s just the reality,” Rabbi Abraham Cooper from the Simon Wiesenthal Center said during Friday's news conference. “Tomorrow we go to our services with our children.""

            Tran was arrested about 100 miles (161 kilometers) east of Los Angeles in the Riverside County community of Cathedral City near Palm Springs.

            According to the affidavit, Los Angeles police officers investigating the second shooting used video from a camera at an intersection to identify an older model gray Honda that appeared to be involved.

            An officer who responded to assist saw and photographed a man driving a dark gray Honda Civic. The image captured the license plate, which was registered to Tran, whose driver license photo was consistent with witness' descriptions of the shooter, the affidavit said.

            License plate readers showed the Honda was in the area of the two shootings at the times they occurred. Police identified a mobile phone number associated with Tran and location data showed it was in the Palm Springs area Thursday afternoon.

            Around 5:45 p.m., Cathedral City police responded to a call from someone who heard the sound of a gunshot and saw a man with a gun near a Honda Civic.

            Officers found Tran standing next to the car, and they could see an “AK-style rifle” and a .380-caliber handgun in plain view on the driver's seat, the affidavit said. The officers also found a spent shell casing.

            The U.S. attorney said that Tran had been a resident of the city of Riverside.

            In the FBI interview, Tran said he was homeless and had been living out of the car for 12 to 14 months, and that he obtained the firearms from someone he did not know in Arizona, the affidavit said.

            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said fighting hate crimes is a priority of her administration's public safety agenda.

            “We can rest hopefully a little bit easier,” she said during Friday's news conference. “Still, antisemitism and terror are tragically on the rise across our city and across our nation.""LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man who allegedly shot and wounded two Jewish men as they left synagogues in Los Angeles this week was charged Friday with federal hate crimes.Jaime Tran, 28, allegedly carried out the attacks on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said at a news conference.“For the past two days, our community has experienced two horrific acts,"" Estrada said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813969,Norfolk police charge mom of boy who brought gun to school,"NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The mother of a 6-year-old student who brought a handgun to school has been charged in the incident, police in Norfolk said Friday.

            Police said in a news release they responded to Little Creek Elementary School in Norfolk at about 3:30 p.m. Thursday after receiving a report that a student had a weapon in the school. When officers arrived, a handgun was turned over to police by school staff. No injuries were reported, police said.

            After an investigation, police charged the student's mother with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and allowing access to a loaded firearm by children. The student's mother, 35, was released on a criminal summons, police said. The Associated Press is not identifying the mother because doing so could reveal the identity of the student.











            School officials did not immediately return a call seeking comment, and Superintendent Sharon Byrdsong did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

            Police declined to release additional details.

            The incident was first reported by The Virginian-Pilot.

            Last month, a 6-year-old boy in Newport News, Virginia, shot and wounded his first-grade teacher, Abigail Zwerner. An attorney for Zwerner has filed a notice of intent to sue the Newport News school district, alleging that school administrators were warned repeatedly by staff hours before the shooting that the boy had a gun and was threatening other students.

            Police have said the gun in the Newport News case was legally purchased by the boy's mother. No charges have been brought in that case.NORFOLK, Va.

            Striker Valentín Castellanos got the hosts going in the eighth minute. Ukraine forward Viktor Tsygankov, who joined from Dynamo Kyiv in January, doubled the lead in the 34th and Girona never looked back. Rodrigo Riquelme and Javi Hernández made it 4-0 before halftime.

            Iván Martín and Cristhian Stuani added two more goals for Girona in the second half, while Largie Ramazani and El Bilal Touré scored for Almeria.











            “As far as attack goes, this was our best game of the season,” Girona coach Míchel Sánchez said. “Everything went our way today because we were able to find open spaces behind their defense.”

            Girona remained in 11th place. With 33 goals, the modest club from northeast Spain has the third most potent attack in the 20-team competition. Only Real Madrid (44) and Barcelona (43) have scored more.

            Almeria was left in 15th place at two points above the relegation zone.

            “This is a game to forget. I must ask (our fans) for forgiveness because in the first half we were not up to the task,” Almeria coach Rubi Ferrer said. “The fault is mine. I think that talking this week about needing to win on the road made my team play with nerves.”

(AP) — A building at the U.S. Naval Academy that had been named after a leader in the Confederate Navy was renamed Friday in honor of former President Jimmy Carter, who graduated from the academy in 1946.

            The decision to rename the engineering building in Annapolis was made after a commission mandated by Congress determined several military assets across all branches of the service had to be renamed because of Confederate ties. 

            The building that had been called Maury Hall was built and named in the early 1900s after Matthew Fontaine Maury, a naval officer and scientist who joined the Confederates. 











            The Naval Academy superintendent's house and a nearby road are named after Franklin Buchanan, the academy's first superintendent who left to join the Confederate Navy at the start of the Civil War. The academy also is renaming the house and road, but has yet to announce those changes.

            Carter, who is 98, was president from 1977 to 1981. He did not attend the ceremony, though some of his relatives did.

            “It would be impossible to overstate what this Academy and the Navy has meant to my grandfather, and by extension to my family,” said Josh Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, in a news release from the Navy.ANNAPOLIS, Md.

            The army called it the biggest seizure of meth this year. 

            Troops found the drugs Thursday at a half-finished house in the town of Angostura, in the northern state of Sinaloa. The state is home to the drug cartel of the same name. 











            Three suspects fled the scene and there were no arrests. 

            The zrmy distributed photos showing the meth packed into plastic basins, drums and buckets.

            The raid came two days after soldiers seized more than a half million fentanyl pills in another raid in Sinaloa on what the army called the largest synthetic drug lab found to date. The army said the outdoor lab was discovered in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa. 

            Soldiers raided the lab Tuesday and found almost 630,000 pills that appearee to contain the synthetic opioid fentanyl, the army said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813985,"North Dakota moves to curb trans identity in data, minors","The North Dakota House passed gender-related bills Friday that would omit transgender identity from state data collection and criminalize health care providers who give gender-affirming care to minors. 

            The bills still need to go through the Senate and governor to become law.

            The first measure would require “male” and “female” — as assigned at birth — to be the only options in state data collection of vital statistics. Supporters of the bill said it would improve the accuracy of public health data, while opponents said it would erase vulnerable populations from data and outreach. 











            Republican Rep. SuAnn Olson said in support of the bill that it would serve “the interest of being scientifically accurate and statistics being valuable."" For example, she said there shouldn't be many cases of prostate cancer among females, but such cases could be logged if data isn't reported based on sex assigned at birth. 

            Democratic Rep. Josh Boschee, of Fargo. said, “This is just a complete overreach of our government. And again, another example of us just trying to limit and erase certain people from our society. ... We should be able to collect as much data as we can to make sure that we can help improve people’s lives."" 

            The bill passed with a 74-18 vote. 

            Another bill that passed would charge a health care provider with a class B felony for performing gender-affirming surgery on a minor and with a class A misdemeanor for giving puberty-blocking medication to a minor. 

            The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. The misdemeanor charge has a maximum penalty of 360 days in prison and a $3,000 fine.

            Supporters said the bill would protect children from predatory adults and future regrets, whereas opponents said it would further harm transgender children who already have high rates of suicide.

            Republican Rep. Brandon Prichard, of Bismarck, said in support: “We need to protect our children from being experimented on. ... We have to have a criminal violation for butchering children and for changing them and playing on a dysphoria. We should treat a child’s dysphoria with mental health care. We should not over-medicate them or surgically cut off parts of their body.” 

            Democratic Rep. Karla Rose Hanson of Fargo responded: “I recognize that some of you in this chamber genuinely believe that this bill and similar bills will protect kids,” but the bills would actually do the exact opposite, she said. 

            “Gender-affirming care is suicide prevention,"" Hanson said. “Prohibiting this care would be devastating for families. ... I beg you, let’s keep kids alive.”

            The bill passed with a 66-25 vote. 

            There are 12 Democrats and 82 Republicans in the House. Several Republicans voted against the bills that passed.

            Legislation in at least seven other states have LGBTQ-rights advocates worrying about a sweeping Republican-led effort to erase the legal existence of transgender people, deny recognition to nonbinary or gender-fluid people and ignore those who are intersex.

            Republican lawmakers in more than two dozen states have pushed for bans on gender-affirming care this year, targeting what doctors and psychologists widely consider medically necessary care.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813997,Japan to launch pilot programme for issuing digital yen,"TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japan will start a pilot programme in April to test the use of a digital yen, its central bank said on Friday, joining a growing number of countries seeking to catch up with front-runner China in launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
The widely expected move follows two years of experiments that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been conducting to decide whether to issue a CBDC, and moves Japan closer to issuing a digital yen in several more years.
It also comes ahead of the BOJ's leadership transition to academic Kazuo Ueda, who is expected to succeed incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda's second five-year term ends in April.
""Our hope is that the pilot programme will lead to improved designs through discussion with private businesses,"" BOJ Executive Director Shinichi Uchida said in opening remarks at the central bank's meeting with private-sector executives.
Under the pilot programme, the BOJ will conduct simulated transactions with private entities in a test environment, Uchida said. The programme will help the BOJ be ready in case the government decides to issue a digital yen, the bank said.
Kazushige Kamiyama, head of the BOJ's department overseeing development of a CBDC, said the pilot programme will last for several years and involve discussions not just with commercial banks but non-bank settlement firms and carriers.
While there is no plan to do so for now, the central bank could conduct experiments involving actual transactions among retailers and consumers in the future, he said.
""To a certain extent, we need to move in lockstep with other advanced economies in deciding on the timeframe"" for issuing a CBDC, Kamiyama told a briefing.
Central banks around the world have stepped up efforts to develop their own digital currencies to modernize financial systems and speed up domestic and international payments.
Japan and other advanced economies are seeking to catch up with China, which is at the fore of a global race to develop CBDCs and has ramped up pilot schemes for retail payments.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has also been exploring how it can launch a fully digital dollar that some have referred to as Fedcoin. Fed leaders have said that any launch of such an asset would need the support of elected leaders.
The Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies have sought to align themselves in their progress towards issuing CBDCs. In 2021, the group agreed that any digital currency issued by a central bank must ""support and do no harm"" to the bank's ability to fulfil its mandate on monetary and financial stability.TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japan will start a pilot programme in April to test the use of a digital yen, its central bank said on Friday, joining a growing number of countries seeking to catch up with front-runner China in launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC).The widely expected move follows two years of experiments that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been conducting to decide whether to issue a CBDC, and moves Japan closer to issuing a digital yen in several more years.It also comes ahead of the BOJ's leadership transition to academic Kazuo Ueda, who is expected to succeed incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813998,Jimmie Johnson tops Daytona 500 practice in return to NASCAR,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Seven-time is officially back.

            Jimmie Johnson, making his return to stock car racing after a two-year dalliance in IndyCar, topped the first practice session for the Daytona 500 on Friday.

            The two-time Daytona 500 winner and seven-time Cup Series champion reached a top speed of 194.25 mph around the 2 1/2-mile superspeedway. He edged fellow Chevrolet drivers Chase Elliott — his former teammate at Hendrick Motorsports — Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and pole-sitter Alex Bowman, the driver who replaced Johnson when he left NASCAR after the 2020 season, to create a feel-good moment for the bowtie.











            It was Johnson's first extended stint behind the wheel in the Next Gen car at Daytona International Speedway. He did take part in a one-day practice session at Phoenix last month.

            “I honestly think it's too early to read far into this. It is plate racing, and that was just a practice session,” Johnson said. “We didn't make any mistakes and did some things right to end up where we did. ... 

            ""Anything can still happen. But I'm glad to be in here, I'm glad we're at the top of the board and not the bottom. I'm sure the headlines would read a little differently if we were on the other end of it.”

            Johnson returned to NASCAR in November as part-owner of what is now called Legacy Motor Club, an organization that began as Petty Enterprises nearly 75 years ago. He has so far as a driver entered the Daytona 500 — Johnson will start 39th on Sunday — the street course race in Chicago in July and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as part of NASCAR's Garage 56 project. 

            How'd the new car feel?

            “It drives like a stock car,” he quipped. “It doesn't drive like an IndyCar, thank God. We know how that went.”

            Johnson drove the No. 48 for his entire career but will be behind the wheel of the No. 84 when he competes in NASCAR this year. 

            Aric Almirola and Joey Logano, both winners in Thursday night's qualifying races, led a train of Ford drivers behind the Chevy leaders. Almirola and Logano were fifth and sixth and followed by Ryan Blaney, Chase Briscoe, Kevin Harvick, Zane Smith, Chris Buescher and Harrison Burton. 

            Martin Truex Jr. was the fastest Toyota driver in 17th.

            The fast lap capped a big day for Johnson, who earlier flew with the Air Force Thunderbirds before turning 34 laps in the one-hour practice session. He blacked out in the jet but didn't get sick.

            “Never felt anything like that, the adrenalize, the acceleration,” he said.

            Thirty-seven of 40 drivers turned at least one lap in Friday night practice. Kaulig Racing teammates AJ Allmendinger and Justin Haley sat out along with Riley Herbst of Rick Ware Racing. 

            There's one practice remaining for the 65th running of “The Great American Race,"" and several drivers are expected to skip the final session because they don't want to risk any damage before the season opener.

            FEELING SICK

            Toyota drivers Denny Hamlin and Tyler Reddick suffered from carbon monoxide exposure earlier this month at the exhibition Clash, the head of the manufacturer’s racing program said.

            Hamlin complained of illness, and Reddick said he passed out on the plane ride home following the race held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

            “The subsidization is it was a multifaceted issue,” TRD President David Wilson said. “One probably being the mufflers that we ran, and the other racing in a bowl and a lot of time at low speed contributing to that. I’m not aware if other drivers suffered to the same extent, but we don’t have any cause to believe that it is a Toyota-specific issue.”

            CHARITY FISHING

            NASCAR driver Erik Jones notched a victory at Daytona International Speedway on Friday, only this one came on the water instead of on the track. 

            Jones and his team won the Hot Rods & Reels Charity Fishing Tournament, which benefits the Darrell Gwynn Chapter of the Buoniconti Fund to Cure Paralysis. The annual tournament takes place at Lake Lloyd inside the speedway.

            Jones’ team hooked a three-fish total of 6.86 pounds, enough to edge David Blaney’s team (6.52 pounds) and Hall of Famer Donnie Allison’s team (5.08 pounds). 

            Bobby Allison, Christopher Bell, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson, Brad Keselowski, Michael McDowell, Ryan Newman and Martin Truex, Jr. were among the drivers and racing legends who took part in the event.

            Darrell Gwynn and his charity donated a $25,000 custom wheelchair to injured dirt-track racer Grady Chandler, whose spinal cord was significantly damaged in a 2019 crash in Oklahoma.

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Seven-time is officially back.Jimmie Johnson, making his return to stock car racing after a two-year dalliance in IndyCar, topped the first practice session for the Daytona 500 on Friday.The two-time Daytona 500 winner and seven-time Cup Series champion reached a top speed of 194.25 mph around the 2 1/2-mile superspeedway. He edged fellow Chevrolet drivers Chase Elliott — his former teammate at Hendrick Motorsports — Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and pole-sitter Alex Bowman, the driver who replaced Johnson when he left NASCAR after the 2020 season, to create a feel-good moment for the bowtie.It was Johnson's first extended stint behind the wheel in the Next Gen car at Daytona International Speedway. He did take part in a one-day practice session at Phoenix last month.“I honestly think it's too early to read far into this. It is plate racing, and that was just a practice session,” Johnson said. “We didn't make any mistakes and did some things right to end up where we did. ...""Anything can still happen. But I'm glad to be in here, I'm glad we're at the top of the board and not the bottom. I'm sure the headlines would read a little differently if we were on the other end of it.”Johnson returned to NASCAR in November as part-owner of what is now called Legacy Motor Club, an organization that began as Petty Enterprises nearly 75 years ago. He has so far as a driver entered the Daytona 500 — Johnson will start 39th on Sunday — the street course race in Chicago in July and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as part of NASCAR's Garage 56 project.How'd the new car feel?“It drives like a stock car,” he quipped. “It doesn't drive like an IndyCar, thank God. We know how that went.”Johnson drove the No. 48 for his entire career but will be behind the wheel of the No. 84 when he competes in NASCAR this year.Aric Almirola and Joey Logano, both winners in Thursday night's qualifying races, led a train of Ford drivers behind the Chevy leaders. Almirola and Logano were fifth and sixth and followed by Ryan Blaney, Chase Briscoe, Kevin Harvick, Zane Smith, Chris Buescher and Harrison Burton.Martin Truex Jr. was the fastest Toyota driver in 17th.The fast lap capped a big day for Johnson, who earlier flew with the Air Force Thunderbirds before turning 34 laps in the one-hour practice session. He blacked out in the jet but didn't get sick.“Never felt anything like that, the adrenalize, the acceleration,” he said.Thirty-seven of 40 drivers turned at least one lap in Friday night practice. Kaulig Racing teammates AJ Allmendinger and Justin Haley sat out along with Riley Herbst of Rick Ware Racing.There's one practice remaining for the 65th running of “The Great American Race,"" and several drivers are expected to skip the final session because they don't want to risk any damage before the season opener.FEELING SICKToyota drivers Denny Hamlin and Tyler Reddick suffered from carbon monoxide exposure earlier this month at the exhibition Clash, the head of the manufacturer’s racing program said.Hamlin complained of illness, and Reddick said he passed out on the plane ride home following the race held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.“The subsidization is it was a multifaceted issue,” TRD President David Wilson said. “One probably being the mufflers that we ran, and the other racing in a bowl and a lot of time at low speed contributing to that.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813999,"2 train derailments have similar risks, different outcomes","TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Police Chief Jason Wright feared the worst as he rushed to the scene of a freight train derailment in Michigan's Van Buren Township, mindful of a fiery rail crash this month in Ohio that led to evacuations and a toxic chemical release.

            Instead, the situation a half-hour's drive west of Detroit was far less grim: 28 of 134 cars in a Norfolk Southern train had gone at least partially off the track Thursday with a couple overturned and several others upright but knocked sideways. No one was injured and nothing appeared to have spilled. The lone car carrying hazardous materials wasn't affected.

            “We couldn't believe how lucky we were, considering the awful situation over there in Ohio,” Wright said Friday.











            About 50 train cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio. Vinyl chloride later was released into the air from five of them before crews ignited it to get rid of the highly flammable chemicals in a controlled way, creating a dark plume of smoke.

            Residents from nearby neighborhoods in Ohio and Pennsylvania were evacuated because of health risks from the fumes. They later were allowed to return but many say they've experienced headaches and eye irritations and worry about long-term effects.

            The starkly contrasting outcomes of similar incidents involving the same rail company in next-door states might appear a matter of fate. But many factors determine the severity of rail crashes, experts said, including how fast a train is going, what kind of cargo it carries and the reason it jumps the tracks.

            The cause of neither derailment has been determined, Norfolk Southern spokesman Connor Spielmaker said. Crews had gotten two cars back on the track in Michigan and were working on others, he said.

            Officials say a mechanical issue with a car axle — perhaps from an overheated wheel bearing — is suspected in the Ohio crash.

            “That's one of those classes of accidents that happen basically with no warning — when the train is moving at normal operating speeds, there's no notice to the crew, no opportunity to slow the train down or reduce the energy associated with derailments,” said Allan Zarembski, a University of Delaware railroad engineering professor. When axles break at high speed, he said, “it's a pretty significant event.”

            A crash like the one in Ohio is rare, he said. When they happen, the consequences can be catastrophic. Still, most derailments are “fender benders” that happen in rail yards and do little if any damage, Zarembski said.

            The fact that two Norfolk Southern trains would go off the rails within a couple of weeks is hardly surprising, given that the company has about 20,000 miles of track — “as much track as all of England,” he said.

            “It's not a good thing, but it's not an ‘oh my god, there's something horribly wrong' thing,” he said. “There's nothing that says there's been a major drop in safety. It just means we're following the statistical pattern.”

            The American Society of Civil Engineers gave railroads a grade of “B” in its most recent “report card” on U.S. infrastructure — better than roads and aviation, which were rated at just above failing.

            There were more than 12,400 train derailments in the U.S. over the past decade, or more than 1,200 annually, according to Federal Railroad Administration data based on reports submitted by railroads.

            Those accidents combined derailed or damaged about 6,600 tank cars carrying hazardous materials — including 348 cars that released their contents — and prompted evacuations involving more than 18,600 people, according to FRA data.

            Total damages reported by railroads from derailments of trains hauling hazardous materials exceeded $930 million over the decade, the accident reports show.

            U.S. rail accidents from all causes – from derailments to malfunctioning equipment — released more than 5 million gallons of hazardous materials since 2011, according to data collected by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The bulk of what spilled was crude oil, but the accidents also included fuels such as gasoline and ethanol and a wide range of other chemicals.

            The danger to nearby communities from derailments rises significantly any time hazardous solids, liquids or compressed gas are involved, said Bob Chipevich, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board.

            Manufacturing cars in keeping with the newest standards — thicker steel walls, added protections at either end and in valve areas — can help them stay intact even if overturned, he said. But communities where hazardous materials rail cars regularly pass through should be vigilant, he added.

            “Certainly if I lived along a track, I'd insist that the railroad maintain that track in very good condition,"" Chipevich said. “Poor track conditions are a significant cause for trail derailments.”

            Environmental groups called for reinstating a regulation dropped by the Trump administration in 2018 that had required trains to switch to electronic braking from the air-brake systems long used.

            “Reliance on century-old braking technology is unacceptably negligent,” said Sean Dixon, executive director at Puget Soundkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit organization concerned with protecting the waterways of the Puget Sound.

            Whatever precautions are imposed on the industry, communities should prepare emergency responders to deal with hazardous material releases from derailed trains, Chipevich said.

            Wright, the Michigan police chief, said he and colleagues have done “tabletop exercises” on chemical spills and potential risks to neighborhoods and schools.

            “To me, it's no different than semi-trucks hauling hazardous stuff down our roads and highways,” he said. “It's around us all the time. You try to plan for the worst and do the best you can when it happens.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814000,3 NYC firefighters critically hurt in wind-swept house fire,"NEW YORK (AP) — Three New York City firefighters were critically injured Friday in what the commissioner said was a “very close call” as wind-swept flames tore through a Staten Island duplex. They are alert and expected to survive, officials said.

            Firefighters rescued a lieutenant from the second floor after he transmitted a mayday signal during a search for occupants in one of the homes, in the borough’s Arden Heights neighborhood, Chief of Department John Hodgens said.

            A nozzle man involved in the rescue was hit in the head by falling plaster, dislodging his mask and forcing him to breathe in heavy smoke, Hodgens said.











            Another firefighter jumped from a second-floor balcony after getting trapped by fire, Hodgens said.

            All three firefighters were taken to Staten Island University Hospital, where they were listed in stable but critical condition.

            Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said at a hospital news conference that the injured firefighters are awake, alert and even cracking jokes, but that they continue to be monitored and treated for a variety of injuries.

            “I cannot emphasize enough that this was a very close call for the FDNY,” Kavanagh said. “We could have lost three members today.”

            Nineteen other firefighters sustained minor injuries, Kavanagh said. No residents were hurt.

            The blaze started around 1:30 p.m. in a space between additions in the back of each home and quickly spread to the attached buildings, Hodgens said.

            Firefighters searching the homes were trapped when heavy winds broke through the windows, which intensified the fire and blew flames toward them, Hodgens said.

            Bystander video showed heavy flames and thick. black smoke coming from the home. One of the extensions collapsed as firefighters battled the blaze. The fire was under control by around 2:46 p.m. The cause is under investigation, Hodgens said.

            “With the amount of fire upon arrival and the wind condition, it was a difficult fire,” Hodgens said. “It was a difficult fire that required us to really work very hard.”

            The president of the firefighters union said the closest firehouse was closed Friday because of scheduled firefighter medical exams, possibly delaying the fire department’s response.

            Another engine company was involved in an accident on the way to the scene, Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro said.

            “Had Engine 167 not been closed, more firefighters would have arrived faster and put water on the fire that much quicker, resulting in less damage and possibly sparing some firefighters injuries,” Ansbro said.NEW YORK (AP) — Three New York City firefighters were critically injured Friday in what the commissioner said was a “very close call” as wind-swept flames tore through a Staten Island duplex.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814002,Montana lawmaker: There's a religious right to abortion,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Abortion rights groups are challenging abortion bans in some states by arguing the bans — supported by certain religious principles — violate the religious rights of people with different beliefs. 

            Conservative Christians for decades have argued that life begins at conception and abortion should be illegal and 47 states have laws that allow health care workers to opt out of providing abortions if that violates their religious beliefs or morals.

            In Montana, a state lawmaker who is an ordained Jewish rabbi argues religious freedom laws that protect health care workers' religious beliefs should also protect abortion rights for those who belong to religions that support such rights. 











            “It seems that both sides should be permitted to have equal protections for their religious conscience,” said Rep. Ed Stafman, a Democrat.

            States have been creating their own abortion laws after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling last summer. Abortion laws in Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Wyoming have faced challenges on the basis of religious freedom, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. None of those cases have been resolved.

            The Montana bill faces uncertain prospects in the state's Republican-controlled legislature, but Stafman noted that several members of the House Judiciary Committee that heard testimony on the bill on Friday are members of the Montana Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative lawmakers whose key issues include religious freedom.

            Montana's House Judiciary Committee, along with the House itself, have already passed a bill this session expanding the state law to allow health care workers to decline to participate in any medical procedures that violate their conscience or religious beliefs.

            Stafman's bill does not say how the state would determine if religious protection should be granted, but health care facilities can ask for employees to submit in writing their religious or moral refusals to participate in abortions.

            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid form for those seeking an exemption from a required COVID-19 vaccine requires just a signature and no explanation. Under federal law, an individual can seek a religious exemption regardless of whether the religious beliefs, observances or practices are common or non-traditional and regardless of whether they are recognized by any organized religion. 

            Republicans on the committee questioned how far the proposed law could go in protecting actions claimed as religious beliefs, including whether it should protect infanticide or the killing of people who violate religious tenets.

            “Do you admit then that a religious exemption for killing a child that has been born ... exists under your premise behind this bill?"" Republican Rep. Lee Deming asked.

            “No,” Stafman replied. “There's no religious exemption to kill a child that's been born under my bill.""

            There are limitations to religious protections, “when there is a very, very broad public consensus on morality like there is around polygamy and certainly around murder,” Stafman said. 

            “In this case, the case of abortion, there certainly is no consensus,” he said. Polls show society is divided, as are different religious communities, he said.

            Some religious groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, Assemblies of God, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Southern Baptist Convention, oppose abortion rights, with few to no exceptions, according the Pew Research Center.

            The Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Methodist Church support abortion rights, with some limits. Conservative and Reform Judaism, the Presbyterian Church, Unitarian Universalist and the United Church of Christ support abortion rights with few or no limits, Pew said. 

            Islam, Buddhism, the National Baptist Convention and Orthodox Judaism hold no clear position on the procedure.

            Judaism has a tremendous respect for life, Stafman said, and it differentiates between a woman as a life and a fetus as a potential life.

            Stafman said he respects the religious beliefs of those who came to testify against his bill, quoting the Bible and scripture.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814003,Panthers hire Thomas Brown as offensive coordinator,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers added the last major piece of Frank Reich’s coaching staff, hiring Thomas Brown as offensive coordinator on Friday.

            The team has now filled all three coordinator positions.

            After deciding not to retain last year's interim coach, Steve Wilks, who is Black, the Panthers have hired two Black coordinators in Brown and Ejiro Evero, who will coach the defense.

            The Panthers also announced on Friday they have hired Tem Lukabu as outside linebackers coach, Bert Watts as safeties coach and Devin Fitzsimmons as assistant special teams coach.

Chase, the U.S. Department of Defense's deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, was slated to arrive in Taiwan ""in the coming days."" The newspaper said Chase that day was in Mongolia for military talks.When asked by the media on that morning to confirm Chase's visit, Taiwan Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱國正) said that whenever any delegation visits for the benefit of Taiwan, ""it is a very good opportunity."" When pressed to provide a timeframe for when Chase would arrive, Chiu appeared to acknowledge that it would occur by saying that he cannot yet provide precise details on the timing of the trip.However, at 3:59 p.m., the author of the article, Demetri Sevastopulo, wrote on Twitter that the story had been updated to clarify that following a trip to Ulan Bator in Mongolia, ""Chase is now in Taiwan."" On Saturday (Feb. 18), Reuters cited two sources as confirming that Chase is indeed in Taiwan.In response to a question about Chase's impending visit at a press conference in Beijing on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin (汪文斌) said that China ""firmly opposes official interactions and military ties between the U.S. and Taiwan."" He said that Beijing urges the U.S. to adhere to its ""one China principle"" and the Three Joint Communiques.Wang warned the U.S. to not support Taiwan's independence and put a halt to any form of official exchanges and military relations with Taiwan. He then demanded the U.S. ""stop meddling in the Taiwan issue, and stop creating new tension factors in the Taiwan Strait.""Chase is the highest-level Pentagon official to visit Taiwan since former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck was dispatched to Taiwan in 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814009,Thai PM to dissolve parliament before term ends next month,"BANGKOK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has ""a date in mind"" for when parliament will be dissolved, which he said will come before the government's term ends late next month.He declined to disclose the date in his remarks to reporters late on Thursday, which was the first time Prayuth has said the house would be dissolved early. According to a timeline in the constitution, an election must be held by May at the latest.The ballot could make for a grudge match for the premiership that pits two royalist former army chiefs against the billionaire Shinawatra family, whose elected governments the generals helped to overthrow in coups in 2006 and 2014.Prayuth, 68, has fared poorly in recent opinion polls against the Pheu Thai Party's Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 36-year-old daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra and niece of Yingluck Shinawatra, both self-exiled former prime ministers.He is expected to run also against his 77-year-old military mentor Prawit Wongsuwan, his deputy prime minister and veteran political kingmaker from the same royalist army regiment.Early dissolution could be advantageous to Prayuth, who last month joined the new United Thai Nation party (UTN), as it would allow for more members to be recruited. Under election rules, early dissolution would reduce the minimum period of party membership for election candidates from 90 days to 30 days.His party has much ground to gain and was sixth in an opinion poll conducted last month with support from just 4.8% of respondents. Pheu Thai was top with 23.4%.Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup, promising his rule was only temporary. He served as prime minister of a junta and remained premier after a 2019 election.",2023/02/18,153,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814021,North Korean leader brings daughter to soccer match,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his young daughter to a soccer game celebrating the birthday of his late father, state media said Saturday, her latest in a series of public appearances that have triggered debate on whether she’s being prepped for a future leadership role.

            The official Korean Central News Agency said the presence of Kim and his “beloved” daughter, known as Kim Ju Ae and believed to be around 10 years old, brought “joy and excitement” to Friday’s ceremonial game between staff members from the Cabinet and the Defense Ministry. 

            The Defense Ministry team won the match 3-1 and then beat the Cabinet staff again in a tug-of-war event, according to the report, which didn’t mention any comments made by Kim. The event was to celebrate the birthday of the late Kim Jong Il, the country’s previous leader and the father of the current ruler. 











            “The stadium was filled with joy and excitement of officials of the Cabinet and the Ministry of National Defense who had the great honor of holding significant sports and cultural events on the spring holiday of February in the presence of Kim Jong Un whom they wanted to see even in their dreams,” the KCNA report said. It said all participants at the event made a “firm pledge to serve the people with devotion with renewed courage and in high spirits.”

            Photos published by North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed Kim and his daughter smiling and clapping from the VIP seats, where they sat in the center between senior government and military officials. Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s sister and one of his top foreign policy officials, was seen sitting in a row behind them.

            The event marked the sixth known public appearance of Kim Ju Ae, but the first that wasn’t overtly related to her father’s nuclear arms ambitions. She was first shown on state media in November when Kim Jong Un brought her to observe a flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

            She also appeared with her father in a huge military parade in the capital, Pyongyang, last week, when troops rolled out more than a dozen ICBMs, an unprecedented number that underscored how Kim continues to expand his military capabilities despite limited resources while diplomacy remains stalled. 

            Prior to the parade, Kim Ju Ae also joined her father in a visit to troops, where she sat in the seat of honor at a banquet while being flanked by her parents and generals. She also appears alongside her father in several new postal stamps released Friday to mark the November ICBM test, which the North has described as a success.

            Analysts say Kim Ju Ae’s appearances at major events tied to the country's military is her father’s way of reminding the world he will never voluntarily surrender his nuclear weapons and missiles, which he clearly sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family’s dynastic rule. Her prominent exposure in state media could also be aimed at strengthening domestic loyalty to the Kim family and preparing for a future heredity transfer of power.

            While North Korean state media’s lofty descriptions of Kim Ju Ae, who has been called “beloved” and “respected,” have fueled speculation that she’s being primed as a future leader, South Korean Unification Minister Kwon Youngse downplayed that possibility during a parliamentary session on Wednesday.

            Kwon, Seoul’s top point man on North Korea, said Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age — believed to be 39 — and North Korea’s male-dominated power hierarchy make it questionable whether Kim Ju Ae is being groomed as his successor.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his young daughter to a soccer game celebrating the birthday of his late father, state media said Saturday, her latest in a series of public appearances that have triggered debate on whether she’s being prepped for a future leadership role.The official Korean Central News Agency said the presence of Kim and his “beloved” daughter, known as Kim Ju Ae and believed to be around 10 years old, brought “joy and excitement” to Friday’s ceremonial game between staff members from the Cabinet and the Defense Ministry.The Defense Ministry team won the match 3-1 and then beat the Cabinet staff again in a tug-of-war event, according to the report, which didn’t mention any comments made by Kim.

The Celtics were NBA champions. The Red Sox and Patriots were respectable. The Bruins got swept in the first round of the playoffs.

            And that also was when Nike was betting much of its future on Michael Jordan.

            Part of that tale will be told in the upcoming film “Air,” which Affleck directed and stars in alongside Matt Damon, Viola Davis, Jason Bateman and more. Affleck plays Nike co-founder Phil Knight, and Damon plays then-Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro — who was tasked with finding a way of saving what was then the company’s fledgling basketball division.











            Affleck did it with one key character absent: Jordan is not shown in the movie.

            “What I wanted to try to accomplish was to have Michael Jordan have the effect in the story that he has in the world, which is that obviously the vast majority of people don’t know and have never met Michael Jordan — and yet they know about him, and they know what he means and they might talk about him,” Affleck said. “So, in a way, he’s like a presence that’s felt and discussed and everybody else around him is there. But you never see his face.”

            Nike wound up signing Jordan — who had yet to play an NBA game — to a $2.5 million, five-year deal.

            It was a huge gamble.

            Spoiler alert, with apologies to the movie that gets released April 5: It worked out.

            Jordan Brand generated $4.7 billion in revenue in 2021, the Jumpman logo is iconic, Nike has become one of the world’s most powerful and recognizable companies, and Jordan won six NBA championships, became a billionaire, and now owns the Charlotte Hornets.

            And since most viewers will already know all those things, Affleck took on the challenge of telling lesser-known parts of the story.

            “The movie has to do realistic, it has to do authentic, and it has to surprise the audience,” Affleck said. “Because if what happens is something that the audience can predict, even if they like it, they go along with it, it’s ordinary, it’s boring. It’s just not what I want to do.”

            The trailer, released last week, is up to 6 million views. Affleck was at All-Star weekend to help promote Friday’s celebrity game, and ads for the film were shown on the jumbo scoreboards over the court.

            Affleck said he has met with Jordan about the movie.

            “Somebody asked me what you’re doing from Boston and making a movie about the Chicago guy,” Affleck said in an interview with a number of media outlets. “Michael Jordan sort of transcends, I think, rivalry.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814070,Bulgaria: 18 migrants found dead in truck,"The police in Bulgaria found the bodies of 18 migrants in an abandoned truck near the capital Sofia on Friday.The Bulgarian Interior Ministry said that according to initial information, the truck was carrying about 40 migrants and the survivors were taken to nearby hospitals.The country's Health Minister Assen Medzhidiev said most of the survivors were in very bad condition.""They have suffered from lack of oxygen, their clothes are wet, they are freezing, and obviously haven't eaten for days,'' Medzhidiev said.Officials said that based on initial information, the migrants originated from Afghanistan.Four Bulgarians have been detained as suspects in the case.The truck, which was transporting timber, had hidden the migrants ""under some wood"" said officials.The head of the National Investigative Service, Borislav Sarafov, explained that the migrants had illegally crossed the border via Turkey.They had hid in the woods for two days before being loaded onto the truck in southeastern Bulgaria.He confirmed that the migrants died from asphyxia and added that given the number of victims, ""this is the deadliest incident with migrants in Bulgaria.""The Balkan country of Bulgaria is located on a major route for migrants from the Middle East and Afghanistan who are seeking to enter Europe through Turkey.The country of 7 million is the poorest member of the EU.Bulgaria has erected a 259-kilometer (161-mile) barbed wire fence along its border with Turkey. However, with the help of local human traffickers, migrants continue to enter.Data from the Interior Ministry reflects that in 2022, the border police thwarted 164,000 ""irregular crossing"" attempts, compared to 55,000 in 2021.Sofia has faced mounting accusations of human rights abuses as asylum seekers reported that they have been pushed back, locked up, stripped and beaten.Bulgarian authorities have denied the accusations.In December, Austria and the Netherlands blocked the country's bid to join the Schengen border-free zone, over security and rule-of-law concerns.Bulgaria asked the EU for €2 billion ($2.1 billion) to strengthen the border fence and improve surveillance. Brussels has refused the request.The gruesome discovery of the recent bodies drew comparisons to previous cases.In 2015, at the peak of Europe's migration crisis, the bodies of 71 migrants were found piled up in the back of a poultry refrigerator truck in Austria.A Hungarian court handed three Bulgarians and an Afghan national life prison sentences over the case.In 2019,  39 Vietnamese migrants were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain shortly after it had crossed over from mainland Europe.In recent years, several such cases have been reported in Croatia, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.ns/wd (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814076,AP source: Commanders finalizing hire of Bieniemy as OC,"Eric Bieniemy is finalizing terms of a deal to become the Washington Commanders' offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because the deal was not yet completed. It’s expected to be done Saturday.

            Bieniemy, a two-time Super Bowl-winning assistant with Kansas City, now gets the chance to show what he can do without Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes.











            Bieniemy, who turns 54 in August, emerged from a pool of more than a half-dozen candidates as Washington's choice for the job following the Chiefs' second championship in his five seasons as their offensive coordinator. The longtime NFL assistant has interviewed for numerous head coaching jobs, but Reid calling plays for an offense featuring a two-time MVP in Mahomes clouded Bieniemy's stock.

            The decisions by teams not to hire Bieniemy, who is Black, as a head coach have been an ongoing talking point for critics of the NFL's minority hiring practices.

            Bieniemy will get the chance to call plays and run every aspect of Washington's offense under Ron Rivera, a defensive-minded coach and former linebacker who's going into his fourth season in charge of the team's football operations.

            Bieniemy inherits second-year quarterback Sam Howell, who goes into spring as the starter, and an offense that includes running backs Brian Robinson Jr. and Antonio Gibson and top receiver Terry McLaurin.

            A running back for nine seasons in the 1990s, Bieniemy has coached at the college and pro levels. He coached running backs with Kansas City for five years before being promoted to offensive coordinator and before that worked at the University of Colorado and for the Minnesota Vikings as a position coach.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814078,Homa feeling at home and leads at Riviera as Tiger makes cut,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Max Homa in the lead at his hometown PGA Tour event used to give him chills. Now he's playing so well it almost feels normal.

            Homa, a winner last month down the coast at Torrey Pines, ran off three birdies around the turn at Riviera and tossed in a few big par saves Friday for a 3-under 68, giving him a one-shot lead over Jon Rahm, Keith Mitchell and Lee Hodges at the Genesis Invitational.

            Tiger Woods will be part of the weekend, even with a sloppy finish and more attention over a juvenile prank than a putter that went cold. Woods finished with three bogeys over his last four holes for a 74.











            He was at 1-over 143, leaving him 11 shots behind Homa, but certain to make the cut when the second round is completed Saturday morning. For the second straight day, darkness kept the round from finishing.

            Woods, playing elite competition for the first time since the British Open last summer, apologized if anyone was offended by him jokingly slipping a tampon into the hand of Justin Thomas on Thursday after Woods outdrove him by about 10 yards.

            “It was supposed to be all fun and games and obviously it hasn’t turned out that way,” Woods said.

            Homa and Rahm had their own brand of fun on a crisp afternoon off Sunset Boulevard.

            Homa hit wedge to 4 feet to a pin tucked behind the bunker for a birdie on No. 9, holed a 15-foot birdie on the 10th and then chipped beautifully to a back right pin for a third straight birdie on the par-5 11th.

            He also saved par from a plugged lie in the bunker and made an 18-foot par putt on the 16th. His round ended with trouble off the tee that led to bogey, but he had no complaints at 11-under 131 and his name atop the leaderboard.

            He already has won twice this season, including last month down the coast at Torrey Pines. When he won this tournament two years ago — the one he used to attend as a kid who grew up 30 miles away — he said, “I don't know if I could ever do anything cooler in golf than this.”

            Playing good every week is pretty cool.

            “I kind of feel like I should be doing this when I’m playing well, and I am playing well,” Homa said. “Yeah, it’s exciting — 36-hole leads are awesome. Like I said, there’s a long way to go, but regardless, I can rest on the fact I’m playing great golf and I’m just going to try and do that for two more days.”

            Rahm is playing even better. He has nine consecutive top 10s dating to September, four of those victories, and he is close to returning to No. 1 in the world.

            Even the best need a break every now and then, and Rahm got a big one Friday evening. He went with a 5-wood from 270 yards on the par-5 17th and cooked it, sailing the green toward the back grandstands. The ball smacked off the base of the bleachers, tumbled along the edge of a bunker and settled just over 3 feet away for an eagle. 

            That capped off a stretch of playing five holes in 5-under par that put the Spaniard right into the mix going into the weekend.

            “Obviously, I got very fortunate to get that bounce not only to go on the green, but to have basically 3 feet straight up the hill,” Rahm said. “That’s arguably the best bounce I’ve seen in person my whole golf career and it would be hard to beat in the future.”

            He's seen plenty of great bounces before on various video compilations, and he started reciting some of the bizarre ones, many on the European tour. He's just never the star of those shows, and so maybe he'll be in the next video.

            “I hope it's in it,” he said. “If anything beats that, I'd be surprised.”

            Mitchell played in the morning, making five birdies to offset a few mistakes. He was in contention two weeks ago at Pebble Beach.

            Collin Morikawa (68) was two shots behind, with Patrick Cantlay (67) another shot back. Both grew up some 20 miles from Riviera.

            Rory McIlroy had a 69 and was four back.

            The stars are out in Los Angeles, part of that due to Riviera, part of that due to the strongest field of the year competing for a $20 million purse. 

            Woods felt his 74 was as high as it could have been because of his putting, but at least he's around for the weekend. So his Xander Schauffele, who looked certain to miss the cut until his shot from 173 yards flew straight into the cup on the 17th for an eagle. He made it on the number.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814092,"Parise scores late, Nelson nets 2 as Islanders edge Penguins","NEW YORK (AP) — Zach Parise scored the tiebreaker late in the third period and Brock Nelson added two goals as the New York Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-4 on Friday night.

            Anders Lee had two goals and an assist, Ilya Sorokin finished with 40 saves and the Islanders snapped a three-game skid that included two overtime losses. Mathew Barzal added two assists.

            “We all look at the standings, we knew the importance heading into the game,” Parise said. “We got teams that are climbing behind us with games in hand, we got teams we are trying to catch, there is just not a lot of room for error.”











            Rickard Rakell scored twice and Sidney Crosby had a goal and an assist as the Penguins lost for the second time in three games. Casey DeSmith made 23 saves.

            Kyle Palmieri bumped Penguins defender Brian Dumoulin off the puck and Nelson picked up the loose puck before feeding a darting Parise, who gave the Islanders a 5-4 edge at 17:17 of the third. With the win, the Islanders moved past the Washington Capitals in the wild-card standings and temporarily secure the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

            “To get that win against a team we are hunting down (in the playoff race) is huge,” Nelson said. ""It’s a big two points, to get that in regulation is nice. The road doesn’t get any easier.”

            The Islanders knotted the game at 4 when Nelson converted a one-time shot on the power play for his second of the game and team-leading 24th of the season at 5:01 of the third period. Bo Horvat won the offensive zone faceoff cleanly and Noah Dobson set up Nelson. 

            Nelson pulled the Islanders to within one goal at 14:25 of the second period and extended his point streak to a career-best 12 games. Mayfield’s long outlet pass sprung Nelson into the offensive zone and he completed a wraparound to cut the Penguins’ lead to 3-2.

            Pittsburgh briefly reclaimed a two-goal edge at 18:57 of the second as Rakell scored his second of the game. Crosby corralled a loose puck near the top of the crease and set up Rakell for a simple one-time finish.

            “I thought for the majority of the night our team was terrific,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “I felt we were playing with the right intentions out there and unfortunately we couldn’t hold the lead.”

            The Islanders trimmed their deficit to one for the second time to cap the middle period. Lee scored his second of the game as he inadvertently deflected Barzal’s shot past DeSmith.

            Crosby opened the scoring at the 12-minute mark of the first period with his 25th of the season. The Penguins' captain found the puck under the Islanders goaltender and pushed it across the goal line.

            Lee responded with a quirky goal at 13:56 of the first to even the score at 1. DeSmith stopped Lee’s initial attempt, but the Islanders captain located the puck on top of the Penguins goaltender and whacked it in. Marcus Pettersson’s turnover behind the net led to the Islanders scoring opportunity.

            The Penguins scored twice in a span of 1:42 early in the second period to gain a 3-1 advantage.

            Rakell picked up his 20th of the season and broke a 1-all tie at 3:53 of the middle frame. Jake Guentzel slid a pass between the legs of Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield and Rakell redirected the puck past Sorokin.

            Zucker extended Pittsburgh’s advantage to two goals when he redirected Pierre-Olivier Joseph’s shot at 5:35.

            “We turned the puck over too many times in the neutral zone in the first 40 minutes,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “We did a better job of getting it in deep and that led to a better forecheck.""

            NOTES: Penguins goalie Tristan Jarry skated prior to Friday’s game against the Islanders and is nearing a return. He has been sidelined with an upper-body injury since a 2-1 overtime loss against the New Jersey Devils on Jan. 22. … Crosby became the third player in NHL history to record 130 career points against the Islanders, joining Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814094,No hurt feelings: NBA changes format for All-Star Draft,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The “last pick” of Sunday night's All-Star Draft will be a starter.

            The NBA has changed the format of Sunday’s draft, and LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo — the captains — will make their picks from the pool of reserve players first.

            They’ll then choose their starting lineups, from the pool of eight other starters. The switch will ensure that no player will have to deal with the stigma of being picked last, even though that hasn’t been too much of an issue in the past.











            This is the sixth year of the format where captains — determined by fan voting — choose their own All-Star rosters, but the first year in which those captains will do so on game night and basically right in front of the other All-Stars.

            The 2018 draft was not shown publicly. The 2019 draft had Bradley Beal as the last pick among reserves, not including Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki — who were added to the game by Commissioner Adam Silver to commemorate their final seasons. (Nowitzki wound up being the last pick.)

            In 2020, Domantas Sabonis, then of Indiana, was the last pick. In 2021, Rudy Gobert, then of Utah, was the last reserve left on the board. And last year, the final pick was James Harden — after Kevin Durant took Gobert, and didn’t choose his former Brooklyn teammate in a comical scene.

            RISING STARS

            
                New Orleans guard Jose Alvarado’s drifting 3-pointer clinched a 25-20 win for Team Pau (Gasol) over Team Joakim (Noah) in the title game of the Rising Stars event Friday at All-Star weekend.

            Alvarado, who was named the Most Valuable Player, had five points in the title game.

            The win capped a memorable day for Gasol, who was named a Basketball Hall of Fame finalist earlier Friday.

            “I’m going out on top. It may be one and done for me,” Gasol said of his coaching debut.

            New York’s Quentin Grimes scored 14 points in the final but was wrapped up — literally held at times — by Alvarado down the stretch.

            “I didn’t know you could do that in the Rising Stars game. I should have alerted the refs to call a technical or something,” Grimes said. “It was all fun but I was going for the win tonight.”

            Said Alvarado: “It might not have been (legal), but he was doing good.""

            The four teams, comprised of 21 first- and second-year NBA players along with seven G League players, competed in semifinals games to a target score of 40.

            Alvarado’s 13 points helped Team Pau top Team Deron (Williams) in the first game 40-27, despite an array of spectacular dunks by Trey Murphy III.

            In the second semifinal, Grimes scored 13 points including the winning 3 to power Team Joakim over Team Jason (Terry), composed of the G Leaguers. Mac McClung, who is competing in Saturday’s Dunk Contest, nearly stole the show with 10 points in the comeback bid but missed a jam on his last attempt.

            CELEBRITY GAME

            Team Dwyane rallied in the fourth quarter to beat Team Ryan 81-78 in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night. Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith and Basketball Hall of Fame finalist Dwyane Wade served as honorary captains of the celebrity teams.

            Seattle Seahawks receiver DK Metcalf paced Team Dwyane with 20 points and 10 rebounds — but he'll be best remembered for an array of dunks. Actor Everett Osbourne led Team Ryan with 23 points, 12 rebounds and three assists. Metcalf was named the game’s MVP.

            Each celebrity team included a WNBA All-Star. Phoenix Mercury guard Diamond DeShields played for Team Ryan. Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale played for Team Dwyane. Other notable athletes participating included former NFL player Calvin Johnson and former MLB player Albert Pujols.

            Wade added former NBA player Carlos Boozer to his team in the second half. Smith countered by adding former NBA player Richard Jefferson. Jefferson served as part of the officiating crew during the first half; he also worked as an official for one quarter of a Summer League game in Las Vegas last year.

            Between the game, and a 3-point shootout between Smith and Wade, $142,000 was raised for 5 for the Fight, a charitable foundation devoted to funding cancer research.

            Smith said the funds raised on Friday would benefit the Huntsman Cancer Institute on the University of Utah campus.

            JABARI ON JORDAN

            Houston’s Jabari Smith Jr. was asked if Michael Jordan — who turned 60 on Friday — could compete if they were were to play 1-on-1 now.

            Smith was pretty sure Jordan wouldn’t be getting buckets.

            “He’s not beating me right now. If a 60-year-old is hooping on me, I need to hang it up,” Smith said. He then added, “Happy Birthday, MJ!”

            SHORT STUFF

            Alvarado is listed at 6 feet, which might be a tiny bit generous.

            He doesn’t mind.

            When told before Friday’s Rising Stars event that he was a hero for the undersized, Alvarado had a message for others who consider themselves vertically challenged.

            “Hey short people, I’m just like y’all. We got a lot of heart,” Alvarado said. “I see lots of other little guys tagging me on Instagram. I see your love. Keep being yourself, don’t try to be nobody else.”

            Alvarado admitted that the highlights of him hiding behind bigger players to get steals in the backcourt is making it tougher to surprise opponents.

            “Everybody seen those clips. Now, so I just got to find another way, but I’m crafty,” he said.

            WELCOME MOMENT

            Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said the season has been like a dream. He used to wear Derrick Rose's shoes constantly when he was younger and then found himself guarding D-Rose in Madison Square Garden.

            “So wild,” Williams said before the Rising Stars games. “Going up against people that I watched on TV is definitely kind of surreal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814123,"Broad and Bazball roll over the Kiwis on day 3, 1st test","MOUNT MAUNGANUI, New Zealand (AP) — Stuart Broad and Bazball rolled over New Zealand on the third day of the first day-night cricket test Saturday, leaving England five wickets from its 10th win in 11 test matches.

            Rapid half centuries by Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Foakes allowed England to speed along at more than five runs per over to 374 in its second innings, an overall lead of 393.

            Stuart Broad then clean bowled Devon Conway (12), Kane Williamson (0), Tom Latham (15) and first innings century-maker Tom Blundell (1) to take out the batters who might have been able to anchor New Zealand’s highest successful fourth-innings run chase in tests and the sixth highest of all time.











            When Blundell was out New Zealand was 28-5 and it had improved a little by stumps when it was 63-5, still 330 behind. Daryl Mitchell, who was 13, and Michael Bracewell, who was 25, saw out the last 10 overs of the day.

            Broad’s four wickets lifted his tally of test wickets in partnership with James Anderson to 1,004, surpassing the Australian combination of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne (1,001), who previously were the most prolific wicket-taking pair in tests.

            “I feel very blessed that I was born in the same era as (Anderson) so that I could bowl at the other end to him,” Broad said. “I felt like it was the perfect dryness of pitch today for my kind of bowling. I could slam the ball into the pitch but it was still skidding and hitting the stumps.”

            On a day seething with action, Root, Brook and Foakes carried England along at one-day international pace.

            Root made 57 from 62 balls, Brook 54 from 41, Foakes 51 from 80 and there were also important contributions from Ollie Pope (49 from 46), Ben Stokes (31 from 33) and Ollie Robinson (39 from 48) which showed why the innings progressed at such irresistible pace.

            At times it was impossible to look without missing an important piece of the action, so densely packed were the highlights.

            The fearlessness which has become the heart of England’s approach was always on show. When batting, England shows no deference to the time of day, the state of the match or the efforts of the bowling team. The object always was to dominate.

            When England bowled, as Broad again demonstrated under the floodlights which caused the ball to swing, there was an effort to make every ball a wicket ball. He brought the ball back at pace and late to both the left- and right-handers.

            New Zealand simply couldn’t stand the force of the Bazball doctrine. It had done well on the second day with the help of Blundell’s century to come within 19 runs of England’s first innings of 325-9 declared, the declaration having come midway through the last session on the first day.

            England already had begun to remove the props of New Zealand’s confidence when it reached 79-2 before stumps on Day 2. And when Pope, Root and Brook helped England score 158 runs in the first session on Saturday, it was clear the match rapidly was escaping New Zealand.

            Any hopes New Zealand might have had of battling through the final session to launch its run chase in full on the fourth day began to fade when Broad swung the ball back through Conway’s usually solid defense to claim his valuable wicket in the fourth over.

Daryl Mitchell, who was 13, and Michael Bracewell, who was 25, saw out the last 10 overs of the day.Broad’s four wickets lifted his tally of test wickets in partnership with James Anderson to 1,004, surpassing the Australian combination of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne (1,001), who previously were the most prolific wicket-taking pair in tests.“I feel very blessed that I was born in the same era as (Anderson) so that I could bowl at the other end to him,” Broad said. “I felt like it was the perfect dryness of pitch today for my kind of bowling. I could slam the ball into the pitch but it was still skidding and hitting the stumps.”On a day seething with action, Root, Brook and Foakes carried England along at one-day international pace.Root made 57 from 62 balls, Brook 54 from 41, Foakes 51 from 80 and there were also important contributions from Ollie Pope (49 from 46), Ben Stokes (31 from 33) and Ollie Robinson (39 from 48) which showed why the innings progressed at such irresistible pace.At times it was impossible to look without missing an important piece of the action, so densely packed were the highlights.The fearlessness which has become the heart of England’s approach was always on show. When batting, England shows no deference to the time of day, the state of the match or the efforts of the bowling team. The object always was to dominate.When England bowled, as Broad again demonstrated under the floodlights which caused the ball to swing, there was an effort to make every ball a wicket ball. He brought the ball back at pace and late to both the left- and right-handers.New Zealand simply couldn’t stand the force of the Bazball doctrine. It had done well on the second day with the help of Blundell’s century to come within 19 runs of England’s first innings of 325-9 declared, the declaration having come midway through the last session on the first day.England already had begun to remove the props of New Zealand’s confidence when it reached 79-2 before stumps on Day 2. And when Pope, Root and Brook helped England score 158 runs in the first session on Saturday, it was clear the match rapidly was escaping New Zealand.Any hopes New Zealand might have had of battling through the final session to launch its run chase in full on the fourth day began to fade when Broad swung the ball back through Conway’s usually solid defense to claim his valuable wicket in the fourth over.Then Williamson and Latham followed in the space of 18 balls and when Nicholls was caught by Foakes off Robinson and Blundell was bowled by Broad, New Zealand’s task had become hopeless.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814135,Boldy's shootout score sends Wild to 2-1 win over Stars,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Matt Boldy scored in the shootout and Filip Gustavsson turned back the tying attempt to help the Minnesota Wild to a 2-1 win over the Dallas Stars on Friday night.

            After the Stars' Jason Robertson and the Wild's Frederick Gaudreau traded shootout scores, Boldy beat Jake Oettinger with a backhand shot and Gustavsson stopped Wyatt Johnson's attempt to seal the win.

            “Obviously it’s nice to get rewarded positively in a game like that against a team like that,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “To play the way that we played defensively, but the way that we worked, was again positive.”











            Gustavsson also stopped Dallas' Joe Pavelski and Tyler Seguin in the shootout to set up Boldy's chance to score the go-ahead tally.

            Minnesota went to overtime for the third time in four games. The Wild have not won in regulation in 12 games.

            Johnson had a good look at an open net with just seconds left in overtime, but missed wide, sending the game to a shootout.

            Dallas was 0 for 4 on the power play Friday and has gone a combined 0 for 18 with the man advantage over the last four games.

            “We battled hard against a real desperate team,” Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. ""That team needs to win that game. I thought we had lots of chances and fought back, got behind, so a lot of good stuff.”

            Mats Zuccarello scored for Minnesota in regulation. He snapped the scoreless struggle with his 20th goal of the season, scoring on the power play. Boldy found Zuccarello cutting to the net, and he beat Oettinger, giving the Wild the lead with 13:23 left in the third period.

            Stars captain Jamie Benn scored the tying goal four minutes later. Benn took a pass from Johnson and fired at a tough angle past Gustavsson with 9:36 remaining. It was Benn's third goal in the last four games and his 22nd of the season.

            Oettinger, from Lakeville, Minnesota, made 31 stops in net before the shootout, including a big save on Boldy in overtime.

            “It felt like a playoff game. They’re a great team over there,” Oettinger said. ""It’s tight out there. I had the chance to end the game in the shootout and I didn’t do it.”

            Gustavsson finished with 29 saves. One of his biggest stops came early in the third when he robbed Radek Faksa from close range. He also made a key save early in overtime after a Minnesota turnover led to a breakaway for Dallas.

            “I love to win. It’s way more fun than losing. I’m very happy,” Gustavsson said. “Tomorrow’s a new day and you’re no better than your last game.”

            NOTES: Following Friday’s game, the Wild completed a three-team trade with St. Louis and Toronto that netted Minnesota a fourth-round draft pick in 2025. The Wild originally acquired center Ryan O’Reilly from St. Louis in exchange for Josh Pillar and then traded O’Reilly to the Maple Leafs for the draft pick. ... The Wild entered Friday’s game 10 points back in the Central of division-leading Dallas. The Stars won two of the first three meetings against the Wild. ... Minnesota’s penalty kill continued to shine in the win. The Wild killed off all four penalties, extending a streak of 18 consecutive short-hand situations killed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814136,Australia's Warner ruled out of 2nd test with concussion,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Australia opener David Warner has been ruled out of the second cricket test against India after sustaining a concussion while batting in the first innings. 

            Warner was struck on the helmet by a sharp bouncer from pace bowler Mohammed Siraj in the 10th over on Friday. He was on six not out off 30 balls at that time and continued to bat. He was eventually dismissed for 15 after combining with Usman Khawaja in a 50-run opening stand. 

            Warner didn’t field during the Indian innings late on Day 1 and Cricket Australia announced before the scheduled restart Saturday that the veteran opener would take no further part in the test. Matt Renshaw was called into the XI as a concussion substitute. 











            “Warner will now follow the graduated return to sport protocols ahead of the third test in Indore in line with Cricket Australia guidelines,” the Australian team said in a statement.

            Left-handed Renshaw, who was dropped after Australia's heavy loss in the first test last week in Nagpur, will open the batting in the second innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814147,Is this Hong Kong's answer to Tucker Carlson?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When asked how he would describe himself, Hong Kong author, political commentator, and Youtuber Chip Tsao (陶傑) had a comparison on the tip of his tongue.“Tucker … Yes, Tucker Carlson, which is a bit provocative, but somehow speaks the truth,” he said, along with another comparison: Piers Morgan.There are a couple of likely characterizations that may come into readers’ minds when they hear these names, such as racism, misogyny, and popularism. And they could be forgiven for thinking that, as he has been accused of all these things.Perhaps his most prominent controversy came in 2009 when he wrote an article about the Sino-Philippine dispute over islands in the South China Sea, advising Filipinos, ""As a nation of servants, you don't flex your muscles at your master, from whom you earn most of your bread and butter.""He has also been accused of mocking the #metoo movement, of looking down on the Chinese, and glorifying British culture. This is possibly due to his education at the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics, and his great admiration for Winston Churchill.Despite all that, it is hard to agree with Tsao’s self-comparison with Tucker Carlson. Yes, the controversy surrounding his comments about Filipinos was certainly warranted, and there is no doubt that calling Filipinos slaves and Chinese masters veers past the realm of satire and into the realm of racial prejudice, even bigotry.Tsao's 2009 article, however, does not represent a repeated pattern of racist output, a la Carlson, who promotes extreme-right-wing conspiracy theories and white supremacist narratives nearly daily on his Fox News TV slot. As Tsao described his views on a range of prescient international issues, even those who may not agree with him would likely recognize that he approaches issues with a genuine desire to stoke meaningful debate.“I’m a liberal, but my thoughts and feelings are deeply anchored in the soil of common sense,” he told Taiwan News in an exclusive interview. “I was born in Hong Kong, and brought up as a Hong Kong Chinese. I was educated in an Anglo-Saxon world, I could read English literature, so I am a cultural fence-sitter,” Tsao said. “I don’t mind labeling and name-calling, I am used to it.”“I try to strike a balance between East and Western cultures and liberalism and conservatism,” Tsao said, and while that may lead to some branding him as a “right-winger,” he doesn’t see himself as one.He says that through his YouTube channel, he has been taking classical liberal values of the 19th century and translating them into his own language and culture, providing a lone voice of reason in an age of self-censorship.The Beijing-backed National Security law passed in Hong Kong in 2020 has caused many publishers, social commentators, journalists, and outspoken government critics to leave Hong Kong, himself included. He is currently in Taiwan, producing content here.Tsao does not feel sorry for himself, though, nor for others who have chosen self-exile to avoid political crackdowns. He says that those who fled Hong Kong might benefit from better integrating into the societies they have chosen to leave for, like one of his intellectual inspirations, Winston Churchill.During the 1930s, Churchill was out of political favor, and spent much of his time attempting to influence U.K. politics from the sidelines, via newspaper and magazine columns. Notably, his repeated warnings against the Nazi threat went unheeded, until his ultimate vindication when the failure of appeasement policies resulted in his return to power, wartime prime ministership, and eventual recognition as one of history’s great statesmen.“These are the stories that have been inspiring me for years,” Tsao said. “There are more lessons to learn while you are in exile in a foreign country, so that one day when you go back to Hong Kong, you will be a different person.”“Who knows, one day you may go back to Hong Kong and it will be a democratized place, and then things will change, and then you can be a leader,” he said.Perhaps this is the future Tsao hopes for himself, making a triumphant return to Hong Kong when the time is right, and there is room for his political ideas. Until then, he does appear to be following in Churchill’s footsteps, voraciously producing media content (the night before our interview he had livestreamed from mid-evening to 3am), and getting his voice out there however he can.Addressing current concerns, Tsao said that he believes the Chinese balloon that drifted over the U.S. in early February, causing a major diplomatic upset, was likely played up by the U.S., who in his words “turned a passive (act) into an active one.”Tsao said this is a critical time for China to reengage with the global economy and other international actors as it comes out of three years of pandemic setbacks, recent U.S. semiconductor controls, and economic decline. He said that intentionally invading U.S. airspace is not rational behavior.“(The incident) is more likely to be a mistake in the Chinese bureaucracy or a technical problem. After all, Chinese manufacturing is not so reliable,” Tsao quipped.Tsao said the U.S. has “known for a long time” about Chinese balloons, and that Biden’s decision to shoot it down where he did, allowing it time to reach a place where damage from debris could be avoided, suggests it wasn’t an immediate threat, and that other factors were at play.The Biden administration’s public release of photos showing the destroyed balloon will help the Democrats in the upcoming 2024 election, according to Tsao, while creating conditions favorable to a McCarthy trip to Taiwan.Tsao also pointed out that Biden’s repeated commitments to defend Taiwan suggest U.S. strategic ambiguity has moved toward a “state of preparing for war.”Europe is largely led by Germany and France, according to Tsao, both of which have close trade relations with China. “China knows that if it can control Germany, it can control most of Europe,” he said.As for Taiwan, Tsao says that European countries are taking advantage of “tourist diplomacy,” referencing the delegations from Germany, France, and other countries that have recently visited Taiwan. The bilateral negotiations for trade and investment agreements that have come out of these trips are simply down to material interests, said Tsao.“It’s quite hard to imagine that Europe would just abandon the whole Chinese market overnight and embrace Taiwan just because of political and moral beliefs,” he said.Tsao said that the visits from foreign delegations, including Nancy Pelosi’s in August 2022, will not make the cross-strait situation less dangerous. He said what really puts Taiwan at greater risk is its approach to cross-strait negotiations.Tsao posed the question, if war were to break out in Taiwan over the next few years, “how could European capital be expected to invest in Taiwan? This world is realistic and profit-oriented.”There won’t be a war with China before the end of 2024 as China waits to see the results of the year’s presidential election, Tsao said. If the Kuomintang gains power in 2024, Tsao said “the CCP believes that there is hope for peace talks.”Regardless, Tsao believes that ""Taiwan's own military strength"" and ""relations with the United States"" are the key to Taiwan's future.KMT Vice Chairman Andrew Hisa’s recent trip to China to meet with CCP officials is not likely to have any impact on cross-strait relations, Tsao said. “Discussions or no discussions, there’s no difference.”In Tsao’s view, Hsia’s visit only serves as a political signal to the undecided Taiwan voters that, unlike Tsai Ing-wen, the KMT is capable of having discussions with China, thus strengthening the party’s position in the upcoming election.Regardless, Tsao believes that for Taiwan, it does not matter who is in power. ""Even if (relatively pro-China former Taiwan President) Ma Ying-jeou came to power now, it would not be more peaceful than Tsai Ing-wen,"" he said.“It doesn’t matter if you don’t mention Taiwan independence, if you only talk about the 1992 Consensus, you only mention one China, and you don’t mention China in different forms. China can still say that you have Taiwanese independence, and if it feels confident, it can still beat you,” Tsao said. “So, what is important, is Taiwan’s strength.”",2023/02/18,1303,Opinion

            UCLA set the tone for the game on the boards, out-rebounding Cal 48-28 and pulling down 20 caroms off the offensive glass, and it helped the Bruins to a 15-point lead at intermission, 35-20. 

            The Golden Bears got the deficit into single digits briefly early in the third quarter after a Karisma Ortiz jumper made it 42-33, but Emily Bessoir answered with a jumper and Gina Conti hit a 3 to get the Bruins back into a double-digit lead they maintained the rest of the way. 











            Jones hit 7-of-12 shots from the field and was 2-of-2 from the line to lead UCLA (21-6, 10-5 Pac-12). Charisma Osborne posted a double-double, scoring 12 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Bessoir had 10 points and eight rebounds. 

            Jayda Curry finished with 15 points to lead Cal (12-14, 3-12). Kemery Martin and Leilani McIntosh each had 14 points.

            Cate Reese added 16 points for the Wildcats (20-6, 10-5). Helena Pueyo had 12 points, including four free throws in the final 90 seconds.

            “I started off on fire,” Pellington said. “I feel like when I saw the first one go in, the second one go in, the third one go in. ... It just kept going and going and going. I also wanted to make sure that I was making sure that I was taking shots that made sense in the flow of the game.”











            Arizona broke the Utes’ seven-game winning streak and avenged an 80-79 loss in Salt Lake City a month ago.

            Allison Pili scored 26 points, Jenna Johnson had 19 and Gianna Kneepkens 13 for the Utes (22-3, 12-3), who entered with the highest ranking in program history. 

            “To lose it with 1.5 seconds left there on free throws, that was tough to swallow” Arizona coach Adia Barnes said of the game in Salt Lake City. “We really were focused at home and we need these wins. Everybody needs these wins. We're all chasing the top four in the Pac-12 tournament. We're playing for postseason standings.”

            Pellington had 23 points in the first half when she made all 10 field goal attempts. She made her first shot in the second half before missing.

            Pellington finished 13 of 18 with eight rebounds and five steals.

            “This game will help us in a lot of ways,"" Barnes said. ""Came out and battled against a very good Utah team. We’re starting to peak at the right time.”

            Utah trimmed a 10-point deficit to 76-72 on Pili’s three-point play with 1:08 remaining before Madi Conner made two free throws for a 78-72 lead with 48.4 seconds remaining after Utah was called for an intentional foul. The Utes missed a 3-pointer on their next possession and were 4 of 19 from distance.

            “That’s what it came down to,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “We missed shots. That’s just how the game goes sometimes. This game was not a must-win. Our backs were not against the wall. It was an incredibly physical game. Our offense is predicated on ball movement and player movement. It was hard to do. We couldn’t even cut.""

            Utah, sixth in Division I in scoring, was held 12.7 points below its average. Arizona beat its fourth ranked team this season after wins over Baylor, Oregon and UCLA.

            AN INCH OF SEPARATION

            Utah beat the Wildcats on Jan. 15 when the lead changed hands twice in the final two seconds. Paris Clark’s steal and layup gave Arizona a 79-78 lead. After a Utah timeout, Pili was fouled after catching a long pass and made two free throws with one second left.

            HOME CROWD

            The Wildcats drew 8,238, the second-largest this season after drawing 9,868 against Stanford last Friday. The largest crowd the Utes had seen this season was 6,289 at Oregon.

            BIG PICTURE

            Utah: The Utes’ only other losses are to ranked Pac-12 teams No. 3 Stanford and No. 21 Colorado. With a strong finish, they could capture one of eight host sites in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament, which would be another program first.

            Arizona: The Wildcats can bank on their third consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament, and the victory over the Utes helps make the journey one step easier.

            Grossman's deal, which could be worth as much as $5 million, came three days before Monday's full-squad reporting date. His base salary will be $2 million and he could earn as much as $3 million more in incentives. 

            The Rangers made room on their 40-man roster by placing left-handed reliever Brett Martin on the 60-day injured list. Martin had left shoulder surgery Jan. 18, and is expected to miss most of the 2023 season. 











            Grossman hit .209 with seven home runs and 45 RBIs over 129 games combined last season with Detroit and Atlanta, and hit .320 against left-handed pitchers. He drew walks in nearly 12% of his at-bats, among the best rates in the majors for players with at least 450 plate appearances. 

            The 33-year-old Grossman has a career .245 batting average with 80 homers and 366 RBIs in 1,011 games with Houston (2013-15), Minnesota (2016-18), Oakland (2019-20), Detroit (2021-22), and Atlanta.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814174,"Kings overcome goalie's match penalty, beat rival Ducks 6-3","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Viktor Arvidsson scored two goals, Kevin Fiala had a goal and two assists, and Adrian Kempe scored his eighth goal in four games during the Los Angeles Kings' 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Friday night in a feisty edition of the Freeway Faceoff.

            Pheonix Copley made 16 saves before the Kings’ unlikely No. 1 goalie got a match penalty in the final minute of the second period for throwing punches with his blocker during a big brawl. Copley also skated out to accept John Gibson’s invitation for a center-ice goalie fight, but linesmen intervened first.

            “They were going at (Copley) a couple of times earlier in the game, so he had probably just had enough,” said Kings defenseman Drew Doughty, who had two assists. “I would have loved for the linesmen to just let ’em go, but Cop has been playing great for us, and we don’t need him getting injured.”











            Captain Anze Kopitar had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles, which scored three times on the power play. Blake Lizotte also scored and Jonathan Quick made eight saves after relieving Copley for the Kings, who have won three straight out of the All-Star break while scoring at least five goals in three consecutive games for the first time since 2009.

            “You get excited to play these games,” Kempe said. “Every game, there's something on the line. We know we have to win these types of games for sure. We've got to keep playing the way we've been playing.”

            The Southern California rivals separated by 30 miles of traffic engaged in a heated brawl in the final minute of the second period, leading to Copley's match penalty for whaling on Frank Vatrano during the scrum.

            Gibson then skated to center ice and slapped his stick to get the attention of Copley, who threw off his mask and skated out to tangle before getting stopped by a linesman.

            The scrap was another intriguing chapter in the improbable rise of Copley, the 31-year-old native of North Pole, Alaska, who seized Los Angeles’ No. 1 job after Quick and Cal Petersen faltered early this season.

            “He was given an opportunity, and he made good on it,” Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said. “You can't write a better script than that.”

            Gibson stopped 35 shots and Kevin Shattenkirk scored goals in back-to-back games for the first time in nearly two years for the last-place Ducks. Mason McTavish and Vatrano scored in the third period for Anaheim, which has yielded 26 goals during a four-game losing streak following a two-week stretch of solid play.

            Lizotte opened the scoring by ending his 19-game goal drought, but Shattenkirk evened it with a long shot past a screen. The veteran defenseman ended his 60-game goal drought Wednesday against Buffalo.

            Kempe got his 28th goal on a power play. The Swede has goals in four consecutive games, highlighted by his four-goal performance against Pittsburgh last weekend.

            McTavish scored his 12th goal with 2:09 left in the Anaheim power play resulting from the brawl, but the Kings reclaimed a two-goal lead on Kopitar's power-play goal through traffic.

            Vatrano scored with 6:50 to play after Quick stopped his first two attempts from the slot, but Arvidsson walked in from the corner and scored on a power play 2:20 later. Fiala added an empty-net goal to cap his latest standout effort for his new team.

            Kings forward Gabriel Vilardi returned from a 10-game absence since mid-January due to an undisclosed injury.

Huang wrote, ""I just passed by this and it felt so sad that they had to create such a 'sidewalk' to protect themselves.""Huang said Taiwan has recently been labeled a ""hell for pedestrians,"" and added that pedestrians' right of way should be taken seriously. He claimed that people encounter difficulties traversing Taiwan's streets, but have become resigned to the situation.He argued that improving pedestrian zones would not only be good to attract tourists, but is essential for the ""daily life of a civilized city.""Based on the photo, SET News identified the area as Wenzhong Street in Kaohsiung City's Fengshan District. Because there is no sidewalk on the main road, school children hold up a rope to form their own ""moving sidewalk,"" while guarding the outer perimeter.A Taiwanese Facebook page has labeled Taiwan as a ""living hell for pedestrians,"" drawing attention from international media such as CNN, which, in December last year, claimed Taiwan suffers from ""battlefield-like"" traffic conditions. There are approximately 400 traffic accidents in Taiwan that result in the death of pedestrians every year, while in New Taipei City alone, there were 8,000 traffic accidents involving pedestrians, according to the New Taipei City Police Department.",2023/02/18,2694,Society

            Chris Kreider scored twice, Mika Zibanejad added a goal and Igor Shesterkin made 25 saves as the Rangers dug out of a 4-1 hole. They are 14-2-2 in their last 18 and 33-14-8 overall.

            “I like the way we played,” Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said. “We were down 4-1 and I thought the game was far from over, we still have 40 minutes. It’s the NHL, it’s not like the game was going to be over and we battled hard and found a way.”











            Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Tyson Barrie, Derek Ryan and Leon Draisaitl scored for Edmonton, and Jack Campbell stopped 34 shots. The Oilers have lost three straight to fall to 30-19-7. They have lost seven straight games that have gone to extra time.

            “It was disappointing that we didn’t find the second point tonight,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft. said.

            The Oilers got off to a terrific start, taking a 3-0 lead 12:30 into the first period.

            On the power play, Zach Hyman sent a shot off the post and Nugent-Hopkins deposited his 27th of the season off a mad scramble in front at 7:52.

            With an assist on the play, Connor McDavid picked up his 100th point of the season in his 56th game. It’s the sixth time in his career that he has hit triple digits.

            At the 12:11 mark, a big rebound came out to Barrie, who jumped into the play to score his eighth of the season. Nineteen seconds later, Ryan beat Shesterkin with a glove-side snipe for his 10th.

            New York got one back just over a minute after on the power play as a crisp four-way passing play culminated in Kreider tapping one in past Campbell from the doorstep to extend his point streaks to seven games.

            Draisailt made it 4-1 when he rifled home his 32nd of the season on a feed from McDavid.

            The Rangers trimmed the deficit with a short-handed goal 6:26 into the second period when a Kreider pass attempt hit a skate and came back to him, and he scored his second of the game.

            New York kept coming to start the third. Lafreniere snapped his ninth 1:36 into the frame after the puck was chipped in front to him.

            The Rangers tied it on a two-man advantage with 6:50 remaining in the third as Zibanejad blasted his 30th from the slot.

            “If you look at that first period, you might say that’s a horrendous first period going down 4-1,” Zibanejad said. “But I thought we did some good things and the way we created some chances was good, they were things that we’ve been talking about all year.

            “We had to make sure we trust our way of playing, just being patient, there is 40 minutes left at that point and little by little getting back into the game and that’s what we did.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814219,Dominion voting case exposes post-election fear at Fox News,"NEW YORK (AP) — A court filing in a lawsuit against Fox News lays bare a panic at the network that it had alienated its viewers and damaged its brand by not lining up with President Donald Trump's false claims that he had won the 2020 presidential election.

            That worry — a real one, judging by Fox's ratings in the election's aftermath — played a key role in Fox not setting the record straight about unfounded fraud claims, the network's accuser contends.

            “It's remarkable how weak ratings make good journalists do bad things,” the filing quotes Fox Washington news executive Bill Sammon as saying.











            The details were included in a trove of private communications unearthed by lawyers and contained in a redacted brief filed Thursday by Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion claims in a $1.6 billion lawsuit that Fox aired allegations that Dominion had doctored the vote against Trump, even as it knew that was untrue. Fox says it was doing its job as a news organization by airing the accusations made by Trump and his allies.

            Fox's internal troubles began with a correct call: declaring on election night 2020 that Democrat Joe Biden had beaten Trump in Arizona. The declaration, coming ahead of other news organizations, infuriated the president and his fans.

            The backlash was noted in internal emails. “Holy cow, our audience is mad at the network,” said one, quoted by Dominion. “They're FURIOUS,” said another.

            Five days after the election, Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch communicated to Suzanne Scott, Fox News CEO, that the channel was “getting creamed by CNN. Guess our viewers don't want to watch it,” according to court papers.

            Fox News tumbled from first to third in the news network ratings between the Nov. 3, 2020, election and Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021, according to the Nielsen company. Meanwhile, thousands of Fox viewers flocked to the more conservative Newsmax, where prime-time viewership shot from 58,000 the week before the election to 568,000 the week after.

            The change shook the foundations of a network that had consistently led in the news ratings for the better part of two decades.

            Fox roared back into the lead by tacking more sharply to the right after Biden took office. But in the immediate aftermath of the election, there was genuine worry at its New York headquarters.

            Almost immediately, the network went on “war footing,” Dominion said, quoting a Fox executive.

            “Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we've lost with our audience?” Fox prime-time star Tucker Carlson wrote to his producer, according to Dominion's brief. “We're playing with fire, for real ... an alternative like newsmax could be devastating to us.”

            Dominion contends that Fox executives made the decision to push false narratives to entice their audience back, and points to claims made by Trump allies like attorney Sidney Powell on programs hosted by Maria Bartiromo and Lou Dobbs.

            On Nov. 9, Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto cut away from a news conference held by Trump aide Kayleigh McEnaney when she began to air unsubstantiated allegations. A Fox executive complained in the aftermath that Cavuto was damaging the network's brand.

            The court filings also detailed two instances where Fox News reporters were attacked internally for tweeting fact checks. In one, reporter Jacqui Heinrich tweeted that there was no evidence any voting system deleted, lost or changed votes.

            “Please get her fired,” Carlson messaged fellow anchor Sean Hannity, saying Heinrich was hurting the company, according to Dominion's filing. Heinrich's tweet was later deleted, the court papers said. 

            She later retweeted the fact-check, removing the names of Hannity and Dobbs.

            Carlson himself tried to “thread the needle,” Dominion said. It noted how he publicly stated that Powell had never provided evidence to back up her claims of fraud. “On the other hand, he did not say what he believed privately — that she was lying,” Dominion said.

            Fox said many of its specific responses will come in a document that Superior Court Judge Eric Davis in Delaware ordered sealed until Feb. 27. Fox said Dominion had mischaracterized the record and cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context.

            “There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners, but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan,” Fox said.

            If either side can persuade Davis to grant summary judgment in its favor, the case will end without a jury trial. If not, the trial is scheduled to begin in mid-April. 

            As a result of Sullivan and cases that followed, such defamation cases against journalists are usually very hard to prove, and Fox is also arguing that Dominion is grossly overestimating any economic damage to the company.

            Ultimately, though, the case is pulling back the curtain on what happened at the nation's largest media outlet that appeals to conservative viewers at a pivotal time at the network's, and the nation's history.

            “Privately, Fox hosts and executives knew that Donald Trump lost the election and that he needed to concede,” Dominion argued in the papers released Thursday. “But Fox viewers heard a different story — repeatedly.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814220,Turmoil in courts on gun laws in wake of justices' ruling,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment is upending gun laws across the country, dividing judges and sowing confusion over what firearm restrictions can remain on the books. 

            The high court's ruling that set new standards for evaluating gun laws left open many questions, experts say, resulting in an increasing number of conflicting decisions as lower court judges struggle to figure out how to apply it. 

            The Supreme Court’s so-called Bruen decision changed the test that lower courts had long used for evaluating challenges to firearm restrictions. Judges should no longer consider whether the law serves public interests like enhancing public safety, the justices said.











            Under the Supreme Court's new test, the government that wants to uphold a gun restriction must look back into history to show it is consistent with the country’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation."" 

            Courts in recent months have declared unconstitutional federal laws designed to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers,felony defendants and people who use marijuana. Judges have shot down a federal ban on possessing guns with serial numbers removed and gun restrictions for young adults in Texas and have blocked the enforcement of Delaware's ban on the possession of homemade “ghost guns."" 

            In several instances, judges looking at the same laws have come down on opposite sides on whether they are constitutional in the wake of the conservative Supreme Court majority's ruling. The legal turmoil caused by the first major gun ruling in a decade will likely force the Supreme Court to step in again soon to provide more guidance for judges. 

            ""There’s confusion and disarray in the lower courts because not only are they not reaching the same conclusions, they’re just applying different methods or applying Bruen's method differently,"" said Jacob Charles, a professor at Pepperdine University's law school who focuses on firearms law. 

            “What it means is that not only are new laws being struck down ... but also laws that have been on the books for over 60 years, 40 years in some cases, those are being struck down — where prior to Bruen — courts were unanimous that those were constitutional,"" he said. 

            The legal wrangling is playing out as mass shootings continue to plague the country awash in guns and as law enforcement officials across the U.S. work to combat an uptick in violent crime. 

            This week, six people were fatally shot at multiple locations in a small town in rural Mississippi and a gunman killed three students and critically wounded five others at Michigan State University before killing himself. 

            Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023, including in California, where 11 people were killed as they welcomed the Lunar New Year at a dance hall popular with older Asian Americans. Last year, more than 600 mass shootings occurred in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or wounded, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

            The decision opened the door to a wave of legal challenges from gun-rights activists who saw an opportunity to undo laws on everything from age limits to AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons. For gun rights supporters, the Bruen decision was a welcome development that removed what they see as unconstitutional restraints on Second Amendment rights.

            “It’s a true reading of what the Constitution and the Bill of Rights tells us,” said Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. “It absolutely does provide clarity to the lower courts on how the constitution should be applied when it comes to our fundamental rights."" 

            Gun control groups are raising alarm after a federal appeals court this month said that under the Supreme Court's new standards, the government can’t stop people who have domestic violence restraining orders against them from owning guns. 

            The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that the law “embodies salutary policy goals meant to protect vulnerable people in our society."" But the judges concluded that the government failed to point to a precursor from early American history that is comparable enough to the modern law. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said the government will seek further review of that decision. 

            Gun control activists have decried the Supreme Court's historical test, but say they remain confident that many gun restrictions will survive challenges. Since the decision, for example, judges have consistently upheld the federal ban on convicted felons from possessing guns. 

            The Supreme Court noted that cases dealing with “unprecedented societal concerns or dramatic technological changes may require a more nuanced approach.” And the justices clearly emphasized that the right to bear arms is limited to law-abiding citizens, said Shira Feldman, litigation counsel for Brady, the gun control group. 

            The Supreme Court's test has raised questions about whether judges are suited to be poring over history and whether it makes sense to judge modern laws based on regulations — or a lack thereof— from the past. 

            “We are not experts in what white, wealthy, and male property owners thought about firearms regulation in 1791. Yet we are now expected to play historian in the name of constitutional adjudication,” wrote Mississippi U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. 

            Some judges are “really parsing the history very closely and saying ‘these laws aren’t analogous because the historical law worked in a slightly different fashion than the modern law’,” said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law. 

            Others, he said, ""have done a much more flexible inquiry and are trying to say ‘look, what is the purpose of this historical law as best I can understand it?'""

            Firearm rights and gun control groups are closely watching many pending cases, including several challenging state laws banning certain semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.

            A federal judge in Chicago on Friday denied a bid to block an Illinois law that bans the sale of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, finding the law to be constitutional under the Supreme Court's new test. A state court, however, already has partially blocked the law — allowing some gun dealers to continue selling the weapons — amid a separate legal challenge. 

            Already, some gun laws passed in the wake of the Supreme Court decision have been shot down. A judge declared multiple portions of New York’s new gun law unconstitutional, including rules that restrict carrying firearms in public parks and places of worship. An appeals court later put that ruling on hold while it considers the case. And the Supreme Court has allowed New York to enforce the law for now. 

            Some judges have upheld a law banning people under indictment for felonies from buying guns while others have declared it unconstitutional. 

            A federal judge issued an order barring Delaware from enforcing provisions of a new law outlawing the manufacture and possession of so-called “ghost guns"" that don't have serial numbers and can be nearly impossible for law enforcement officials to trace. But another judge rejected a challenge to California's “ghost gun"" regulations. 

            In the California case, U.S. District Judge George Wu, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, appeared to take a dig at how other judges are interpreting the Supreme Court's guidance. 

            The company that brought the challenge —“and apparently certain other courts"" — would like to treat the Supreme Court’s decision “as a ‘word salad,’ choosing an ingredient from one side of the ‘plate’ and an entirely-separate ingredient from the other, until there is nothing left whatsoever other than an entirely-bulletproof and unrestrained Second Amendment,” Wu wrote in his ruling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814221,"Brink new Stanford career blocks leader, Cardinal beat USC","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Cameron Brink has evolved into a smart and imposing shot-blocker in both the paint and on the perimeter, going straight up and with one hand to avoid picking up fouls.

            On Friday night, she became Stanford's career leader in blocked shots with six more and scored 12 points, including a key putback with 1:04 left, and the No. 3 Cardinal beat 25th-ranked Southern California 50-47 to take sole possession of the Pac-12 lead.

            Brink began the night needing two blocks to break Jayne Appel’s mark of 273 set from 2006-2010, then swatted away a layup by Kadi Sissoko at the 5:25 mark of the second for the record. Close family friend and supporter Stephen Curry and his daughter, Riley — alongside 49ers quarterback Trey Lance — sat on the baseline cheering for her. Brink has 278 career blocks and already held the single-season program record, moving her total to 99. She also grabbed 10 rebounds.











            Afterward, Brink hinted she will return for her final collegiate season, much to the delight of coach Tara VanDerveer: “I think why you go to Stanford is to stay for four years and get your degree,"" Brink said.

            Okako Adika's jumper with 1:41 remaining pulled the Trojans (19-7, 9-6) to 48-45 but Brink answered after a miss by Jones. Destiny Littleton scored 15 points but missed a baseline 3 under pressure just before the final buzzer trying to send the game into overtime.

            Haley Jones added eight points, 10 rebounds and five assists in the “Pink Game” as both programs wore pink to raise awareness for breast cancer. Stanford (25-3, 13-2 Pac-12) bounced back after having its 14-game winning streak stopped by the Trojans in a 55-46 loss in Los Angeles on Jan. 15.

            The Cardinal are alone in atop the Pac-12 after No. 4 Utah's 82-72 loss at 18th-ranked Arizona earlier Friday. 

            “We want to be in first place. Every game for us is a shot to win the championship and so that's what we’re working at,” VanDerveer said. “... This was a great game for us, it was a tournament game.""

            Sissoko, leading USC at 15 points per game for a Trojans team averaging 65.8 points, shot just 3 of 15 for nine points.

            Adika made two early 3s and Littleton also knocked one down from deep as USC went ahead 11-5. Adika wound up with 13 points but the Trojans had just two points in the paint, none from the bench and none in the fast break.

            Littleton was determined to stay aggressive, even with Brink's presence in the middle.

            “What gives me confidence with this group is the body of work over the course of the season,” coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. “I still think our best basketball is in front of us.”

            BLOCK QUEEN

            Appel, now Jayne Appel-Marinelli, offered her congratulations to Brink via text message to the AP.

            “From one Stanford big to another Stanford big: You have taken the torch and moved it to a higher level. Congratulations, Block Queen! Truly an accomplishment to be on the top with all the other Stanford greats!”

            Said Brink: “Coming from Jayne, that's the biggest compliment. I idolize her. She was such an amazing player.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814222,Why balloons are now in public eye — and military crosshairs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wafting across the United States and into the attention of an alarmed national and global public, a giant Chinese balloon has changed Americans' awareness of all the stuff floating in the air and how defense officials watch for it and respond. 

            
                President Joe Biden said Thursday that the U.S. is updating its guidelines for monitoring and reacting to unknown aerial objects. That's after the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting the country triggered high-stakes drama, including the U.S. shootdowns of that balloon, and three smaller ones days later.

            Biden said officials suspect the three subsequent balloons were ordinary ones. That could mean ones used for research, weather, recreational or commercial purposes. Officials have been unable to recover any of the remains of those three balloons, and late Friday the U.S. military announced it had ended the search for the objects that were shot down near Deadhorse, Alaska, and over Lake Huron on Feb. 10 and 12.











            In all, the episodes opened the eyes of the public to two realities. 

            One: China is operating a military-linked aerial surveillance program that has targeted more than 40 countries, according to the Biden administration. China denies it.

            Two: There’s a whole lot of other junk floating up there, too.

            A look at why there are so many balloons up there — launched for purposes of war, weather, science, business or just goofing around; why they're getting attention now; and how the U.S. is likely to watch for and respond to slow-moving flying objects going forward.

            WHAT ARE ALL THOSE BALLOONS DOING UP THERE?

            Some are up there for spying or fighting. Humans have hooked bombs to balloons since at least the 1840s, when winds blew some of the balloon-borne bombs launched against Venice back on the Austrian launchers. In the U.S. Civil War, Union and Confederate soldiers floated up over front lines in balloons to assess enemy positions and direct fire.

            And when it comes to peacetime uses, the cheapness of balloons makes them a favorite aerial platform for all kinds of uses, serious and idle. That includes everything down to ""college fraternities with nothing better to do and $10,000,” joked Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

            Himes' role on the committee involved him in a congressionally mandated intelligence and military review of the most credible of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena, or UFOs. That review also drove home to him and other lawmakers ”how much stuff there is floating around, in particular balloons,"" Himes said.

            For the National Weather Service, balloons are the main means of above-ground forecasting. Forecasters launch balloons twice daily from nearly 900 locations around the world, including nearly 100 in the United States.

            High-altitude balloons also help scientists peer out into space from near the edges of the Earth's atmosphere. NASA runs a national balloon program office, helping coordinate launches from east Texas and other sites for universities, foreign groups and other research programs. School science classes launch balloons, wildlife watchers launch balloons.

            Commercial interests also send balloons up — such as Google's effort to provide internet service via giant balloons.

            And $12 gets hobby balloonists — who use balloons for ham radio or just for the pleasure of launching and tracking — balloons capable of getting up to 40,000 feet and higher. 

            That's roughly around the altitude that the U.S. military says the three smaller balloons were at when U.S. missiles ended their flights.

            Most pilots probably wouldn't even be aware of a collision with such a balloon, said Ron Meadows, who produces balloons — with transmitters the size of a popsicle stick — for middle schools and universities to use for science education. 

            All it “does is report its location and speed,” Meadows said. “It's not a threat to anyone.”

            Among hobby balloonists, there are suspicions that a balloon declared missing by the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Brigade was one of the ones shot down, as the publication Aviation Week Network first reported. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday the administration was not able to confirm those reports 

            And it's not just the United States' Mylar, foil and plastic overhead. Wind patterns known as the Westerlies sweep airborne things ranging from Beijing's tailpipe soot and the charred chunks of Siberian forest fires swinging over the Arctic and into the United States. China says its big balloon was a meteorological and research one that got picked up by the Westerlies. The U.S. says the balloon was at least partly maneuverable. 

            WHY ARE WE JUST NOW SPOTTING ALL THESE BALLOONS?

            Short answer: Because we are just now looking for them.

            Balloons' rise to global prominence got a lift starting in the past few years. Congress directed the Director of National Intelligence to pull together everything the government has learned about unidentified aerial phenomena. That included creating a Defense Department UAP task force. 

            Last year, in the first congressional hearing on unidentified airborne objects in a half-century, Scott W. Bray, the deputy director of Naval intelligence, told lawmakers that improved sensors, an increase in drones and other non-military unmanned aerial systems, and yes, “aerial clutter” including random balloons were leading to people noticing more unidentified airborne objects.

            That awareness kicked into overdrive this month, after the U.S. military and then the U.S. public spotted the Chinese balloon floating down from the High North. While the U.S. says previous Chinese balloons have entered U.S. territory, this was the first one of them to slowly cross the United States in plain view of the public. 

            That balloon, and what had been growing official awareness of a Chinese military-linked balloon surveillance campaign that had targeted dozens of countries, led U.S. officials to change radar and other sensor settings, screening more closely for slow-moving objects in the air as well as fast ones.

            SIDEWINDER MISSILES: A LONG-TERM BALLOON STRATEGY?

            Post big Chinese balloon, U.S. defense officials are expected to keep up broader monitoring so that balloons remain on the radar, but fine-tune the response. 

            Biden's order to the Air Force to shoot down the three smaller airborne objects with Sidewinder missiles left him fending off Republican accusations he was too trigger-happy. Biden says all four shootdowns were warranted since the balloons could have posed dangers to civilian aircraft. Hobby balloons with payloads of only a few pounds are not covered by many FAA airspace rules.

            Biden says the U.S. is developing “sharper rules” to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects.

            He directed national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead an interagency team to review the procedures.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814223,India welcomes 12 cheetahs from South Africa,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India welcomed 12 cheetahs from South Africa on Saturday that will join eight others it received from Namibia last year as part of an ambitious drive to reintroduce the big cats in the country after 70 years. 

            An aircraft carrying the cheetahs landed at Gwalior Air Force base, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. The cats will then be flown in helicopters to Kuno National Park in India's Madhya Pradesh state, where they will be released into quarantine enclosures. 

            In January, India said it planned to import 12 cats annually for the next eight to 10 years as part of an agreement signed by the two African countries.











            Cheetah populations in most countries are declining. South Africa, where the cats are running out of space, is an exception.

            
                The eight cheetahs flown from Namibia were released into the sprawling Kuno National Park in central India in September. 

            Cheetahs were once widespread in India but became extinct in 1952 from hunting and loss of habitat. They remain the first and only predator to die out since India’s independence in 1947. India hopes that importing African cheetahs will aid efforts to conserve the country’s threatened and largely neglected grasslands.

            There are fewer than 7,000 adult cheetahs in the wild globally, and they now inhabit less than 9% of their original range.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814232,US concludes recovery operations of Chinese 'spy balloon',"The United States, on Friday, concluded its search for debris from an a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon which was shot on February 4.""Final pieces of debris are being transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Virginia for counterintelligence exploitation,"" said the US military's Northern Command in a statement.The search for two of the three other objects  shot down near Alaska and on  Lake Huron has also ended, said the statement.The Northern Command said that the air and maritime safety perimeters were being lifted at both sites.According to officials, much of the balloon had fallen into about 50 feet of water.The Navy collected remnants floating on the surface, while divers and unmanned naval vessels  pulled up the rest from the ocean floor.White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that a significant amount of debris, including ""electronics and optics,"" were recovered.The debris included key equipment which could reveal what the balloon was able to monitor and collect.Kirby declined to say what the US had discovered from the wreckage thus far but said a lot had already been learnt by observing the balloon as it drifted over the US.""We're going to learn even more, we believe, by getting a look at the guts inside it and seeing how it worked and what it was capable of,"" he said.An official told AP news agency on the condition of anonymity that the US had tracked the balloon for several days after it left China.With regards to the search conducted near Alaska and on Lake Huron, the Northern Command said that they ""did not locate debris.""Earlier this week, President Biden said that according to preliminary evidence, the two incidents were  not related to a broader Chinese spy program.On Thursday President Joe Biden directed national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead an interagency team to establish ""sharper rules"" to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown objects.The announcement to end the search for debris capped three dramatic weeks that saw US fighter jets shoot down four airborne objects — a large Chinese balloon and three smaller objects.They are the first known peacetime shootdowns of unauthorized objects in US airspace.China has maintained that the device was for  weather surveillance and had gone astray.Relations between China and Washington have been increasingly tense since.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his visit to Beijing earlier this month.The trip would have been the first by a US secretary of state to China in five years where both sides would have sought to stabilize increasingly fraught ties.US officials have been looking at the possibility of a meeting between Blinken and China's top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that began on Friday.ns/kb (AP, AFPE, Reuters)",2023/02/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814238,Lyon’s 5 wickets help bowl out India for 262 on day 2,"NEW DEHLI (AP) — Spinner Nathan Lyon took 5-67 to help dismiss India for 262, one run less than Australia's first innings total on day two Saturday of the second test.

            India was a precarious 139-7 when Axar Patel counterattacked with 74 runs off 115 balls in a key stand of 114 with Ravichandran Ashwin, who made 37.

            At stumps, Australia was 61-1 and leading by 62. Travis Head was unbeaten on 39 and Marnus Labuschagne on 16 not out.











            “There is more bounce here than in Nagpur, which is something I tried to exploit,” Lyon said. ""But I have an eye on the whole test overall and my role in the second innings.”

            The morning session was a hectic one. Lyon picked up all four wickets to rock India's top order.

            India lost Lokesh Rahul (17) and Rohit Sharma (32) within the first hour, despite Australia losing all of its reviews.

            Cheteshwar Pujara fell for a seven-ball duck in his 100th test, the eighth cricketer ever to do so.

            Shreyas Iyer also fell before lunch when Peter Handscomb held a sharp catch that bounced off his arm and leg.

            India resumed after lunch on 88-4, and Ravindra Jadeja was trapped on 26 by Todd Murphy to end a 59-run stand with Virat Kohli.

            India lost two more wickets in the next four overs, including Kohli on 44, and was 139-7.

            Australia debutant Matthew Kuhnemann got his maiden test wicket when he trapped Kohli. The decision was debatable with the ball hitting both bat and pad simultaneously. Kohli walked off unhappy even as the review stayed in favor of Australia.

            Lyon completed his five-wicket haul after Srikar Bharat edged to slip. Lyon's 5-67 in 29 overs was his second test five-for, after taking 7-94 in New Delhi in 2013.

            Patel and Ashwin, 37 from 71 balls, pulled off their rescue act. Patel hit nine fours and three sixes.

            Australia began its reply without opening batsman David Warner, who was substituted out of the test owing to concussion suffered on Friday. Warner was hit on the helmet in the 10th over by Mohammed Siraj and didn't take the field late in the third session. Warner also had a suspected hairline fracture from an elbow hit in the same innings and could be in doubt for the remainder of the four-match series.

            Matt Renshaw replaced him and opened with Usman Khawaja, who was caught by Iyer at leg gully on 6 off Jadeja.

            Head attacked Jadeja and hit five fours and a six.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814240,Marcos: China laser not enough to activate US defense pact,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine president said Saturday the Chinese coast guard’s use of military-grade laser that briefly blinded some of the crew aboard a Philippine patrol vessel in the disputed South China Sea was not enough for him to invoke a mutual defense treaty with the United States, but warned that such aggression should stop.

            President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told a news conference he also reminded China’s ambassador to Manila that escalating aggression and incursions into Philippine waters by Beijing’s coast guard, navy and government-backed civilian fishing fleets violate an agreement he struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping last month.

            “Despite the fact that it was a military-grade laser that was pointed at our coast guard, I do not think that that is sufficient for it to trigger the Mutual Defense Treaty,” Marcos said in his first public remarks about the Feb. 6 incident involving two Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.











            Responding to a question, Marcos said he was concerned that activating the 1951 treaty would ratchet up regional tensions.

            Marcos spoke to reporters in the northern resort city of Baguio where he delivered a speech before cadets and former graduates of the Philippine Military Academy and repeated a vow to defend the country's territory amid a new territorial spat with China.

            “This country will not lose one inch of its territory,” Marcos said to applause. “We will continue to uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with our constitution and with international law.”

            “We will work with our neighbors to secure the safety and security of our peoples,” Marcos said without elaborating.

            Like his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos has taken steps to nurture friendly ties with Beijing. He met Xi in the Chinese capital early last month to boost relations and discuss the Asian neighbors’ long-seething territorial disputes in the strategic waterway that also involve Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. 

            China claims the South China Sea virtually in its entirety, putting it on a collision course with other Asian claimants and separately with Washington. The U.S. lays no claims to the disputed sea but has deployed its Navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters, promote freedom of mobility and challenge China’s territorial claims.

            The contested waters have become a delicate front in the broader rivalry between the U.S. and China in Asia and elsewhere.

            In the latest flare-up, the Philippines says a Chinese coast guard ship beamed a high-grade laser to block the Philippine vessel from approaching Second Thomas Shoal, which is held by Philippine forces. The Marcos administration sent a strongly worded diplomatic protest to the Chinese Embassy in Manila and Marcos summoned Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on Tuesday to express his concern.

            China responded by saying its coast guard ship used a hand-held laser and another light-emitting gadget to harmlessly measure the distance and speed of the Philippine vessel, which it claimed intruded into Chinese territorial waters and was warned to leave the area.

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said China’s “dangerous operational behavior directly threatens regional peace and security, infringes upon freedom of navigation in the South China Sea as guaranteed under international law.” 

            Washington, he said, was standing by its treaty ally Manila following the latest sea feud.

            Price renewed a warning that an armed attack on Philippine military forces, public vessels or aircraft, including those of the coast guard in the South China Sea, would invoke U.S. mutual defense commitments under the 1951 treaty.

            Australia, Japan, Canada, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom also expressed alarm following the Chinese coast guard's use of the military-grade laser against the Philippine patrol vessel that they said threatens regional peace and stability.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine president said Saturday the Chinese coast guard’s use of military-grade laser that briefly blinded some of the crew aboard a Philippine patrol vessel in the disputed South China Sea was not enough for him to invoke a mutual defense treaty with the United States, but warned that such aggression should stop.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told a news conference he also reminded China’s ambassador to Manila that escalating aggression and incursions into Philippine waters by Beijing’s coast guard, navy and government-backed civilian fishing fleets violate an agreement he struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping last month.“Despite the fact that it was a military-grade laser that was pointed at our coast guard, I do not think that that is sufficient for it to trigger the Mutual Defense Treaty,” Marcos said in his first public remarks about the Feb. 6 incident involving two Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.Responding to a question, Marcos said he was concerned that activating the 1951 treaty would ratchet up regional tensions.Marcos spoke to reporters in the northern resort city of Baguio where he delivered a speech before cadets and former graduates of the Philippine Military Academy and repeated a vow to defend the country's territory amid a new territorial spat with China.“This country will not lose one inch of its territory,” Marcos said to applause. “We will continue to uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with our constitution and with international law.”“We will work with our neighbors to secure the safety and security of our peoples,” Marcos said without elaborating.Like his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos has taken steps to nurture friendly ties with Beijing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814241,Russian envoy claims West is determined to destroy Russia,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A week before the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s U.N. ambassador claimed that the West is driven by its determination to destroy Russia and declared: “We had no choice other than to defend our country — defend it from you, to defend our identity and our future.”

            Western ambassadors shot back, accusing Russia of using a Security Council meeting it called on lessons learned from the failure to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists that began in 2014 to justify what France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere called “the unjustifiable” – Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022.

            Friday's meeting in the council — the only international venue where Russia regularly faces Ukraine and its Western supporters — put a spotlight on the deep chasm between the warring parties as the conflict moves into its second year with no end in sight, tens of thousands of casualties on both sides, and new military offensives expected.











            Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Western nations including France and Germany of “holding back” on implementing the Minsk agreements brokered by the two countries to end the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk in the country’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial east that flared in April 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

            “You knew very well that the Minsk process for you is just a smoke screen, so as to rearm the Kyiv regime and to prepare it for war against Russia in the name of your geopolitical interest,” Nebenzia said.

            U.S. deputy ambassador Richard Mills accused Russia of failing to implement “a single commitment it made” in the Minsk agreements while the other signatories — France, Germany, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe — “sought to implement them in good faith.”

            France’s De Riviere said his country and Germany have worked “tirelessly” since 2015 to promote dialogue between parties. “The difficulties encountered in implementing these agreements can never serve as justification or mitigating circumstances for Russia’s choice to end the dialogue with violence,” he stressed.

            De Riviere recalled that exactly a year ago, on Feb. 17, 2022, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin reaffirmed to the council that the Minsk agreements were “the only international legal basis” to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and that rumors of Russian military intervention were unfounded and stemmed from Western paranoia. Four days later, Russia recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, and on Feb. 24 it invaded Ukraine.

            “The one and only lesson to be learned here is that Russia, by attacking Ukraine, has chosen alone, to put an end to dialogue and negotiation,” De Riviere said. “It took the decision alone to shatter the Minsk agreements, whose main objective, let us remember, was the reintegration of some regions of Donetsk and Luhansk under full Ukrainian sovereignty, in exchange for broad decentralization.”

            Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward also cited Vershinin’s statement to the council that allegations of a Russian attack were baseless a week before President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, and said the United Kingdom had learned some lessons.

            “Russia lied when we warned of its intention to attack Ukraine,” she said. “Russia was planning for war while we called for diplomacy and de-escalation, and Russia continues to choose death and destruction while the world calls for a just peace.”

            Russia’s Nebenzia blamed “a criminal policy by the Ukrainian leadership which was goaded by the collective West” for refusing to implement the Minsk agreements.

            After a year of war, he told Western members of the Security Council, “Obviously, we will not be able to live in the future the way we did in the past.”

            Nebenzia accused the West of “deep Russophobia,"" and a “determination to destroy my country, using others if possible.” And he claimed it is not interested “in building a European and Euro-Atlantic security system together with Russia” because “for you such a system can only be aimed against Russia.”

            “We have no trust left in you and we are not able of believing any promises you make — not as regards a non-expansion of NATO in the east, or your desire not to interfere in our internal affairs, or your determination to live in peace,” Nebenzia said. 

            “You have shown that it’s impossible to negotiate with you,"" he said. “You’ve shown how treacherous you are by creating on our borders a neo-Nazi, neo-nationalist beehive and then stirring it up.”

            Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of violating the Minsk agreements, citing as an example the Minsk memorandum of Sept. 19, 2014 ordering all military, militias and mercenaries to leave Ukraine that was never implemented.

            “The truth is that Putin has proved once and for all to be impossible to negotiate with,” he said. “Russia’s consistent undermining and final killing of the Minsk agreements make that crystal clear.”

            Ukraine urges “healthy forces in Russia, if there are any, to come to their senses and force Putin to implement the demands of the U.N. General Assembly to immediately cease the use of force and to withdraw Russian military forces from Ukraine,” Kyslytsya said. “The dictator should give up and recede into the past.”UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A week before the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s U.N. ambassador claimed that the West is driven by its determination to destroy Russia and declared: “We had no choice other than to defend our country — defend it from you, to defend our identity and our future.”Western ambassadors shot back, accusing Russia of using a Security Council meeting it called on lessons learned from the failure to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists that began in 2014 to justify what France’s U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814243,Election conspiracist to lead Michigan GOP through 2024,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Election conspiracist Kristina Karamo, who was overwhelmingly defeated in her bid to become Michigan’s secretary of state, was chosen Saturday to lead the state's Republican Party for the next two years.

            Karamo defeated a 10-candidate field dominated by far-right candidates to win the Michigan GOP chair position after a state convention that lasted nearly 11 hours. A former community college professor, she lost her secretary of state race in the 2022 midterms by 14 percentage points after mounting a campaign filled with election conspiracies.

            Karamo inherits a state party torn by infighting and millions in debt. She will be tasked with helping win back control of the Legislature and flipping one of the nation’s most competitive Senate seats, while attempting to help a presidential candidate win the battleground state.











            Addressing delegates before the vote, Karamo said that “our party is dying” and it needs to be rebuilt into ""a political machine that strikes fear in the heart of Democrats.”

            Karamo rose to prominence following the 2020 presidential election when she began appearing on conservative talk shows saying that as a poll challenger in Detroit, she saw “ballots being dropped off in the middle of the night, thousands of them.”

            The decision to elect Karamo, who will lead through the 2024 elections, solidifies the hold that far-right activists have on the state party after Michigan Republicans suffered sweeping electoral losses last year. 

            It took three rounds of voting at the convention in Lansing for locally elected delegates to pick Karamo over former attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno, who had been endorsed by Trump in the race. 

            With a field dominated by grassroots activist candidates running on far-right messaging, many longtime Michigan Republicans had given up on a state party before Saturday's vote even took place. 

            “We lost the entire statehouse for the first time in 40 years, in large part, because of the top of the ticket. All deniers. It turned off a lot of voters,” former longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Upton said last week. “As I look at the state convention, it looks like it could well be more of the same.” 

            The party may take “a cycle or two to correct itself and to get out of the ditch that we’ve been in for the last couple of years,” Upton told The Associated Press.

            The state party previously has been led by former U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and current national Republican Party Chair Ronna McDaniel. The party built a large volunteer base of grassroots activists, former Chair Bobby Schostak said, while also raising “$30 to $35 million each cycle."" 

            In Schostak’s time as chair from 2011 to 2015, Republicans maintained control of the Legislature and Rick Snyder, a Republican, was reelected as governor. Trump won the state in the 2016 presidential election. 

            Democrats now control all levels of power in the state for the first time since the 1980s. They won control of both houses of the Legislature and defeated Republicans by significant margins for governor, attorney general and secretary of state in the 2022 midterms. 

            Longtime donors withheld millions in donations as the Republican party grew increasingly loyal to Trump, nominating his handpicked candidates, DePerno and Karamo. Tudor Dixon, who lost her race for governor to Whitmer, said her campaign was hurt by the state party not having as much money as in the past.

            “I’d love to say that it is just a movement of going and knocking doors. But you’ve got to be able to put the money behind it,” Dixon said. 

            Following the midterms, Michigan GOP Chair Ron Weiser and co-Chair Meshawn Maddock said they would not seek reelection. 

            Prior to the vote Saturday, Schostak, now a major donor in the state, said the next leader will need to prove “they have the capability to be good stewards of the donor money.""

            If donors once again decide in large numbers not to give to the state party, they will need to find other ways of helping candidates ahead of a 2024 presidential election in which Republicans will look to flip the state House and win a U.S. Senate seat for the first time in more than two decades. 

            “The state party’s a little bit weaker, and they’re not going to have the influence in races that they had before,” state House Republican Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus noted. “That being said, there are a lot of other avenues to pick up that slack and to make sure that we are still effective with or without the party.”LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Election conspiracist Kristina Karamo, who was overwhelmingly defeated in her bid to become Michigan’s secretary of state, was chosen Saturday to lead the state's Republican Party for the next two years.Karamo defeated a 10-candidate field dominated by far-right candidates to win the Michigan GOP chair position after a state convention that lasted nearly 11 hours. A former community college professor, she lost her secretary of state race in the 2022 midterms by 14 percentage points after mounting a campaign filled with election conspiracies.Karamo inherits a state party torn by infighting and millions in debt. She will be tasked with helping win back control of the Legislature and flipping one of the nation’s most competitive Senate seats, while attempting to help a presidential candidate win the battleground state.Addressing delegates before the vote, Karamo said that “our party is dying” and it needs to be rebuilt into ""a political machine that strikes fear in the heart of Democrats.”Karamo rose to prominence following the 2020 presidential election when she began appearing on conservative talk shows saying that as a poll challenger in Detroit, she saw “ballots being dropped off in the middle of the night, thousands of them.”The decision to elect Karamo, who will lead through the 2024 elections, solidifies the hold that far-right activists have on the state party after Michigan Republicans suffered sweeping electoral losses last year.It took three rounds of voting at the convention in Lansing for locally elected delegates to pick Karamo over former attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno, who had been endorsed by Trump in the race.With a field dominated by grassroots activist candidates running on far-right messaging, many longtime Michigan Republicans had given up on a state party before Saturday's vote even took place.“We lost the entire statehouse for the first time in 40 years, in large part, because of the top of the ticket. All deniers. It turned off a lot of voters,” former longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Upton said last week. “As I look at the state convention, it looks like it could well be more of the same.”The party may take “a cycle or two to correct itself and to get out of the ditch that we’ve been in for the last couple of years,” Upton told The Associated Press.The state party previously has been led by former U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and current national Republican Party Chair Ronna McDaniel. The party built a large volunteer base of grassroots activists, former Chair Bobby Schostak said, while also raising “$30 to $35 million each cycle.""In Schostak’s time as chair from 2011 to 2015, Republicans maintained control of the Legislature and Rick Snyder, a Republican, was reelected as governor. Trump won the state in the 2016 presidential election.Democrats now control all levels of power in the state for the first time since the 1980s. They won control of both houses of the Legislature and defeated Republicans by significant margins for governor, attorney general and secretary of state in the 2022 midterms.Longtime donors withheld millions in donations as the Republican party grew increasingly loyal to Trump, nominating his handpicked candidates, DePerno and Karamo. Tudor Dixon, who lost her race for governor to Whitmer, said her campaign was hurt by the state party not having as much money as in the past.“I’d love to say that it is just a movement of going and knocking doors. But you’ve got to be able to put the money behind it,” Dixon said.Following the midterms, Michigan GOP Chair Ron Weiser and co-Chair Meshawn Maddock said they would not seek reelection.Prior to the vote Saturday, Schostak, now a major donor in the state, said the next leader will need to prove “they have the capability to be good stewards of the donor money.""If donors once again decide in large numbers not to give to the state party, they will need to find other ways of helping candidates ahead of a 2024 presidential election in which Republicans will look to flip the state House and win a U.S. Senate seat for the first time in more than two decades.“The state party’s a little bit weaker, and they’re not going to have the influence in races that they had before,” state House Republican Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus noted. “That being said, there are a lot of other avenues to pick up that slack and to make sure that we are still effective with or without the party.”",2023/02/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814244,Altering diplomatic ties with Taiwan would be 'irrational': Paraguay president,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Any change to diplomatic ties with Taiwan would be a mistake, Paraguay President Mario Abdo Benitez said on Saturday (Feb. 18).

            Given all the fruitful results of bilateral cooperation, including in economy, trade, and culture, and the potential areas of partnership, any change to diplomatic relations with Taiwan would be “irrational and reckless,” Abdo said at a press conference.

            As the president is serving out his last term, there are talks of Paraguay dropping Taiwan in favor of China ahead of general elections in April. Opposition party candidate Efrain Alegre has vowed to break off ties with Taiwan in order to open up Paraguay to China’s massive soy and beef markets if he is elected.

            Commenting on this matter, Abdo said that from a rational, realistic, and historical perspective, Taiwan and Paraguay have had 65 years of friendly interactions. “I don’t believe anyone would want to alter this relationship,” he said, adding that relations between Paraguay and Taiwan have been steadfast under his administration.











            Under his presidency, Abdo said he has striven to deepen and strengthen the strategic alliance and partnership between the two nations. Paraguay has only ever had diplomatic ties with Taiwan, he said.

            Paraguay is a global leader of clean, renewable energy, Abdo said, revealing the country is planning cooperation with Taiwan in EV technology. Taiwanese EV-related businesses have begun expansion into the Paraguayan and regional markets, he said.

            He also expressed hope for more collaboration in food products and to see more Taiwanese business investments in South America via Paraguay.

            Abdo thanked Taiwan for providing scholarships to Paraguayan students, noting that there are 330 nationals studying in Taiwan to learn Mandarin and better understand the Taiwan work culture. In the future, if Taiwanese businesses want to move to Paraguay, these scholarship recipients will be the best resource to make the process go smoothly, he said.

            The president is wrapping up a trip to Taiwan. He arrived on Feb. 14 and met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other senior government officials to discuss bilateral cooperation and issues of common concern.

            He also oversaw the signing of an agreement on the training, exchange, and cooperation of diplomatic personnel by the foreign ministers of the two countries and attended a Paraguay meat promotion and investment information session.

The death toll in Turkey stands at 39,672, while neighbouring Syria has reported more than 5,800 deaths. Syria's toll has not changed for days.Mosques around the world on Friday performed absentee funeral prayers for the dead in Turkey and Syria, many of whom could not receive full burial rites given the enormity of the disaster.While many international rescue teams have left the vast quake zone, domestic teams continued to search through flattened buildings on Saturday hoping to find more survivors who defied the odds. Experts say most rescues occur in the 24 hours following an earthquake.Hakan Yasinoglu, in his 40s, was rescued in the southern province of Hatay, 278 hours after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck in the dead of night on Feb. 6, the Istanbul Fire Brigade said.Earlier, Osman Halebiye, 14, and Mustafa Avci, 34, were saved in Turkey's historic city of Antakya, known in ancient times as Antioch. As Avci was carried away, he was put on a video call with his parents, who showed him his newborn baby.""I had completely lost all hope. This is a true miracle. They gave me my son back. I saw the wreckage and I thought nobody could be saved alive from there,"" his father said.An exhausted Avci was later reunited with his wife Bilge and daughter Almile at a hospital in Mersin.Aid organisations say the survivors will need help for months to come with so much crucial infrastructure destroyed.In neighbouring Syria, already shattered by more than a decade of civil war, the bulk of fatalities have been in the northwest, an area controlled by insurgents who are at war with President Bashar al-Assad - a conflict that has complicated efforts to aid people affected by the earthquake.The sides clashed overnight for the first time since the disaster, with government forces shelling the outskirts of Atareb, a rebel-held town badly hit by the earthquake, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Friday.Reuters could not independently verify the report.Thousands of Syrians who had sought refuge in Turkey from their country's civil war have returned to their homes in the war zone - at least for now.ANGER GROWSNeither Turkey nor Syria have said how many people are still missing following the quake.For families still waiting to retrieve relatives in Turkey, there is growing anger over what they see as corrupt building practices and deeply flawed urban development that resulted in thousands of homes and businesses disintegrating.One such building was the Ronesans Rezidans (Renaissance Residence), which keeled over in Antakya, killing hundreds.""It was said to be earthquake-safe, but you can see the result,"" said Hamza Alpaslan, 47, whose brother had lived in the apartment block. ""It's in horrible condition. There is neither cement nor proper iron in it. It's a real hell.""Turkey has promised to investigate anyone suspected of responsibility for the collapse of buildings and has ordered the detention of more than 100 suspects, including developers.The United Nations on Thursday appealed for more than $1 billion in funds for the Turkish relief operation, and has launched a $400 million appeal for Syrians.",2023/02/18,134,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814259,Taiwan and the Paraguay presidential election,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Paraguay's President Mario Abdo Benitez arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday (Feb. 14) for an official state visit and immediately reaffirmed his steadfast commitment to Taiwan, while the Paraguayan Ambassador to Taiwan said the trip would “reaffirm the shared democratic values such as free expression, justice, and democracy.”""Nobody is going to dare to go ahead with a process of diplomatic rupture with the Republic of China, Taiwan,"" Abdo told reporters on Saturday Feb. 18.In contrast with Abdo’s clear commitment to Taiwan, his main opponent Efrain Alegre said he will sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and switch to recognizing China if he wins Paraguay’s presidential election in April.In light of this, what can we expect for the future of bi-lateral relations between the two countries?Two countries a world apartParaguay is a landlocked country in South America with a population of about 7 million, and shares borders with Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia. It is classed as a developing country, with a nominal GDP that is just under 15% of Taiwan’s at US$5,616 (NT$170,660).The Paraguayan economy is based largely on soy, maize, and beef production, having overcome the issue of having a mostly black-market economy based on drugs, weapons, and illicit electronics products in the early 2000s.Taiwan and Paraguay are about as physically far away from one another on the globe as two countries could be. Despite that, Taiwan has provided significant development assistance to the South American nation since it established bi-lateral relations in 1957 in the form of loans, technical assistance, and funding for various development projects.Paraguay’s presidential electionDespite Paraguay’s repeated commitments to its relationship with Taiwan, there may be trouble on the horizon.As the only South American country to formally conduct formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Paraguay-Taiwan relations are constantly threatened by the prospect of the former switching recognition to China.One key factor in this is Paraguay’s upcoming presidential election and the ruling Colorado Party’s main opposition candidate, Efrain Alegre. Alegre has stated that he will sever ties with Taiwan and switch to recognition of China if he wins the election in April this year.While historical trends would indicate this is unlikely (the Colorado Party has been in power for all but five of the past 77 years) his government has recently been plagued by allegations of corruption and complaints from the soy and beef industries about lack of access to the Chinese market.Santiago Pena, presidential candidate for the ruling Colorado Party, and Efrain Alegre, his opponent, who said he will cut ties with Taiwan if elected in April this year. (Reuters photo)""We make a sacrifice for the political support given to Taiwan and on balance, we consider that we receive very little in compensation,"" Pedro Galli, president of the Rural Association of Paraguay, told Reuters.These issues are part of an ongoing discussion in Paraguay about the opportunity cost of maintaining relations with Taiwan at the expense of a relationship with China. A 2021 study estimated the opportunity cost of recognizing Taiwan for Paraguay is about 1% of the country’s total GDP in aid funding alone.Alegre has stood in the past two presidential elections and was beaten by the incumbent Abdo in 2018 by less than 4% of the vote. That was, however, before the majority of the corruption allegations against the ruling party surfaced.In addition to the upcoming election, in September last year the Financial Times reported that Abdo requested US$1 billion in Taiwanese investment to maintain diplomatic relations, though Abdo later denied that there was any “quid pro quo” for the Paraguay-Taiwan relationship,US interest in status quoEven as U.S. domestic politics becomes increasingly polarized, support for Taiwan maintains healthy bi-partisan support, and helping to maintain Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic relationships is a key method for Washington to protect its strategic interests.In 2019, Mike Pompeo made the first visit to Paraguay of any sitting U.S. secretary of state in more than 50 years, and cited the country’s relationship with Taiwan as evidence that South American countries are pushing back against “external meddling”.“Countries like Paraguay, meanwhile, are (standing) up for their own interests and beliefs by supporting a democratic Taiwan,” he said.",2023/02/18,1095,Politics

            The Anchorage Fire Department confirmed the death of one victim after a building housing the Turnagain CrossFit gym collapsed, the Anchorage Daily News reported.

            Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson tweeted that the fire department and the Anchorage Police Department responded to reports of the building collapse at 5:25 p.m.











            Fire department Assistant Chief Brian Partch said more than 10 people were inside when the building collapsed and three were trapped in the structure east of Old Seward Highway, the newspaper reported. 

            Firefighters located and were able to speak to one person while working for about an hour to cut away debris. The victim was then removed and transported to a hospital, officials said.

            “We had our search and rescue crews jump in and they started shoring up the building to make it safe for the rescuers and to protect the individual who was trapped in the building,” Partch said.

            Fire department Assistant Chief Alex Boyd said another person escaped the building without assistance and was treated at the scene by first responders.

            Partch said first responders were working with Municipality of Anchorage engineers and others to stabilize the building debris to recover the deceased victim, who was not immediately identified. 

            The cause of the collapse was unclear and would be investigated by inspectors and structural engineers, Boyd said, noting that initial speculation was the weight of snow on the building was a contributing factor.

            About a third of the building experienced significant structural damage and officials were concerned other areas may be impacted.

            “With one area of failure, we’re concerned about other areas of failure,” Boyd said.

            People were evacuated from businesses in parts of the building beyond the gym and engineers will determine when it is safe to return, possibly within 48 hours, Boyd said.

            Bronson thanked the fire and police departments for their “incredible response” and professionalism and said he and his wife were praying for the loved ones of the deceased victim.

            Organizers issued a statement later saying a “weather event” at the conclusion of racing caused significant damage to wing sails and at least one boat and forced the cancellation of the two fleet races scheduled for Sunday. Team Canada's wing was badly damaged when it was hit by a gust and blown into a canvas shelter while being lifted by a crane. Vision of the scene shows workers and spectators running for safety as the equipment is flung around in the wind.

            It capped an eventful day on Sydney Harbour.











            Delapierre won the opening race after the New Zealand team was penalized at the start for going a fraction too early, the Australian team was penalized at the last gate and the British team lost a sailor overboard.

            Spithill’s U.S. team placed second in the first two races and fifth in the third to hold second spot with 24 points, and the two-time defending series champion Australians were third after a difficult day with 20 points, one ahead of Emirates GBR. Denmark was in fifth place on 18 points, New Zealand was in sixth place on 17 and Canada had 14.

            “We tried to push harder in these tricky conditions and it was quite rough,” Delapierre said. ”I tried to keep the boat in a safe position and tried to get the right start and for now it works.”

            Gusting winds also caused dramas off the course.

            “After racing today, a major weather event occurred that has resulted in significant damage,” organizers said in a statement. ""As far as we know, no one was seriously injured during the incident. As a result of the damage, SailGP has had to cancel racing for the second day of the Sydney event.

            “A full assessment of the damage is underway but it is likely some of the future SailGP events may also need to be delayed.”

            The Aussies were going for a hat trick on home waters in the Australia Sail Grand Prix, the third-to-last regatta of SailGP’s third season but had technical problems before and during the first race and had to settle for third, fourth and sixth in the three races.

            Team Australia initially said it wouldn't be able to make the start because of mechanical problems but then rejoined the fleet with 30 seconds to go, taking an early lead and holding it until incurring a penalty at the last gate.

            GBR briefly surged to the lead but grinder Matt Gotrel slipped and fell overboard and the British dropped back to sixth as the crew pulled him back in, allowing the French and Americans to sail to first and second.

            GBR strategist Hannah Mills said Gotrel was fine, but ""it was a pretty scary situation — he went straight over the front, but the guys did a great job getting him back on board.”

            Ahead of the weekend, Team Australia held a nine-point lead in the season standings over New Zealand, with Britain’s Ben Ainslie another five points back.

            Spithill said the wind “really played havoc” with the racing among the nine 50-foot catamarans on Saturday.

            “The gusts were like bullets hitting,"" he said during a TV interview. “Downwind when you're going head to head with other boats, it's full on.”

            After two light-air regattas in Dubai and Singapore, won by Australia and New Zealand, the season had been set to wrap up in the windier venues of Sydney, Christchurch and San Francisco. The top three teams at the end of the San Francisco regatta will sail in the $1 million Grand Final.

            The U.S. team is lagging in the season standings and needed to finish strongly to have any chance of qualifying for the winner-take-all Grand Final.

            Spithill had been confident after Day 1.

            “We have no choice but to really get a good event this time,” he said. “We've done a lot of work after the last event. We've definitely got the hammer down and we're full throttle into tomorrow.”

We've definitely got the hammer down and we're full throttle into tomorrow.”__More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814276,"Ukraine invasion reshaped global alliances, renewed fears","BANGKOK (AP) — Nearly a year after Russia invaded Ukraine, the battlefield has narrowed and stiff resistance has forced Moscow to scale back its military goals. But the diplomatic consequences of the war still reverberate worldwide.

            The fighting has reshaped global alliances, renewed old anxieties and breathed new life into NATO and the bond between Europe and the United States.

            The invasion drew Moscow closer to Beijing and the pariah states of Iran and North Korea. It also raised broad questions about sovereignty, security and the use of military power, while intensifying fears about China’s designs on Taiwan.











            “The war underscores the interrelationship between diplomacy and the use of force in a way that has not been thought about in quite the same fashion for many, many years,” said Ian Lesser, vice president of the German Marshall Fund think tank.

            When Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, it “marked the complete end of the post-Cold War world,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said last month in a speech at Johns Hopkins University. “It has come to light that globalization and interdependence alone cannot serve as a guarantor for peace and development across the globe.”

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukraine is an “integral part” of Russian history that never achieved “real statehood” — a stance that echoes Chinese President Xi Jinping’s position on Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own.

            Some six months after the invasion of Ukraine, China issued a white paper on Taiwan, saying the island “has been an integral part of China’s territory since ancient times.” The paper said Beijing seeks “peaceful reunification” but “will not renounce the use of force.”

            China’s designs on Taiwan date to well before the war in Ukraine, but China stepped up its pressure over the past year or more, including firing ballistic missiles over the island and into Japanese waters in August in response to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.

            If Russia is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, it could further embolden countries like China, with its visions of an international order “that diverge from ours and that we can never accept,” Kishida said.

            He pledged to use Japan’s presidency of the G7 this year to strengthen “the unity of like-minded countries” against Russian aggression.

            “If we let this unilateral change of the status quo by force go unchallenged, it will happen elsewhere in the world, including Asia,” he said.

            A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be far more complicated than Russia’s attack on Ukraine, said Euan Graham, a Singapore-based expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

            “Russia's incompetent performance on the battlefield in Ukraine has to give pause to any military or senior political leader in China about an adventure on a much more ambitious scale with Taiwan,” Graham said.

            But the fear is real. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen extended the nation’s compulsory military service in a December announcement that referenced the war in Ukraine.

            “They’ve drawn the lesson from Ukraine that you need to have a larger military reserve if there is a conflict,” Graham said.

            North Korea, which has threatened to preemptively use nuclear weapons in a broad range of scenarios, was already a regional concern. But Russia’s suggestion that it could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine fueled new worries.

            South Korea, which is under the protection of the American “nuclear umbrella,” last year expanded exercises with the U.S. military that had been downsized under the Trump administration. South Korea is also seeking stronger assurances that Washington will swiftly use its nuclear capabilities in the face of a North Korean nuclear attack.

            North Korea has been strongly supportive of neighboring Russia. Late last year, the U.S. accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with artillery shells.

            Iran has also been helping Russia militarily, providing the bomb-carrying drones Moscow uses to strike power plants and civilian sites throughout Ukraine.

            While Western allies have cooperated closely in their responses to the war, a major diplomatic challenge has been to convince much of the rest of the world of the invasion’s significance.

            Only a handful of countries in Asia have taken tough action against Moscow, and many abstained from the United Nations resolution condemning the attack.

            Just weeks before the invasion, China declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia. It has refused to criticize the war and has drawn closer to Russia, buying more of its oil and gas and helping Moscow to offset Western sanctions.

            But there are signs of “complicated fault lines” in the China-Russia relationship, Jude Blanchette, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a call with reporters.

            During September talks in Uzbekistan, the Chinese president raised unspecified “concerns” with Putin over the invasion, though at the same time promised “strong support” to Russia’s “core interests.”

            “I think if Xi Jinping could snap his fingers, he would like to see the war end but in a way that Russia comes out of this with Putin in power and Russia continuing to be a strong strategic partner,” Blanchette said.

            India, which is heavily reliant on Russia for military equipment, also abstained from the U.N. resolution and has continued to purchase Russian oil.

            But as regional rival China moves closer to Russia, India has quietly drifted toward the U.S., especially within the four Quad nations that also include Japan and Australia, said Viraj Solanki, a London-based expert with the IISS think tank.

            In Europe, the invasion has reinvigorated NATO after a barrage of criticism from Donald Trump during his presidency that led French President Emmanuel Macron to declare the alliance had experienced “brain death.”

            NATO member countries and allies have rallied to support Ukraine, with several changing policies that prohibited the export of weapons to countries in conflict. Perhaps most remarkably, Germany shed post-World War II taboos and provided Leopard battle tanks.

            The war also prompted Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, which most experts think will be approved this year.

            NATO last year singled out China for the first time as a strategic challenge, although not a direct adversary. The alliance warned about China’s growing military ambitions, its confrontational rhetoric and its increasingly close ties to Russia.

            Beyond NATO, the war has also underscored the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and European Union, which Lesser said has been “absolutely critical” to sanctions and export controls.

            China insists that it is the U.S. that started the Ukraine crisis, partially through NATO’s expansion into more Eastern European countries. Beijing has also criticized the alliance for suggesting the war could influence China’s actions in Asia.

            “NATO claims to be a regional defense organization, but it keeps breaking through the territory and field, stirring up conflicts, creating tension, exaggerating threats and encouraging confrontation,” Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday.

            The war’s long-term effects on global diplomacy are difficult to predict. But Lesser said one thing is certain: It will be “very hard for Russia to recover from the damage to its reputation on many levels.”

            A core group of countries such as Syria, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela “may be inclined to stick with Russia,” he said. But in terms of broader diplomacy, Russia’s reputation ”has experienced an enormous blow.”

Braun, BD, Baihe Medical, Cook Medical, Lepu Medical, Smith Medical, TuoRen, SCW MEDICATHA Central Venous Catheter (CVC) is a type of catheter that is placed into a large vein in the body, usually in the neck, chest, or groin area. The catheter is then threaded through the vein until it reaches a larger vein near the heart. CVCs can be used to administer medication, fluids, blood products, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) directly into the bloodstream. There are different types of CVCs, including tunneled and non-tunneled catheters. Non-tunneled catheters are inserted through the skin directly into the vein, while tunneled catheters are inserted through a small incision in the skin and tunneled under the skin to the vein. Tunneled catheters are typically used for long-term access.Single-lumen

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814322,"In Baltics, Poland, grassroots groups strive to help Ukraine","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — In a dusty workshop in northern Lithuania, a dozen men are transforming hundreds of wheel rims into potbelly stoves to warm Ukrainians huddled in trenches and bomb shelters. As the sparks subside, one welder marks the countertop: 36 made that day. Hours later, they've reached 60.

            People from across Lithuania send old wheel rims to the volunteers gathering weekly in Siauliai, the Baltic country’s fourth-largest city. Two cars loaded with wood stoves wait outside the workshop ahead of the long night drive south.

            Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — three states on NATO’s eastern flank scarred by decades of Soviet-era occupation — have been among the top donors to Kyiv.











            Linas Kojala, director of the Europe Studies Center in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, said Ukraine’s successful resistance “is a matter of existential importance” to the Baltic countries, which share its experience of Russian rule.

            “Not only political elites, but entire societies are involved in supporting Ukraine,” Kojala told the AP.

            In Siauliai, Edgaras Liakavicius said his team has sent about 600 stoves to Ukraine.

            “Everybody here ... understands the situation of every man, every soldier, the conditions they live in now in Ukraine,” Liakavicius, who works for a local metal processing plant, told the AP. 

            Jaana Ratas, who heads an effort in Tallinn, Estonia to make camouflage nets for Ukrainian soldiers, echoed his words.

            “My family and most Estonians, they still remember (the Soviet occupation),” she said.

            Ratas chose a symbolic location for her project. Five days a week, Estonian and Ukrainian women gather at Tallinn’s Museum of Occupations and Freedom to weave the nets from donated fabrics.

            Lyudmila Likhopud, a 76-year-old refugee from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, said the work has lifted her out of depression.

            “I started feeling that I can be useful,” she told the AP.

            In Latvia’s capital of Riga, Anzhela Kazakova — who ran a furniture store in the Black Sea port of Odesa — is one of 30 Ukrainian refugees working for Atlas Aerospace, a drone manufacturer that has supplied more than 300 kits to the Ukrainian army.

            Ivan Tolchinsky, Atlas Aerospace’s founder and CEO, grew up in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, held by Kremlin-backed separatists since 2014. He had long petitioned both the EU and Ukraine to supply drones to Kyiv’s forces fighting the separatists. Final permission arrived a day before Moscow’s full-scale invasion, he said.

            Atlas Aerospace has since increased production 20-fold, Tolchinsky said, and is planning to open a site in Ukraine despite withering Russian strikes on infrastructure.

            Tolchinsky’s drones are just some of the weapons flowing to Kyiv from its Baltic allies. Together with their southern neighbor Poland — another NATO and European Union member with a history of Soviet oppression — the three small states rank among the biggest donors per gross domestic product helping Ukraine.

            Lithuania, with a mere 2.8 million inhabitants, was the first country to send Stinger air defense missiles, according to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

            One of the latest Lithuanian initiatives is a crowdfunding drive to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian drones and missiles. Launched in late January, it initially aimed to raise 5 million euros by the Feb. 24 first anniversary of the invasion. That goal was reached within weeks, and organizers have since doubled it as donations keep flowing.

            One fundraising group has grown into a major player that participates in international tenders purchasing military equipment for Kyiv.

            “We have expanded 10 times in less than a year. (We used to supply) five drones in one batch, but now it’s 50 or more,” said Jonas Ohman, founder of the nongovernmental organization Blue/Yellow. The group recently won a bid for military optics, edging out rivals including the Indian military, and clinched a contract with an Israeli company for multi-purpose high sensitivity radars for Kyiv.

            “It’s entirely another level now,” Ohman said.

            In Poland, millions of zlotys have been raised to fund everything from advanced weapons to treating the wounded. Backed by over 220,000 contributors, journalist Slawomir Sierakowski was able to gather almost 25 million zlotys ($5.6 million) to buy an advanced Bayraktar drone for Ukraine.

            Ohman, the head of the Lithuanian NGO, drew parallels between his compatriots’ readiness to help Kyiv and local partisan movements fighting Soviet rule after World War II.

            “It is about personal responsibility in tough times,"" he said. “Just like in 1945 when (the) Soviets returned, the government was gone, but the struggle for freedom continued in the woods for years.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814324,"Grieving Ukrainian mom finds refuge in UK, but little solace","LONDON (AP) — The small English village that Viktoria Kovalenko now calls home is peaceful, sleepy — a far cry from the fighting in Ukraine that killed her family in one horrific, unexpected blow. Her memories are a different matter.

            “It’s a condition that I can’t control. Sometimes I think everything is fine. Sometimes I cry for no reason,” she told The Associated Press from her house in Kent, southeast England.

            “What happened to my husband and my daughter will stay with me all my life,” she added. “It is impossible to cure.”











            Kovalenko, 34, saw her husband Petro and 12-year-old daughter Veronika die in northern Ukraine last March when a shell hit their car. Kovalenko survived, along with her then 1-year-old baby, Varvara, but Russian soldiers held them captive in a school basement for three weeks. 

            Almost a year on, Kovalenko has a temporary new home through the kindness of volunteers who helped her cross borders and apply for a U.K. visa.

            Like tens of thousands of other Ukrainians who have fled to Britain, she’s slowly getting used to her new life in the U.K. Her English is improving day by day. She keeps busy taking care of Varvara, now 2, who toddles everywhere with no fear and loves British chocolate. She shares her refuge with her brother, his wife and their two young girls, who escaped unharmed.

            But Kovalenko still wells up when she speaks about Petro and Veronika or looks at their framed photos next to her bed. And every day she longs to return to Chernihiv, the city she fled when war broke out last February.

            After the shell landed on March 5, 2022, killing Petro and Veronika, Viktoria Kovalenko and Varvara hid in an abandoned building, but next day were found by Russian soldiers who took them to a gym in a school basement. There the mother and child were held for 24 days, along with about 300 people including 2-month-old babies, as well as elderly villagers who later died in captivity.

            “It was very crowded, it was always dark and dirty. There was no fresh air at all. People were sick and coughing, some slept on the floor, or on chairs, or even standing against the wall,” Kovalenko recalled. “It can be said we were lucky because the soldiers who held us were not soldiers who were in (Kyiv suburbs) Bucha, Irpin or somewhere else, who just killed everyone in a row.”

            When the Russians retreated from the area in early April, Kovalenko got out and later found her way to the western city of Lviv, then on to Poland, where she joined her brother and his family.

            It was in Poland that a volunteer reached out and offered to help find her refuge in the U.K. The volunteer was working with Derek Edwards, a Briton who set up an organization called Homes for Ukraine soon after the war started, to help transport dozens of refugees to safe housing in England. Edwards had read the AP article on Kovalenko’s story and decided to help.

            Kovalenko said she knew next to nothing about the U.K., but decided to go anyway because she thought being on the move would help her process her grief.

            “I just wanted something new, to constantly change the circumstances around me,” she said. “I thought I could escape evil thoughts. But it didn’t help much.”

            In December, six months after Edwards first submitted her visa request, Kovalenko finally arrived in Kent. Edwards had picked up Kovalenko and her relatives from Poland, and found her a former vicar's house with the help of church officials. She took in the quiet country lanes, the village green and old brick houses, the everyday luxuries that British people take for granted.

            But all she could think about was returning to her apartment block in Chernihiv. By year end, the war could be over, she said hopefully. Then, she said, she could restart therapy, find a job and rebuild her life.

            “Ukraine alone will not be able to win this,” Kovalenko said. “If the whole world ... gives us more weapons now, then perhaps the war will end faster.”

            “I hope that by the time I can go to work — when Varvara is older — I will have returned to Ukraine,"" she added. “It’s not because I don’t like it here, but it’s not home.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814347,China representative met with protests on visit to Taiwan,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A visit by a Chinese official at the invitation of the Taiwanese capital’s newly elected China-friendly mayor has drawn protests on the self-ruled island. 

            The head of Shanghai city's Taiwan Affairs Office, Li Xiaodong, arrived Saturday morning for a three-day visit that marks a rare point of contact between the sides.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814348,"Key developments in the aftermath of the Turkey, Syria quake","ISTANBUL (AP) — Search and rescue teams amazingly found more survivors in the ruins of the Feb. 6 earthquake that devastated swaths of Turkey and Syria even as the death toll from worst disaster in modern Turkish history increased. 

            Here’s a look at the key developments Saturday from the aftermath of the earthquake.

            DEATH TOLL IN TURKEY PASSES 40,000











            The president of Turkey's disaster and emergency management agency, Yunus Sezer, said the number of earthquake deaths in the country has grown to 40,642. 

            The new figure takes the combined death toll in Turkey and Syria to 44,330. The U.N. has said the full scope of the deaths in Syria may take time to determine. 

            THREE RESCUED IN HARD-HIT HATAY PROVINCE

            
                A couple and their son were extracted from under an apartment building in Antakya, the capital of Hatay province, on the 13th day of rescue operations, although the child later died.

            The three were transferred to ambulances after spending 296 hours buried under the Kanatli apartment building in the center of the city, local TV reported. Footage showed medics fixing an IV drip to the man’s arm as he lay on a stretcher.

            Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency identified the family as Samir Muhammed Accar, 49, his wife, Ragda, 40, and their 12-year-old son. 

            The bodies of the couple's two other children were also found in the rubble, reports said, quoting a member of a Kyrgyz rescue team.

            
                Hatay was one of the worst hit of the 11 provinces in the Turkish disaster zone. 

            MISSING SOCCER PLAYER’S BODY FOUND

            Search teams have recovered the body of Ghanaian international soccer player Christian Atsu in the ruins of a building that collapsed during the earthquake, his manager said Saturday. 

            The remains of the 31-year-old soccer star, who had been playing for Turkish Super Lig club Hatayspor, were found in what was left of a luxury 12-story building in Antakya, the same city where the Accar family was found. 

            “Atsu’s lifeless body was found under the rubble. At the moment, his belongings are still being removed,” the player's manager, Murat Uzunmehmet, told private Turkish news agency DHA.

            Atsu, who previously played for English Premier League clubs Chelsea, Newcastle United, Everton and Bournemouth, signed with Hatayspor late last year.

            The Turkish club said his body was being repatriated to Ghana. “There are no words to describe our sadness,” the club tweeted.

            Reports a day after the quake struck had said that Atsu was pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed building and taken to a hospital for treatment. The club, however, announced days later that Atsu and the club’s sporting director, Taner Savut, were still missing. Savut has not been found.

            The contractor who build the Ronesans Rezidans building, where Atsu and Savut lived, was detained at Istanbul Airport a week ago, apparently trying to leave the country.

            A TEEN PREPARING FOR DEATH

            A teenager who was buried under tons of debris in southeastern Turkey's city of Adiyaman filmed what he thought was his final message to family and friends after the earthquake hit. 

            Instead, Taha Erdem was pulled from the rubble two hours later by neighbors and taken to an aunt’s home. His parents and siblings also would be saved. 

            The video the 17-year-old high school student recorded on his cellphone from a cramped space amid the concrete and twisted metal when he thought death was near has become a power affirmation of life. 

            Taha appears remarkably calm as the screams of neighbors are heard in the background, as well as the sound of shifting rubble as powerful aftershocks continue to pound the collapsed building. 

            He listed his injuries and spoke of his regrets and the things he hoped to do if he emerged alive. 

            “Death, my friends, comes at a time when one is least expecting it.” he said, before reciting a Muslim prayer in Arabic.

            When The Associated Press spoke to the family on Thursday, they were living in a government-provided tent, along with hundreds of thousands of other survivors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814349,"North Korea fires missile as US, S. Korea prepare for drills","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Saturday fired a long-range missile from its capital into the sea off Japan, according to its neighbors, a day after it threatened to take strong measures against South Korea and the U.S. over their joint military exercises. 

            According to the South Korean and Japanese militaries, the missile was fired on a high angle, apparently to avoid reaching the neighbors' territories, and traveled about 900 kilometers (560 miles) at a maximum altitude of 5,700 kilometers (3,500 miles) during an hourlong flight. 

            The details were similar to North Korea’s Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile test flight in November, which experts said demonstrated potential to reach the U.S. mainland if fired on a normal trajectory. 











            Japanese government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said no damage was reported from the missile, which landed within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Oshima island. Oshima lies off the western coast of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido.

            North Korea’s Foreign Ministry on Friday threatened with ""unprecedently"" strong action against its rivals, after South Korea announced a series of military exercises with the United States aimed at sharpening their response to the North’s growing threats. 

            While the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory, or its allies, the White House National Security Council said it needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region. 

            “It only demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,” it said, calling it a “flagrant violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.” 

            The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said his national security director, Kim Sung-han, presided over an emergency security meeting that accused the North of escalating regional tensions. It denounced North Korea for accelerating its nuclear arms development despite signs of worsening economic problems and food insecurity, saying such actions would bring only tougher international sanctions. 

            Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul over the launch, which he called “an act of violence that escalates provocation toward the international order.” 

            The launch was North Korea’s first since Jan. 1, when it test-fired a short-range weapon. It followed a massive military parade in Pyongyang last week, where troops rolled out more than a dozen ICBMs as leader Kim Jong Un watched in delight from a balcony.

            The unprecedented number of missiles underscored a continuation of expansion of his country’s military capabilities despite limited resources while negotiations with Washington remain stalemated. 

            Those missiles included a new system experts say is possibly linked to the North’s stated desire to acquire a solid-fuel ICBM. North Korea’s existing ICBMs, including Hwasong-17s, use liquid propellants that require pre-launch injections and cannot remain fueled for prolonged periods. A solid-fuel alternative would take less time to prepare and is easier to move around on vehicles, providing less opportunity to be spotted. 

            It wasn’t immediately clear whether Saturday’s launch involved a solid-fuel system.

            “North Korean missile firings are often tests of technologies under development, and it will be notable if Pyongyang claims progress with a long-range solid-fuel missile,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The Kim regime may also tout this launch as a response to U.S. defense cooperation with South Korea and sanctions diplomacy at the United Nations.”

            North Korea is coming off a record year in weapons demonstrations with more than 70 ballistic missiles fired, including those with potential to reach the U.S. mainland. The North also conducted a slew of launches it described as simulated nuclear attacks against South Korean and U.S. targets in response to the allies’ resumption of large-scale joint military exercise that had been downsized for years.

            North Korea’s missile tests have been punctuated by threats of preemptive nuclear attacks against South Korea or the United States over what it perceives as a broad range of scenarios that put its leadership under threat. 

            Kim doubled down on his nuclear push entering 2023, calling for an “exponential increase” in the country’s nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting “enemy” South Korea and the development of more advanced ICBMs.

            The North Korean statement on Friday accused Washington and Seoul of planning more than 20 rounds of military drills this year, including large-scale field exercises, and described its rivals as “the arch-criminals deliberately disrupting regional peace and stability.”

            South Korea’s Defense Ministry officials told lawmakers earlier that Seoul and Washington will hold an annual computer-simulated combined training in mid-March. The 11-day training will reflect North Korea’s nuclear threats, as well as unspecified lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Heo Tae-keun, South Korea’s deputy minister of national defense policy. Heo said the countries will also conduct joint field exercises in mid-March that would be bigger than those held in the past few years.

            South Korea and the U.S. will also hold a one-day tabletop exercise next week at the Pentagon to sharpen a response to a potential use of nuclear weapons by North Korea. 

            North Korea has traditionally described U.S.-South Korea military exercises as rehearsals for a potential invasion, while the allies insist that their drills are defensive in nature.

            The United States and South Korea had downsized or canceled some of their major drills in recent years, first to support the former Trump administration’s diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang and then because of COVID-19. But North Korea’s growing nuclear threats have raised the urgency for South Korea and Japan to strengthen their defense postures in line with their alliances with the United States.

            South Korea has been seeking reassurances that United States will swiftly and decisively use its nuclear capabilities to protect its ally in face of a North Korean nuclear attack. In expanding its military exercises with South Korea, the United States has also expressed commitment to increase its deployment of strategic military assets like fighter jets and aircraft carriers to the Korean Peninsula in a show of strength. 

            In December, Japan made a major break from its strictly self-defense-only post-World War II principle, adopting a new national security strategy that includes preemptive strikes and cruise missiles to counter growing threats from North Korea, China and Russia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814351,Nigerian cash crisis brings pain: ‘Everything is just tough',"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — No one in Godgift Inemesit’s family of eight is sure when they will eat each day — except for her three kids, two of whom have malaria. She can't pay for the drugs they need or feed the rest of her family regularly. 

            Like most Nigerians, the family's savings are trapped in the bank. A changeover to redesigned currency has plunged Africa's largest economy into crisis just ahead of a presidential election: There aren't enough new banknotes in a country reliant on cash.

            For Inemesit, 28, the shortage of cash means even basics like food and medicine are getting trimmed for her husband, mother, kids ages 4 to 8 and two other relatives. One recent afternoon, only the children had gotten bread and hot drinks.











            “We usually eat three square meals, but now we eat once sometimes because there is no money to use,” Inemesit said in her house in Banana village, an overcrowded shanty town tucked in the southern corner of the Nigerian capital of Abuja. 

            “We were told to drop the old currency (notes) in the bank and that new one is coming,"" she said. “But we don’t have the new currency and no old currency. Everything is just tough.”

            Customers are waiting all day at banks and ATMs to withdraw only enough money — called naira — to last a day. Fights have broken out in bank halls, angry customers have attacked workers and protesters have set financial institutions on fire. Businesses unable carry out transactions have been forced to close, and people are illegally selling new currency notes at higher rates.

            As people become more desperate for cash, the impact is likely to spill into the Feb. 25 presidential election. Nigerians hope to elect someone to fix challenges ranging from a security crisis that has killed thousands in the past year to an ailing economy. 

            The shortage of currency ""has already created significant hardship, which could make a greater number of voters vulnerable to vote-buying and ratchet up election tensions even further,"" said the International Crisis Group, which works to prevent conflict.

            
                Facing increasing pressure to find a solution, President Muhammadu Buhari, who has reached his term limits and leaves office in May, said he directed the Central Bank of Nigeria to “deploy all legitimate resources and legal means” to ensure people “enjoy easy access to cash withdrawal.”

            “I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathize with you all over these unintended outcomes,” he said, while still defending the changes.

            Experts blame policymakers for a “rushed” introduction of the new naira notes. Central bank leader Godwin Emefiele argued that some government officials are “buying the new notes and storing them for whatever purposes.”

            The central bank has said the revamped currency would help curb money laundering before the election, transform the West African nation into a cashless economy and fight inflation of over 21%, a 17-year high. 

            Inemesit said she — like many others — have started losing interest in the election, dampening hopes of increased voter participation after years of steady decline in turnout.

            She voted in 2019 when only 34% of registered voters cast their ballot for president. But as this year’s election draws closer, her vote and hopes for a better country have been dashed.

            “With what we are facing now, I don’t have the aim of voting again. When you don’t have the strength to walk to where they are voting, how will you be able to vote?” she said.

            The cash shortages have made life even more difficult in Nigeria, where 63% of the population is poor, 33% is unemployed and as of 2021, only 45% of adults had a bank account, according to the World Bank. The crisis has added to the woes of surging inflation and a weakened currency.

            The three top contenders in the presidential race have made pledges to deliver democratic change to Nigerians. The ruling party’s Bola Tinubu has said he is seeking to “renew hope,” while the main opposition party’s Atiku Abubakar wants to “rescue” Nigeria. The Labour Party’s Peter Obi — who leads the crowded field in recent polls — has p romised to “rebuild” the country.

            Lack of access to cash has affected consumption patterns and trade for small and medium businesses in the informal sector, a major employer that includes farming, street and market trade, and public transport, said Joachim MacEbong, a senior governance analyst at Stears, a Nigerian intelligence company. 

            The central bank’s yearslong push to make the economy cashless led digital transactions to increase 150% last year. However, unreliable digital payment platforms have forced many businesses to use paper naira.

            “The cost of denying people access to cash far outweighs any benefit,” MacEbong said.

            At ATMs, people are making choices they never would have imagined: Sunny Eze, a father of two, was hungry but was saving the little money on him for transportation if he couldn't get cash. Esther Ugonna waited for about 10 hours to withdraw 10,000 naira ($22). Nasir Yusuf closed his shop for the day, devoting his time to trying to withdraw cash he needed.

            Inemesit, meanwhile, waited in line until 8 p.m. one day last week and returned home empty-handed. Like dozens of others, she was told the bank branch had run out of new banknotes.

            “If someone were to tell me that I can have the money but I cannot make use of the money, I would not believe it,” she said, frustrated and downcast. With her 1.7 million naira ($3,680) in the bank, “you have the money, but you cannot see it.”

            The family’s income from selling bags such as luggage and backpacks has fallen drastically as Nigerians with little cash on hand are prioritizing food over other needs.

            “People will not leave feeding their family to come and buy bags,” she said.

            The crisis has left Inemesit too tired and frustrated to think of the upcoming presidential vote.

            “The government failed us very well. They disappointed us,” she said, grabbing her 4-year-old who was coughing incessantly. “Things are difficult and everything has been increasing prices.”ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — No one in Godgift Inemesit’s family of eight is sure when they will eat each day — except for her three kids, two of whom have malaria. She can't pay for the drugs they need or feed the rest of her family regularly.Like most Nigerians, the family's savings are trapped in the bank. A changeover to redesigned currency has plunged Africa's largest economy into crisis just ahead of a presidential election: There aren't enough new banknotes in a country reliant on cash.For Inemesit, 28, the shortage of cash means even basics like food and medicine are getting trimmed for her husband, mother, kids ages 4 to 8 and two other relatives. One recent afternoon, only the children had gotten bread and hot drinks.“We usually eat three square meals, but now we eat once sometimes because there is no money to use,” Inemesit said in her house in Banana village, an overcrowded shanty town tucked in the southern corner of the Nigerian capital of Abuja.“We were told to drop the old currency (notes) in the bank and that new one is coming,"" she said. “But we don’t have the new currency and no old currency. Everything is just tough.”Customers are waiting all day at banks and ATMs to withdraw only enough money — called naira — to last a day. Fights have broken out in bank halls, angry customers have attacked workers and protesters have set financial institutions on fire. Businesses unable carry out transactions have been forced to close, and people are illegally selling new currency notes at higher rates.As people become more desperate for cash, the impact is likely to spill into the Feb. 25 presidential election. Nigerians hope to elect someone to fix challenges ranging from a security crisis that has killed thousands in the past year to an ailing economy.The shortage of currency ""has already created significant hardship, which could make a greater number of voters vulnerable to vote-buying and ratchet up election tensions even further,"" said the International Crisis Group, which works to prevent conflict.Facing increasing pressure to find a solution, President Muhammadu Buhari, who has reached his term limits and leaves office in May, said he directed the Central Bank of Nigeria to “deploy all legitimate resources and legal means” to ensure people “enjoy easy access to cash withdrawal.”“I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathize with you all over these unintended outcomes,” he said, while still defending the changes.Experts blame policymakers for a “rushed” introduction of the new naira notes. Central bank leader Godwin Emefiele argued that some government officials are “buying the new notes and storing them for whatever purposes.”The central bank has said the revamped currency would help curb money laundering before the election, transform the West African nation into a cashless economy and fight inflation of over 21%, a 17-year high.Inemesit said she — like many others — have started losing interest in the election, dampening hopes of increased voter participation after years of steady decline in turnout.She voted in 2019 when only 34% of registered voters cast their ballot for president. But as this year’s election draws closer, her vote and hopes for a better country have been dashed.“With what we are facing now, I don’t have the aim of voting again. When you don’t have the strength to walk to where they are voting, how will you be able to vote?” she said.The cash shortages have made life even more difficult in Nigeria, where 63% of the population is poor, 33% is unemployed and as of 2021, only 45% of adults had a bank account, according to the World Bank. The crisis has added to the woes of surging inflation and a weakened currency.The three top contenders in the presidential race have made pledges to deliver democratic change to Nigerians. The ruling party’s Bola Tinubu has said he is seeking to “renew hope,” while the main opposition party’s Atiku Abubakar wants to “rescue” Nigeria. The Labour Party’s Peter Obi — who leads the crowded field in recent polls — has p romised to “rebuild” the country.Lack of access to cash has affected consumption patterns and trade for small and medium businesses in the informal sector, a major employer that includes farming, street and market trade, and public transport, said Joachim MacEbong, a senior governance analyst at Stears, a Nigerian intelligence company.The central bank’s yearslong push to make the economy cashless led digital transactions to increase 150% last year. However, unreliable digital payment platforms have forced many businesses to use paper naira.“The cost of denying people access to cash far outweighs any benefit,” MacEbong said.At ATMs, people are making choices they never would have imagined: Sunny Eze, a father of two, was hungry but was saving the little money on him for transportation if he couldn't get cash. Esther Ugonna waited for about 10 hours to withdraw 10,000 naira ($22). Nasir Yusuf closed his shop for the day, devoting his time to trying to withdraw cash he needed.Inemesit, meanwhile, waited in line until 8 p.m. one day last week and returned home empty-handed. Like dozens of others, she was told the bank branch had run out of new banknotes.“If someone were to tell me that I can have the money but I cannot make use of the money, I would not believe it,” she said, frustrated and downcast. With her 1.7 million naira ($3,680) in the bank, “you have the money, but you cannot see it.”The family’s income from selling bags such as luggage and backpacks has fallen drastically as Nigerians with little cash on hand are prioritizing food over other needs.“People will not leave feeding their family to come and buy bags,” she said.The crisis has left Inemesit too tired and frustrated to think of the upcoming presidential vote.“The government failed us very well.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814378,Ghana soccer player Christian Atsu dies in Turkey earthquake,"Christian Atsu, the Ghana international forward who played for Premier League clubs Chelsea and Newcastle, has died in the earthquake in Turkey. He was 31.

            Search teams recovered Atsu's body in the ruins of a luxury 12-story building where he had been living in the city of Antakya, Hatay province, his manager said Saturday.

            “Atsu’s lifeless body was found under the rubble. At the moment, his belongings are still being removed,” manager Murat Uzunmehmet told private news agency DHA.











            Atsu joined Turkish club Hatayspor in September and scored the winning goal for his new team in a league game at home against Kasimpaşa S.K. on Feb. 5, just hours before the earthquake struck in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 6.

            Antakya, the city where Hatayspor is based, is in the southern region of Turkey hardest hit by the earthquake.

            The death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria passed 43,000 on Friday.

            Hatayspor said Atsu’s body was being repatriated to Ghana. “There are no words to describe our sadness,” the club tweeted.

            Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo posted a photo of Atsu on his official Twitter account and wrote: “Ghana football has lost one of its finest personnel and ambassadors, one who will be difficult to replace. He’ll be sorely missed.”

            Former Ghana captain and teammate Asamoah Gyan tweeted “RIP Brother.”

            A day after the earthquake there were reports that Atsu had been rescued but Hatayspor, after initially announcing that it had received information that Atsu was alive and on his way to the hospital, said later that the reports of a successful rescue were, heartbreakingly, mistaken and the player was still missing. It had also said the club’s sporting director, Taner Savut, was still missing. Savut has not yet been found.

            The contractor of the 12-story Ronesans Rezidans building — where Atsu and Savut lived — was detained at Istanbul Airport a week ago, apparently trying to leave the country.

            Atsu's agent, Nana Sechere, traveled to Turkey with members of Atsu's family in an attempt to find him, holding onto hopes that he might be alive amid the wreckage. Sechere had urged authorities and Hatayspor officials to step up their efforts in the search for Atsu and Savut.

            In a statement Tuesday, Sechere said rescuers had been able to pinpoint Atsu's exact room location in his collapsed apartment building over a week after the devastating earthquake but the only thing they recovered were two pairs of his shoes.

            Sechere confirmed Saturday that Atsu’s body was found. He posted a message on Twitter: “My deepest condolences go to his family and loved ones.""

            Atsu played more than 60 times for Ghana and scored on his debut as a 20-year-old in 2012. He was part of the Ghana squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and starred at the 2015 African Cup of Nations, scoring two goals to help Ghana to the final, where it lost in a penalty shootout to Ivory Coast.

            He was named the player of the tournament at that African Cup.

            Atsu was signed by Chelsea in 2013 but his time there was limited to appearances in exhibition games and he was sent out on loan to various clubs over the next four years. The winger joined Newcastle on loan in 2016 and was part of the team that won promotion back to the Premier League in the 2016-17 season.

            He signed a permanent deal with Newcastle in 2017 and spent four years there. The club said Saturday it was “profoundly saddened” by Atsu's death.

            “A talented player and a special person, he will always be fondly remembered by our players, staff and supporters,” Newcastle tweeted.

            The Ghana Football Association added: “We would like to express our deepest condolences to his wife and children, the family, loved ones and the football community.”

            Atsu joined Hatayspor last year after a short spell playing in Saudi Arabia.

            Ibrahim Kwarteng, a friend of Atsu's in Ghana, told The Associated Press in a recent interview that he knew the player as someone who helped people in his West African home country as much as he could.

            Kwarteng runs an organization that helps people convicted of petty crimes get jobs and put their lives back together after being released from jail and Atsu was its single biggest donor, Kwarteng said. Atsu had also started building an orphanage in Ghana and was helping to fund a new breast cancer screening center, Kwarteng said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814406,Turkish teen filmed 'last moments' from quake-hit apartment,"ADIYAMAN, Turkey (AP) — A 17-year-old high school student has captured Turkish hearts after he filmed a farewell message to his loved ones as he was trapped under the rubble of his home during last week’s earthquake.

            Taha Erdem and his family were fast asleep when a 7.8 magnitude quake hit their hometown of Adiyaman in the early hours of Feb. 6.

            Taha was abruptly woken by violent tremors shaking the four-story apartment building in a blue-collar neighborhood of the central Anatolian city.











            Within 10 seconds, Taha, his mother, father and younger brother and sister were plunging downward with the building.

            He found himself alone and trapped under tons of rubble, with waves of powerful aftershocks shifting the debris, squeezing his space amid the mangled mess of concrete and twisted steel. Taha took out his cellphone and began recording a final goodbye, hoping it would be discovered after his death.

            “I think this is the last video I will ever shoot for you,” he said from the tight space, his phone shaking in his hand as tremors rocked the collapsed building.

            Showing remarkable resilience and bravery for a teenager believing he was speaking his last words, he lists his injuries and speaks of his regrets and the things he hopes to do if he emerges alive. During the video, the screams of other trapped people can be heard.

            “We are still shaking. Death, my friends, comes at a time when one is least expecting it.” says Taha, before reciting a Muslim prayer in Arabic.

            “There are many things that I regret. May God forgive me of all my sins. If I get out of here alive today there are many things that I want to do. We are still shaking, yes. My hand isn’t shaking, it’s just the earthquake.”

            The teen goes on to recount that he believes his family are dead, along with many others in the city, and that he willsoon join them.

            But Taha was destined to be among some of the first saved from the destroyed building. He was pulled from the rubble two hours later by neighbors and taken to an aunt’s home.

            Ten hours after the quake, his parents and siblings were also saved by local residents who dug at the wreck of the building with their bare hands and whatever tools they could find.

            When The Associated Press spoke to the family on Thursday they were living in a government-provided tent, along with hundreds of thousands of others who survived the disaster that hit southern Turkey and north Syria, killing more than 43,000.

            “This is my home,” said Taha’s mother Zeliha, 37, as she watched excavators digging up their old life and dumping it into heavy trucks.

            “Boom-boom-boom, the building went down floor by floor on top of us,” she recalled, describing how she had kept yelling her son’s name while trapped under the debris in the hope that all five of them could die together as a family.

            The Erdems’ younger children — daughter Semanur, 13, and 9-year-old son Yigit Cinar — were sleeping in their parents’ room when the quake hit.

            But Taha could not hear his mother’s calls through the mass of concrete. Nor could she hear her son’s cries in the dark, and both believed the other was lying dead in the destroyed building.

            It was only when Zeliha, her husband Ali, 47, a hospital cleaner, and the other children were taken to her sister’s home that they realized Taha had survived.

            “The world was mine at that moment,” Zeliha said. “I have nothing, but I have my kids.”

            The story of the Erdem family is one of many emotional tales of human fortitude to emerge from the widespread disaster area. Many vividly recount the horrors of being trapped beneath their homes.

            Ibrahim Zakaria, a 23-year-old Syrian who was rescued in the coastal Syrian town of Jableh on Feb. 10, told the AP that he survived by licking water dripping down the wall next to him, slipping in and out of consciousness and losing hope of survival in his waking moments.

            “I almost surrendered because I thought I will die,” he said from his hospital bed. “I thought: ‘There is no escape.’”

            In the Turkish city of Gaziantep, 17-year-old Adnan Muhammed Korkut, was trapped for four days before he was rescued. He told the private IHA news agency that he grew so thirsty that he drank his own urine.

            Muhammet Enes Yeninar, 17, and his 21-year-old brother were saved after 198 hours in nearby Kahramanmaras.

            He said they cried for the first two days, mostly wondering about their mother and whether she had survived, IHA reported. They later began to comfort each other — “talking about brotherhood” and eating powdered protein.

            Also in Kahramanmaras, Aleyna Olmez, 17, was pulled free after 248 hours under the rubble. “I tried to pass the time on my own,” she said.

            Stories of remarkable survival often emerge during disaster, especially following earthquakes, when the world’s media records the fading hope of recovering survivors as each hour ticks by.

            Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a 16-year-old girl was rescued in Port-Au-Prince 15 days after an earthquake devastated the city. Three years later, a woman trapped under a collapsed building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was saved after 17 days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814419,Turkey-Syria quakes: Three pulled out alive after 12 days,"Three people, including a child, were rescued alive from the rubble of a building in Antakya district in southern Turkey on Saturday, 296 hours after the recent earthquakes, state news agency Anadolu reported.Footage showed teams carrying a man and a woman out on a stretcher to
a waiting ambulance.Next to them, medics were seen treating a child.The three are the latest in a series of miraculous rescues nearly two weeks after the disaster struck Turkey and Syria.On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called a young woman who had also been pulled alive a day earlier from under the rubble in the Dulkadiroglu district of Kahramanmaras province.Seventeen-year-old Aleyna Olmez was taken to a hospital in Ankara, and Erdogan promised he would visit her once he returned to the Turkish capital.Four people were found alive on Friday, including a 45-year-old man who had spent 278 hours under rubble.Here are other updates from Saturday February 18, on the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes:The body of Christian Atsu, a former Ghanaian international football player was found under the rubble of the building where he lived in southern Turkey on Saturday, his agent said.""We have reached his lifeless body. His belongings are still being removed. His phone was also found,"" Murat Uzunmehmet told local media.There were initial reports that Atsu had been rescued a day after the quake but these turned out to be false.The former English Premier League winger had been staying at Ronesans Residence, a block of high-rise luxury flats that towered over Antakya city in Hatay.Turkish police arrested the building's contractor at the Istanbul airport last week. He appeared to be heading to Montenegro, local media reported.31-year-old Atsu spent four seasons at Chelsea as well as spells at Newcastle, Everton and Bournemouth.In September, he signed for the Turkish Super Lig side Hatayspor.More than 45,000 people have now been reported dead in the earthquake.In Turkey, the death toll stands at 39,672, said Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu.More than 264,000 apartments in Turkey have been destroyed and many people are still missing.On February 12, the World Health Organization reported that 5,900 had been killed by the earthquake in Syria.Updated figures of the dead and injured were not available for Syria.On Friday, mosques around the world performed absentee funeral prayers for the dead in Turkey and Syria.Many of the deceased could not receive full burial rites given the enormity of the disaster.More than 35,000 personnel have joined rescue efforts to search for any survivors.But hopes are dimming of finding anyone else alive, 12 days after the disaster, authorities said.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said that rescue teams searched for survivors in around 200 collapsed buildings in 11 Turkish provinces.Efforts will continue ""until the end,"" he said, adding that the search is focused primarily on Hatay province, which is the worst hit.More than 50 people, including contractors, have been arrested in connection with the collapsed buildings.A 17-year-old high school student made a farewell video message to his loved ones while being trapped under the rubble of his home.Taha Erdem was abruptly woken by violent tremors shaking the four-story apartment building in Adiyaman, in Antalya province on February 6.Finding himself alone under tons of rubble, he took out his cell phone and recorded a message that he hoped would be found after his death.""I think this is the last video I will ever shoot for you,"" he said as his hand shakes as he holds onto the phone during aftershocks.""Death, my friends, comes at a time when one is least expecting it,"" he adds. ""There are many things that I regret. May God forgive me of all my sins. If I get out of here alive today there are many things that I want to do. We are still shaking, yes. My hand isn't shaking, it's just the earthquake.""The teen then says he believes his family is dead and that he will soon join them.But Taha was destined to be among some of the first saved from the destroyed building. He was pulled from the rubble two hours later by neighbors and taken to an aunt's home.His parents and siblings were also saved 10 hours after the quake by local residents who used their bare hands to dig at the wreck of the building.mm, ns/kb (Reuters, AP, AFP, DPA)",2023/02/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814420,Kosovo celebrates 15 years of independence,"Geographically speaking, Kosovo is a region in southeastern Europe located in the center of the Balkan Peninsula. It borders Serbia to the north and northeast, North Macedonia to the southeast, Albania to the southwest, and Montenegro to the west.Like its neighbors, Kosovo's population is ethnically diverse. The largest group among the approximately 1.9 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90% of the population. Serbs make up about five percent of the citizenry, while the others are members of minorities such as Roma, Bosniaks and Turks. Most people in Kosovo are Muslim, but Orthodox Christians and Catholics have a presence there as well.Kosovo belonged to the Ottoman Empire for many centuries until it was conquered by troops from the Kingdom of Serbia in 1913. At the end of World War I, the Serbian monarchy was absorbed into the Kingdom of Serbs, State of Slovenes (SHS), which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.During World War II, Kosovo was annexed to Italian-controlled Albania following the occupation of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Mussolini's fascist Italy and their allies. After the victory of the Yugoslav partisans under the communist Josip Broz Tito in 1944 and 1945, Yugoslavia was transformed into a socialist federation, and Kosovo received the status of an autonomous province within the Serbian republic.In 1989, the then head of the Serbian Communists, Slobodan Milosevic, ousted Kosovo's majority-Albanian government and Kosovo's autonomy was revoked. His infamous June 1989 speech in Kosovo Polje is regarded as the beginning of the warlike disintegration of Yugoslavia. Two years before the fighting in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina began in 1991-92, Albanian civil servants were dismissed in Kosovo, and instruction in schools and at universities was held only in Serbian.The Albanian majority reacted with nonviolent resistance for a long time. After 1989, most of the remaining Albanian officials left the now Serb-dominated state institutions and proclaimed their own republic in 1992. Under the leadership of the writer and pacifist Ibrahim Rugova, a shadow state was established with its own government and administration.One of the most important tasks of the shadow state was educating Albanian children, who were taught in Albanian in private homes. The Kosova Albanian ""diaspora"" — Albanians living abroad — financed the underground state through donations.At the same time, the regime in Serbia's capital Belgrade became increasingly repressive. Albanians in Kosovo were subjected to baseless arrests with increasing frequency. As a result, many saw Rugova's policy of pacifist resistance as a failure. In 1994, the Kosovo Liberation Army (UÇK) was founded, which began to appear with guerrilla actions in 1996.In 1997, the UÇK began attacking police stations and other facilities of the Serbian state in Kosovo. The international community attempted to calm the situation with an OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) mission in the fall of 1998. But Serbian security forces continued to massacre civilians despite the presence of international observers.After the final failure of diplomatic talks between representatives of Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians in Rambouillet, France, NATO air strikes began on March 24, 1999, against what was then Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The political goal was to prevent a genocide like the one that had taken place in Srebrenica in August 1995. As part of the fighting, more than a million people fled Kosovo, mainly to Albania and what was then Macedonia.In June 1999, Milosevic finally gave up and withdrew his troops from Kosovo. Since then, the NATO-led multilateral peacekeeping force KFOR (Kosovo Force) has been securing the peace. Politically, Kosovo was placed under the administration of the United Nations (UNMIK).In 2008, Kosovo declared its independence after an attempt at mediation by UN envoy and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari failed. In the process, the concept for which Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 was adopted, according to which Kosovo is a multiethnic state and a fixed number of seats in Kosova's parliament are reserved for Serbians and other ethnic minorities.To date, 117 countries have recognized the independence of the Republic of Kosovo, including the United States and most EU member states. Serbia, Russia, China, and some other states, on the other hand, continue to view Kosovo as part of Serbia. Five EU states  — Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Cyprus — have also so far refused to recognize Europe's newest state.According to a legal opinion issued by the International Court of Justice ICJ in 2010, Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence did not violate international law. The opinion had been commissioned by the UN to clarify whether Kosovo's secession from Serbia was legal. The ICJ's ruling is not binding, but it represents an important political and diplomatic recognition for Kosovo.Due to the veto of UN Security Council members Russia and China, Kosovo cannot become a full member of the United Nations. However, the republic is a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and some international sports organizations, such as the IOC, FIFA and UEFA. Currently, the government in the capital Pristina is seeking membership in the Council of Europe. In 2022, an application for candidate status in the European Union was submitted. A Stabilization and Association agreement was signed with the EU back in 2015.Since 2012, the EU has been working to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia. These are crucial for EU membership, which both countries are seeking. Serbia has been a candidate since 2012, and Kosovo applied for membership at the end of 2022. Under EU mediation, Kosovo and Serbia signed a number of agreements between 2013-2015 that address important day-to-day issues, including telecommunications, border issues, missing persons, and energy supplies. But tensions stemming from Serbia's failure to recognize Kosovo as a state continue to stall talks.A proposal by Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and France's President Emmanuel Macron, which is also supported by the United States and is now considered an official EU proposal, brought new hope in September 2022. Under the Franco-German proposal, Serbia need not formally recognize Kosovo, but would respect its independence and not prevent Kosovo's membership in international organizations — analogous to the Federal Republic's relationship with East Germany under the 1973 Basic Treaty. In return, Pristina would accept an Association of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo.The Association of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo is a kind of umbrella organization that takes care of the concerns of Serbs in the ten municipalities with a Serb majority.The Kosovo leadership rejects this proposal, on the grounds that it would create a Serb parallel structure within the country. According to the Albanians, this would threaten Kosovo's stability in a similar way to the Republika Srpska in Bosnia.Serbia, on the other hand, has made the implementation of the municipal union a condition for further concessions. However, both sides are under pressure, especially since Russia's attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Since then, the West has been in an even bigger hurry to make progress, at least in the Western Balkans, not least because Moscow is trying hard to gain influence in the region.This article was translated from German.",2023/02/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814421,St. Helens edge Penrith with golden-point field goal in CWC,"PENRITH, Australia (AP) — Lewis Dodd kicked a field goal in golden-point extra time to give St. Helens a 13-12 win over the Penrith Panthers on Saturday to claim the 2023 World Cup Challenge.

            The English Super League champions missed two attempts at field goals in regulation time and blew a 12-6 lead with just over a minute to go, when Penrith equalized with a try out wide to winger Brian To’o that was converted by Nathan Cleary to force the match into extra time.

            It was the first World Club Challenge held since 2020 and gave Penrith the opportunity to add another trophy following its dominance of Australia’s National Rugby League competition since that time.











            St. Helen’s fullback Jack Welsby was instrumental in getting his team to an early advantage when he saved two tries with desperate defense, scored the opening try of the match in the 8th minute and had a hand in the team’s second try to Konrad Hurrell in the 15th.

            The visitors led 10-0 at halftime and, after the resumption of play was delayed by 10 minutes because of lightning, extended it to 12 with a Mark Percival penalty goal.

            Izack Tago crossed for Penrith in the 50th minute to start the comeback and when To'o scored late, momentum was going the way of the hosts.

            Instead, it was St. Helens which became the first British team to win the title on Australian soil since Wigan in 1994. The narrow loss extended Penrith's wait for the World Cup Challenge title after it lost to Wigan in 1991 and to Bradford in 2004.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814424,Taiwan company offers first cat DNA testing service,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Damian Kao is the COO of Basepaws, a company he describes as a kind of 23andMe for cats that gives owners information to help keep their pets fighting fit.Kao recently joined Jon of the Asianometry YouTube channel to discuss his company on the Startup Island Taiwan podcast, and said that, like a lot of startups, his company’s goals have changed over time. He said that the company’s initial hook was providing cat owners with information about the cat’s breed, just as 23andMe tells consumers about their ancestry composition, but has since directed its attention to cat health, which was always Kao’s intention.“We look at certain health markers, certain genetic mutations that your cat might have, that are associated with known diseases” Kao said. “We can tell you, for example, if your cat might develop a kidney disease, and if we do, you might have to change its diet, or take your cat to the vet more often to get tests done.”Basepaws also does tests on cats’ oral microbiome, looking at all the different bacteria and elements that are in there. “By looking at the different compositions of these microbes in the cat’s mouth we’re able to provide a risk for dental disease, or paradental disease, or tooth reabsorption, or a host of other diseases,” Kao said.Kao said that he is particularly excited about his company’s plans to extend testing to systemic diseases also. “When you think about the oral microbiome you think about dental diseases obviously, but we are starting to see some signals that associate the oral microbiome with kidney disease, heart disease,” Kao said.Kao said that while this kind of science is not particularly new, and has been done on humans for some time, Basepaws is hoping to expand upon the existing knowledge with their data.Kao said that the genetic testing market for dogs was already quite big, but there were few to none operating in the cat space and that Basepaws was the first. He puts this down to two reasons; historical elements, and the availability of resources.“Dog ownership and dog breeding, and the whole industry around dogs is just a lot older,” Kao said. “(There are) kennel clubs all over the world, dog breeding for specific traits has been going on for a long time (and) there’s actually a lot of money in it.In 2022, Basepaws was acquired by the company Zoetis, a globally leading animal healthcare company. “We were immediately drawn to their passion for pets and the role that genetic testing and data analytics can have in advancing animal care,” Zoetis CEO Kristin Peck said at the time.",2023/02/18,241,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814428,White Sox RHP Kopech on track in comeback from knee injury,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — When Michael Kopech started throwing again after right knee surgery, he felt a sense of relief.

            It was a real issue that prevented him from being himself for much of last season with the Chicago White Sox.

            “Absolutely. There's a little bit of relief knowing that I wasn’t just trying hard and it not coming out last year,” Kopech said. “There was something that I had to fight through, which take it with a grain of salt. I'm going to battle through everything that I have to battle though. But ultimately, I want to be as healthy as I can and I’m on track to do that now.”











            The 26-year-old Kopech went 5-9 with a 3.54 ERA in a career-high 25 starts in 2022. But he left a June 12 game against Texas with right knee discomfort, and it became a lingering issue for the rest of the year.

            The right knee trouble quite possibly played a role in Kopech going on the 15-day injured list in August with left knee discomfort. He went back on the IL on Sept. 17 with right shoulder inflammation, ending his season.

            Kopech said he showed up early to spring training this year to finish his rehab, and he thinks he will be ready for the start of the season.

            “I’m at a point where the knee’s feeling better, the shoulder’s feeling better,” he said Friday. “But it’s just kind of smoothing things out and getting back to 100 percent.”

            It has been more than seven years since Chicago acquired Kopech in the December 2016 trade that sent Chris Sale to the Boston Red Sox. Since his big league debut with the White Sox in 2018, the hard-throwing right-hander has shown flashes of brilliance, but hasn't been able to stay healthy.

            Kopech missed the 2019 season after he had Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. 

            “It kind of flies by, I still feel like I’m 22,” he said. “My body might disagree with me but I still feel like a young kid in this game. Hopefully I have a few more years that are still youthful and strong. I’m going to do everything I can to be as impactful in this game as I can.”

            He was certainly impactful at several points last year. He had five starts in 2022 when he pitched at least five innings and allowed one hit or fewer. One of those was a dominant performance against Detroit when he struck out a career-high 11 in six hitless innings, and he also had a gem at Yankee Stadium when he permitted one hit in seven scoreless innings.

            But Chicago finished 81-81 in a disappointing season.

            “You probably heard multiple guys in the clubhouse say we have something to prove to ourselves, to the fans, to the league,” Kopech said. “We should have had a better season last year. We have the talent, we always seem to have the talent. It’s a matter of coming together and doing the little things right.”

            First-year manager Pedro Grifol said he is just looking for Kopech to stay healthy this spring.

            “He’s got to go through the process, but he’s right on pace to be where we want him to be at the start of the season,” Grifol said.

I’m going to do everything I can to be as impactful in this game as I can.”He was certainly impactful at several points last year. He had five starts in 2022 when he pitched at least five innings and allowed one hit or fewer. One of those was a dominant performance against Detroit when he struck out a career-high 11 in six hitless innings, and he also had a gem at Yankee Stadium when he permitted one hit in seven scoreless innings.But Chicago finished 81-81 in a disappointing season.“You probably heard multiple guys in the clubhouse say we have something to prove to ourselves, to the fans, to the league,” Kopech said. “We should have had a better season last year. We have the talent, we always seem to have the talent. It’s a matter of coming together and doing the little things right.”First-year manager Pedro Grifol said he is just looking for Kopech to stay healthy this spring.“He’s got to go through the process, but he’s right on pace to be where we want him to be at the start of the season,” Grifol said.___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814429,Defense minister: Finland could join NATO ahead of Sweden,"MUNICH (AP) — Finland’s defense minister said Saturday that his country will join NATO without waiting for Sweden if its Nordic neighbor’s accession is held up by the Turkish government.

            Mikko Savola told The Associated Press on Saturday that Finland would prefer that that the two countries join the alliance together, but it wouldn’t hold up the process if Turkey decides to approve Finland, but not Sweden, as it has warned.

            “No, no. Then we will join,” Savola said in an interview on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich.











            Since they broke with decades of non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland and Sweden have insisted they want to join NATO together. But Turkey’s reluctance to accept Sweden unless it steps up pressure on Kurdish exile groups has made it more likely the two will have to join the alliance at different speeds.

            “Sweden is our closest partner,” Savola said. “Almost every week our defense forces are practicing together and so on. It’s a very deep cooperation and we also trust fully each other. But it’s in Türkiye’s hands now.” 

            Speaking later Saturday at separate panels in Munich, Finland's top officials struck similar notes. Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Finland prefers to join NATO with Sweden but “cannot influence” how countries go about the ratification. 

            Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said Turkey saying yes to Finland but no to Sweden would present a difficult situation.

            “Our hands are in a way tied. We have applied for membership. Should we now say that ‘No, we cancel our application?’ No, that we can’t simply do,” Niinisto said.

            
                All NATO countries except Turkey and Hungary have already given both countries the green light to join the alliance. Hungary has said it would do so soon, but Turkey says Sweden hasn’t done enough to meet Turkish national security concerns, causing a rift in NATO at a time when the U.S. and other allies are seeking to project a united front against Russia.

            In recent weeks, NATO officials have played down the significance of the two nations joining simultaneously.

            “The main is issue is not whether Finland and Sweden are joining at the same time. The main issue is that Finland and Sweden join as soon as possible, and it is of course a Turkish decision whether to ratify both protocols or only one protocol,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Munich on Friday. 

            Savola said he hopes Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, will become a member of the alliance before a NATO summit in July. Until then, Savola said, Finland isn't worried about the security situation, noting Finland has a conscription army with a wartime strength of 280,000 soldiers, 95% of them reservists, and plans to buy F-35 fighter jets from the U.S., while also investing in its naval and land forces.

            “We are strong and our willingness to defend the country is also strong,” Savola said.

            Finland has supported Ukraine with weapons from the start of the war. Savola said the military support amounts to 600 million euros so far. The country has said it will participate in a joint effort by European countries to deliver Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but hasn’t specified whether it will hand over any of its own tanks.

            “There are many ways to join. There are those tanks, of course, training, spare parts and logistics,” he said. “We are making those decisions quite soon in Finland.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814438,UK's Sunak: It's time to double down on support for Ukraine,"MUNICH (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on world leaders Saturday to “double down” on support for Ukraine, saying additional arms and security guarantees are needed to protect the country and the rest of Europe from Russian aggressio n now and in the future.

            Sunak delivered the message in a speech to the Munich Security Conference, an annual meeting of heads of state, defense ministers and other world leaders. This year’s conference is focused on threats to the accepted rules of international relations nearly a year after Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

            Highlighting Britain’s recent commitment to provide battle tanks, advanced air defense systems and longer-range missiles to Ukraine, Sunak urged other nations to follow suit before Russia launches an expected spring offensive. 











            “Now is the moment to double down on our military support,” Sunak said. “When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter. Even now he is betting we will lose our nerve.”

            Sunak also called on NATO to provide long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. Such commitments are necessary to shield Ukraine from future Russian aggression and to protect the system of international rules that have helped keep peace since the end of World War II, Sunak said. 

            “It’s about the security and sovereignty of every nation,” the prime minister said. “Because Russia’s invasion, its abhorrent war crimes and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric are symptomatic of a broader threat to everything we believe in.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814457,Olesen leads Hojgaard and Paul at Thailand Classic,"CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark moved a step closer to his seventh European Tour after he shot an 8-under 64 to take a two-stroke lead at Thailand Classic on Saturday.

            Olesen made eight birdies in a bogey-free third round at Amata Spring Country Club to reach 18-under 198 overall, two shots in front of countryman Nicolai Hojgaard and Germany's Yannik Paul.

            Joost Luiten of the Netherlands was a further shot back.











            “Overall, it was a pretty good round. I didn’t get in a lot of trouble,"" the 33-year-old Olesen said. “Some of the par fours and par fives I hit pretty close and make birdies. I made it very easy for myself today. It’s not always like that.”

            Olesen will play in the final group alongside the 21-year-old Hojggard on Sunday in search for his next tour win after capturing the British Masters title last May.

            “It’s amazing that so many Danes coming up in the last three to four years,"" he said. “It’s good for Denmark as the weather is not ideal (for golf) and we have only five-and-a-half million people. But we are good at really grinding it out.”

            Hojggard had seven birdies, an eagle on the par-5 11th and a bogey on the eighth to match Olesen’s 64.

            “I have been adding consistency in my game this year,"" said Hojgaard, an identical twin of three-time European Tour winner Ramus. “That’s been a different. Obviously, I’d like to fight for wins. It will be fun tomorrow.”

            Paul, who won the Mallorca Open in October, made seven birdies against one bogey in his 66.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814458,"Iran International moves shows to Washington, citing threats","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Farsi-language satellite news channel based in London long critical of Iran's theocractic government said Saturday it had moved its broadcasts to Washington “to protect the safety of its journalists” after being targeted by Tehran.

            The targeting of Iran International comes as Tehran also has long harassed members of the BBC's Persian service for their work reporting on the country. However, the threats against Farsi-language networks broadcasting abroad have exponentially grown as they cover the nationwide protests that have rocked Iran since September — providing information otherwise unheard across the Islamic Republic's state-controlled television and radio networks. 

            Iran International described making the decision after London’s Metropolitan Police told it “about the existence of serious and immediate threats to the safety of Iranian journalists"" working there. 











            Reached for comment, Iran International referred to a statement saying that “threats had grown to the point that it was felt it was no longer possible to protect the channel’s staff"" or the public around its studio in London.

            “A foreign state has caused such a significant threat to the British public on British soil that we have to move. Let’s be clear this is not just a threat to our TV station but the British public at large,” the channel's general manager Mahmood Enayat said. “Even more this is an assault on the values of sovereignty, security and free speech that the U.K. has always held dear.”

            Enayat added: ""We refuse to be silenced by these cowardly threats. We will continue to broadcast. We are undeterred.”

            The head of the Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism unit, Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes, acknowledged giving advice to Iran International about the threat and moving its operation. 

            Jukes said in a statement that police and the domestic intelligence service MI5 had foiled “15 plots since the start of 2022 to either kidnap or even kill British or U.K.-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime,” without elaborating.

            “We also appreciate that talking to a media company about moving their operations from a particular location — even though it is due to grave safety concerns — is exceptional. The advice to relocate has not been given lightly,” Juke said. “The situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face such hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the U.K. is a challenging reality that we are determined to confront.”

            Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

            Iran International tied its decision to London police days earlier announcing the arrest and charging of Austrian national Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, 30, with allegedly “collecting information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.” 

            Police say they arrested Dovtaev a week ago at London's Chiswick Business Park, home to the offices of Volant Media UK Ltd., the owner of Iran International. Police had placed armed officers around the channel in November over threats against it. 

            It wasn't immediately clear if Dovtaev had a lawyer. 

            Voltant Media, once majority-owned by a Saudi national, also broadcasts another channel called Afghanistan International.

            Iran International has focused intensely on the nationwide protests that have swept Iran since the September death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman earlier detained by the country's morality police. Iran's Intelligence Ministry describes the channel as a “terrorist organization.”

            “Its operatives and affiliates will be pursued by the Ministry of Intelligence,” Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib said in November. “And from now on, any kind of connection with this terrorist organization will be considered to be tantamount to entering into terrorism and a threat to the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

            That same month, the broadcaster said the Metropolitan Police warned that two of its British-Iranian journalists faced threats from Iran that “represent an imminent, credible and significant risk to their lives and those of their families.” Meanwhile, another outspoken critic of Iran's government living in the U.S. has faced multiple alleged plots by Tehran targeting her. 

            The BBC in February filed a separate complaint to the United Nations saying there were “increased security concerns for BBC News Persian journalists in the light of extraterritorial threats.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814462,Death toll from Islamic State attack in Syria at least 53,"BEIRUT (AP) — The death toll from an attack by the Islamic State group against an army checkpoint and people collecting truffles in central Syria has risen to at least 53, most of them civilians, state media and an opposition war monitor reported Saturday.

            The attack near the central town of Sukhna on Friday was the deadliest by the extremist group since so far this year, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor said.

            The Observatory said the attack targeted a Syrian army checkpoint and people collecting wild truffles nearby, killing 68 people, including 61 civilians. It said IS fighters reached the area on motorcycles. On Friday, it reported that the attack killed 46. 











            The Observatory, which tracks Syria’s conflict, said the IS gunmen took advantage of the Feb. 6 earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria killing tens of thousands of people to carry out their deadly attack. The attention in Syria has been mostly focused on the earthquake over the past two weeks.

            Syria’s state news agency, SANA, quoted the head of the general hospital in the central town of Palmyra as saying that they have received the bodies of 46 civilians and seven soldiers. 

            Despite their defeat in Syria in March 2019, Islamic State sleeper cells still conduct attacks around Syria and Iraq, where they once declared a “caliphate.”

            On Friday, the U.S. military said a helicopter raid led by its forces in northeast Syria left a senior leader with the Islamic State group dead and four American service members wounded. It identified the killed IS commander as Hamza al-Homsi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814463,Black Baltimoreans fight to save homes from redevelopment,"BALTIMORE (AP) — In 2018, Angela Banks received bad news from her landlord: Baltimore officials were buying her family’s home of four decades, planning to demolish the three-story brick row house to make room for a beleaguered urban renewal project aimed at transforming a historically Black neighborhood. Banks and her children became homeless almost overnight. With nowhere else to go, they spent months sleeping in her aging Ford Explorer. 

            Roughly five years later, the house remains standing, and plans to redevelop west Baltimore’s Poppleton neighborhood have largely stalled, even after the city displaced Banks and many of her neighbors.

            Banks filed a complaint Monday asking federal officials to investigate whether Baltimore’s redevelopment policies are perpetuating racial segregation and violating fair housing laws by disproportionately displacing Black and low-income residents. Her experience presents the latest example of Black Baltimoreans losing their homes to redevelopment after watching their neighborhoods suffer from growing disinvestment — while whiter, more affluent communities flourish, Banks and her attorneys argue. 











            “I lost everything,” Banks told The Associated Press. “It’s like we had no voice. We could make noise, but nobody would hear us.”

            Ordered to vacate quickly, her family ended up leaving behind many of their belongings.

            During a recent visit to the neighborhood, Banks stepped cautiously through an unsecured back door and peered inside the house, wondering aloud whether squatters had moved in. Her eyes settled first on the marbled vinyl floor tiles she installed herself many years ago. She also encountered extensive water damage and rotting drywall, unfamiliar furniture, clothes and other personal items. Startled by her presence, two black cats scurried down the second-floor hallway and disappeared into a hiding spot.

            “This was home,” she said, shaking her head. 

            Her landlord sold the house to the city voluntarily in 2018, but other Poppleton homeowners have been subjected to eminent domain, when the government seizes private property for public use.

            Once relatively common in American cities, using the practice for revitalization and infrastructure projects has largely fallen out of favor. Some cities are currently working to provide reparations to Black residents, acknowledging the harm caused by urban renewal efforts and other discriminatory practices. 

            Banks reminisced about her children swimming in Poppleton’s public pool while she socialized with neighbors on their stoops. Since then, over 100 occupied homes have been seized, according to the complaint. The pool and nearby recreation center closed years ago, Banks said. Poppleton is about 93% Black, according to 2020 census data.

            “Baltimore has long been a tale of two cities,” said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which joined Banks in filing the complaint and organized a news conference Monday in Poppleton. 

            In 1910, Baltimore leaders enacted the country’s first residential segregation ordinance that restricted African American homeowners to certain blocks. 

            In addition to redlining, Poppleton residents experienced “slum clearance” starting in the 1930s with construction of Poe Homes, a public housing complex named after a nearby onetime residence of the famous poet Edgar Allan Poe. The number of displaced Black families was larger than the number of housing units created, according to the complaint. 

            Then came Baltimore’s so-called “Highway To Nowhere,” which was designed to connect the downtown business district to interstates surrounding the city. Officials used eminent domain to demolish nearly 1,000 homes in the 1960s and ’70s, cutting a swath through majority-Black west Baltimore and severing ties between Poppleton and other nearby communities.

            Construction of the thoroughfare was never finished — partly because residents in more affluent neighborhoods successfully campaigned against it — and the endeavor became largely pointless. 

            “What’s happening now in Poppleton is a reflection of what has happened before, part of an unbroken chain of policies and practices,” said Lawrence Brown, a research scientist at Morgan State University. “There is a pattern.”

            Plans for Poppleton’s urban renewal surfaced in the 1970s. By that time, Brown said, the neighborhood had already been experiencing mistreatment and disinvestment for decades. 

            In 2006, city officials signed an agreement with a New York-based company, La Cite Development. Construction has been completed on two mixed-use buildings with 262 rental units, but many other aspects of the $800 million project haven’t materialized. Initial plans identified over 500 properties the company would redevelop near a University of Maryland biomedical research park, just outside the downtown business district. 

            Company officials didn’t respond to a recent request for comment.

            Baltimore leaders have said they’re committed to revitalizing an increasingly blighted community suffering from population loss, but Poppleton residents accuse them of catering to big developers at the expense of homeowners and renters.

            In 2015, the city agreed to partially subsidize the Poppleton redevelopment project. That was after officials tried to terminate their agreement with the developer, citing a lack of progress, but the company sued and won. 

            Mayor Brandon Scott, who took office in 2020, pledged his commitment to “advancing fairness and equity in housing for all residents.” In a statement Thursday, he said his administration “has taken significant steps to address the housing inequities of the past through substantial investments in formerly redlined communities.”

            The movement to save Poppleton’s existing homes galvanized around longtime resident Sonia Eaddy, who recently won a decadeslong fight when Scott announced her row house would be removed from the redevelopment plan after negotiations with the developer. A nearby block of rainbow-colored historic row houses will be rehabbed by a local nonprofit that helps Black women achieve homeownership, officials also announced.

            Eaddy said she celebrated the victory, but she’s not done fighting for reform. 

            “Eminent domain is an act of violence. It’s being used to perpetuate gentrification,” she said during Monday’s news conference.

            Most displaced residents have been offered financial assistance. Banks said she didn’t initially qualify because her landlord sold the property voluntarily, but the city later gave her compensation she used to pay off debts.

            Her complaint lists a series of potential remedies, including additional compensation and priority access to affordable housing for displaced residents. She filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which said it was unable to comment on pending investigations.

            Banks’ former neighbor, Parcha McFadden, recently left the family home she inherited after losing her father, who invested in the property with future generations in mind. She and her daughter have been living in a rented apartment while their old house sits vacant.

            “Homeownership is part of the American dream, but it can so easily be ripped away,” she said. “How is this American?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814474,US: Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine,"MUNICH (AP) — The United States has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris said Saturday, insisting that “justice must be served” to the perpetrators.

            Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Harris said the international community has both a moral and a strategic interest in pursuing those crimes, pointing to a danger of other authoritarian governments taking advantage if international rules are undermined.

            “Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population — gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation,” Harris said. She also cited “execution-style killings, beatings, and electrocution.” 











            The Biden administration formally determined last March that Russian troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine and said it would work with others to prosecute offenders. A determination of crimes against humanity goes a step further, indicating that attacks against civilians are being carried out in a widespread and systematic manner.

            “Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people, from Ukraine to Russia, including children,” Harris said. “They have cruelly separated children from their families.""

            She also pointed to the attack in mid-March on a theater in the strategic port city of Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering, which killed hundreds, and to the images of civilians' bodies left on the streets of Bucha after the Russian pullback from the Kyiv area last spring.

            Harris said that as a former prosecutor and former head of California's Department of Justice, she knows “the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.” 

            “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt,” she said. “These are crimes against humanity.”

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also was attending the Munich conference, said in a statement issued as Harris spoke that “we reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes.” 

            The new determination underlines the “staggering extent” of suffering inflicted on Ukrainian civilians and “also reflects the deep commitment of the United States to holding members of Russia’s forces and other Russian officials accountable for their atrocities,” he said.

            In an address to his country on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv this week had gotten “strong signals from our partners, specific agreements on the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people.”

            “Every Russian attack … on every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state,” Zelenskyy said, citing attacks not just in the past year of war but dating back to 2014, when fighting with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine first broke out.

            The president did not refer specifically to Harris’ remarks or name any countries that had provided agreements on Russian accountability. 

            Russia's nearly yearlong invasion of Ukraine, has dominated discussions at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of security and defense officials from around the world. Harris told the assembled participants: ""Let us all agree — on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served.”

            “Such is our moral interest,” she said. “We also have a significant strategic interest.”

            If Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in attacking international rules and norms, she said, “other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the world to their will, through coercion, disinformation and even brute force.”

            Harris' audience Saturday didn't include any Russian officials. Conference organizers decided not to invite them this year.

            While Western officials defended arms supplies to Ukraine, China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, called for an end to the war through peace talks, saying Beijing was “deeply worried about the expansion and long-term effect of this war.""

            China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine or to impose sanctions on Moscow like Western nations have done. Without naming any countries, Wang said “there may be forces” that don't want the war to stop anytime soon.

            “What they care about is not the life and death of the Ukrainian people, nor the increasing damage to Europe. They probably have bigger strategic goals than Ukraine,” he said.

            Asked on the sidelines of the event about the U.S. determination of crimes against humanity, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba replied that “Russia waged a genocidal war against Ukrainians because they do not recognize our identity and they do not think we deserve to exist as a sovereign nation.""

            “Everything that stems from that is crimes against humanity, war crimes and various other atrocities committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine,” he said. ""Let lawyers sort out specifically which act belongs where in terms of legal qualification.”

            Zelenskyy had urged Western allies in a video address to the conference on Friday to quicken their military support for Ukraine.

            Kuleba voiced confidence that Ukraine would eventually receive fighter jets from its partners, despite their current reluctance. He noted that they initially pushed back on providing other heavy weapons that were later delivered or promised.

            In Munich on Friday, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, called for cluster munitions and phosphorous bombs, German media reported. Cluster munitions are banned by an international treaty.

            Asked whether he supported calling for such weapons, Kuleba said Ukraine has evidence that Russia uses them.

            “We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster ammunition, so legally there are no obstacles for that,” he said. “And if we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation.”

            Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineMUNICH (AP) — The United States has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris said Saturday, insisting that “justice must be served” to the perpetrators.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Harris said the international community has both a moral and a strategic interest in pursuing those crimes, pointing to a danger of other authoritarian governments taking advantage if international rules are undermined.“Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population — gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation,” Harris said. She also cited “execution-style killings, beatings, and electrocution.”The Biden administration formally determined last March that Russian troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine and said it would work with others to prosecute offenders. A determination of crimes against humanity goes a step further, indicating that attacks against civilians are being carried out in a widespread and systematic manner.“Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people, from Ukraine to Russia, including children,” Harris said. “They have cruelly separated children from their families.""She also pointed to the attack in mid-March on a theater in the strategic port city of Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering, which killed hundreds, and to the images of civilians' bodies left on the streets of Bucha after the Russian pullback from the Kyiv area last spring.Harris said that as a former prosecutor and former head of California's Department of Justice, she knows “the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.”“In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt,” she said. “These are crimes against humanity.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also was attending the Munich conference, said in a statement issued as Harris spoke that “we reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes.”The new determination underlines the “staggering extent” of suffering inflicted on Ukrainian civilians and “also reflects the deep commitment of the United States to holding members of Russia’s forces and other Russian officials accountable for their atrocities,” he said.In an address to his country on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv this week had gotten “strong signals from our partners, specific agreements on the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people.”“Every Russian attack … on every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state,” Zelenskyy said, citing attacks not just in the past year of war but dating back to 2014, when fighting with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine first broke out.The president did not refer specifically to Harris’ remarks or name any countries that had provided agreements on Russian accountability.Russia's nearly yearlong invasion of Ukraine, has dominated discussions at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of security and defense officials from around the world. Harris told the assembled participants: ""Let us all agree — on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served.”“Such is our moral interest,” she said. “We also have a significant strategic interest.”If Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in attacking international rules and norms, she said, “other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the world to their will, through coercion, disinformation and even brute force.”Harris' audience Saturday didn't include any Russian officials. Conference organizers decided not to invite them this year.While Western officials defended arms supplies to Ukraine, China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, called for an end to the war through peace talks, saying Beijing was “deeply worried about the expansion and long-term effect of this war.""China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine or to impose sanctions on Moscow like Western nations have done. Without naming any countries, Wang said “there may be forces” that don't want the war to stop anytime soon.“What they care about is not the life and death of the Ukrainian people, nor the increasing damage to Europe. They probably have bigger strategic goals than Ukraine,” he said.Asked on the sidelines of the event about the U.S. determination of crimes against humanity, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba replied that “Russia waged a genocidal war against Ukrainians because they do not recognize our identity and they do not think we deserve to exist as a sovereign nation.""“Everything that stems from that is crimes against humanity, war crimes and various other atrocities committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine,” he said. ""Let lawyers sort out specifically which act belongs where in terms of legal qualification.”Zelenskyy had urged Western allies in a video address to the conference on Friday to quicken their military support for Ukraine.Kuleba voiced confidence that Ukraine would eventually receive fighter jets from its partners, despite their current reluctance. He noted that they initially pushed back on providing other heavy weapons that were later delivered or promised.In Munich on Friday, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, called for cluster munitions and phosphorous bombs, German media reported. Cluster munitions are banned by an international treaty.Asked whether he supported calling for such weapons, Kuleba said Ukraine has evidence that Russia uses them.“We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster ammunition, so legally there are no obstacles for that,” he said. “And if we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation.”___Geir Moulson contributed to this report from Berlin.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814475,FBI records deepen mystery of dig for Civil War-era gold,"CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) — The court-ordered release of a trove of government photos, videos, maps and other documents involving the FBI's secretive search for Civil War-era gold has a treasure hunter more convinced than ever of a coverup — and just as determined to prove it.

            Dennis Parada waged a legal battle to force the FBI to turn over records of its excavation in Dents Run, Pennsylvania, where local lore says an 1863 shipment of Union gold disappeared on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The FBI, which went to Dents Run after sophisticated testing suggested tons of gold might be buried there, has long insisted the dig came up empty.

            Parada and his advisers, who have spent countless hours poring over the newly released government records, believe otherwise. They accuse the FBI of distorting key evidence and improperly withholding records in an apparent effort to conceal the recovery of a historic, extremely valuable gold cache. The FBI defends its handling of the materials. 











            Parada's dispute with the FBI is playing out in federal court, where a judge overseeing the case must decide whether the FBI will have to release its operational plan for the gold dig and other records it wants to keep secret. The judge could also order the FBI to keep looking for additional materials to turn over to the treasure hunter.

            “We feel we were double-crossed and lied to,” Parada said in an interview at his cramped, wood-paneled office, where huge drill bits and high-end metal detectors compete for space with rusty miners' picks, Civil War-era cannon parts and other odds and ends he's dug up over the years.

            “The truth will come out,” said Parada, co-founder of the treasure-hunting outfit Finders Keepers. Solving the mystery is not his only goal — he had hoped to earn a finder’s fee from the potential recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold.

            An FBI spokesperson declined to answer questions about the agency’s gold dig records or respond to the coverup allegations, citing the ongoing litigation. Last year, the FBI released a statement publicly acknowledging for the first time that it had been looking for gold in Dents Run. The statement said the FBI did not find any, adding the agency “continues to unequivocally reject any claims or speculation to the contrary.”

            There is little evidence in the historical record to suggest that an Army detachment lost a gold shipment in the Pennsylvania wilderness — possibly the result of an ambush by Confederate sympathizers — but the legend has inspired generations of treasure hunters, Parada among them.

            He and his son spent years looking for the fabled gold of Dents Run, eventually guiding the FBI to a remote woodland site 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh where they say their instruments identified a large quantity of metal. The FBI brought in a geophysical consulting firm whose sensitive equipment detected a 7- to 9-ton mass suggestive of gold. 

            Armed with a warrant, a team of FBI agents came in March 2018 to dig up the hillside. An FBI videographer was on hand to document it, at one point interviewing a Philadelphia-based agent on the FBI’s art-crime team who explained why the FBI was in the woods of one of Pennsylvania's most sparsely populated counties.

            “We’ve identified through our investigation a site that we believe has U.S. property, which includes a significant sum of base metal which is valuable ... particularly gold, maybe silver,” the agent said on the video, his face blurred by the FBI to protect his privacy.

            Calling it a “155-year-old cold case,” he said the FBI had corroborated Parada’s information about the location of the reputed gold through ""scientific testing."" He stressed the test results did not prove the presence of gold. Only a dig would help law enforcement “get to the bottom of this story once and for all,” the agent said.

            Parada obtained the video and other FBI records through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, hoping they would help answer lingering questions about what took place at Dents Run five years ago. Parada was mostly kept away from the dig site while the FBI did its work.

            He suspects the agency conducted a clandestine, overnight dig between the first and second days of the court-authorized excavation, found the gold, and spirited it away. Residents have previously told of hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight — when the dig was supposed to have been paused — and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles, including large armored trucks. The FBI has denied it conducted an overnight dig.

            Parada and a consultant, Warren Getler, have focused on a handful of FBI photos and an accompanying photo log that have them questioning the FBI's official gold dig timeline. At issue is the presence or absence of snow in the images and the timing of a storm that briefly disrupted operations. For example, an FBI image that was supposed to have been taken about an hour after the squall does not show any snow on a large, moss-covered boulder at the dig site. That same boulder is snow-covered in a photo that FBI records indicate was taken the next morning — some 15 hours after the storm. 

            They accuse the FBI of altering the sequence of events to conceal an overnight excavation.

            “We have compelling evidence a night dig took place, and that the FBI went to some large effort to cover up that night dig,” said Getler, co-author of “Rebel Gold,” a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.

            There are other seeming anomalies in the records, according to Finders Keepers' legal motion. Among them:

            — The FBI initially turned over hundreds of photos, but rendered them in low-resolution, high-contrast black-and-white, making it impossible to tell the time of day they were taken or even, in some cases, what they show. The treasure hunters went back and requested several dozen of the photos in color, which the FBI provided.

            — The agency did not provide any video of the second and final day of the dig. Nor did it produce any photos or video showing what the FBI’s own hand-drawn map described as a 30-foot-long, 12-foot-deep trench — which the treasure hunters claim could have only been dug overnight. Government lawyers acknowledged these gaps in the photo and video record but did not elaborate in a court filing last week.

            — The consulting firm hired by the FBI to assess the possibility of gold produced a report on its findings, but the version given to the treasure hunters seems to be missing key pages.

            — The FBI did not provide any of its agents' travel and expense invoices, which could shed further light on the dig timeline.

            The records released so far “cast doubt on the FBI’s claim to have found nothing and raise serious and troubling questions about the FBI’s conduct during the dig and in this litigation, where it has gone to great lengths to distort critical evidence,” Anne Weismann, a lawyer for Finders Keepers, wrote in a legal filing that seeks records, including the FBI’s operational plan, that she says were improperly withheld. 

            The Justice Department did not address the treasure hunters’ most explosive claims of a possible coverup in its latest legal filing. The government instead told a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that the FBI had satisfied its legal obligation to the treasure hunters to search for its records of the dig, and asked for the case to be closed.

            The judge has yet to rule.

            Parada said he will keep asking questions until he gets satisfactory answers.

            “I will stick at this until the end, until I know everything that happened to that gold,” he said. “How much, where it went to, who has it now. I gotta know.”CLEARFIELD, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814476,The KMT's mega dilemma,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — For the last few weeks, the politics sections on every local Chinese language news website have been packed with articles regarding Foxconn founder Terry Gou’s (郭台銘) allegedly divinely-approved bid to rejoin the Kuomintang (KMT) so he can run in their presidential primary. The speculation and opinion on the subject has hit a fever pitch.It is highly likely that he will be allowed to rejoin the party. The giant question looming over the political scene is when, which is up to KMT Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫) and presumably the membership committee (which usually votes the way the chair indicates).As background for this column, yesterday’s column “Who is Taiwan's 'Genghis Khan' at the gates of KMT?” delves into the origins of the current situation, the background of Terry Gou, and all the trials and tribulations of his last primary run. In a nutshell, Terry Gou claimed that he was told by Matsu in a dream to run for president in 2019, lost in the primary, impetuously attacked the KMT, and renounced his party membership.Party rules state that he is only eligible to rejoin the party after four years, which is this September, after the primary.In 2019, the KMT changed its rules to accommodate Gou joining the primary by lifting the one-year membership requirement to run. If Eric Chu wants him to run, he can figure out a way — and everyone knows it.This creates a complicated dilemma for Chu. Chu is a skilled politician and shrewdly punted the decision until after the upcoming March 4 Nantou legislative by-election, claiming that he was putting his full attention into that race.I don’t buy that, of course, but it was a very smart move. It allows him to see how Gou is playing in the press, time to see who and how many in his party are for and against Gou and how strongly, and also to see if Gou either makes another gaffe or comes up with a sweetener for the party, like a major cash donation.Probably the most basic consideration for Chu is whether he thinks he has a shot at winning himself. There is no doubt he wants another shot at running for president after having lost in 2016, but the polling looks grim.Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) polling shows that in a primary competing against Terry Gou, New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) and media personality Jaw Shaw-kong's (趙少康), Eric Chu comes in third at 7.9%, well behind Gou and Hou, though ahead of Jaw. That poll didn’t include now-declared candidate Chang Ya-chung (張亞中), but both Gou and Hou would likely poll well ahead of Chang as well.For Chu to win the primary, he’d have to see off Gou and Hou. However, Hou hasn’t declared if he’s running or not, which complicates matters — Hou is Taiwan’s most popular politician.TVBS polled hypothetical three-way matchups between three potential KMT candidates, the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Lai Ching-te (賴淸德) and the Taiwan People’s Party’s Ko Wen-je (柯文哲). When the KMT candidate was either Hou or Gou, they had the highest support at 34%, but when the candidate was Chu, he scored a paltry 14% and came in dead last after Lai and Ko.Faced with this grim fact, he may well have decided he would be better off politically by trying to score a big win as party chair by getting a KMT president elected in hopes of getting a plum reward like being chosen as premier. There would be some irony if Hou won. Hou was Chu’s protege and a deputy mayor of his when Chu was New Taipei mayor.Chu is talking like he realizes he might not be a good candidate. He’s repeatedly been saying that he will “selflessly” work to get the “strongest candidate.”In spite of Hou having previously been his protege, there are rumors of a rift between the two, and Hou has bucked Chu as party chair in very public ways, including standing him up just the other day. That being said, Chu recently praised Hou as a strong “hen” (母雞) able to boost the electability of downstream candidates (chicks, 小雞).Hou has not yet declared his candidacy, which is a major problem for Chu, who is deciding whether to admit Gou to run in the primary. If Gou is allowed in, and then Hou enters the race, the primary could badly fracture the party, which happened when Gou entered the 2019 race.However, it could be worse if Gou is rebuffed and Hou doesn’t enter the race. Then the KMT would be left without a strong candidate unless Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen (盧秀燕) can be convinced to join.Even worse, if rejected, Gou could run as an independent, create a new party or even potentially run with the Taiwan People’s Party, though both Gou and Ko Wen-je so far have talked like that won’t happen. However, things can, and often do, change dramatically in Taiwan politics and that can’t be ruled out (a topic explored at length in this previous column).The newspapers have been chock full of talk that Hou and Gou have an arrangement between the two whereby if one declares the other won’t run. I haven’t been able to find a shred of proof that such an arrangement has been made, and neither of them appears to have in any way indicated it exists.If Gou were to run outside of the KMT, with his funding he would cause quite a splash and split the pan-blue vote. Lai Ching-te is probably hoping this is exactly what will happen.Chu also has internal politics to consider. The powerful 49er families that fled the Chinese Civil War that have powerful sway within the party are widely suspicious of Hou, whose family has been in Taiwan for hundreds of years, and suspect he may be another secret pro-independence supporter like former President Lee Tung-hui (李登輝) because Hou studiously avoids the topic.Gou is from a 49er family, has strong ties to China, is suspicious of buying weapons from the United States, and is ideologically deep blue — so on paper he should appeal to them. Though he has his supporters in the party, intriguingly some deep blue politicians have come out against him — my suspicion is due to a combination of the damage he did to party unity last time, and because he hasn’t been loyal to the KMT in past.Deep blue firebrand Alex Tsai (蔡正元) declared if Gou became the party’s nominee he’d “leave the party and support Lai Ching-te” and that if the party changed the rules to allow Gou in the primary the KMT would be like a “public toilet.” While it’s inconceivable Tsai would actually support Lai, it is a strong statement from Tsai, even by his rather outrageous standards.Also, intriguingly deep blue former KMT Chair Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) has strongly thrown her support behind Hou, not Gou. Alex Tsai supports Chang Ya-chung, which is less surprising.Deep blue media outlet Want Want China Times Chair Tsai Eng-meng (蔡衍明) reportedly is unhappy with Gou, though he denies it. That the China Times recently ran an editorial headlined “Will the KMT be defiled by Terry Gou once again” suggests otherwise.I spend hours every day going through local media across the political spectrum, and my sense is that opposition to Gou in the KMT is stronger than his support by a fair margin, at least judging by the comments of KMT politicians. Referring to Gou’s seeking out approval from deities to run, a KMT city councilor mocked him by asking “will everything in international and domestic affairs be decided by divination?”Chu will also have to consider Gou’s electability. In the TVBS poll mentioned above, he came out ahead of both Lai Ching-te and Ko Wen-je, garnering the same 34% support as when Hou was the polled candidate.Gou is also very well-known, popular, and admired for his business acumen. His support for his former employee Ann Kao (高虹安) was considered a significant factor in her winning the Hsinchu mayoral race.He’s one of the richest people in the country. That’s a big plus for a party that is as cash-strapped as the KMT.But Chu knows better, he’s too shrewd a politician not to. First, Gou has only ever run in one presidential primary, and is vastly less experienced in politics than Hou Yu-ih or Chu.Then there is the matter of Gou’s ideology and his character, which was laid out in yesterday’s column. In summary, he is gaffe-prone, thin-skinned, and prone to angry outbursts.He is also ideologically far too deep blue for mainstream voters, has extensive ties with China, is reportedly on good terms with Xi Jinping, and has said disparaging things about democracy, all of which will come under serious scrutiny if he does become the nominee. In 2018, KMT nominee Daniel Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) started the year well ahead in the polls but as the public grew more aware of his similarly deep-blue ideology the voters sent him down to a landslide defeat.Eric Chu has a really tough decision to make. If he lets Gou in, the KMT primary is going to be a wild ride.",2023/02/19,1086,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814493,Chief of staff exerts quiet power at center of White House,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It's been called the worst job in Washington. The gatekeeper to the most powerful leader on earth. The president's alter ego or the chief javelin catcher. 

            The job of White House chief of staff is at the fulcrum of the federal government, yet it's a role that remains largely opaque outside of Washington circles. The newest person to assume the title is Jeff Zients, a longtime Washington hand with a reputation as a managerial whiz who became President Joe Biden's second chief of staff last week. 

            Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said the White House chief of staff is a kind of a “chief operating officer of the country.”











            “He’s not the biggest problem solver. He shouldn’t have to do the analysis and he’s got all sorts of other people that will do that,” said Romney, who pondered his own chief of staff picks when he was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012. “But he’s got to run the government, and that’s a task which very few chiefs of staff have had real experience in doing.” 

            So what does a White House chief of staff actually do? 

            Zients is literally the chief of the West Wing staff, ensuring that trains run on time and that the president is well served by aides. Zients is the one who presents options to the president on any number of executive decisions.

            The chief of staff controls access to the president and is charged with turning the administration's ambitions into reality. The president's top aide is part of the Cabinet and must maintain good relationships with the heads of other agencies to ensure they are all on the same page. The job means juggling countless competing constituencies and often being the person who has to say “no” to them. 

            In a 2005 Washington Post article, Andy Card, who served President George W. Bush for nearly six years, likened his approach to managing a kitchen. Top priority items were on the front and back burners of the stove and longer-term tasks got stashed into the freezer. 

            ""I’ve described it as a wind tunnel,” said Mack McLarty, who was President Bill Clinton’s first chief of staff. McLarty recalled that as he was preparing to assume the role, he was told by Howard Baker, chief of staff in President Ronald Reagan’s second term, that there was no worse job in the nation’s capital.

            During his first 10 days on the job, Zients has had to handle long-planned White House priorities ( a planned trip to Poland to mark one year since Russia invaded Ukraine) and unexpected challenges ( multiple unidentified objects shot down from the sky). All throughout, Zients' chief objective as the president prepares for a likely reelection campaign is to seamlessly implement several landmark bills that Biden signed into law in his first two years. 

            “As a team, our approach to delivering results for the American people will be straightforward,"" Zients wrote in a note to White House aides on his first day as chief of staff. “We must aggressively and equitably implement the President’s policies, ensure that Americans know how to access these benefits and clearly communicate what we have accomplished on behalf of ALL Americans.”

            The new chief of staff, who was an initial investor in a Washington bagel shop, immediately resurrected an old tradition from his previous stint in the White House: Bagel Wednesdays. 

            Those who have been a White House chief of staff, as well as those who have studied them, can point to several traits that are key to success: experience serving in previous administrations, an intimate familiarity with Capitol Hill, managerial acumen and political shrewdness. Also: a temperament that doesn't gyrate with the whims of a news cycle — not to mention a close, personal relationship with the president.

            Past chiefs of staff with that precise collection of characteristics, according to Chris Whipple, who wrote extensively on the role for “The Gatekeepers,"" include James Baker, Reagan's first chief of staff; Leon Panetta, Clinton's second chief of staff; and Ron Klain, who recently exited the White House after serving as Biden's chief of staff his first two years. 

            ""Every president learns — sometimes the hard way — that he cannot govern effectively without empowering a White House chief of staff as first among equals in the West Wing to execute his agenda and to tell him what he doesn’t want to hear,"" said Whipple, who spent extensive time with Klain for his latest book, “The Fight of His Life.” 

            Panetta, who would go on to serve as CIA director and defense secretary under President Barack Obama, agreed. 

            “I think the success or failure of any chief of staff is going to be very dependent on the relationship that that individual has with the president,"" Panetta said in an interview. “In order for any chief of staff to do his job, he absolutely has to have the trust of the president of the United States, and the two of them have to be able to trust one another.” 

            Romney said he would have picked either Mike Leavitt, a former Utah governor and Bush's health secretary who led Romney’s would-be transition team, or just-retired Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, as chief of staff had Romney won the presidency. He said both possessed “extraordinary management capacity.""

            Panetta also underscored the importance of the White House chief of staff maintaining close ties on Capitol Hill, which steers so much of the administration's objectives or impede them. Zients has never worked in Congress, although he has won praise from Republican lawmakers from his time leading the Biden White House's COVID-19 response team.

            Lawmakers ""can set the tone for what's before the White House for that particular day, as to whether they're having a good day or a bad day,"" Panetta said. 

            As for those who weren't quite as successful in the role, Whipple pointed to Mark Meadows, President Donald Trump's final chief of staff — noting that Meadows declined to keep tight controls on who had access to Trump and did not push back on the president's most outlandish demands. 

            “He swung the gate wide open for this Star Wars bar cast of characters parading into the Oval from Rudy Giuliani to Sidney Powell to the pillow guy,” said Whipple, referring to MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a high-profile Trump ally. Giuliani was Trump's personal lawyer and Powell was a lawyer for Trump's campaign’s legal team who was booted from that role after pushing unfounded conspiracy theories after the 2020 election.

            Whipple also said Donald Regan, Baker’s successor under Reagan, did not serve the president well as the Iran-contra affair engulfed the Reagan administration, and saw himself akin to a prime minister with little interest in the “staff” part of his title. Regan, who died in 2003, famously feuded with first lady Nancy Reagan, who helped force him out in 1987.

            In picking a chief of staff, presidents sometimes gravitate toward someone with whom they've had long-held ties. McLarty was a kindergarten classmate of Clinton in Hope, Arkansas. Klain spent decades alongside Biden on Capitol Hill and was a campaign adviser on Biden's previous presidential bids and chief of staff when Biden was vice president.

            Trump went the opposite direction with his first chief of staff, picking Reince Priebus, who led the Republican National Committee in 2016. Priebus struggled to unite the warring factions within the White House. He never overcame deep suspicion from Trump loyalists who viewed him as a stalwart of the party establishment they reviled. Priebus was unceremoniously fired via tweet just six months into Trump's term. 

            Biden signaled the importance he places on his chief of staff during an event honoring Klain, saying a president is “only as good as the team you put around you.""

            The White House chief of staff is one of just a handful of the most powerful jobs in government that have been occupied only by white men. Asked last month whether Biden would select someone who is not white or male if he has the chance to choose another chief of staff after Zients, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say. 

            But she said the current administration is ""the most diverse in history"" and “we expect this trend to continue.”WASHINGTON (AP) — It's been called the worst job in Washington. The gatekeeper to the most powerful leader on earth. The president's alter ego or the chief javelin catcher.The job of White House chief of staff is at the fulcrum of the federal government, yet it's a role that remains largely opaque outside of Washington circles. The newest person to assume the title is Jeff Zients, a longtime Washington hand with a reputation as a managerial whiz who became President Joe Biden's second chief of staff last week.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said the White House chief of staff is a kind of a “chief operating officer of the country.”“He’s not the biggest problem solver. He shouldn’t have to do the analysis and he’s got all sorts of other people that will do that,” said Romney, who pondered his own chief of staff picks when he was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012. “But he’s got to run the government, and that’s a task which very few chiefs of staff have had real experience in doing.”So what does a White House chief of staff actually do?Zients is literally the chief of the West Wing staff, ensuring that trains run on time and that the president is well served by aides.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814495,Ratcliffe's Ineos confirms bid to buy Manchester United,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos confirmed Saturday it has made a bid to buy Manchester United, pledging to make the Premier League team “the number one club in the world once again.”

            Ratcliffe’s Ineos company will compete with Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who also submitted a bid on Friday to buy out the Glazer family.

            The 70-year-old Ratcliffe is one of Britain's wealthiest people with an estimated net worth of 12.5 billion pounds ($15 billion) following the success of his global chemical company.











            “We can confirm that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have submitted a bid for majority ownership of Manchester United Football Club,” the company said in a statement. “We are ambitious and highly competitive and would want to invest in Manchester United to make them the number one club in the world once again.""

            Ineos also appeared to cast itself as an alternative to foreign ownership, with the Qatari bid coming in the wake of a Saudi takeover of Newcastle last year. Defending league champion Manchester City — United's crosstown rival — has been Abu Dhabi-owned since 2008. Sheikh Jassim's bid has emphasized that only private wealth is being used, in contrast to the Qatari state-backed ownership of Paris Saint-Germain.

            “We also recognize that football governance in this country is at a crossroads,"" Ineos said. ""We would want to help lead this next chapter, deepening the culture of English football by making the club a beacon for a modern, progressive, fan-centred approach to ownership. We want a Manchester United anchored in its proud history and roots in the North-West of England, putting the Manchester back into Manchester United and clearly focusing on winning the Champions League.”

            Ratcliffe announced his intention to bid last month. That was a shift in strategy from last year when he launched a last-minute bid for Chelsea, but was not considered because he missed the deadline.

            Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, last year said he had no interest in another bid for a Premier League club after missing out on Chelsea and receiving little encouragement from the Glazers for United. But he would be a popular choice among fans because of his longstanding support of the club.

            It is the first time two people were elected in the same year in the Wheelchair Tennis Category, which appears on the Hall ballot every four years. The additions of Vergeer and Draney raise the total number of wheelchair tennis inductees to seven.

            For the second consecutive year, no one nominated in the Player Category was picked to join the Hall, which has been around since 1955. The Class of 2022 marked the first time in history no one on the ballot was selected. This year’s Player Category candidates were Cara Black, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Ana Ivanovic, Carlos Moya, Daniel Nestor, Flavia Pennetta and Lisa Raymond.











            Candidates need to be chosen on 75% of ballots; voters include media, historians, Hall of Fame members, industry experts and fans. Nominees can remain in contention for three years.

            The results of the 2023 balloting were announced Saturday during the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam, where Vergeer is the tournament director for the wheelchair events.

            Vergeer, who is Dutch, won 44 Grand Slam titles between singles and doubles and was unbeaten for more than 10 years, retiring with a singles winning streak of 470 matches.

            She won eight Paralympic medals — four each in singles and doubles — and was a 13-time International Tennis Federation world champion.

            Draney, who is from the United States, played a key role in the development of the quad division in wheelchair tennis, in addition to being an accomplished athlete. He was a three-time International Tennis Federation year-end No. 1 in quad singles and also reached No. 1 in doubles.

            The induction ceremony will be on July 22 in Newport, Rhode Island, the site of the Hall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814505,Will Alex Murdaugh testify? Takeaways from his murder trial,"The defense team at disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial finally get their chance to present their version of events after more than three weeks of testimony. 

            Murdaugh, 54, is accused of killing his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, at their home in June 2021 as the once-prominent attorney's career and finances were crumbling. Murdaugh, whose family dominated the legal system in tiny Hampton County for generations, has denied any role in the fatal shootings.

            Prosecutors called 61 witnesses and introduced more than 550 pieces of evidence over 17 days of testimony — from descriptions of the brutality of the killings to numbing details about bank records. 











            Here are some key takeaways so far.

            WILL ALEX MURDAUGH TESTIFY?

            Murdaugh’s lawyers haven’t given any indication publicly if the disbarred attorney will take the stand.

            Doing so would allow him to explain some of the evidence prosecutors presented. 

            For example, Murdaugh told police he wasn't at his Colleton County home in the hours before the killings, but several witnesses said they heard his voice on video taken from the dog kennels there just minutes before his wife and son were shot. Their bodies were found near the kennels.

            Murdaugh also could respond to his sister-in-law’s testimony that he didn’t appeared scared in the weeks after the slayings even as other family members were worried that they, too, were potential targets.

            Testifying also could come with risks. 

            Defendants who choose to do so sometimes give jurors evidence of their guilt. 

            For Murdaugh, he could open himself up to questions about some of the roughly 100 other charges he is awaiting trial for. Those include allegations that he stole millions from clients and others. 

            He faces 30 years to life if convicted of murder.

            TRIALS WITHIN A TRIAL

            Throughout the double murder trial, Judge Clifton Newman has allowed prosecutors to present evidence related to those other charges — from insurance fraud for allegedly trying to arrange his own killing to theft to money laundering to tax evasion.

            Prosecutors have argued that evidence is central to the murder case. They say Murdaugh wanted sympathy to buy time to cover up his financial crimes that were about to be discovered. They also say it shows that when Murdaugh is about to face dire consequences, he chooses violence.

            His defense team has strongly objected, saying the crimes are unrelated to murder. They say that evidence is intended to convince a jury that Murdaugh is so bad he must have killed his family, even if prosecutors haven't proved that.

            Newman's decisions in favor of prosecutors have led to trials within a trial, with days spent on testimony related to the other allegations. 

            If Murdaugh is convicted of murder, that's likely to be a huge part of any appeal.

            ALEX MURDAUGH'S HEIGHT

            The defense has made Murdaugh's height an issue, suggesting he's too tall to have fired the shot that killed his son.

            At one point, defense attorney Jim Griffin got out a tape measure during a courtroom break and stretched to log his client's height, thought to be about 6-foot-4 (1.93 meters).

            A pathologist and a crime scene expert testified the bullet that killed Paul Murdaugh entered through his abdomen and traveled at a steep angle up through his head, and that the barrel of the shotgun was held away from his skin. The defense suggested a tall man would have to stand at an odd, off-balance angle with a shotgun with a strong kickback to fire that way.

            Jurors also heard about a blue rain jacket with gunshot residue on the inside lining. Prosecutors suggested Alex Murdaugh used it to take away the murder weapons, which have not been found.

            The jacket was recorded as a large on the crime lab's evidence log sheet, a lab tech said under questioning from Murdaugh's attorneys.

            They later asked the housekeeper and family friend who washed the family's clothes what size Murdaugh wore. 

            Her answer: XXL.

            EVIDENCE TEASED

            A receipt with a $1,021.10 item from Gucci circled. Hair in Maggie Murdaugh’s hands. Footprints near the kennels that seemed to be from her flip flops.

            Those are among the evidence that prosecutors have presented but not yet explained.

            Out of nowhere Thursday, prosecutor John Meadors mentioned a cooler that a caretaker at the Murdaugh home mentioned was there before the killings and he hadn't seen since.

            Meadors asked a state agent if someone could theoretically take wet clothing or guns away in a cooler and not get the inside of their vehicle dirty. No cooler has been placed in evidence and that was the only mention of it so far.The defense team at disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial finally get their chance to present their version of events after more than three weeks of testimony.Murdaugh, 54, is accused of killing his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, at their home in June 2021 as the once-prominent attorney's career and finances were crumbling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814506,Why sick minks are reigniting worries about bird flu,"NEW YORK (AP) — A recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people.

            Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets.

            As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.











            Scientist say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009.

            Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

            A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention:

            WHAT IS BIRD FLU?

            Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig — or swine — flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.

            The bird flu virus drawing attention today — Type A H5N1 — was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.

            By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices.

            HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU?

            The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while.

            Symptoms are the similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe. life-threatening pneumonia.

            Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.

            The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered.

            CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE?

            In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007.

            In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people.

            It wouldn't take much for that to happen ""and then we would be in a really tough situation,” said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

            The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said.

            WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MINK FARM?

            Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu.

            Then last month, a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52,000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire.

            The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink — a worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions.

            Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people.

            ""That's the real worry,"" said Nuzzo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814517,North Korea fires long-range ballistic missile into sea,"North Korea launched a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Saturday that landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone, the Tokyo government said.The test came after Pyongyang warned of an ""unprecedentedly persistent, strong"" response to planned joint military drills by the United State and South Korea.Pyongyang ""fired one ICBM-class ballistic missile toward the east. It flew for about 66 minutes,"" chief government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.He said the missile flew an estimated 900 kilometers (560 miles), reaching a maximum altitude of 5,700 kilometers, and is believed to have landed at 6:27 p.m. local time (0927 GMT).Matsuno said Japan had lodged a protest through ""diplomatic channels.""""The government will respond by coordinating closely with the international community including the US and South Korea through the ongoing G7 foreign ministerial meeting and the UN Security Council,"" he added.Tokyo said there were no immediate reports of damage to ships or airplanes.Later Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile seemed to have a 14,000-kilometer range that could reach the US mainland.The White House said in a statement that the ""launch needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.""The statement added that the US would take ""all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.""Saturday's missile launch was the first by Pyongyang since January 1 and took place from the Sunan area, where the isolated country has conducted most of its recent ICBM tests.Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the firing of an unprecedented number of missiles, including ICBMs capable of striking anywhere in the United States and has also restarted plans for its first nuclear test since 2017.State media video footage from a military parade last week suggests the North has created a military unit tasked with operating new ICBMs, in line with its recent restructuring of the army.The parade displayed more ICBMs than ever before, including a possible new solid-fuel weapon, which could help the North deploy its missiles faster in the event of a war.Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs are banned under United Nations Security Council resolutions.But the North's leaders say the weapons development is necessary to counter ""hostile policies"" by Washington and its allies.South Korea's Defense Ministry said Friday that Seoul and Washington will hold annual computer-simulated combined training in mid-March.The 11-day exercise would reflect North Korea's nuclear threats, as well as unspecified lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, an official said.The two countries are also due to conduct joint field exercises in mid-March that would be bigger than those held in the past few years.Pyongyang has traditionally described US-South Korea military exercises as rehearsals for a potential invasion, while the allies insist that their drills are defensive in nature.The two allies had downsized or canceled some of their major drills in support of former US President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang.But North Korea's growing nuclear threats have raised the urgency for South Korea and Japan to strengthen their defense postures in line with their alliances with the United States.In December, Japan made a major break from its strictly self-defense-only post-World War II principle, adopting a new national security strategy that includes preemptive strikes and cruise missiles to counter growing threats from North Korea, China and Russia.mm/kb (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814518,Republican losses fan election conspiracies in rural Arizona,"BISBEE, Ariz. (AP) — James Knox was glad to get out of the big city.

            Part of a network of activists who believe U.S. elections are unreliable, Knox has unsuccessfully tried to convince supervisors in Maricopa County, Arizona's most populous county and home to Phoenix, that they should throw out elections that Republicans lost and get rid of voting machines.

            So earlier this past week, Knox went somewhere more hospitable to his project — nearly 200 miles south of his home in the Phoenix exurb of Queen Creek to Cochise County. During last year's elections, the county's conservative-majority Board of Supervisors tried to count all ballots by hand — until a judge blocked that — and then refused to certify the results until a judge ordered them to do so.











            “Here, it's a little bit easier to be heard by the board,” Knox said before the latest supervisors' meeting, where members discussed replacing the respected elections director, who resigned after objecting to the board's decisions.

            Last year was a tough one for the election denial movement in Arizona. Its candidates for U.S. Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general all lost. But it's still thriving in rural Cochise County, a vivid example of how paranoia about elections fanned by former President Donald Trump maintains a stubborn grip in rural parts of the country.

            Trump last year backed a slate of candidates for top state election positions in Arizona and elsewhere who parroted his lie about losing the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud. Every one of those candidates lost in the battleground states that typically decide the presidency. But the election conspiracy movement maintains a firm hold in beet-red rural spots such as Cochise County, a swath of the Sonoran Desert dotted with ranches, small towns and U.S.-Mexico border communities that encompasses an area larger than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.

            The county’s respected elections director, Lisa Marra, who had opposed the board’s voting moves, recently resigned from the nonpartisan position after five years in the job. The two Republicans on the three-member board are seeking to replace her with the elected county recorder, David Stevens, another Republican.

            Stevens is a friend of former GOP state Rep. Mark Finchem, who attended Trump's rally in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the Capitol riot and who ran unsuccessfully last year for secretary of state, Arizona's top election post. Finchem had said he would not have certified President Joe Biden's 2020 win in Arizona.

            Stevens was prepared to oversee Cochise County's hand count when Marra objected last year, and only stopped once a judge ruled that it violated state law. Stevens and the two Republican board members have appealed that ruling. The recorder recently joined a nonprofit founded by Finchem to focus on election “integrity.”

            In Arizona, elected recorders such as Stevens already play a part in elections. They register voters, distribute mail ballots and verify signatures on the ones sent back, while the nonpartisan election director handles the counting. Stevens said he has always been a fair broker in elections and that in 2020, he spoke more to Democratic groups about voting than Republican ones.

            Still, many residents are furious at Stevens' new role.

            “Recorder Stevens has proven he's part of the crazy conspiracy crowd,” said Jennifer Druckman, a retiree who was one of dozens who spoke out against Stevens getting expanded responsibilities to oversee elections in the county.

            Cochise is staunchly conservative — Trump won the county by 20 percentage points in 2020 even as Biden took the state. But the backlash to the election chaos has been palpable.

            Activists are circulating petitions to recall Supervisor Tom Crosby, one of the two Republicans who voted for the hand count in October. Crosby also refused to certify the county's vote tallies as a way to stop the state from finalizing election results in December after Democrat Katie Hobbs defeated Republican Kari Lake for governor.

            After a judge ordered the Cochise County board to certify the election, Crosby skipped the next meeting, leaving fellow Republican Peggy Judd and Democrat Ann English to take the vote. It was a dramatic example of how the once-routine task of formalizing election results became charged with politics as Trump allies in scattered rural counties in the West targeted certification as a way to disrupt elections.

            In an interview after this past week's meeting, Crosby scoffed at speakers' claims that he represents a threat to democracy.

            “The ‘Big Lie’ is that checking voting machines is subverting democracy,” Crosby said. “My constituents feel like, if we can't check ‘em, we don’t want 'em.”

            Election officials, including in Cochise County, check the accuracy of their machines by comparing their tabulations with paper ballot receipts, but Crosby said he still had broader suspicions. Crosby also dismissed the recall effort.

            “If it's leftists bashing me or patriots saying I'm wonderful, the message is the same,” he said.

            But not everyone upset at Crosby is a leftist. Greg Lamberth, a retired engineer and lifelong Republican, is one of the people circulating petitions to recall the supervisor.

            “I don't see Mr. Crosby as acting in a way that gives us a functional government in Cochise County,” Lamberth said in an interview, noting the county has already spent more than $100,000 in legal fees related to its election adventures.

            A former Marine, Lamberth is also disappointed in Stevens, a onetime military information technology specialist.

            “He knows damn well that a hand count is less accurate than a machine count,” Lamberth said.

            That's why election officials decades ago largely turned away from hand counts and used tabulators to tally up ballots. Trump and his allies have attacked those devices, making unsupported allegations they were rigged against him in 2020, sometimes insinuating that foreign powers such as Venezuela were behind it. Those allegations triggered pushes for hand counts in a few rural counties in Nevada and New Mexico.

            Stevens said in an interview that last October, a small group of conservative citizens approached him and asked whether the county could tally all ballots by hand rather than rely on machines. Stevens said he told them no — it was too close to the election to change procedure.

            But Stevens suggested the county conduct a parallel hand count to check the machines' accuracy. Other election officials were alarmed, warning it could fan misinformation about the true tally in statewide races. A judge ruled the county didn't have discretion to pursue a full hand count; the county is appealing.

            Stevens stressed that none of this was his idea or that of the supervisors.

            “All this comes from the grassroots,” he said in an interview in his office in the county building, where a pockmarked target from a shooting range hung from the wall and assembled Lego Star Wars sets sat on his coffee table.

            While Stevens knocked down some prominent Arizona election conspiracy theories, saying most were a product of people not understanding the complexity of the elections process, he said he didn't want to dismiss the value of a hand count.

            “I try not to have preconceived notions — let's find out,” Stevens said.

            Elisabeth Tyndall, the chairwoman of the county's Democratic Party, said the problem is that Cochise's Republican power structure simply cannot say “no” to its base.

            “We have had Republican leadership pretty much forever,” Tyndall said. “They haven't held their fellow Republicans accountable for nonsense.”

            Despite their overwhelming numerical advantages at the ballot box, many Cochise Republicans still see themselves as an aggrieved minority that needs to get more aggressive.

            Bob McCormick, 82, a retired real estate agent, was a member of the small group that initially met with Stevens. He said their numbers are now more than 100.

            Still, McCormick knew as he waited to enter the supervisors meeting that he was outnumbered by angry Democrats wanting to vent at the Republican supervisors and Stevens.

            “For every 10 of them, one of us shows up,” McCormick said of Democrats. “We really don't fight. Until we change the whole system, we're going to be in trouble.”

            Associated Press coverage of democracy receives support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content.BISBEE, Ariz. (AP) — James Knox was glad to get out of the big city.Part of a network of activists who believe U.S. elections are unreliable, Knox has unsuccessfully tried to convince supervisors in Maricopa County, Arizona's most populous county and home to Phoenix, that they should throw out elections that Republicans lost and get rid of voting machines.So earlier this past week, Knox went somewhere more hospitable to his project — nearly 200 miles south of his home in the Phoenix exurb of Queen Creek to Cochise County. During last year's elections, the county's conservative-majority Board of Supervisors tried to count all ballots by hand — until a judge blocked that — and then refused to certify the results until a judge ordered them to do so.“Here, it's a little bit easier to be heard by the board,” Knox said before the latest supervisors' meeting, where members discussed replacing the respected elections director, who resigned after objecting to the board's decisions.Last year was a tough one for the election denial movement in Arizona. Its candidates for U.S. Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general all lost. But it's still thriving in rural Cochise County, a vivid example of how paranoia about elections fanned by former President Donald Trump maintains a stubborn grip in rural parts of the country.Trump last year backed a slate of candidates for top state election positions in Arizona and elsewhere who parroted his lie about losing the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud. Every one of those candidates lost in the battleground states that typically decide the presidency. But the election conspiracy movement maintains a firm hold in beet-red rural spots such as Cochise County, a swath of the Sonoran Desert dotted with ranches, small towns and U.S.-Mexico border communities that encompasses an area larger than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.The county’s respected elections director, Lisa Marra, who had opposed the board’s voting moves, recently resigned from the nonpartisan position after five years in the job. The two Republicans on the three-member board are seeking to replace her with the elected county recorder, David Stevens, another Republican.Stevens is a friend of former GOP state Rep. Mark Finchem, who attended Trump's rally in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the Capitol riot and who ran unsuccessfully last year for secretary of state, Arizona's top election post. Finchem had said he would not have certified President Joe Biden's 2020 win in Arizona.Stevens was prepared to oversee Cochise County's hand count when Marra objected last year, and only stopped once a judge ruled that it violated state law. Stevens and the two Republican board members have appealed that ruling. The recorder recently joined a nonprofit founded by Finchem to focus on election “integrity.”In Arizona, elected recorders such as Stevens already play a part in elections. They register voters, distribute mail ballots and verify signatures on the ones sent back, while the nonpartisan election director handles the counting. Stevens said he has always been a fair broker in elections and that in 2020, he spoke more to Democratic groups about voting than Republican ones.Still, many residents are furious at Stevens' new role.“Recorder Stevens has proven he's part of the crazy conspiracy crowd,” said Jennifer Druckman, a retiree who was one of dozens who spoke out against Stevens getting expanded responsibilities to oversee elections in the county.Cochise is staunchly conservative — Trump won the county by 20 percentage points in 2020 even as Biden took the state.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814519,Late goals give Arsenal 4-2 win over Villa to halt slide,"BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — With Arsenal heading toward another disappointing result, new signing Jorginho came up big to keep the Gunners’ title aspirations on track.

            Jorginho's shot from outside the area in second-half stoppage time bounced against the crossbar and off Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez's head before going into the net to put Arsenal ahead for good in a come-from-behind 4-2 win Saturday that halted a three-game winless streak in the English Premier League.

            Arsenal had to come from behind twice before the lucky bounce from Jorginho's shot made it 3-2 in the third minute of stoppage time. Gabriel Martinelli then tapped a fourth into an empty net on a quick counter after Martinez — the former Arsenal goalkeeper — had come up the field as the hosts searched for an equalizer in an action-filled game at Villa Park.











            Martinelli had also helped set up Arsenal's third goal by squaring the ball back to Jorginho, who unleashed a fierce strike.

            “We needed a magic moment and Jorginho produced it,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.

            The win puts Arsenal back atop the table, two points ahead of Manchester City and with a game in hand after Pep Guardiola's team was held to 1-1 at Nottingham Forest later Saturday. It also halted an alarming slump for Arteta's team, which had looked in danger of suffering a fourth loss in five games in all competitions. That recent run included a 3-1 loss to City at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday that had handed the momentum in the title race the defending champions.

            “Of course, very important after the last results we had,” said Jorginho, who joined Arsenal from Chelsea before the transfer deadline. “And the start wasn’t easy. We were not producing our game. And then we came into halftime, we had a talk, a chat, then we went back to doing the basics that we need to do, and we could change the game.”

            With actor and avid Villa fan Tom Hanks in attendance, the hosts went ahead in the the fifth minute through Ollie Watkins, after Oleksandr Zinchenko had given the ball away cheaply. Bukayo Saka equalized with a perfectly struck volley in the 16th, but Villa reclaimed the lead in the 31st through Philippe Coutinho.

            Zinchenko then scored his first Arsenal goal with a shot from just outside the area in the 61st to level for a second time, and the crucial bounces then all went the visitors' way as Villa's Leon Bailey hit the crossbar with a late chance before Jorginho — the former Chelsea midfielder who joined Arsenal in January — was more fortunate at the other end.

            “We (learned) an unbelievable lesson for all of us, that (is) we just need to believe until the very end that we can achieve everything,"" said Zinchenko, who won four Premier League titles with Man City before joining Arsenal last summer. “The reaction from all of us in the second half is perfect.”

            For Arteta, it was also a first win over Unai Emery, the former Arsenal manager who knocked the Gunners out of the Europa League semifinals two years ago when he was coaching Villarreal.

            After a bright start under Emery, Villa has now lost three straight games, including 4-2 defeat at home to Leicester.

            “It is embarrassing to lose 4-2 two home games in a row,” Emery said. “To concede eight goals in two games is poor, the performances cannot continue like that away or at home.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814520,Hungarian ballet rehearses in car factory amid energy crunch,"GYOR, Hungary (AP) — Reka Zalai clocked out for lunch on Thursday in the quality assurance department of an Audi automobile factory in Hungary.

            But instead of heading to her ordinary spot in the factory’s lunch room, she walked to a nearby conference hall near the production line to watch a performance of a professional contemporary ballet troupe. 

            The Ballet Company of Gyor, a city in northwest Hungary that is home to the sprawling car and motor plant, began rehearsing at the factory in January after being forced to shutter their rehearsal hall in response to soaring energy prices. 











            With nowhere to rehearse and scheduled performances approaching, the troupe approached the Audi factory, a longtime sponsor, which offered to host the dancers in a heated room at the plant for a few weeks during the coldest winter months. 

            In a converted conference room on Thursday, the dancers honed their pliés and pirouettes, while row upon row of new cars could be seen in a distant lot through the ceiling-high windows, and workers passed by outside dressed in bright red coveralls.

            Laszlo Velekei, the ballet company’s director, said that being able to maintain the continuity of rehearsals after the dancers left their theater was essential to keeping them in top form.

            “The most important thing in a dancer’s life is that they can’t stop,” Velekei said. “There is a saying that we often repeat to one another: if you miss one day (of rehearsal), it’s no problem. If you miss two days, then the dancer begins to feel it. If you miss three days, then the audience notices, too.”

            The Gyor Ballet's rehearsal hall is one of dozens of Hungarian cultural institutions that have temporarily shut down for the winter season in response to exponentially rising energy prices. Heating bills for some have risen tenfold since last winter, while high inflation and a weakening currency have compounded a dire economic outlook.

            Hungary’s government in July declared an “energy emergency” in response to rising prices and supply disruptions linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. It also made cuts to a popular utility subsidy program that since 2014 had kept the bills of Hungarians among the lowest in the 27-member European Union.

            Reka Jakab, a press spokesperson for Audi, said the ballet company wanted to give something back for the plant's 12,000 workers in return for the rehearsal space.

            “They offered to give one open performance for them each week, and they were also open to giving access to the rehearsals whenever the workers have free time,"" she said.

            She said many workers had never seen a ballet before, but the responses have been very positive.

            “Several people said that they would definitely attend the next performance in the theater.” 

            Zoltan Jekli, a dancer with the Gyor ballet, said that the troupe had overcome some of the limitations of the new space by outfitting the floor with a layer of soft PVC foam and bringing their own equipment to make it feel like home.

            “Whenever I come here, it fills me with good feelings and memories and I think everyone (in the troupe) feels the same,” he said. “We don’t have the sense that we’re coming into a car factory. We like to be here.”

            Zalai, 28, said she’s “always been amazed by ballet,” but that seeing it up close and getting a chance to break from her daily routine had been a particularly special experience. 

            “I was really recharged by this half-hour. Time stopped for me,” she said.GYOR, Hungary (AP) — Reka Zalai clocked out for lunch on Thursday in the quality assurance department of an Audi automobile factory in Hungary.But instead of heading to her ordinary spot in the factory’s lunch room, she walked to a nearby conference hall near the production line to watch a performance of a professional contemporary ballet troupe.The Ballet Company of Gyor, a city in northwest Hungary that is home to the sprawling car and motor plant, began rehearsing at the factory in January after being forced to shutter their rehearsal hall in response to soaring energy prices.With nowhere to rehearse and scheduled performances approaching, the troupe approached the Audi factory, a longtime sponsor, which offered to host the dancers in a heated room at the plant for a few weeks during the coldest winter months.In a converted conference room on Thursday, the dancers honed their pliés and pirouettes, while row upon row of new cars could be seen in a distant lot through the ceiling-high windows, and workers passed by outside dressed in bright red coveralls.Laszlo Velekei, the ballet company’s director, said that being able to maintain the continuity of rehearsals after the dancers left their theater was essential to keeping them in top form.“The most important thing in a dancer’s life is that they can’t stop,” Velekei said. “There is a saying that we often repeat to one another: if you miss one day (of rehearsal), it’s no problem.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814524,Fox pit reporter Sims a symbol of NASCAR's diversity goals,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — When Josh Sims reports on NASCAR this season, the stock car series these days -- from the garage to the grandstands to top brass -- looks more like him. 

            Yes, Sims takes pride in the fact that he will become the first Black pit reporter for the Daytona 500 and that his rapid rise at Fox has made him one of the primary faces of the network’s NASCAR coverage.

            More than that, Sims sees that NASCAR may finally be running out of unconquered firsts for people of color. For women. For any minority who perhaps has experienced an uneasy relationship with a series founded in the South 75 years ago, a generation before the civil rights era.











            Sims’ journey from NASCAR novice through a sports anchor gig in Charlotte, North Carolina, that sparked his passion in the sport had led to his biggest assignment yet: pit reporting as a Black man from one of auto racing’s signature events.

            “I never set out to be a first,” the 35-year-old Sims said. “I never set out to make history. I just wanted to be the best at what I was doing, whether it was hosting or reporting. At the same time, I kind of understand the platform and what it means for me to be doing this.”

            Sims has a full workload this season. He is the Cup Series pit reporter, teams with Regan Smith as an Xfinity Series reporter and is part of the host rotation for the FS1 show “Race Hub.”

            And this season, he wants to share the stories on what he sees at the track beyond the in-race reports and fantastic finishes. Minorities may not necessarily become the dominant demographic for the series, but they can certainly grab a larger share of the marketplace.

            “I think if more people out there saw it, saw people that looked them, instead of just driver, crew chief, you might be more inclined to feel like, hey, I feel a little more comfortable going to the track,” Sims said. “Getting that out there might help in terms of more people coming to the track and getting more different faces to the stands. It’s not necessarily about getting more people in, it’s showing what you already have.”

            It was, of course, a very low bar but the garage and grid and fans certainly appears to be more diverse now than before 2020 when NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from its tracks and properties. NASCAR is still overwhelmingly white, but NASCAR President Steve Phelps isn’t exaggerating when he says you notice the change when walking through the garage. 

            “I think the events of 2020 allowed the sport to get younger and more diverse,” he said at his state-of-the sport address in November.

            Among the notable achievements: Jusan Hamilton, who last year became the first Black race director in Daytona 500 history, will do it again this season. Amanda Oliver, a Black woman, negotiates high-profile deals as NASCAR’s senior vice president. John Ferguson, a Black man, is the chief human resources officer.

            Owners now include Pitbull and Michael Jordan, whose team features Bubba Wallace, the Black driver who prompted the flag ban. Rising stars in the developmental series include Rajah Caruth, a 20-year-old graduate of the “Drive for Diversity” program.

            Phelps said NASCAR was committed to strengthening ties to various programs that can attract a broader fan base, from Boys & Girls Clubs to “some of the other areas we have from a partnership standpoint that really speak to what’s happening in the African American community, what’s happening in the Hispanic, Latino community (to) what’s happening in the LGBTQ community.”

            While the frequently toxic nature of social media makes it easier for haters to reach Sims and others, he’s a popular personality each weekend at the track.

            “I never necessarily felt uncomfortable,” he said. “You get stuff here and there in terms of messages that’s emailed to you or sent to you but that’s par for the course if you’re a minority in the sport, a woman in the sport, even white drivers get stuff like that. But for every one or two of those, I get a lot more stuff from people excited that I’m here. You know, focus on the good.”

            Raised in East Brunswick, New Jersey, Sims is a Villanova graduate who followed the Wildcats in NCAA Tournament games in 2009 and remained a fan of most Philly teams. 

            “I grew up in Jersey, so not exactly NASCAR country,” Sims said. “Growing up, you know the Jimmies and the Dale Seniors and the Tony Stewarts and everybody but it wasn’t something I followed week in and week out.”

            His interest in NASCAR picked up in 2015 when he moved to Charlotte and hosted a pre-race show on the local Fox affiliate. Sims covered his first Daytona 500 in 2016 when Denny Hamlin nipped Martin Truex Jr. in the closest finish in race history.

            “I was like, I am all in,” Sims said.

            Charlotte can feel like a small town for a city and Sims kept bumping into friends and contacts in NASCAR. Fox Sports executives hired Sims in 2021 as a reporter for their slate of NASCAR shows. He also became the first Black pit reporter in any NASCAR series, for Trucks races.

            “I kind of hope that young people that look like me, can see me doing it and now recognize that it’s possible,” Sims said. “I hope I can kind of blaze a trail for them to one day say, hey, because Josh Sims did it, I can do it, too. And that’s what’s important.”

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — When Josh Sims reports on NASCAR this season, the stock car series these days -- from the garage to the grandstands to top brass -- looks more like him.Yes, Sims takes pride in the fact that he will become the first Black pit reporter for the Daytona 500 and that his rapid rise at Fox has made him one of the primary faces of the network’s NASCAR coverage.More than that, Sims sees that NASCAR may finally be running out of unconquered firsts for people of color. For women. For any minority who perhaps has experienced an uneasy relationship with a series founded in the South 75 years ago, a generation before the civil rights era.Sims’ journey from NASCAR novice through a sports anchor gig in Charlotte, North Carolina, that sparked his passion in the sport had led to his biggest assignment yet: pit reporting as a Black man from one of auto racing’s signature events.“I never set out to be a first,” the 35-year-old Sims said. “I never set out to make history. I just wanted to be the best at what I was doing, whether it was hosting or reporting. At the same time, I kind of understand the platform and what it means for me to be doing this.”Sims has a full workload this season. He is the Cup Series pit reporter, teams with Regan Smith as an Xfinity Series reporter and is part of the host rotation for the FS1 show “Race Hub.”And this season, he wants to share the stories on what he sees at the track beyond the in-race reports and fantastic finishes. Minorities may not necessarily become the dominant demographic for the series, but they can certainly grab a larger share of the marketplace.“I think if more people out there saw it, saw people that looked them, instead of just driver, crew chief, you might be more inclined to feel like, hey, I feel a little more comfortable going to the track,” Sims said. “Getting that out there might help in terms of more people coming to the track and getting more different faces to the stands. It’s not necessarily about getting more people in, it’s showing what you already have.”It was, of course, a very low bar but the garage and grid and fans certainly appears to be more diverse now than before 2020 when NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from its tracks and properties. NASCAR is still overwhelmingly white, but NASCAR President Steve Phelps isn’t exaggerating when he says you notice the change when walking through the garage.“I think the events of 2020 allowed the sport to get younger and more diverse,” he said at his state-of-the sport address in November.Among the notable achievements: Jusan Hamilton, who last year became the first Black race director in Daytona 500 history, will do it again this season. Amanda Oliver, a Black woman, negotiates high-profile deals as NASCAR’s senior vice president. John Ferguson, a Black man, is the chief human resources officer.Owners now include Pitbull and Michael Jordan, whose team features Bubba Wallace, the Black driver who prompted the flag ban. Rising stars in the developmental series include Rajah Caruth, a 20-year-old graduate of the “Drive for Diversity” program.Phelps said NASCAR was committed to strengthening ties to various programs that can attract a broader fan base, from Boys & Girls Clubs to “some of the other areas we have from a partnership standpoint that really speak to what’s happening in the African American community, what’s happening in the Hispanic, Latino community (to) what’s happening in the LGBTQ community.”While the frequently toxic nature of social media makes it easier for haters to reach Sims and others, he’s a popular personality each weekend at the track.“I never necessarily felt uncomfortable,” he said. “You get stuff here and there in terms of messages that’s emailed to you or sent to you but that’s par for the course if you’re a minority in the sport, a woman in the sport, even white drivers get stuff like that. But for every one or two of those, I get a lot more stuff from people excited that I’m here. You know, focus on the good.”Raised in East Brunswick, New Jersey, Sims is a Villanova graduate who followed the Wildcats in NCAA Tournament games in 2009 and remained a fan of most Philly teams.“I grew up in Jersey, so not exactly NASCAR country,” Sims said. “Growing up, you know the Jimmies and the Dale Seniors and the Tony Stewarts and everybody but it wasn’t something I followed week in and week out.”His interest in NASCAR picked up in 2015 when he moved to Charlotte and hosted a pre-race show on the local Fox affiliate.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814525,"N. Carolina congressman, briefly senator Broyhill dies at 95","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Jim Broyhill, a longtime North Carolina Republican congressman who served briefly in the U.S. Senate to fill a vacancy before losing a bid to keep the job, died early Saturday at age 95, his family said. 

            Broyhill, a scion of the Broyhill Furniture business in the North Carolina foothills that brought jobs and prestige to the region, died at Arbor Acres retirement home in Winston-Salem, according to his son, Ed. He had suffered from congestive heart failure for years that worsened in recent months, his son said Saturday.

            The moderate Republican served more than 23 years in the House. He was considered a reliable conservative who helped North Carolina turn into a competitive two-party state, particularly as the GOP made national gains in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. 











            In a video interview in honor of receiving a state award in 2015, Broyhill recalled the dearth of Republicans on the first state ballot he filled out in 1948.

            “I was determined that I’m going to do what I could to see if we could not develop a two-party system in our state,” Broyhill said. “And I think I had a great deal to accomplish that, but with the help and the leadership of many other people.”

            GOP Gov. Jim Martin appointed Broyhill to replace Republican Sen. John East when East died by suicide in June 1986. 

            Broyhill had already won the Senate GOP primary a month earlier against David Funderburk, who had the support of Sen. Jesse Helms’ national organization that backed hardline Republicans. East wasn’t seeking reelection due to medical issues. 

            The Senate appointment was viewed as an asset to help Broyhill in his fall general election against former Gov. Terry Sanford, a Democrat and outgoing Duke University president. Sanford narrowly defeated Broyhill in two elections that November -- one to serve out the rest of 1986 and another for the next six years. 

            Expected initially to be a low-key affair, the campaign took on the intensity of a modern, more divisive campaign. Reagan came to Charlotte to campaign for Broyhill. In a recent interview, Martin said he’s unsure whether appointing Broyhill to the Senate ultimately aided his campaign. 

            “He wasn’t able to spend as much time campaigning because he was intensely dependable on fulfilling his Senate duties,” Martin said. 

            Broyhill's Capitol Hill career began with a surprising U.S. House victory in 1962. 

            When Democrats attempted to redraw the district of the lone Republican in the House delegation after the 1960 census in hopes of defeating him, the adjoining district became more Republican, according to a biography of Martin. That opened the door for Broyhill, who had worked at the family business for close to two decades, to upset Democratic incumbent Hugh Quincy Alexander. 

            While he never served in a Republican-controlled chamber until his Senate appointment, Broyhill flexed his political muscles for Republican presidential administrations in the House and built support for their agendas with Democrats.

            In the interview highlighting his 2015 award, Broyhill recalled legislation he helped pass to create the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Broyhill's family and others cited his efforts to create energy policies, and deregulate the telecommunications, pharmaceutical and trucking industries. 

            Frank Drendel, founder of coaxial cable producer CommScope based in Hickory, said on Saturday that Broyhill's work to get a law passed in 1978 so that cable companies could connect their cables to other utility poles helped the cable industry soar. 

            Broyhill “set an example that sadly we don’t have much of today and that is to cross the aisle and come up with solutions that are nonpartisan,"" said former Glaxo Wellcome CEO Bob Ingram, a North Carolina resident who knew Broyhill while working in Washington. “He wanted to get to the best answer to solve problems.” 

            After his 1986 defeat, Broyhill served on North Carolina’s Economic Development Board. Martin later picked him to serve in his second-term Cabinet as commerce secretary, saying he had “impeccable connections with North Carolina industry.” 

            A native of Lenoir, James Thomas Broyhill graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1950, according to his official congressional biography. His father, J.E. Broyhill, began the family’s furniture dynasty in 1926 as the Lenoir Chair Company and was a well-known Republican in his own right.

            ""Jim added to that and made his contribution in a huge way as a member of Congress,"" Martin said. “That family tradition has given an enormous boost to the Republican Party.” Ed Broyhill is now a Republican National Committee member.

            Recently retired Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who was recruited by Broyhill to run for Congress more than 30 years ago, said he would be remembered as “a gentlemen and a statesman,” and called him a “mentor and confidant.”

            “I always knew I could trust his advice and counsel because he viewed everything through the lens of what’s best for the country,"" Burr said. 

            Current Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper praised Broyhill on Saturday in a tweet for his commitment and service to the state.

            The congressman was preceded in death by his son, Philip. In addition to Ed Broyhill, other survivors of Broyhill include his wife of 71 years, Louise R. Broyhill; his daughter, Marilyn Broyhill Beach of Winston-Salem; six grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

            Broyhill's funeral will be Feb. 28 at Centenary United Methodist Church in Winston-Salem, with a graveside service later that day in Wilkes County.RALEIGH, N.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814527,Bird flu costs pile up as outbreak enters second year,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.

            In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.

            The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.











            Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.

            The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.

            “The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry’s history,” National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.

            In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm — which can number in the millions — must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa — the nation's biggest egg producer — leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.

            In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.

            That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn’t have any birds on their farms.

            This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.

            
                Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what’s driving prices so high.

            The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That’s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.

            The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.

            The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.

            The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.

            Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.

            “We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.

            Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.

            “America’s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,” said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.

            Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.

            “That’s really the key – early detection. It’s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,” National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.

            Officials say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.

            There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.“The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry’s history,” National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm — which can number in the millions — must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa — the nation's biggest egg producer — leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn’t have any birds on their farms.This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what’s driving prices so high.The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That’s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.“We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.“America’s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814532,Texas death row inmate who cut out his eyes seeks clemency,"HOUSTON (AP) — Plagued by mental illness, Texas death row inmate Andre Thomas started hearing voices when he was 9 years old and first attempted suicide when he was 10, his attorneys say. 

            Thomas’ psychosis, filled with religious delusions and hallucinations, became worse as he grew older. His family — beset by a long history of mental illness, addiction and poverty — was unable to help.

            His lawyers say in March 2004, when he was 21, Thomas’ mental illness erupted in a burst of horrific violence in his hometown of Sherman, Texas. He fatally stabbed his estranged wife Laura Christine Boren, 20, their 4-year-old son Andre Lee and her 13-month-old daughter Leyha Marie Hughes, cutting out the hearts of the two children. He later told police God had instructed him to commit the killings and that he believed all three were demons.











            Thomas was sentenced to death for killing the little girl after jurors rejected his insanity defense. Prosecutors argued that he knew his conduct was wrong and exacerbated his mental condition with drug use. He has spent the last 15 years at a unit south of Houston for the state’s most mentally ill prisoners. The heavily medicated Thomas, now 39, is also blind. Twice since the killings, he has gouged out his eyes, eating one of them to ensure that the government could not hear his thoughts, his attorneys said.

            Thomas’ attorneys say he will never be competent for his April 5 execution. They, along with over 100 faith leaders and dozens of mental health professionals on Wednesday asked Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute his sentence to life in prison or to grant a reprieve so the courts can determine his competency for execution.

            “Gov. Abbott has the power to stop the spectacle of prison guards leading a blind, mentally incompetent, delusional man to the death chamber,” said attorney Maurie Levin.

            But authorities say Thomas’ victims and their families should not be forgotten in this debate and that if Thomas is determined competent, his execution should go forward. The killings of Boren and her children shocked Sherman, a city of about 45,000 residents 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Dallas.

            “A jury has spoken about what justice should be in this case. We are not going to ignore that,” said J. Kerye Ashmore, with the Grayson County District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted the case.

            A spokeswoman for Abbott did not respond to an email sent Friday seeking comment. Abbott has granted clemency to only one death row inmate since taking office in 2015.

            The Supreme Court has prohibited the death penalty for the intellectually disabled, but not for people with serious mental illness. However, it has ruled that a person must be competent to be executed.

            Thomas’ attorneys will have to file a court motion asking that his competency be reviewed. A judge would ultimately decide the issue.

            His attorneys say prison records show that as recently as December, Thomas “still hallucinate(s) constantly,” including “voices ‘from a spiritual prison’ and seeking ‘angels.’”

            “He is one of the most mentally ill prisoners in Texas history,” Levin said.

            Thomas’ attorneys have said his trial was also problematic because jurors who said they opposed interracial marriage were allowed to serve. Thomas is Black and his estranged wife was white. The U.S. Supreme Court last year declined to hear an appeal on this issue.

            Ashmore said the standard to determine if someone is competent to be executed is not “whether he is mentally ill or has hallucinations” but figuring out if an inmate understands why he is being put to death or that his execution is imminent.

            Joe Brown, the former Grayson County district attorney who led the prosecution, said this has been a difficult case for everyone involved.

            “For many people I hear from, it does not matter whether he understands that he is being punished or not. They believe a crime with those facts demands death. To others ... the death penalty is never justified. Our legal system does the best it can in that difficult situation,” said Brown, who is now in private practice in Sherman.

            The Texas Legislature is set to debate a bill that would make people with severe mental illness ineligible for the death penalty. Similar bills failed to become law in 2019 and 2021.

            
                Kentucky and Ohio have approved such measures in recent years.

            “It would be very troubling to execute Mr. Thomas at the exact time that the (Texas) House is once again considering exempting people like him from being executed, said Greg Hansch, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Texas. If such a bill became Texas law, it wouldn’t be retroactive.

            Rev. Jaime Kowlessar, a pastor from Dallas who is among the more than 100 faith leaders asking to stop the execution, said putting Thomas to death would serve no legitimate purpose.

            “We pray that Gov. Abbott will choose the path of healing and grace by sparing Mr. Thomas’ life,” Kowlessar said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814544,"From a secret safehouse, Peru's Indigenous revolt advances","LIMA, Peru (AP) — In an industrial corridor of Peru's capital, a dingy stairwell leads to a second-floor safehouse. Dozens of Quechua and Aymara activists lie on mattresses strewn on the floor, resting up for more anti-government demonstrations as volunteers cook a breakfast of donated rice, pasta and vegetables.

            Among the makeshift refuge's occupants is Marcelo Fonseca. The 46-year-old watched as a a friend was shot and killed in December as they battled security forces in the southern city of Juliaca. Within hours, Fonseca joined a caravan of demonstrators that descended on the capital, Lima, to demand the resignation of interim President Dina Boluarte.

            “Our Andean blood burns when we become furious,” Fonseca, whose native language is Quechua, said in a halting Spanish. ”It runs faster. That’s what brings us here.”











            Two months into Peru’s angry insurrection, emotions have hardened. While the unrest has barely disturbed the late-night revelry in Lima's beachside enclaves, roadblocks still rage across the countryside, scaring away foreign tourists and leading to shortages of gas and other staples. 

            The tumult, which has left at least 60 dead, was triggered by the impeachment in December of President Pedro Castillo. To Peruvians like Fonseca, the leftist rural teacher was a symbol of their own exclusion, while Boluarte's ascension to power from the vice presidency in cahoots with Castillo's conservative enemies in Congress is seen as an unforgivable class betrayal. 

            The impasse has given a jolt of self-confidence to Peru's Indigenous movement. Unlike neighboring Bolivia, where Indigenous groups were emboldened by Aymara coca-grower Evo Morales' election as president in 2006, or Ecuador, where ethnic groups have a long tradition of toppling unpopular governments, Peru's Indigenous groups had long struggled to gain political influence.

            Although Peruvians of all backgrounds take pride in the history of the Inca Empire, the country's Indigenous population is often treated with neglect and even hostility. Little is done to promote Quechua, despite its being spoken by millions and being an official language since 1975. Not until the 2017 census were Peruvians even asked whether they identify with any one of 50-plus Indigenous groups. 

            Tarcila Rivera, a prominent Quechua activist and former adviser to the United Nations on Indigenous issues, attributes the disdain to systemic racism stretching back to the Spanish conquest.

            “Despite the two hundred years since the founding of our republic, the reality is that those of us who come from pre-Hispanic civilizations haven't obtained our rights, nor are those rights taken into account,” said Rivera.

            The current turmoil has also unleashed a torrent of racism. One lawmaker from the floor of Congress disparaged the rainbow-colored Wiphala flag, which represents the native people of the Andes, as little more than a “chifa tablecloth,” using the word for a cheap Chinese restaurant. Another urged security forces to send protesters to Bolivia with a big “kick.” 

            Rivera says the crackdown has radicalized younger protesters. Meanwhile, the spread of smartphones and the Internet during the past few decades of economic stability has made Indigenous Peruvians more aware of their rights, the country's gaping inequalities and the sacrifices of previously unheralded Indigenous heroes, whose achievements contrast with narratives of perennial victimhood.

            “All our kids are ever been taught is that we're losers, miserable souls who were conquered without a fight,"" Rivera said.

            The current protest movement is centered in the southern Andes, where Indigenous identity is strongest. The area is the source of much of Peru's mineral wealth and is home to archeological jewels that attracted more than 4 million tourists a year before COVID. 

            Its peasants are also among Peru's most neglected. 

            Those inequalities were on vivid display this month at a roadblock near Cusco, where a group of campesinos sat vigil for hours over a roadblock of tires, tree trunks and boulders. As the line of stranded vehicles grew, tensions flared as motorists complaining that they had family emergencies.

            “Don't yell at me when I'm speaking to you with manners!” barked one motorist who faulted the protestors for voting for Castillo, who lived in an adobe home in one of Peru's poorest districts before winning the presidency. “Don't let shameless politicians, who are often from the same community, trick you,"" he said repeating a false narrative held by elites that Castillo's victory was the result of bribes, fraud and chicanery. 

            Eventually, the demonstrators yielded to the pressure and briefly opened the road, after a harangue against the “millionaires"" and powerful interests blamed for driving their community to desperate actions.

            Back in Lima, the safehouse is a hive of activity as another day of demonstrating awaits. Hand-written signs list daily chores to keep the cramped quarters safe and clean. Dozens more activists from Cusco are expected soon and need to be lodged in one of the few dozen homes, apartments and businesses across the capital that have opened their doors, like clandestine rebel bases. 

            Discretion is a must. Like Fonseca, many of the demonstrators were already detained when security forces firing tear gas last month stormed a university campus at breakfast and arrested hundreds for trespassing. As a result, occupants are encouraged to leave the safehouse one or two at a time, turn off lights early and immediately report any police intrusion to two human-rights attorneys on permanent standby. The windows are covered with newspapers and dog-food bags to block out would-be snoops.

            But more than fear, the mood is one of hope. 

            “No matter what happens, I dare say we've already won,” said Victor Quinones as he stuffs a wad of coca leaves into his cheek.

            At 60, Quinones is one of the group's veterans. He says the past few weeks in the capital have strengthened his resolve to push forward and no longer accept the status quo — or futile standoffs with police back home as the best way to change it.

            “We broke the barrier. We've started our long march — and look at all this support we've garnered along the way,"" he reflects. ""We've won because, now, the world knows.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814548,NASCAR makes key developments in push for greater diversity,"NASCAR says it has made progress on diversity, an effort that started before the industry banned the Confederate flag in 2020 but has only grown since in all aspects from team ownership to grassroots racing efforts. Minorities may not necessarily become the dominant demographic for the stock car series, but they can certainly grab a larger share of the marketplace. A few key developments underway for NASCAR as it celebrates its 75th anniversary:

            — The NASCAR Drive for Diversity Pit Crew Development Program has grown substantially since 2004. There are more than 100 graduates now working in NASCAR and more than 25 at the top Cup Series level. The program has a 100% placement rate and drives approximately $2 million in salary.

            — The NASCAR Diversity Internship Program was launched in 2000 and since then more than 500 college students have participated in the industry’s longest-running diversity initiative.











            
                — Nick Sanchez, who participated in the NASCAR Drive for Diversity Development Program in 2022 and won the ARCA Menards Series Championship with Rev Racing last year, is advancing to the Truck Series. Sanchez will drive the No. 2 Gainbridge Chevrolet for Rev Racing with its technical alliance partner, Kyle Busch Motorsports. He won the pole for the Truck Series race at Daytona this weekend. 

            
                — Rajah Caruth also graduated from the NASCAR Drive for Diversity Development Program and will be competing full time in the Truck Series, driving the No. 24 for GMS Racing. Caruth is a prominent iRacer who made his transition to the racetrack in 2019.

            
                — Hailie Deegan and Natalie Decker also participated in the NASCAR Drive for Diversity Development Program. Both drivers currently compete in national series.

            The crash happened at about 8:30 p.m. Friday in the Far Rockaway section of Queens.

            Officials said the police SUV had its emergency lights on and was about to pass a car on the left when the car turned in front of the cruiser. The cruiser hit the car. The force of the collision sent the cruiser toward a sidewalk, where it hit a pedestrian who was standing in a bike lane just off the corner, police said. The cruiser then hit an unoccupied car.











            The woman, whose name was withheld pending family notification, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Four officers in the SUV were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, police said. The driver of the car that turned in front of the cruiser was not hurt.

            Police said the cruiser was responding to an emergency call by another officer who requested help.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814565,Bulgaria detains 7 over deaths of 18 migrants found in truck,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Authorities in Bulgaria have detained seven people in connection with an abandoned truck in which 18 people believed to be migrants were found dead, police said Saturday. 

            The bodies were discovered Friday in a secret compartment below a load of lumber in the truck, which was left on a highway not far from Bulgaria's capital, Sofia. 

            Borislav Sarafov, director of Bulgaria's National Investigation Service, confirmed that all the victims had died of suffocation. He called the case the country's deadliest involving smuggled migrants. 











            Police also found 34 survivors in the truck, most of them in very poor physical condition, Bulgarian Health Minister Assen Medzhidiev said.

            All the passengers originally were from Afghanistan and had entered Bulgaria from Turkey while hoping to reach Western Europe, authorities said. 

            Sarafov said the people who died had perished 10 to 12 hours before the truck was found and that the smugglers had fled the scene after they noticed the deaths. 

            The seven suspects were detained at different locations across Bulgaria. Investigators were working to determine if the truck's driver was among them. 

            The investigation indicates the suspects belonged to a organized crime ring involved in smuggling migrants from the border with Turkey to the Bulgaria-Serbia border, Sarafov said. Passengers paid 5,000-7,000 euros each, he said. 

            Bulgaria, a Balkan country of 7 million and the poorest member of the European Union, is located on a major route for migrants from the Middle East and Afghanistan seeking to enter Europe from Turkey. Very few plan to stay, with most using Bulgaria as a transit corridor on their way westward.

            Bulgaria has erected a barbed-wire fence along its 259-kilometer (161-mile) border with Turkey, but with the help of local traffickers many migrants still manage to enter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814568,"Trial ordered in shooting that killed 1 officer, wounded 2nd","PITTSBURGH (AP) — A man has been ordered to stand trial in the shooting death of one police officer and the wounding of another in western Pennsylvania earlier this month.

            Johnathan Jermia Morris, 31, of McKeesport is charged in Allegheny County with criminal homicide, attempted homicide and assault of a law enforcement officer and firearms crimes in the Feb. 6 shootings in McKeesport, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of Pittsburgh.

            Authorities have said that officers were called to a home over a dispute involving a man who police said was having a “mental health crisis.” Police allege they caught up with him after he walked away, and he “suddenly produced a handgun"" and shot them. Officer Sean Sluganski, 32, was killed and another officer was wounded.











            Authorities said Morris, wounded in the leg by return fire, ran to a parking lot and told two people he had been shot and needed help. Authorities say a witness putting a tourniquet on his leg reported seeing Morris pull a handgun and point it at an approaching officer, and an exchange of gunfire wounded the suspect.

            Detective Patrick Kinavey testified Friday during a preliminary hearing that Morris told him three days after the shooting that he didn’t remember shooting at Sluganski and only opened fire after racking his gun wasn’t enough to scare the officers off.

            Kinavey said Morris alleged that police tried twice to hit him with a car, and he racked his gun to try to scare them off, and when that didn't work he fired twice into the vehicle. After being wounded, he said he feared a third officer who was approaching was “out for blood” and fired after the officer reached for his gun, Kinavey said.

            The detective said he told Morris that there were more than two spent shell casings at the scene, and Morris said he didn't remember firing at Sluganski but must have if there was evidence of that. 

            Morris said he has post-traumatic stress disorder but it is “well managed” through meditation and showering “to wash the PTSD” away. He said he was “having a good day” and wasn't having any episodes that day, the detective said.

            Defense attorney Art Ettinger questioned whether his client was on pain medication during the interview and whether any statements weren’t recorded, and he also sought the names of the people who recorded the events.

            A formal arraignment in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court is scheduled for March 21, by which time prosecutors must decide whether they plan to seek the death penalty in the event that the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder.PITTSBURGH (AP) — A man has been ordered to stand trial in the shooting death of one police officer and the wounding of another in western Pennsylvania earlier this month.Johnathan Jermia Morris, 31, of McKeesport is charged in Allegheny County with criminal homicide, attempted homicide and assault of a law enforcement officer and firearms crimes in the Feb. 6 shootings in McKeesport, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of Pittsburgh.Authorities have said that officers were called to a home over a dispute involving a man who police said was having a “mental health crisis.” Police allege they caught up with him after he walked away, and he “suddenly produced a handgun"" and shot them.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814569,UK PM splashes cold water on prospects of quick trade deal,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday sought to dampen optimism about an imminent settlement in the dispute over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland that has brought political turmoil to the region and clouded relations with the European Union.

            A recent flurry of meetings and diplomatic activity, including his own late-night dash to Belfast on Thursday night, has yet to yield an agreement, Sunak said during a question-and-answer session following his speech at a security conference in Munich. 

            British media outlets have speculated that the outlines of a settlement could be announced as soon as Monday.











            “No, there isn’t a deal that has been done,” Sunak said. “There is an understanding of what needs to be done.’’

            The so-called Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs trade between the region and the Republic of Ireland, has been one of the most vexing issues facing the EU and Britain since the U.K. left the bloc more than two years ago.

            Sunak met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during Saturday’s Munich Security Conference as British and EU officials try to capitalize on a recent thaw in relations to resolve their differences.

            Sunak’s office said the two leaders agreed that recent cooperation in the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should be extended to all aspects of the relationship between Britain and the EU.

            “They also had a positive discussion about the talks on the Ireland-Northern Ireland Protocol,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. “They agreed that there had been very good progress to find solutions. Intensive work in the coming days is still needed at official and ministerial levels.”

            The protocol was an effort to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland by preserving the free flow of trade between it and the Republic of Ireland, which share the only land border between the United Kingdom and the EU.

            But Northern Ireland’s biggest unionist party, which wants to remain part of the United Kingdom, opposes the protocol because it says the current arrangement weakens the region’s links to Britain.

            The Democratic Unionist Party forced the collapse of the region’s power-sharing government almost a year ago, saying it wouldn’t return until the protocol was renegotiated. 

            The 1998 agreement that ended three decades of violence in Northern Ireland requires unionists and nationalists, who favor eventual reunification with the Republic of Ireland, to share power in the regional government.

            Sunak acknowledged that the protocol created “very real challenges for families, for people, for businesses on the ground,’’ including concerns about whether the desires of local residents have been respected.

            “We’re working through those (issues) hard and we will work through them intensely with the EU, but we are by no means done,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814570,Germany’s women looking to World Cup with optimism,"The disappointment of the Euro 2022 final defeat by England has long since given way to optimism. ""We have very good conditions here in Marbella to get even better. To improve on the small details in order to win titles,"" says captain Alexandra Popp.It is an expression of confidence and building hype around the team. The German forward is currently preparing for the upcoming matches with the national team in the first training retreat of the year, in the winter warmth of the south of Spain.The buzz can also be measured in numbers. More than 17,000 tickets have been sold for the international friendly in Duisburg against Sweden on February 21. A sell-out would be a quantum leap in German women's soccer. After years of debates about too early kick-off times and a lack of TV presence, a new development is emerging.Alexandra Popp has long felt the effects: ""It's actually a little crazy. Two years ago, I could still walk around in big cities with peace of mind. Today, I can't do that anymore. But I see it very positively, as recognition and appreciation that people have seen us."" The national team wants to build on this hype in Germany and let it grow even further at the next major event: the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July this year.The Women's Champions League has been expanded and the density of dates in the calendar has increased. But no one on the German team is complaining about that. Instead, the upcoming tasks are more of an incentive for those involved to continue growing the importance of women's soccer. The spectators also perceived the team as a real team at the European Championship. ""We want to continue to build on this flow and hype. And now we want to do better next time,"" says Popp.Goalkeeper Merle Frohms agrees. ""We were in the European Championship final and were already close to the title. Each of us were disappointed that it wasn't enough. All the more motivated we are now to go home with the title at the end of the tournament."" Accordingly, the players have no doubts about their own performance.According to the DFB (German soccer federation), the number of active women in the game has increased by 25% since 2021. The association is now hoping that there will be further positive effects after the Women's World Cup. The DFB wants to host the next World Cup in 2027 together with Belgium and the Netherlands.In the women's Bundesliga, however, strides still need to be made. Despite new attendance records, such as the season-opening match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayern Munich attracting 23,200 spectators, attendance in the league is rather moderate. On the first nine match days, the number of spectators increased to a total of 173,438 (up 17% on the same period last season) due to the top matches. But for games such as Eintracht Frankfurt against Werder Bremen, only around 2,000 spectators are in attendance. SV Meppen vs. Hoffenheim attracted just 654 paying visitors.Compared with the men's Bundesliga (3,392,774 fans), the women lag well behind. The average attendance of 41,886 spectators per game (men's Bundesliga) is more than 13 times higher than the women's figure (3,211 per game). Nevertheless, the trend is clearly pointing upward.The women's national team, at least, has seen a significant increase in popularity. ""It's just nice to see this development, that viewers follow women's soccer, that they see it as authentic and honest. That's a very nice compliment,"" said Frohms.The DFB's strategy is long-term and is intended to culminate in the fairy tale of the 2027 World Cup on home soil - but the first task is a successful World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this summer.This article was translated from German.",2023/02/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814577,Bayern loses at Gladbach 3-2 in another Bundesliga setback,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich's rocky start to 2023 continues.

            Borussia Mönchengladbach defeated 10-man Bayern 3-2 to add more intrigue in the Bundesliga title race on Saturday.

            Marcus Thuram scored late to seal the win after goals from Lars Stindl and Jonas Hofmann stretched Bayern’s winless run against Gladbach to five games across all competitions. Gladbach defeated the Bavarian powerhouse 5-0 in the German Cup last season.











            It was the fourth time in six league games this year that defending champion Bayern has dropped points and it means Union Berlin can take over the lead on Sunday by beating last-placed Schalke. Borussia Dortmund can move level on points with Bayern by beating visiting Hertha Berlin.

            Julian Nagelsmann, who has never experienced a win over Gladbach since becoming Bayern coach, was furious that Dayot Upamecano was sent off in the eight minute. The French defender was shown a red card for bringing down Alassane Plea, who was through on goal. TV replays showed only minimal contact but it was enough for the match officials.

            “Referees also make mistakes, it's not a problem,” said Nagelsmann, who confronted ref Tobias Welz after the game. “But just say it's not a red card. Everyone can live with that. It's simply not a red.”

            The Bayern coach later apologized for his “choice of words” to Welz and his team. 

            “I went too far there, unfortunately,” Nagelsmann said. 

            Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting equalized in the 35th after a great run down the left from Alphonso Davies.

            Substitute Mathys Tel added another in injury time for Bayern, also set up by Davies.

            Bayern goalkeeper Yann Sommer was honored before the game for his 8 1/2 years of service to Gladbach. The Swiss goalie played a big role in ensuring Bayern was frustrated in its previous games against Gladbach before his switch between the teams last month.

            Sommer saved Stindl’s effort from the free kick after Upamecano was sent off, but couldn’t stop the Gladbach captain opening the scoring in the 13th. Hofmann played in a free kick from the right and Stindl met it with a low shot inside the right post.

            Nagelsmann reacted to Upamecano’s sending off by sending on João Cancelo for team captain Thomas Müller, who had been making his 429th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern, tying goalkeeper Oliver Kahn’s record for the club. Only Sepp Maier, with 473, has more.

            Bayern showed great morale after Choupo-Moting equalized but Hofmann scored in the 55th after playing a one-two with Plea. Nagelsmann was irate as the chance came from a Bayern mistake.

            Ramy Bensebaini struck the crossbar two minutes later for Gladbach, which sealed the win through Thuram, who was set up by Hofmann in the 84th.

            “It's a setback, but we have to swallow it,” Sommer said. 

            Bayern next faces Union Berlin in Munich on Feb. 26. 

            KOLO MUANI'S TIMELY RETURN

            After a rare match without a goal against Cologne last weekend, Randal Kolo Muani scored again for Eintracht Frankfurt to beat Werder Bremen 2-0.

            The France forward sealed the win in the 52nd minute, set up by Ansgar Knauff after Jiří Pavlenka saved his first effort. It was Kolo Muani's eighth goal in seven games across all competitions this year. 

            Frankfurt hosts Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday. 

            Also, Leipzig defeated Wolfsburg 3-0 away. Christopher Nkunku came on as a substitute to return from injury for Leipzig.

            Stuttgart defeated Cologne 3-0 to climb out of the relegation zone at the expense of Bochum, which lost at home to Freiburg 2-0.

It's simply not a red.”The Bayern coach later apologized for his “choice of words” to Welz and his team.“I went too far there, unfortunately,” Nagelsmann said.Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting equalized in the 35th after a great run down the left from Alphonso Davies.Substitute Mathys Tel added another in injury time for Bayern, also set up by Davies.Bayern goalkeeper Yann Sommer was honored before the game for his 8 1/2 years of service to Gladbach. The Swiss goalie played a big role in ensuring Bayern was frustrated in its previous games against Gladbach before his switch between the teams last month.Sommer saved Stindl’s effort from the free kick after Upamecano was sent off, but couldn’t stop the Gladbach captain opening the scoring in the 13th. Hofmann played in a free kick from the right and Stindl met it with a low shot inside the right post.Nagelsmann reacted to Upamecano’s sending off by sending on João Cancelo for team captain Thomas Müller, who had been making his 429th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern, tying goalkeeper Oliver Kahn’s record for the club. Only Sepp Maier, with 473, has more.Bayern showed great morale after Choupo-Moting equalized but Hofmann scored in the 55th after playing a one-two with Plea. Nagelsmann was irate as the chance came from a Bayern mistake.Ramy Bensebaini struck the crossbar two minutes later for Gladbach, which sealed the win through Thuram, who was set up by Hofmann in the 84th.“It's a setback, but we have to swallow it,” Sommer said.Bayern next faces Union Berlin in Munich on Feb. 26.KOLO MUANI'S TIMELY RETURNAfter a rare match without a goal against Cologne last weekend, Randal Kolo Muani scored again for Eintracht Frankfurt to beat Werder Bremen 2-0.The France forward sealed the win in the 52nd minute, set up by Ansgar Knauff after Jiří Pavlenka saved his first effort. It was Kolo Muani's eighth goal in seven games across all competitions this year.Frankfurt hosts Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday.Also, Leipzig defeated Wolfsburg 3-0 away. Christopher Nkunku came on as a substitute to return from injury for Leipzig.Stuttgart defeated Cologne 3-0 to climb out of the relegation zone at the expense of Bochum, which lost at home to Freiburg 2-0.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World

            A foreign search team from Kyrgyzstan rescued Samir Muhammed Accar, 49, his wife, Ragda, 40, and their 12-year-old son while digging through the rubble of the apartment building in the southern Turkish city of Antakya, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814579,Funerals held for victims of Michigan State campus attack,"GROSSE POINTE FARMS, Mich. (AP) — The first funerals were held Saturday for students who were killed in this week's mass shooting at Michigan State University.

            Mourners in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Farms filed into St. Paul on the Lake Catholic Church to remember 20-year-old sophomore Brian Fraser, who was one of three students killed in Monday's attack.

            “He’s one of those charismatic, smiling, humorous, good-natured young men that is hard not to like,"" Father Jim Bilot said during Fraser's service. “So this was a great gift he had, and he used that gift for the glory and honor of God because he honored the gift that had been given to him. He was very athletic, very competitive. I heard he wasn’t always that great in his sports, but certainly loved being part of the team.”











            At the same time, a funeral was held for 20-year-old junior Alexandria Verner at the Guardian Angels Catholic Church in Clawson, a suburb a few miles (kilometers) to the northwest. 

            During that service, Verner's family placed a small wooden cross with her name on it on the church's remembrance wall.

            “Al had lot of love. We have lots of love for her,” said Father Tony Richter, Guardian Angels Catholic Church pastor. “You learn love from a family. She saw something greater in mankind.”

            They were among eight students who were shot in the attack at two buildings on the Michigan State campus in East Lansing, including five who were wounded but survived. A memorial service was scheduled for later Saturday for the third student killed, Arielle Anderson, The Detroit News reported. Her funeral is set for next week.

            Four of the wounded students remained in critical condition Friday at a Lansing hospital. The fifth victim remained hospitalized in stable condition.

            Police say Anthony McRae, a 43-year-old man with no connection to the school, walked into Berkey Hall where evening classes were being held and opened fire in a classroom. He then walked to the nearby MSU Student Union and fired more shots before fleeing.

            After the attack, he walked a few miles (kilometers) toward his Lansing home. He said nothing before he killed himself after being confronted by police, authorities said.

            Detectives found two handguns, ammunition and a note containing a possible motive for the attack. Police said it appeared from the note that McRae felt he had been slighted in some way by people or businesses, adding that he had no connection to the victims or the school and had worked at a grocery chain warehouse.

            “This week, a lot of us didn’t have a whole lot of hope,"" Richter said during Verner's funeral. “It was not easy, and we even had doubt.”

            “We also have to come together in faith,” he added. “We have to rely on it when we don’t know what to do or what the answers are. We also knew that Al had faith. Al had faith because she did things for others.""

            Verner was a 2020 graduate of Clawson High School. She was studying integrated biology and anthropology, according to her LinkedIn profile.

            Fraser previously attended Grosse Pointe South High School. He was president of Michigan State’s chapter of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

            At Fraser's funeral, Bilot told fraternity members and others not to allow evil to make them ""fearful.”

            “To the community of Michigan State University, my heart just goes out to so many that are affected by this,” he said. “But to the students, to the frat brothers, please go back. Go back with determination. Go back with the confidence of the spirit of his love, of God’s love.”

            Anderson graduated from Grosse Pointe North High School. Her family said in a statement that she was pushing to graduate early from Michigan State, hoping to become a surgeon as quickly as possible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814581,"AP sources: Love, Cavaliers finalize buyout as he eyes Miami","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Kevin Love was the last link to Cleveland's memorable 2016 championship. He'll chase another title elsewhere.

            The five-time All-Star and the Cavs completed a buyout of his contract Saturday, freeing the forward to sign with another team. Love is strongly considering a move to the Miami Heat, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

            The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Love, who was with Cleveland since 2014, must still clear waivers before he can sign with a new team. 











            Love's departure ends his tenure with the Cavs that came during the team's most successful run.

            “Kevin represented the organization and the city of Cleveland with the utmost charm and professionalism during his nine seasons in Northeast Ohio,"" Cavs president of basketball of operations Koby Altman said. “He also embodied everything a franchise would want in a player, and the admiration and gratitude we have for him will ultimately land his jersey in the rafters of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

            ""We thank Kevin for his impact and wish him nothing but the best, knowing that he has solidified his place in the hearts of Cavaliers fans and this organization forever.""

            Other teams are expected to bid for Love, who is making $31.3 million this season, before he finalizes a decision, one of the people told the AP.

            “Hopefully he decides to bring his shooting down to 305 so we can end the season on a very high note,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said, referencing the Miami area code.

            Unhappy that he had been dropped from the Cavs' rotation this season, the 34-year-old formally requested a buyout earlier this week. Love sat out Cleveland's past 12 games before the All-Star break and there was little indication his playing time would increase anytime soon.

            Love believes he can still play at a high level, and his postseason experience makes him attractive to any contenders.

            “He knows how to win,"" Miami center Bam Adebayo said. “He's been in those battles.""

            Love's time Cavs had its ups and downs, but he'll be remembered for his role in helping Cleveland overcome a 3-1 deficit to stun the Golden State Warriors in the Finals seven years ago to end the city's 52-year title drought.

            Love figured to have a prominent role this season for the Cavs, but he was slowed by a thumb injury that affected his shot. He's averaging career-lows of 8.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 20 minutes per game.

            The Cavs' recent acquisition of forward and sharpshooter Danny Green pushed Love even further down Cleveland's bench.

            But over parts of 15 NBA seasons with Cleveland and Minnesota, Love has averaged 17.2 points and 10.5 rebounds. He's also a 37% career shooter from 3-point range, and helped USA Basketball win both Olympic and FIBA World Cup gold medals.

            Miami created the flexibility to absorb at least one player in a buyout situation by trading away Dewayne Dedmon to San Antonio earlier this month in exchange for cash considerations. That essentially opened a roster spot for at least one move.

            Cleveland, which entered the break fourth in the Eastern Conference at 38-23, may not want to see Love end up with the Heat, a potential playoff opponent. Miami is seventh in the East at 32-27, a half-game behind No. 6 New York.

            Love joined the Cavs after six seasons with the Timberwolves, who traded him to the Cavs for No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins.

            Accustomed to being the only star in Minnesota, Love struggled to fit in with the Cavs while playing alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. However, over time he began to blend in as Cleveland won four consecutive conference titles after James returned as a free agent.

            When James left again, the Cavs locked Love up by signing him to a four-year, $120 million extension that didn't sit well with some Cleveland fans. Love battled injuries while the Cavs won just 60 games over a three-year span.

            However, his willingness to accept a reserve role was key in the team's turnaround last season, when the Cavs went 44-38 and made the play-in tournament. Also, Love's public openness about his struggles with mental health issues enhanced his popularity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814583,Police: 9 children shot at Georgia gas station,"COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) — Nine youths - including a 5-year-old child - were wounded after shots rang out at a gas station in a Georgia city bordering Alabama, authorities said Saturday.

            Officers from the Columbus Police Department responded about 10 p.m. Friday and found multiple gunshot victims amid a large group of people.

            Police Chief Freddie Blackmon said at a news conference Saturday that an altercation apparently took place at a party nearby and it spilled over to the gas station when the shooting began. Further details were not provided, but Blackmon said the incident remained under investigation.











            “I am committed to assuring you that we will find the person or persons responsible for this senseless crime,” he said.

            Blackmon said detectives have spoken with witnesses, some of whom are cooperating - while others are not. 

            “I encourage anyone with information to contact police. I encourage parents whose child was injured in this incident to make sure that any information they share with them is shared with police. We will work around the clock to resolve this case,” he said. 

            The victims, whose names were not released, ranged in age from 5 to 17. Seven males and two females were hurt, police said. As of Saturday afternoon, at least four had been discharged from hospitals where they were treated, Blackmon said.

            Authorities said none of the injuries appeared life-threatening.

            Blackmon urged parents in the community to “know where your children are and what they have in their possession.”

            “We must work toward helping communicate to our children how to peacefully resolve conflict without resorting to gun violence,"" he said. 

            “I'm so grateful to God that we didn't have anyone lose their life,” Mayor B.H. “Skip” Henderson III said. “I'm tired of seeing folks having a disagreement or argument or maybe even a fistfight who then think they have to reach for a gun. That's just got to stop. We've got to find a way in the community to reclaim our young people.”

            No arrests have been made, and Blackmon did not indicate whether detectives have pinpointed any suspects.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814584,Matthew Hoppe scores 1st senior club goal in 21 months,"American forward Matthew Hoppe scored his first senior club goal in 21 months, helping Hibernian beat visiting Kilmarnock 2-0 Saturday in the Scottish Premier League.

            The 21-year-old from Yorba Linda, California, gave fourth-place Hibs a two-goal lead in the 47th minute.

            James Jeggo's shot was cleared by defender Ash Taylor only to bounce off the face of his teammate Lewis Mayo in the 6-yard box and fall to the feet of Hoppe. The forward settled the ball with his right foot, spun and beat goalkeeper Sam Walker with his left foot from 4 yards.











            On Jan. 9, 2021, Hoppe became the first American to score a hat trick in the Bundesliga when he did it for Schalke against Hoffenheim. Before Saturday, he had not scored a senior goal since May 15, 2021, against Eintracht Frankfurt.

            Hoppe went without a goal in six matches for Middlesbrough of England's second tier this season before he was loaned to Hibs on Jan. 31. He played one previous match for Hibs for this month, making his debut against St Mirren on Feb. 4.

            He spent 2021-22 with Mallorca but made just five La Liga and two Copa del Rey appearances.

            Hoppe has one goal in eight U.S. appearances, against Jamaica in the quarterfinals of the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

(AP) — Florida Republicans chose Christian Ziegler on Saturday to be their party's chairman heading into a 2024 election in which the state could be center stage for GOP presidential politics.

            The vote was 126 for Ziegler, the party's current vice chair, to 100 for Evan Power, who chairs the GOP in Leon County, which includes the state capital, Tallahassee. Power was elected vice chair of the state GOP, the party announced on Twitter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814586,Braves' Harris II says Rookie of Year season was 'decent',"NORTH PORT, Fla. (AP) — Bad news for the rest of the National League: The reigning Rookie of the Year doesn't sound all that satisfied with his debut season.

            Atlanta's Michael Harris II, whose callup last year propelled the Braves to 101 wins and a division title, said Saturday he “had an all right season, I guess,” and then responded with more modesty when asked if that's really how he feels about 2022.

            “Some things I had to work on, but it was decent. I'll try to do better,"" Harris said. ""Kind of like to hold myself to a higher standard.”











            There's no telling how good the 21-year-old center fielder can become. Harris hit .297 with 19 home runs, 64 RBIs and 20 stolen bases after jumping from Double-A to the majors. Atlanta was below .500 when Harris made his debut May 28. Shortly thereafter, the Braves went on a 14-game winning streak.

            Harris and Atlanta teammate Spencer Strider finished 1-2 in the Rookie of the Year vote.

            “It means a lot. I know you can only win it once,"" Harris said. ""I guess that made it mean so much more.”

            Harris starts a $72 million, eight-year deal in 2023 that could be worth $102 million over 10 seasons. He's from DeKalb, Georgia, and the contract means he could be playing in Atlanta for a while.

            “Me being a fan of the Braves growing up, and being able to put on that jersey and play in Atlanta for a team I grew up rooting for, I guess it just gave me that extra push,"" Harris said. ""Having my family and friends here to support me too, that also helped.”

            HENDRIKS THROWS

            Chicago White Sox closer Liam Hendriks is serving as an inspiration for the rest of the team in spring training.

            Hendriks went public with his battle with cancer in January, announcing he has non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But he has been working out at the team’s facility in Arizona, and pitching coach Ethan Katz said the three-time All-Star had a bullpen session on Friday.

            “This guy’s unbelievable. He really is,” an emotional Katz said Saturday. “He’ll be back on the field as soon as he can.”

            Right-hander Lucas Giolito said learning of Hendriks’ diagnosis was “pretty devastating,” but it has helped having him around at camp.

            “It’s like a great thing to see. He’s a special guy off the field as well,” Giolito said. “So seeing him do his thing right now, we’re all looking forward to having him back.”

            HE'S BACK

            Former Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia made his first visit to the team’s spring training facility since he officially retired in 2021. 

            “The energy Pedroia still has is unreal,” manager Alex Cora said. “For him to be around and with the group, I think it’s more important to him and we want to make a conscious effort to have him around as much as possible. When guys like that come here, it’s a joy for everybody, especially him.” 

            Pedroia’s left knee was injured by a slide from Manny Machado in 2017. He spent the next three years having multiple operations before he announced his retirement.

            “He led by example,” Cora said. “There’s a reason he’s limping around. He gave everything to this franchise.""

            Pedroia said he came because Cora called him.

            “He asked me,” Pedroia said. “Obviously I’ll do anything for Alex for what he meant to me and my career, the things that he taught me. He asks and I’m there. But as far as a major role with the organization, I’m not there yet. My kids are young and I’m helping them out.” 

            Does he miss playing? 

            “I miss it,” Pedroia said. “But I’ve kind of fallen in line with my new life. … Obviously, I miss playing and being around the guys, but I didn’t miss the grind. The last few years of my career was tough.”

            THE BOSSES

            Philadelphia manager Rob Thomson sees similarities between former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Phillies owner John Middleton.

            “He really is,” Thomson said. “He’s very competitive, and he wants to win. He wants to have the best organization in the history of the game, and I respect that.”

            Thomson spent 20 of his almost 30 years in the Yankees’ organization in roles from player development to big league coach under Steinbrenner, who died in 2010.

            “I couldn’t put into words, but it’s helped,” Thomson said on how working for Steinbrenner aided him as a manager. “I can’t tell you how much because it’s just attention to detail, and the willingness to win and whatever it takes to win. The competition level that he had is unheard of, and I just loved being around him, really did.”

            Middleton worked the ball bag during batting practice when there was a lack of people shagging balls, something that a smiling Thomson said he never saw Steinbrenner do. 

            Thomson got his first major league managerial chance on an interim basis when Joe Girardi was fired on June 3 of last year. Philadelphia went 65-46 under Thomson en route to winning the National League pennant.

            Thomson had the interim tag removed and received a two-year contract during last year’s postseason.

            FAMILIAR FACE

            The Cincinnati Reds and right-hander Hunter Strickland agreed to terms on a minor league contract with an invitation to major league camp.

            Strickland went 3-3 with a 4.91 ERA and seven saves in 66 relief appearances for the Reds last year. The previous season, he pitched for the Rays, Angels and Brewers.

            The 34-year-old Strickland has also pitched for the Mets, Mariners and Nationals since spending the first five seasons of his career with the Giants.

            BELLO'S HEALTH

            Boston right-hander Brayan Bello has been shut down until Monday due to right forearm soreness.

            “After his last bullpen, he felt soreness,” manager Alex Cora said. “He’s so important to the organization and what we’re trying to accomplish. He’ll be back on his throwing program Monday.” 

            The 23-year-old Bello is a candidate to make the club’s starting rotation this spring. 

            “It was last week, I was throwing. I didn’t feel any pain. I felt tight and I didn’t want to force it,” he said through a translator Saturday morning. “I feel much better right now. I’ve been working really hard to get ready.” 

            Last year, he was promoted from Triple-A and pitched in 13 games for Boston, making 11 starts and going 2-8 with a 4.71 ERA.

            “I feel very anxious. I want Monday to come,” Bello said. “It’s the first time I’ve experienced something like this.”

            In December, Bello worked out at the home of Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez in the Dominican Republic.

            MÁRQUEZ RECOVERING

            Colorado right-hander Germán Márquez will not compete for Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic because of a minor hamstring injury. He's expected to be ready by opening day.

            Márquez is entering his eighth season with the Rockies. He went 9-13 with a 4.95 ERA in 31 starts last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814587,Arsenal back on top as Man City held to draw in EPL,"LONDON (AP) — In a title race that keeps producing twists, the pendulum swung back Arsenal’s way again after a frustrating day for Manchester City in the English Premier League.

            Arsenal came from behind twice before scoring two goals in injury time to beat Aston Villa 4-2 in the early kickoff on Saturday and halt a three-game winless streak in the league. 

            City then conceded a second-half equalizer and was held at Nottingham Forest to a surprising 1-1 after wasting chances to put the game away. The normally prolific Erling Haaland was guilty of a glaring double miss when he first hit the crossbar and then fired the rebound over the net from close range in the second half.











            That all put Arsenal back atop the league standings, two points above City and with a game in hand after Pep Guardiola’s side went ahead on goal difference on Wednesday following a 3-1 win over the Gunners.

            “We had amazing chances but it’s football. We have to score,” Guardiola said. “It is one of the best games we have played but we drop two points.”

            Also, Chelsea’s struggles reached a new low after losing at home against last-placed Southampton 1-0, which should ramp up the pressure on manager Graham Potter. 

            The match also had some worrying scenes as Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta sustained a head injury after taking a kick in the face. He was carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital.

            Liverpool boosted its push for a top-four finish with a 2-0 win at 10-man Newcastle that ended the host's 17-game unbeaten streak in the league. 

            GUNNERS REBOUND

            Having seen an eight-point lead slip away, Arsenal badly needed to beat Villa and bounce back from the defeat to City midweek.

            It came thanks to a lucky late bounce.

            At 2-2, Jorginho’s shot from outside the area in the third minute of injury time struck the crossbar and bounced in off the head of Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to put Mikel Arteta’s team in front. Gabriel Martinelli added the fourth into an empty net after Martinez went up into the Arsenal box in search of an equalizer. 

            “We needed a magic moment and Jorginho produced it,” Arteta said of his new signing, who joined from Chelsea in January.

            None of Chelsea’s expensive January signings seem able to produce much of anything at the moment. Instead, set-piece specialist James Ward-Prowse scored the only goal at Stamford Bridge with a free kick just before the halftime break.

            The result comes on the heels of three straight league draws and a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League for Potter’s side. To make matters worse was Azpilicueta lengthy treatment after being hit in the face by an attempted overhead kick by Sékou Mara in the 74th minute.

            Azpilicueta was taken off on a stretcher wearing a neck brace and breathing from an oxygen mask after a 10-minute stoppage of play.

            “Thankfully he’s conscious,” Potter said. “He’s in hospital. He spoke to his wife, I believe. So we’re just obviously monitoring and very concerned for him. . . . It was not a nice thing to see.”

            BOTTOM TEAMS WIN

            On a low-scoring afternoon, three of the other six mid-afternoon kickoffs also finished 1-0.

            Fulham beat Brighton away, Everton earned a crucial victory over fellow relegation struggler Leeds, and Bournemouth won at Wolves. A last-gasp equalizer earned Brentford a 1-1 draw at home against Crystal Palace.

            Substitute Manor Solomon scored the 88th-minute winner for Fulham to put the London club three points above Brighton in sixth place as the newcomer surprisingly challenges for a European spot. 

            It was an important day at the bottom of the standings as the three teams who started the day in the relegation zone all won. 

            Everton climbed out of the relegation zone thanks to Seamus Coleman’s second-half goal, moving two points above 19th-place Leeds.

            Bournemouth also moved above West Ham into 17th place after Marcus Tavernier marked his return from injury with the winner against Wolverhampton — although the south-coast club could be back in the relegation zone if West Ham earns at least a draw against Tottenham on Sunday. 

            Southampton remained in last place, three points from safety. 

            LIVERPOOL SURGING

            After a hugely disappointing first half to the season, Liverpool could yet pull off a top-four finish. 

            Liverpool followed up its morale-boosting win over rival Everton with a comfortable victory at St. James' Park in a game that was essentially over halfway through the first half.

            Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo scored before Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope was sent off in the 22nd minute for handling the ball outside the area — ruling him out of the team's League Cup final next weekend against Manchester United. 

            The win puts Liverpool six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle, having played a game less.

            Liverpool center back Virgil van Dijk made his return after sitting out for nearly six weeks with a hamstring injury and said he hoped this week could be a turning point for the team. 

            “We’ve had results in the season where we have felt like this is the time to kick on. But this feels a little bit different,” Van Dijk said. “Coming away from the big win against Everton, it was important to keep going and find a way to win.”

The normally prolific Erling Haaland was guilty of a glaring double miss when he first hit the crossbar and then fired the rebound over the net from close range in the second half.That all put Arsenal back atop the league standings, two points above City and with a game in hand after Pep Guardiola’s side went ahead on goal difference on Wednesday following a 3-1 win over the Gunners.“We had amazing chances but it’s football. We have to score,” Guardiola said. “It is one of the best games we have played but we drop two points.”Also, Chelsea’s struggles reached a new low after losing at home against last-placed Southampton 1-0, which should ramp up the pressure on manager Graham Potter.The match also had some worrying scenes as Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta sustained a head injury after taking a kick in the face. He was carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital.Liverpool boosted its push for a top-four finish with a 2-0 win at 10-man Newcastle that ended the host's 17-game unbeaten streak in the league.GUNNERS REBOUNDHaving seen an eight-point lead slip away, Arsenal badly needed to beat Villa and bounce back from the defeat to City midweek.It came thanks to a lucky late bounce.At 2-2, Jorginho’s shot from outside the area in the third minute of injury time struck the crossbar and bounced in off the head of Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to put Mikel Arteta’s team in front.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814600,Dethroned King: Petty hurt as Johnson takes over race team,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Richard Petty may still reign as NASCAR’s King, but with Jimmie Johnson wresting control of Petty’s old race team, he is definitively not the boss.

            The Hall of Famer essentially has been stripped of power inside his former eponymous team that rapidly rebranded and rebuilt since November. Johnson and Petty are the only living seven-time NASCAR champions — and that appears to be where the similarities end inside Legacy Motor Club's front office. 

            The 85-year-old Petty, who is officially Legacy's ambassador, said Saturday he has bruised feelings and little say in the direction of the race team since Johnson bought into the ownership group.











            “It’s been strange to me,” Petty said. “Most of the time, I ran the majority of the show. Jimmie brought all his people in. His way of running things and my way of running things are probably a little bit different. We probably agree on about 50% of what it really comes down to.”

            Ahead of the Daytona 500, an unfiltered Petty said he was irked by Johnson’s rise in power. “Yes, it does” bother him, he said. 

            But Petty conceded it was “probably time for a change” because through several incarnations of his race team — the latest Petty GMS — his cars had never risen above the middle of the pack. GMS founder Maury Gallagher, chairman of Allegiant Air, purchased Richard Petty Motorsports in 2021 and Petty, whose 200 Cup wins as a driver are a record, served as the front man.

            Johnson told The Associated Press he was “disappointed” that Petty publicly expressed his displeasure, adding: “Of course, we'll have conversations.”

            “He’s not expressed them to me, for starters,” Johnson said. “Honestly, there are a lot of moving pieces to this. There are business decisions that are taking place between Mr. Gallagher and the Petty family before I ever arrived. Those are details that are just not my place to say. 

            ""But a lot of what Richard is speaking to is based on business decisions that he and his family have made and they aren't relative to my involvement.""

            One of Johnson’s first decisions: Strip the Petty name that dates in NASCAR to 1949.

            “When Jimmie came in, it was going to be hard to be Johnson Petty GMS,” Petty said. “Jimmie’s thinking further ahead with his crew and came up with a new name."" 

            Petty remains NASCAR’s most recognizable personality, wearing his feathered Charlie 1 Horse hats, dark glasses and cowboy boots. He’s never stopped signing autographs, making personal appearances or glad-handing sponsors, though even those responsibilities seem more uncertain under Johnson's reign.

            “They don’t take over the racing part, they take over the front office,” Petty said. “With sponsorships, appearances and all that stuff, Jimmie’s crowd is kind of controlling that. That’s something I never had to put up with, I guess.”

            Petty did tip his hat to Johnson’s business acumen: Johnson's connections with Gibson guitars and music industry relationships, including entertainment giant Live Nation, were instrumental in landing legendary rock band Guns N’ Roses on the hood of Erik Jones’ No. 43 Chevrolet.

            ""He’s basically going to wind up running the show in four or five years completely,"" Petty said. ""He’ll probably be the majority owner or the owner of our operation. They’re looking at things completely differently.”

            Even with their shared place in NASCAR history, Johnson and Petty were never close before they forged a business relationship. Johnson, though, said he's always had respect for a driver so famous he inspired a character in “Cars.”

            “He's always been so kind and wonderful to me,” Johnson said. “He's the last person I fist-pumped before I rolled off pit lane and won my seventh championship.”

            Petty and Johnson are among nine drivers who won a NASCAR championship and Daytona 500 set to serve as grand marshals for the Daytona 500 on Sunday. Legacy M.C. also fields cars for Erik Jones and Noah Gragson.

            “Jimmie’s very observant. He takes on everything,” Petty said. “Jimmie controls everything, basically. You’re making postcards and stuff, he has to approve it. He approves everything. He’s a pretty busy man right now.”

            That includes racing. The 47-year-old Johnson returned to NASCAR after a two-year stint in IndyCar and proved he hadn’t lost anything in his first spins in NASCAR’s new car. He qualified on speed for the Daytona 500, flew with the Thunderbirds and topped the first speed chart at practice.

            Johnson’s racing career, though, is winding down. He’s just getting started as team owner.

            “He’s still young enough where’s going to be around a long, long time,"" Petty said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814601,Man City held to frustrating 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest,"NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) — Nottingham Forest delivered another twist in the English Premier League title race as Chris Wood’s late goal earned a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Saturday.

            In response to Arsenal’s lunchtime win over Aston Villa, City hoped to return to the top of the table and went ahead on Bernardo Silva’s first-half goal.

            But missed chances, including two from Erling Haaland, proved costly and Wood’s first goal for Forest in the 84rd minute was enough to earn a point.











            The draw means the Gunners are in first place with a two-point lead over City and a game in hand. City had beaten Arsenal 3-1 on Wednesday but handed the advantage right back.

            Jack Grealish had a shot blocked and Kevin De Bruyne sent two tame efforts wide early on, while City had a better chance in the 33rd minute as Rodri put a free header from De Bruyne’s cross inches wide.

            The chances began to rack up and Silva curled an effort just wide from the edge of the area.

            He then gave City the lead in the 41st, when Grealish set up the Portuguese, who unleashed an unstoppable swerving drive from the edge of the area that was too good for Keylor Navas.

            City missed a huge chance to make it 2-0 soon after the restart when Phil Foden lost control as he tried to square to Haaland. Moments later, Aymeric Laporte headed straight at Navas.

            City kept the pressure on but Haaland missed two sitters.

            Navas spilled Foden’s shot from the edge of the area and the Norwegian looked prime to score the rebound, but he hit the crossbar. The striker had another go from the second rebound but was even worse with that attempt, firing over from inside the six-yard box.

            Forest scored with seven minutes when Morgan Gibbs-White sent a low cross for Wood to tap in.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814602,Russian diplomats ordered out of the Netherlands,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch government said Saturday that “a number” of Russian diplomats will have to leave the Netherlands, accusing Moscow of trying to smuggle spies into the country that is home to institutions including the International Criminal Court and the global chemical weapons watchdog.

            The announcement is the latest twist in a diplomatic dispute between the two countries that began shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago sparked a war on Europe's eastern flank.

            “Despite numerous attempts by the Netherlands to find a solution, Russia continues to try to get intelligence officers into the Netherlands under diplomatic cover,” Foreign Affairs Minister Wopke Hoekstra said in a statement. “We cannot and will not allow that.""











            He added that it remains “important to keep the embassies open as a communication channel, even now that relations with Russia are more difficult than ever.”

            The Russian diplomats were given two weeks to leave the country. A Russian trade office in Amsterdam was ordered shut by Tuesday.

            As well as accusing Russia of trying to post spies in the Netherlands, the government said Moscow was refusing to grant visas to Dutch diplomats to staff the Netherlands' consulate in St. Petersburg and embassy in the Russian capital.

            The Dutch consulate general in St. Petersburg is being closed as of Monday.

            Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Dutch government expelled 17 Russian intelligence officers. Russia responded by kicking out 15 Dutch diplomats.

            The Russian Embassy in The Hague did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814604,Dogs in costumes take over at Rio Carnival street party,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — As Rio de Janeiro kicked off its Carnival on Saturday, about 100 dogs barked and wagged their tails to the tune of samba music as they paraded in front of pet lovers in a canine costume competition.

            The “Blocao” — a mixture of “bloco” which refers to Carnival street parties and “cao,” or dog in Portuguese — brought about 300 people to Rio's Barra da Tijuca. Dog costumes ranged from fairies, and superheroes to clowns and cartoon characters. 

            Edson Chianca, 36, brought his 12-year-old Saori to the parade in a Minnie Mouse costume. He dressed the same way so the pair matched. 











            “It is a great initiative, this is a good moment for pets to socialize,” said Chianca.

            Mari Jordão, 52, has attended the Blocao since 2014. Dog “mothers need to be careful, bring water, carry their dog if the pavement is too hot,” she said. 

            Blocao is one of the few events that challenged a city ban on street parties last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has taken place for about 20 years.

            Marco Antonio Vieira, the organizer of Blocao, said he has no intention of humanizing pets with the pet parade and the contest that picks the top five best dressed dogs.

            “Thirty years ago they lived in our backyard, now they live on our beds. It is good for them to be with the owner. When the dog sees the owner happy, he is happy too,"" Vieira said. 

            “Some people have worked on their dog costumes for three months,” Vieira said. “There's nothing but happy people here.”RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — As Rio de Janeiro kicked off its Carnival on Saturday, about 100 dogs barked and wagged their tails to the tune of samba music as they paraded in front of pet lovers in a canine costume competition.The “Blocao” — a mixture of “bloco” which refers to Carnival street parties and “cao,” or dog in Portuguese — brought about 300 people to Rio's Barra da Tijuca.

He dressed the same way so the pair matched.“It is a great initiative, this is a good moment for pets to socialize,” said Chianca.Mari Jordão, 52, has attended the Blocao since 2014. Dog “mothers need to be careful, bring water, carry their dog if the pavement is too hot,” she said.Blocao is one of the few events that challenged a city ban on street parties last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has taken place for about 20 years.Marco Antonio Vieira, the organizer of Blocao, said he has no intention of humanizing pets with the pet parade and the contest that picks the top five best dressed dogs.“Thirty years ago they lived in our backyard, now they live on our beds. It is good for them to be with the owner. When the dog sees the owner happy, he is happy too,"" Vieira said.“Some people have worked on their dog costumes for three months,” Vieira said. “There's nothing but happy people here.”",2023/02/19,,World

            Israel international Solomon, who played under De Zerbi at Shakhtar Donetsk, struck two minutes from time at Amex Stadium after Brighton dominated.

            Solly March and Facundo Buonanotte had goals disallowed for the Seagulls, who failed to score in the top-flight for the first time since October, despite registering 21 attempts.











            Fulham, without star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic due to a minor injury, struggled for a foothold in the game for the majority of the afternoon before the late twist boosted its hopes of European qualification at the expense of its host.

            The veteran Ireland defender ran onto Alex Iwobi's pass down the right side and from just inside the area went for goal to beat Illan Meslier. The Leeds goalkeeper was off his line in anticipation of a cross and could only watch Coleman’s volley sneak in behind him in the 64th minute.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814609,Johnson provides early Daytona thrills in NASCAR comeback,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — “New leader ... 84.”

            Jimmie Johnson sent a jolt through the track when he shot to the top of the leaderboard in practice for the Daytona 500. Ol' seven-time has returned to NASCAR after a humbling two years in IndyCar as part owner and sometimes driver at what's called Legacy Motor Club. 

            Legacy is the Johnson-led rebrand of what began as Petty Enterprises in 1949 — a year after NASCAR began. The Daytona 500 on Sunday starts NASCAR's celebratory 75th season and all eyes are on Johnson, who just over three months ago did an about-face, returned to NASCAR and energized Richard Petty's limp race team. 











            Johnson is not driving the No. 48, the only number he's ever used at NASCAR's top level; that now belongs to Daytona 500 pole-sitter Alex Bowman, Johnson's successor at Hendrick Motorsports. Johnson is in the No. 84 Chevrolet. 

            Everything is different at this new Legacy organization, which Petty said Saturday would be completely run by Johnson within five years. But Johnson showed he still knows his way around Daytona International Speedway, even if FanDuel lists him as 40-1 longshot for Sunday. 

            “The large majority of it is familiar. I’m remembering little details as I make laps and get into the zone,” Johnson said. ""It drives like a stock car. It doesn’t drive like an IndyCar, thank God. We know how that went.”

            Try no podium finishes in two seasons.

            As a team owner, Johnson is a stabilizing figure for the two-car organization of Erik Jones and Noah Gragson. The two-time Daytona 500 champion turns 48 this year, and is a mentor for Gragson — who has the wattage to be a superstar but struggled with maturity issues during his climb into a Cup ride.

            He signed last year with what he thought was Petty GMS, a mediocre team with a legend in Petty in the team masthead. In reality, the 24-year-old has gotten is unrestricted access to one of the greatest sportsmen of his generation. Gragson is soaking in every bit of wisdom Johnson has to offer, and the deal came with spotter Earl Barban, who debuted with Johnson in that 2006 Daytona 500 victory. 

            “New leader ... 48,” was Barban's trademark call as Johnson led nearly 19,000 laps in his career. 

            Johnson didn't want a new spotter, but made a business decision to help his young, new driver. 

            “Wearing my team owner hat and knowing the experience that Earl has and what he can share with Noah ... I just sensed it was the right thing to do,” Johnson said. 

            Although Petty won the Daytona 500 seven times, the last Petty-owned car to win the Daytona 500 was in 1979. Johnson has the organization in the conversation for Sunday. 

            “I’m glad we’re at the top of the board and not at the bottom,” Johnson said. ""I’m sure the headlines would read a little differently if we were on the other end of it.”

            Other things to watch on Sunday: 

            BUMPER CARS 

            NASCAR is in the second year of its new Next Gen car and still seeking solutions to a problem with the bumpers that caused several concussions last season. 

            The rear bumpers were supposed to be softened this year so that the car would absorb more energy during routine contact, but drivers earlier this month complained the hits were just as hard in the exhibition race at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

            Racing at Daytona requires deliberate bump drafting and it's an aggressive race in which the stakes are higher than a typical Sunday. 

            “Daytona has its own set of rules that everyone plays by,” said Brad Keselowski, who was fastest in Saturday's final practice. ”At the end of the race at Daytona, you have to ask yourself, ‘What am I willing to do to win this race?’ More often than not, especially over the last three years, it’s taken wrecking the leader to win the 500.""

            HAMLIN'S HISTORY 

            Denny Hamlin seeks a fourth Daytona 500 victory in a career he already finds beyond fulfilling. 

            The knock on Hamlin is that he's never won a Cup championship in 17 tries. But when asked this week whether he'd trade a Daytona 500 trophy for just one title, Hamlin snapped: “No. I got asked that last year. No way. No chance."" 

            Hamlin finished ninth in his qualifying race and the entire Toyota fleet sat out of Saturday's practice. Both the Ford and Chevy camps seemed both fast and organized — Hendrick Chevys Bowman and Kyle Larson start on the front row, Ford drivers Joey Logano and Aric Almirola start on the second — but Hamlin still likes his chances. 

            “I LOVE my car,” he wrote on Twitter.

            WHO TO WATCH 

            IndyCar driver Conor Daly and action sports star Travis Pastrana make their Daytona 500 debuts in a twist of fate for the good friends. 

            Pastrana always wanted to start the Daytona 500 to add to his long and storied resume. A decade after running one full season of NASCAR at his second-tier level, he gets the chance in a Toyota fielded by 23XI Racing. 

            “A lot of the guys that follow NASCAR, just the fans, they know me as a TV personality or a stuntman,” Pastrana said. “Really in my heart, racer, motorcross racer, built the reputation as a race car driver as well.”

            He anticipates he'll draw new eyes, too. 

            “When I announced I was going to come over here, the action sports community jumped onboard 110%,” Pastrana said. “So many people are saying ‘Man, I’m watching the 500.’ I haven’t been excited since I was a kid for our industry to see this.”

            Pastrana was part of Daly's 30th birthday celebration in Las Vegas in late 2021 that saved Daly's career. There, Daly met with a potential sponsor and that chat over cocktails led to a full season of IndyCar funding for Daly. Bitnile is now heavily involved in all of Ed Carpenter Racing and is funding Daly's effort at Daytona with The Money Team, a fledgling organization owned by Floyd Mayweather. 

            Daly barely made the race, and the No. 50 is probably the least prepared in the field, but like Pastrana he's excited to showcase motorsports. 

            “As a race fan first, I love this race, and I love the Indy 500, of course,” Daly said. “That’s the true gem in my heart and mind. But the Daytona 500 is the Daytona 500. I always think in my lifetime that I wanted to do the Le Mans 24-hour race, the Indy 500, and the Daytona 500. Now I’m going to have two of those crossed off the list.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814610,"Kremlin critic missing amid prison transfer, allies say","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Relatives and allies of an opposition politician imprisoned in Russia say they haven't heard from him in a month and are worried about his well-being. 

            Andrei Pivovarov, who was sentenced to four years in prison last year, was transferred from a detention center in southern Russia in December. In the following weeks, he occasionally wrote letters to his loved ones from detention centers in other Russian cities, stopovers on the way to his undisclosed final destination.

            Tatyana Usmanova, Pivovarov’s partner, received the last such letter on Jan. 18. In it, the politician said he was in a detention center in St. Petersburg, his hometown, and was told that he soon would be sent to a penal colony in the nearby Karelia region. 











            “After that, silence,” Usmanova told The Associated Press. 

            Letters and official requests sent to prisons in Karelia and around St. Petersburg, as well as to Russia’s State Penitentiary Service, yielded no results, and Pivovarov’s whereabouts remain unknown, she said.

            “We don’t know if he’s alive; if he’s feeling well; if he’s being tortured or abused somehow,” Usmanova said. “We don’t know anything. And it’s extremely hard.”

            Amnesty International said in a statement Friday that Pivovarov’s situation amounted to an enforced disappearance.

            The group’s Russia director, Natalia Zvyagina, called the Russian prison transfer system “dire,” and urged authorities to disclose Pivovarov’s location and release him. She said he is “serving an unfair sentence on politically motivated charges for a ‘crime’ that doesn’t exist in international law.”

            Russia’s State Penitentiary Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP.

            Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited. Usmanova said convicts are transported in special train cars attached to ordinary trains and pass through detention centers in various, sometimes out-of-the-way regions.

            Pivovarov was pulled off a Warsaw-bound flight at St. Petersburg’s airport just before takeoff in May 2021 and taken to the southern city of Krasnodar.

            Several days earlier, the opposition group he headed, Open Russia, had disbanded to protect its members from prosecution after Russian authorities designated it as an “undesirable” organization. The government cited a 2015 law that made membership in such organizations a criminal offense.

            In Krasnodar, Pivovarov was accused of supporting a local candidate on behalf of an “undesirable” organization. Charges against him were based on his social media posts, and he rejected them as politically motivated and triggered by his plans to run for the Russian parliament in 2021. 

            He was convicted and sentenced in July, when Russia’s war in Ukraine and sweeping crackdown on dissent were in full swing. 

            In a written interview conducted when he was behind bars in December, before his transfer from Krasnodar, Pivovarov told the AP that his arrest came as a surprise – “to put it mildly, it’s an incredible feeling when a plane is being turned around on the runway because of you” – but that his sentence did not.

            “By the summer of 2022, the political field was completely purged. Those who hadn’t left ended up behind bars just like me,” the 41-year-old wrote.

            Despite his detention, Pivovarov still managed to run, albeit unsuccessfully, for Russia’s parliament in 2021. He was one of the few opposition politicians to be allowed on the ballot, and his team ran his campaign while he was behind bars.

            “Opposition activism in Russia is, by and large, the task of finding a way out of situations with no way out. They prohibit everything for you and watch what you’ll do,” Pivovarov wrote. “They tried to shut me up, but it had the opposite effect.""

            His campaign, he said, became a platform for him and his allies to speak out. 

            It was in jail where he learned that President Vladimir Putin launched “a special military operation” in Ukraine.

            Other inmates, who had TVs in their cells, initially followed the war in Ukraine “as a movie, a football match where you should root for ‘our guys,'” the politician said. But that attitude changed last summer, when Russia’s Wagner Group, a private military contractor, started recruiting convicts to fight in Ukraine. 

            “The opportunity to go there was viewed as a chance to avoid (serving) a lengthy term,” Pivovarov said, adding that inmates were largely motivated by hopelessness.

            In his facility, some 150 men signed up, he said.

            Asked whether there was any point in opposition activism in recent years, given that the Kremlin either imprisoned or drove most activists out of Russia Pivovarov said “there most certainly was,” but he acknowledged some things could have been done differently.

            “Looking back, you realize that maybe we didn’t get all of the priorities straight. Focusing on corruption, authoritarianism, rights violations, we overlooked the emerging militarism,” he said.

             “But the fact that civil society, alternative information channels and (opposition) leaders, even behind bars or in exile, are still there – it is something.”TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Relatives and allies of an opposition politician imprisoned in Russia say they haven't heard from him in a month and are worried about his well-being.Andrei Pivovarov, who was sentenced to four years in prison last year, was transferred from a detention center in southern Russia in December.

In it, the politician said he was in a detention center in St. Petersburg, his hometown, and was told that he soon would be sent to a penal colony in the nearby Karelia region.“After that, silence,” Usmanova told The Associated Press.Letters and official requests sent to prisons in Karelia and around St. Petersburg, as well as to Russia’s State Penitentiary Service, yielded no results, and Pivovarov’s whereabouts remain unknown, she said.“We don’t know if he’s alive; if he’s feeling well; if he’s being tortured or abused somehow,” Usmanova said. “We don’t know anything. And it’s extremely hard.”Amnesty International said in a statement Friday that Pivovarov’s situation amounted to an enforced disappearance.The group’s Russia director, Natalia Zvyagina, called the Russian prison transfer system “dire,” and urged authorities to disclose Pivovarov’s location and release him. She said he is “serving an unfair sentence on politically motivated charges for a ‘crime’ that doesn’t exist in international law.”Russia’s State Penitentiary Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP.Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited. Usmanova said convicts are transported in special train cars attached to ordinary trains and pass through detention centers in various, sometimes out-of-the-way regions.Pivovarov was pulled off a Warsaw-bound flight at St. Petersburg’s airport just before takeoff in May 2021 and taken to the southern city of Krasnodar.Several days earlier, the opposition group he headed, Open Russia, had disbanded to protect its members from prosecution after Russian authorities designated it as an “undesirable” organization. The government cited a 2015 law that made membership in such organizations a criminal offense.In Krasnodar, Pivovarov was accused of supporting a local candidate on behalf of an “undesirable” organization. Charges against him were based on his social media posts, and he rejected them as politically motivated and triggered by his plans to run for the Russian parliament in 2021.He was convicted and sentenced in July, when Russia’s war in Ukraine and sweeping crackdown on dissent were in full swing.In a written interview conducted when he was behind bars in December, before his transfer from Krasnodar, Pivovarov told the AP that his arrest came as a surprise – “to put it mildly, it’s an incredible feeling when a plane is being turned around on the runway because of you” – but that his sentence did not.“By the summer of 2022, the political field was completely purged. Those who hadn’t left ended up behind bars just like me,” the 41-year-old wrote.Despite his detention, Pivovarov still managed to run, albeit unsuccessfully, for Russia’s parliament in 2021. He was one of the few opposition politicians to be allowed on the ballot, and his team ran his campaign while he was behind bars.“Opposition activism in Russia is, by and large, the task of finding a way out of situations with no way out. They prohibit everything for you and watch what you’ll do,” Pivovarov wrote. “They tried to shut me up, but it had the opposite effect.""His campaign, he said, became a platform for him and his allies to speak out.It was in jail where he learned that President Vladimir Putin launched “a special military operation” in Ukraine.Other inmates, who had TVs in their cells, initially followed the war in Ukraine “as a movie, a football match where you should root for ‘our guys,'” the politician said. But that attitude changed last summer, when Russia’s Wagner Group, a private military contractor, started recruiting convicts to fight in Ukraine.“The opportunity to go there was viewed as a chance to avoid (serving) a lengthy term,” Pivovarov said, adding that inmates were largely motivated by hopelessness.In his facility, some 150 men signed up, he said.Asked whether there was any point in opposition activism in recent years, given that the Kremlin either imprisoned or drove most activists out of Russia Pivovarov said “there most certainly was,” but he acknowledged some things could have been done differently.“Looking back, you realize that maybe we didn’t get all of the priorities straight. Focusing on corruption, authoritarianism, rights violations, we overlooked the emerging militarism,” he said.“But the fact that civil society, alternative information channels and (opposition) leaders, even behind bars or in exile, are still there – it is something.”",2023/02/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814613,Blinken: China's balloon incursion 'must never happen again',"MUNICH (AP) — The top diplomats from the United States and China met on Saturday in the first high-level contact between their countries since the U.S. shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon two weeks ago, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken sending the message that Beijing's surveillance program had been “exposed to the world.”

            Blinken and Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, held the hourlong talks in Munich, where they were attending an international security conference, according to the U.S. State Department.

            “I made very clear to him that China sending its surveillance balloon over the United States in violation of our sovereignty, in violation of international law, was unacceptable and must never happen again,"" Blinken said Saturday in an interview for CBS' “Face the Nation.”











            His spokesman, Ned Price, said in a statement that Blinken also told the Chinese official that his nation's “high-altitude surveillance balloon program — which has intruded into the airspace of over 40 countries across five continents — has been exposed to the world.”

            Blinken had canceled a trip to Beijing earlier this month due to the balloon incident, which has become a major issue of contention between the two countries. A meeting at the conference in Germany had been widely anticipated.

            Blinken also told Wang that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, repeating a standard talking point that the Biden administration has provided since it has come into office.

            “The United States will compete and will unapologetically stand up for our values and interests, but that we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not looking for a new Cold War,"" Price said. Blinken ""underscored the importance of maintaining diplomatic dialogue and open lines of communication at all times.” 

            In addition to the balloon incident, Price said Blinken had reiterated a warning to China on providing assistance to Russia to help with its war against Ukraine, including assisting Moscow with evading sanctions the West has imposed on Russia.

            “I warned China against providing materiel support to Russia,” Blinken said in a tweet. ""I also emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of communication.”

            Earlier Saturday, Wang had renewed Beijing's criticism of the United States for shooting down the balloon, arguing that the move did not point to U.S. strength.

            Beijing insists the white orb shot down off the Carolina coast on Feb. 4 was just an errant civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research that went off course due to winds and had only limited “self-steering” capabilities.

            Wang, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, repeated that insistence in a speech at the conference and accused the U.S. of violating international legal norms in destroying the object with a missile fired from an U.S. fighter jet.

            “The actions don’t show that the U.S. is big and strong, but describe the exact opposite,” Wang said.

            Wang also accused the U.S. of denying China’s economic advances and seeking to impede its further development. 

            “What we hope for from the U.S. is a pragmatic and positive approach to China that allows us to work together,” Wang said. 

            His comments came shortly before an address to the conference by Vice President Kamala Harris, who didn't mention the balloon controversy or respond to Wang's comments. She stressed the importance of upholding the “international rules-based order.”

            She said Washington is “troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began” in Ukraine and that “looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing and further undermine a rules-based order.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814615,Alabama headlines early list of top NCAA Tournament seeds,"Alabama got the best of Houston in a nonconference matchup. That has Crimson Tide holding an early lead on the Cougars for the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, too.

            The committee that will select the field of 68 revealed its preliminary list of top teams Saturday, with the Crimson Tide taking the top spot over the Cougars due to a head-to-head road win in December — which committee chairman Chris Reynolds said “put them over the top.”

            Otherwise, there isn't much difference when it comes to the teams' resumes. They're 1-2 in some order in the AP Top 25, NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool) and KenPom rankings. Alabama entered the weekend with seven wins in Quadrant 1 compared to four for Houston, while both teams were unbeaten against Quadrant 2 opponents.











            If the order holds, it would mark the first No. 1 regional seed for Nate Oats’ Crimson Tide in program history. Alabama climbed to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 poll earlier this week for the first time since 2003, though the Tide lost to Tennessee on Wednesday in its first game with that ranking.

            Houston hasn't held a No. 1 seed since 1983, during the “Phi Slama Jama” era of the early 1980s. 

            Purdue and reigning national champion Kansas were the other No. 1 seeds, with the Boilermakers spending a national-best seven weeks at No. 1 in the AP Top 25 this season. The Jayhawks are trying to become the first repeat champion since Florida in 2006-07 and entered the weekend with a national-best 12 Quadrant 1 wins, while no other team had reached 10.

            The nationally televised reveal of the top 16 seeds offers a snapshot of where things stand with a little more than three weeks remaining until the field is set. 

            Since the first reveal in 2017, the NCAA said 65 of 80 teams have remained in the top 16, while three of the four No. 1 regional seeds each year have stayed there.

            Texas, Arizona, Baylor and UCLA were the preliminary No. 2 seeds, followed by Tennessee, Virginia, Iowa State and Kansas State as 3-seeds. Indiana, Marquette, Gonzaga and Xavier rounded out the list as No. 4 seeds.

            Reynolds said Creighton, Miami, Saint Mary's and Connecticut were the top teams to miss the cut. 

            The selection committee also sorted the top 16 seeds into four regional groupings, starting with Alabama headlining the South bracket that goes through Louisville, Kentucky. Baylor, Virginia and Indiana joined the Tide in the South.

            Houston topped the Midwest bracket running through Kansas City, Missouri, followed by Texas, Tennessee and Xavier.

            Purdue was the No. 1 seed in the East bracket running through New York, joined by UCLA, Iowa State and Marquette.

            Kansas was the top seed in the West bracket running through Las Vegas, followed by Arizona, Kansas State and Gonzaga.

            The Big 12 finished with a national-best five teams in the top 16. The Southeastern, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Big East conferences each had two as the only other leagues with multiple teams.

            Selection Sunday is March 12, with First Four games beginning two days later. The Final Four will be held in Houston, with the semifinals set for April 1 and the championship game two days later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814616,"Commanders announce Bieniemy as OC, assistant head coach","Eric Bieniemy has agreed to be the Washington Commanders’ offensive coordinator and assistant head coach, the team announced Saturday.

            Bieniemy, a two-time Super Bowl-winning assistant with Kansas City, now gets the chance to show what he can do without Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes.

            Bieniemy, who turns 54 in August, emerged from a pool of more than a half-dozen candidates as Washington’s choice for the job following the Chiefs’ second championship in his five seasons as their offensive coordinator. The longtime NFL assistant has interviewed for numerous head coaching jobs, but Reid calling plays for an offense featuring a two-time MVP in Mahomes clouded Bieniemy’s stock.











            The decisions by teams not to hire Bieniemy, who is Black, as a head coach have been an ongoing talking point for critics of the NFL’s minority hiring practices.

            Bieniemy will get the chance to call plays and run every aspect of Washington’s offense under Ron Rivera, a defensive-minded coach and former linebacker who’s going into his fourth season in charge of the team’s football operations.

            Bieniemy inherits second-year quarterback Sam Howell, who goes into spring as the starter, and an offense that includes running backs Brian Robinson Jr. and Antonio Gibson and top receiver Terry McLaurin.

            A running back for nine seasons in the 1990s, Bieniemy has coached at the college and pro levels. He coached running backs with Kansas City for five years before being promoted to offensive coordinator and before that worked at the University of Colorado and for the Minnesota Vikings as a position coach.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814620,A rare Sunday game in Utah awaits with All-Star contest,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — There will be an NBA game in Salt Lake City on Sunday night, something that hasn't been said for more than two decades during the regular season.

            The Utah Jazz traditionally don’t play home games on Sundays out of respect to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church. About 60% of Utah residents are Mormons.

            But the Jazz are hosting the All-Star Game. The team said it didn't have discussions with church officials about the plans to bring the All-Star Game to Utah. The NBA awarded Salt Lake City the game in 2019.











            “The Church’s teaching and practice of Sabbath observance is well established and part of the weekly devotion of Church members and other persons of faith in our community,” church spokesman Doug Andersen said. “We seek to keep the Sabbath day holy, not only at church, but at home, at work and in our communities. We encourage everyone to enrich their day with uplifting activities that help build family relations, provide service to others and strength faith in Jesus Christ.”

            With the exception of a handful of playoff games, it's the first time fans at the home arena will get to watch a game on a Sunday since Jan. 21, 2001.

            The NBA works with teams when constructing the regular-season schedule, basing decisions on things such as arena availability and other factors. Teams also can request to play — or not play — on certain dates. The Jazz have had five playoff games in Salt Lake City over the last 20 years, most recently in 2021. The league's television partners largely dictate the playoff schedule.

            The Jazz have played four games on Sundays so far this season and have three more remaining, including the season finale against the Los Angeles Lakers. All those games, obviously, are road contests.

            “The Utah Jazz continue to be a great community partner, and the Church appreciates the longstanding effort of their leadership team, when possible, to avoid playing NBA games at home on Sundays,” Andersen said. “We are grateful for their sensitivities to Sabbath observance.”

            There is one Sunday tradition that will be honored: The Chick-fil-A stand inside Vivint Arena will not be open for the All-Star Game. The fast food restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches keeps its locations closed on Sunday.

            LEBRON EXCUSED

            LeBron James is planning to play in his 19th All-Star Game on Sunday. But he was excused from All-Star Saturday matters.

            The NBA announced Saturday morning that the Lakers star and newly crowned all-time scoring leader — he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar earlier this month — was excused from practice and media events. The league said James cited personal reasons.

            James and fellow captain Giannis Antetokounmpo will draft their teams Sunday night for the All-Star Game. James will also hold a pregame news conference, and there are plans for him to be honored by the league in a halftime ceremony to commemorate becoming the all-time scoring leader.

            James is tied with Abdul-Jabbar for most All-Star selections, and if James plays on Sunday — there’s no reason to think that he won’t — he would become the first player in NBA history to actually appear in 19 All-Star games. Abdul-Jabbar was selected to the 1973 game but did not play.

            That’ll be just another entry on a long list of All-Star records for James. He’s also the first player to be selected to 19 consecutive All-Star games. Until this year, he shared that record with 18-time-selection Kobe Bryant, the Lakers legend who died Jan. 26, 2020.

            If he makes the start as planned, it’ll be James’ 19th time on the floor to open an All-Star Game, which would be four more anyone else in league history; Bryant made 15 starts. The 19 starts in a row would extent another All-Star record — Bob Cousy has the second-longest such streak, having started 13 straight.

            James also is the career All-Star leader in minutes, points, field goals made and field goals attempted.

            SEATTLE HOPE

            Phoenix guard Kevin Durant needed about a millisecond to answer when asked what city that doesn't have an NBA team needs one: “Seattle,"" he said.

            And what would they be called? “Sonics.""

            Durant, of course, made his NBA debut for the Seattle SuperSonics.

            KYRIE TRAVELS

            Kyrie Irving doesn't travel often on the basketball court. If he wasn't playing basketball, that's evidently a different story.

            The Dallas guard — traded from Brooklyn earlier this month — was asked what he'd do for a living if he didn't play basketball. 

            “If I could have any other career? Shoot, I would probably be one of those people that does hotel reviews, travels around the world and does a whole bunch of reviews on what I think about the five-star treatment that I got or the four-star treatment,"" Irving said. 

            “I’m obviously joking, but that would be a great career. Just to record YouTube videos all day and just say how I feel about the experience,"" he added. ""You know, I have so many interests outside the game. But I think that is probably a story for another day.""

            A VINTAGE LOOK

            Sacramento guard Kevin Huerter, who is at All-Star weekend to be part of the 3-point contest, decided during the summer that he was going to add a headband to his gameday look. 

            Some suggested he shouldn't. Seems like they were wrong.

            “I would never listen to those people,"" Huerter said. “The headband was something I was always going to rock. It's been working so far.""

            RESPECT FOR RUSS

            Indiana guard Buddy Hield was asked Saturday which player he'd like to see get an NBA championship ring who doesn't already have one. 

            His first answer was himself, of course. But his real answer was Russell Westbrook, who is weighing his future after being traded to the Utah Jazz by the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this month.

            “He’s a great dude, man,” Hield said. “You hear all his teammates talk about how he’s a great teammate to them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814621,Hungary's Orban accuses EU of prolonging war in Ukraine,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Saturday that the European Union is partly to blame for prolonging Russia’s war in Ukraine, doubling down on his government’s insistence that supporting Kyiv was a mistaken strategy for Europe.

            Speaking at an annual state of the nation address in Budapest, Orban said the EU had fanned the flames of the war by sanctioning Russia and supplying Ukraine with money and weapons, rather than seeking to negotiate a peace with Moscow.

            “When Russia launched its attack, the West didn’t isolate the conflict but elevated it to a pan-European level,” Orban said. “The war in Ukraine is not a conflict between the armies of good and evil, but between two Slavic countries that are fighting against one another. This is their war, not ours.”











            Under the slogan “Peace and Security,” Orban’s nearly hour-long address focused largely on the conflict in Ukraine, which is approaching its one-year mark, Feb. 24. 

            The right-wing populist leader has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire, saying he and his government are “on the side of peace,” and condemning his Western allies for providing assistance to Kyiv.

            Hungary, he said Saturday, is ""part of the Western world, a member of NATO and the European Union where, aside from us, everyone supports the war or at least acts like they do.” 

            In recent months, Orban has spoken out strongly against several rounds of EU sanctions against Moscow, arguing that they've done little to stop the war and have hurt European economies more than Russia. Ultimately, however, he has always voted for them.

            Breaking with most of its Western allies, Hungary has refused to provide military aid to Ukraine or allow its transfer across its borders, and has held up some EU efforts to provide financial aid packages to Kyiv. 

            On Saturday, he said that while Hungary has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine and taken in refugees who fled the war, such assistance “does not mean doing away with our relationships with Russia, because that would be contrary to our national interests.”

            “We are maintaining our economic relationship with Russia, and in fact, we recommend that the entire Western world do the same, because without relations, there will not be a ceasefire nor peace talks,” he said.

            Over the last decade, Orban's government has pursued increasingly close economic and diplomatic ties with Russia, and concluded major agreements on buying Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel. Hungary has threatened to veto any EU sanctions that would affect its access to Russian energy.

            Saturday's address came as Orban faces numerous political and economic obstacles only 10 months after he and his party won a fourth consecutive term in office. 

            Hungary’s economy slowed to a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2022, while its forint currency has lost 7.5% against the euro and 15% against the dollar in the last year. Inflation in Hungary is among the highest in the EU at over 25%, well more than double the bloc’s average of just over 10%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814622,How to keep your Twitter account secure — without paying,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Twitter users were greeted early Saturday with an ultimatum from the social media app: Subscribe to the platform's new premium service or lose a popular account security feature. 

            A pop-up message warned users they will lose the ability to secure their accounts via text message two-factor authentication unless they pay $8 a month to subscribe to Twitter Blue.

            The message said that starting March 19, users who don’t subscribe will be locked out of their accounts until they remove the security feature. 











            Here are some questions and answers about why Twitter made this change and alternative ways to secure your account:

            WHAT IS TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION?

            Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security to password-protected accounts by having users enter an auto-generated code to log in.

            This extra step helps safeguard online accounts because in addition to the password, you need access to a separate app, device or phone number where you can receive the code.

            Such codes can be generated by apps like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. Or they can be sent to a user's smartphone via text message. 

            It's the text message-based two-factor authorization that Twitter is now restricting only to subscribers of Twitter Blue.

            WHY IS TWITTER DOING THIS?

            In a blog post Wednesday, the San Francisco-based company acknowledged that the text message-based security method has been historically popular with its users, but said the feature is being “used — and abused — by bad actors.”

            The company did not respond early Saturday to an email seeking more details on how the security method was being abused.

            Elon Musk, who completed his $44 billion takeover of Twitter in October, has been trying to find way to maximize profits at the company. 

            One of those is Twitter Blue, which among other features allows anyone to pay for verification previously reserved for celebrities, journalists and other well-known people.

            In its blog, Twitter encouraged users who are not going to subscribe to Twitter Blue to consider using alternative account security options, specifically an authentication app or security key. 

            These methods require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a good way to ensure your account is secure.

            WHAT ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO SECURE MY TWITTER ACCOUNT?

            An authentication app or a security key will also add a layer of account security beyond just a password.

            A security key is a small, portable device that generates a set of random numbers that you enter when prompted when logging into an online account. 

            An authentication app uses the same approach, but instead of a separate physical device, the app is on your phone. 

            To set up an authentication app to secure your Twitter account, you will need to download one of a number of available applications to your device. They are free in the Apple or Android app stores. If you'd rather not use Google or Microsoft Authenticator, there are other options, including Authy, Duo Mobile and 1Password.

            Once you have the app, open the desktop version of Twitter and click on the icon showing ellipses in a circle. There, you’ll find “Settings and privacy” then “Security and account access” and finally, “Security.” Here, you can select “Authentication app” and follow the instructions to set it up. Twitter will ask you to share your email address to do this, if you have not already.

            Once you are all set, you can use the auto-generated numeric codes from your authentication app to add an extra layer of security when logging into Twitter.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Twitter users were greeted early Saturday with an ultimatum from the social media app: Subscribe to the platform's new premium service or lose a popular account security feature.A pop-up message warned users they will lose the ability to secure their accounts via text message two-factor authentication unless they pay $8 a month to subscribe to Twitter Blue.The message said that starting March 19, users who don’t subscribe will be locked out of their accounts until they remove the security feature.Here are some questions and answers about why Twitter made this change and alternative ways to secure your account:WHAT IS TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION?Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security to password-protected accounts by having users enter an auto-generated code to log in.This extra step helps safeguard online accounts because in addition to the password, you need access to a separate app, device or phone number where you can receive the code.Such codes can be generated by apps like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. Or they can be sent to a user's smartphone via text message.It's the text message-based two-factor authorization that Twitter is now restricting only to subscribers of Twitter Blue.WHY IS TWITTER DOING THIS?In a blog post Wednesday, the San Francisco-based company acknowledged that the text message-based security method has been historically popular with its users, but said the feature is being “used — and abused — by bad actors.”The company did not respond early Saturday to an email seeking more details on how the security method was being abused.Elon Musk, who completed his $44 billion takeover of Twitter in October, has been trying to find way to maximize profits at the company.One of those is Twitter Blue, which among other features allows anyone to pay for verification previously reserved for celebrities, journalists and other well-known people.In its blog, Twitter encouraged users who are not going to subscribe to Twitter Blue to consider using alternative account security options, specifically an authentication app or security key.These methods require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a good way to ensure your account is secure.WHAT ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO SECURE MY TWITTER ACCOUNT?An authentication app or a security key will also add a layer of account security beyond just a password.A security key is a small, portable device that generates a set of random numbers that you enter when prompted when logging into an online account.An authentication app uses the same approach, but instead of a separate physical device, the app is on your phone.To set up an authentication app to secure your Twitter account, you will need to download one of a number of available applications to your device. They are free in the Apple or Android app stores. If you'd rather not use Google or Microsoft Authenticator, there are other options, including Authy, Duo Mobile and 1Password.Once you have the app, open the desktop version of Twitter and click on the icon showing ellipses in a circle. There, you’ll find “Settings and privacy” then “Security and account access” and finally, “Security.” Here, you can select “Authentication app” and follow the instructions to set it up.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814623,Chelsea loses to last-place Southampton 1-0 in a new low,"LONDON (AP) — Chelsea’s season sunk to a new low after the London club lost at home to last-placed Southampton 1-0 in the English Premier League on Saturday in a game that also saw Cesar Azpilicueta carried off on a stretcher with a head injury. 

            James Ward-Prowse scored from a free kick on the stroke of halftime to ensure Graham Potter’s team went a fourth consecutive match without a win in the league.

            Five of Chelsea’s eight January signings were in the starting lineup and Potter saw them struggle to find any invention against a Saints side set up by interim boss Ruben Selles to frustrate the host's expensive ensemble.











            Chelsea has scored just once at home in 2023, and the lack of a recognized striker was apparent yet again.

            Southampton took the lead in a familiar fashion. Ward-Prowse’s free kick was the 17th he has scored from in the league, putting him one behind David Beckham on the all-time list. This one arced over Chelsea’s wall and dropped crisply into the bottom corner beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga’s despairing dive. 

            Chelsea tried to respond after the break, but even the introduction of Kai Havertz and Mykhailo Mudryk failed to produce results while Chelsea was camped in Southampton’s defensive half for the final 30 minutes. 

            Raheem Sterling was denied at the back post by a flying block from Romain Perraud, then again on the rebound by Romeo Lavia. The pair celebrated as if top-flight safety had already been secured.

            There was a 10-minute stoppage in play after Azpilicueta needed lengthy treatment after being hit in the head by an attempted overhead kick by Sékou Mara in the 74th minute.

            Azpilicueta was taken off on a stretcher wearing a neck brace and breathing from an oxygen mask.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814624,Tavernier returns and scores in Bournemouth win at Wolves,"WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) — Marcus Tavernier marked his return from injury with a winner off his thigh for Bournemouth to squeeze past Wolverhampton 1-0 in their English Premier League relegation fight on Saturday.

            Tavernier, who was making his first start since November, flicked in Dominic Solanke's cross in the 49th minute at Molineux to end the Cherries' long winless run.

            It was the south-coast club's first league triumph since the World Cup break and its first since confirming Gary O'Neil as full-time manager in November.











            The goal was also only Bournemouth's third under O'Neil and, while there was an element of fortune about it, there was no denying its value.

            Until then Wolves, seeking a third successive win, had been the brighter side but, while the contest was an open one, there was a distinct lack of quality in front of goal.

            Bournemouth was one point from safety and Wolves were five points above the drop zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814627,India welcomes 12 South African cheetahs,"India welcomed 12 wild cheetahs from South Africa on Saturday.They will join eight cheetahs that were flown from Namibia last year. All cheetahs have been released at the Kuno National Park in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.Cheetahs historically roamed central India, the Middle East, and Africa, but their numbers have dwindled in the last decades because of hunting and loss of habitat.The Indian government declared in January 2022 that it would reintroduce cheetahs into the country.An aircraft carrying the 12 cheetahs landed at the Gwalior Air Force base on Saturday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.The big cats were then flown in helicopters to the sprawling Kuno National Park.Delhi signed a deal with South Africa last month to import 12 cats annually for the next eight to 10 years.The cheetah population has severely declined globally, with fewer than 7,000 in the wild today, according to the World Wildlife Fund.The Asiatic cheetah, which once roamed India, is found only in Iran today and is classified as critically endangered.The Indian government said it made its decision to import the big cats from South Africa since it was one of the last remaining cheetah strongholds.Loss of habitat meant that cheetahs were declared wiped out in 1952 in India. They remain the first and the only large carnivore to have died out nationally since India's independence in 1947.India hopes that a reintroduction of the wild cats will conserve the country's threatened grasslands.This report was written in part with material from the Associated Press news agency.Edited by: Sean Sinico",2023/02/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814628,Nagelsmann fury: Bayern Munich lose on Yann Sommer's return,"""Eight-and-a-half years of big performances, not big words – Danke, Yann!"" read the banner on the Nordkurve, the home of Borussia Mönchengladbach's hardcore supporters.Not every departure from Borussia Park prompts such warm words – just ask former Gladbach head coach Marco Rose or sporting director Max Eberl, both of whom were the target of furious criticism recently after leaving the club and ending up, via different routes, at RB Leipzig.But no such fury was aimed at Yann Sommer upon his return to his old stomping ground in the colors of Bayern Munich. The 34-year-old Swiss goalkeeper made 335 appearances in almost a decade between the posts for the Foals, including 20 in the Champions League, earning him legendary status among the Gladbach faithful.""It was really nice and it's not to be taken for granted,"" he said. ""We had eight-and-a-half great years together so it was nice to say goodbye like that. A huge thanks to all the fans, even if I would obviously have preferred to win here.""Indeed, Sommer's former teammates were much less welcoming, taking advantage of an early Dayot Upamecano red card and eventually running out 3-2 winners over Bayern to throw the title race wide open.Gladbach captain Lars Stindl fired his team ahead just moments after the red card and, after Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting had drawn Bayern level at the break, Jonas Hofmann and Marcus Thuram secured the points in the second half, despite a late scare after Mathys Tel's late consolation.For Julian Nagelsmann, however, Upamecano's dismissal for a last-man foul on Alassane Plea remained the turning point, as he made clear at full-time when he stormed ""raging and screaming"" down the tunnel, according to reporters in the mixed zone.""It's an absolute joke, is he kidding me?” he was overheard shouting, referring seemingly to referee Tobias Welz. ""My God, what a soft bunch.""Upamecano had been adjudged to have knocked Plea off balance on the edge of the box with his compatriot clean through on goal, but Nagelsmann saw things differently, arguing that the contact was negligible.""You have to be 100% it's a clear foul before showing a red like that,"" he told Sky. ""In my eyes, there's a minimal touch on the shoulder but he doesn't pull him. Anyone who has played football knows that Plea will be waiting for the contact there but he doesn't get it. You can see that clearly on the replays: Plea doesn't move an inch. He falls due to his loss of balance.""Despite his disagreement with the decision itself, Nagelsmann insisted the real reason for his anger was the failure of Welz to admit a mistake.""You can make any decision, that's fine,"" he said. ""Referees are human, we all make mistakes, even when they check it eight times, which they clearly didn't do here. But then you can also say afterwards: 'Yes ok, maybe that was harsh.'""Because no-one can tell me that was a red, even at that speed, because he doesn't touch him enough. It simply wasn't a red.""But the decision stood and, while Stindl's subsequent free-kick was well saved by Sommer, the Gladbach captain was unmarked moments later to fire home from the resulting corner, taken short by Hofmann.It was Stindl's eighth goal or assist against Bayern in the Bundesliga, while Hofmann's assist plus his later strike put him on ten in that category. Only Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus has been involved in more goals against the perennial champions, with 11.Bayern were on the back foot and Nagelsmann reacted, sacrificing talisman Thomas Müller for Joao Cancelo for more stability in midfield.""It was a lousy decision to have to make,"" he said. ""But we had to decide quickly what to do: we needed as much pace as possible [on the counter-attack] and we needed Choupo-Moting up front for set pieces. There were lots of factors, it didn't necessarily have anything to do with Thomas. He knows we had to make a decision, even if it's a lousy one.""The nature of Bayern's equalizer proved Nagelsmann right, with Alphonso Davies bursting down the left with blistering speed and crossing for a well-positioned Choupo-Moting to stroke home.But Gladbach's advantage in numbers eventually told as Hofmann and Thuram put them in the driving seat, extending their unbeaten run at home to Bayern to four games and throwing the Bundesliga title race wide open.Surprise challengers Union Berlin can leapfrog Bayern to the top of the table on Sunday should they beat struggling Schalke, while Borussia Dortmund can draw level on points with the Bavarians should they beat Hertha Berlin.Then Nagelsmann, Sommer and co will have a real job on their hands.",2023/02/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814630,Flaco the escaped zoo owl can remain in the wilds of NYC,"NEW YORK (AP) — For two weeks, an owl that escaped from New York's Central Park Zoo has flown from treetop to treetop, eluding capture and amassing legions of fans worried about its ability to survive alone in the big city.

            Would Flaco, a majestic Eurasian eagle-owl, go hungry because he hadn't developed an ability to hunt while in captivity?

            With a collective sigh of relief, the answer was a resounding no: It appears Flaco has regained his killer instincts and is becoming an old hand at swooping down from his lofty perch to feed on the park's bounty of rats.











            As a result, Zoo officials announced that they were suspending recovery operations, at least for now, but will keep a close eye on the owl's health. 

            “We are going to continue monitoring Flaco and his activities and to be prepared to resume recovery efforts if he shows any sign of difficulty or distress,"" Zoo officials said in a statement.

            The bird's name in Spanish means “skinny,” and it seemed he was in danger of living up to his name in the early days of his escape because he hadn't been seen eating. But when he started coughing up fur and bones, it sparked excitement — proof that he had been hunting and eating.

            Officials acknowledged that recovering Flaco had proven difficult, especially “since he has been very successful at hunting and consuming the abundant prey in the park.”

            The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the larger owl species, with a wingspan of up to 79 inches (2 meters), according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. They have large talons and distinctive ear tufts.

            Despite evidence that Flaco had been dining on rodents, the task of capturing him went on.

            Most recently, zoo officials tried to lure Flaco with bait and recordings of eagle-owl calls. He showed some interest but didn't fall for the ruse.

            The search for Flaco was launched Feb. 2 after the discovery that vandals had cut stainless steel meshing at the bird's enclosure. 

            Flaco has made his rounds of upper Manhattan but hasn't strayed too far from the park. He flew to the nearby shopping hub of Fifth Avenue, where police officers tried to catch him and failed. He captivated audiences wherever he went, including a visit to the park's skating rink. Twitter has been aflutter with sightings, and the hashtag #freeflaco, as well as an online petition to keep him free, soon took flight.

            “Flaco has been doing well in Central Park. And that’s amazing. He’s made a remarkable move from being a captive owl to being in the wild much faster than anyone would have expected,"" said David Barrett, who runs the birding Twitter accounts Manhattan Bird Alert, Brooklyn Bird Alert and Bronx Bird Alert.

            “He’s catching prey on his own. He continues to fly better and better,” he said. “He seems to be enjoying himself out there.”

            Eurasian eagle-owl's aren't native to North America, so Flaco would have to fly across the ocean to find his own kind in the wild. He was less than a year old when he made his home at the Central Park Zoo in 2010.

            Owls are mostly solitary animals and usually only interact with another animal during breeding season.

            “Is he going to be lonely out there? That's a good question,” said Barrett.NEW YORK (AP) — For two weeks, an owl that escaped from New York's Central Park Zoo has flown from treetop to treetop, eluding capture and amassing legions of fans worried about its ability to survive alone in the big city.Would Flaco, a majestic Eurasian eagle-owl, go hungry because he hadn't developed an ability to hunt while in captivity?With a collective sigh of relief, the answer was a resounding no: It appears Flaco has regained his killer instincts and is becoming an old hand at swooping down from his lofty perch to feed on the park's bounty of rats.As a result, Zoo officials announced that they were suspending recovery operations, at least for now, but will keep a close eye on the owl's health.“We are going to continue monitoring Flaco and his activities and to be prepared to resume recovery efforts if he shows any sign of difficulty or distress,"" Zoo officials said in a statement.The bird's name in Spanish means “skinny,” and it seemed he was in danger of living up to his name in the early days of his escape because he hadn't been seen eating.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814632,Schmeichel saves penalty as Nice draws with Reims 0-0,"PARIS (AP) — Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a penalty as Nice earned a goalless home draw against Reims in the French league on Saturday.

            An intense matchup of in-form teams in the French Riviera city finished with Nice unable to post a fifth consecutive win and Reims unbeaten in 16 straight games.

            Nice remained in seventh place, four points above Reims. 











            The host dominated the first half but created only half-chances as Reims defended well. Neither managed a single shot on target. Reims was the better team after the interval and Schmeichel had to stop an effort from the spot from league top scorer Folarin Balogun to produce a clean sheet.

            Balogun, who has 15 goals, provoked a penalty in the 53rd minute after dribbling past Jean-Clair Todibo, who brought him down in the box. But Balogun was denied by Schmeichel. The forward tried again from the rebound but fluffed his shot as teammate Myziane Maolida also rushed toward the ball and both men got in the way. 

            For his first match in charge, coach Frederic Antonetti led struggling Strasbourg to a 2-1 win against last-placed Angers. Habib Diallo scored twice.

            Antonetti, who had been without a club since leaving Metz last summer, was tasked with keeping Strasbourg in the top-flight. His players delivered a flawed but gritty display to move out of the relegation zone. Midfielder Morgan Sanson orchestrated matters with his new team after joining on loan from Aston Villa. 

            Diallo broke the deadlock in the 13th minute from Eduard Sobol's cross and doubled Strasbourg's lead four minutes before the break with a precise header out of Paul Bernadoni's reach.

            Angers midfielder Nabil Bentaleb pulled one back from the spot in the 73rd, ensuring a suspenseful finale.

            “We needed this win to move out of the red zone,"" Diallo said. “Although our new coach arrived less than a week ago, we worked hard for that.""

            Leader Paris Saint-Germain hosts Lille on Sunday, with second-placed Marseille traveling to Toulouse.

            Chelsea manager Graham Potter said he expected the Spaniard to remain in hospital for at least 24 hours after he was hit in the face by an attempted overhead kick by Southampton opponent Sékou Mara in the 74th minute.

            Azpilicueta was taken off on a stretcher wearing a neck brace and breathing from an oxygen mask after a 10-minute stoppage.











            “Thankfully he’s conscious,” Potter said. “He’s in hospital. He spoke to his wife, I believe. So we’re just obviously monitoring and very concerned for him. . . . It was not a nice thing to see.”

            The 33-year-old Azpilicueta joined Chelsea in 2012 and has helped the club win two Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2021. He was named captain in 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814634,"M's Hernandez loses in arbitration, teams go 13-6 vs players","NEW YORK (AP) — Seattle outfielder Teoscar Hernández was among five players who lost their salary arbitration cases on Saturday and Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe won as teams finished with a 13-6 advantage in decisions.

            Angels infielder Gio Urshela, Tampa Bay relievers Colin Poche and Ryan Thompson and St. Louis reliever Génesis Cabrera also lost their cases.

            Teams won the majority of decisions for the fourth straight year and have a 347-257 record since arbitration began in 1974.











            Hernández, acquired by the Mariners from Toronto in a November trade, will receive $14 million instead of his request for $16 million after a hearing Friday before Mark Burstein, John Woods and Howard Edelman. The previous high for an arbitration case that went to a decision was $13.5 million by pitcher Gerrit Cole in his 2019 win over Houston and by pitcher Max Fried in his loss to Atlanta this year.

            Renfroe will get $11.9 million instead of the Angels' offer of $11.25 million. His hearing before Melinda Gordon, Scott Buchheit and John Stout was the first of the year on Jan. 30 but the decision was held until Hernández's case was decided.

            Urshela gets $8.4 million instead of $10 million after a hearing Wednesday in front of Fredric Horowitz, Jeanne Charles and Stephen Raymond.

            Thompson receives $1 million rather than $1.2 million in a case heard Feb. 6 by Stout, Raymond and Allen Ponak, and Poche gets $1,175,000 instead of $1.3 million followng Feb. 7 arguments before John Woods, Jeanne Vonhof and Walt De Treux, The $125,000 gap between Poche and the Rays was the smallest among the 33 cases at the time of the Jan. 13 exchange of proposed figures.

            Tampa Bay split four decisions, losing earlier to outfielder Harold Ramírez ($2.2 million) and reliever Jason Adam ($1,775,000).

            Cabrera receives $950,000 instead of $1.15 million following a hearing Friday before Jules Bloch, Buchheit and Horowitz.

            The 19 hearings this year were up from 13 last year and the most since 22 in 2018. Hearings were held in person at St. Petersburg, Florida, following two years of Zoom sessions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

            Among the players who swapped figures with their teams on Jan. 13, 14 reached agreements without hearings.

            There were about 200 players eligible for arbitration heading into the week of the exchange. Eleven players wound up with mulityear contracts topped by Houston pitcher Cristian Javier with a five-year deal, and the Mets' Jeff McNeil and Tampa Bay's Jeffrey Springs with four years each.

            Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz and Pete Fairbanks agreed to three-year deals along with Philadelphia's José Alvarado, Toronto's Bo Bichette, Seattle's Dylan Moore and Minnesota's Chris Paddack. The Phillies' Seranthony Domínguez and the Dodgers' Tony Gonsolin got two years each.

            An All-Star in 2021, the 30-year-old Hernández hit .267 with 25 home runs and 77 RBIs in 131 games last season for Toronto, then was traded to Seattle for right-hander reliever Erik Swanson and minor league lefty Adam Macko. 

            Renfroe hit .255 with 29 homers and 72 RBIs for Milwaukee last season, down from a .259 average, 31 homers and 96 RBIs for Boston in 2021. The 31-year-old was acquired by the Angels in November for right-handers Janson Junk and Elvis Peguero, and minor league lefty Adam Seminaris. 

            Urshela, 31, hit .285 with 13 homers and 64 RBIs last season for Minnesota, which traded him to the Angels on Nov. 18 for minor league right-hander Alejandro Hidalgo. Urshela earned $6.55 million.

            Thompson, a 30-year-old right-hander, was 3-3 with a 3.80 ERA in 47 relief appearances last year, striking out 39 and walking 11 in 42 2/3 innings. Poche, a 29-year-old left-hander, had Tommy John surgery on July 29, 2020, and returned to the major leagues last April 22 after six appearances at Triple-A Durham. Poche was 4-2 with a 3.99 ERA and seven saves in 65 relief appearances for the Rays. He struck out 64 and walked 22 in 58 2/3 innings.

            Cabrera, a 26-year-old left-hander, went 4-2 with a 4.63 ERA in 39 relief appearances.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814635,Kennedy Airport fixes power outage that canceled flights,"NEW YORK (AP) — Work crews have fixed a power outage at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport that forced some flights to be canceled or diverted, officials said Saturday.

            Repairs were made overnight and full power was restored in Terminal 1, which handles some of the airport's international flights, said the airport's operator, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

            The outage began Thursday when an electrical panel failure caused a small fire, authorities said. Dozens of flights were canceled and some were diverted to other airports.  An Air New Zealand flight was forced to return to Auckland after flying two-thirds of the way across the Pacific Ocean, resulting in a 16-hour trip that ended where it began.











            “I thought it was a bad Ambien dream,” said passenger Rosemary Armao, an adjunct journalism professor who was sleeping when her friend awoke her to say the plane was heading back to Auckland.

            Although full power was restored to Terminal 1, flight activity was limited Saturday morning, the Port Authority said. Terminal 1 was open for 26 of the scheduled 64 arrivals and departures originally scheduled for Saturday, while 18 flights were to be handled at other terminals and 10 were canceled, officials said.

            “Concessions will be operating with reduced menu options as activity resumes in Terminal 1 and the private terminal operator will have additional customer service staff in place to assist passengers,” the Port Authority said in a statement.

            “Customers are encouraged to continue to check with their carriers for the latest flight information. All other terminals at JFK are operating normally,” it said.

            Officials said safety and security systems were fully functional and other building systems were being tested and brought back online.NEW YORK (AP) — Work crews have fixed a power outage at New York's John F.

            Even action sports star Travis Pastrana, who has little experience at Daytona International Speedway, sat out the 50-minute session Saturday. He is driving a third car for 23XI Racing, the team co-owned by Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan.

            “I feel like I have the best Toyota here,” Pastrana said confidently. “I'm just so so proud, stoked, for this team and for them giving me this amazing hot rod.”











            Sixteen of 40 cars did get in a final practice, but not pole-sitter Alex Bowman or his fellow Hendrick Motorsports teammates Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott and William Byron.

            Brad Keselowski topped the speed chart in his No. 6 Ford, reaching 191.201 mph during his 14-lap stint. Joey Logano was second, followed by Ryan Blaney, Ryan Preece and Harrison Burton. Ford drivers claimed the top six spots.

            AJ Allmendinger was the quickest Chevrolet in seventh. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, fastest in practice Friday, turned just three laps and was 15th.

            Balancing risk versus reward, the majority of the garage played it safe.

            The 39-year-old Pastrana felt like he got enough educational seat time during the rain-shortened truck race Friday night. Pastrana finished 13th in his first race at Daytona in a decade.

            He said his heart rate reached 182 beats per minute.

            “Just under heart-attack level. It’s great,” he quipped. “I got to figure out a little bit on how to dip, dodge and dive (during wrecks). We’ll need a little bit of luck, but this car, this 67, it is locked in.”

            Pastrana will start next to Johnson on the last row. 

            “Hopefully we won’t be a danger out there and people can start trusting me,"" he said. ""If it works like the truck, by the halfway point, we should have some friends.”

            He’s already noticed one issue: Some of the field has been hesitant to work with drivers who have yellow stripes designating Daytona 500 rookies on their rear bumpers. Pastrana, IndyCar regular Conor Daly, Riley Herbst and Zane Smith are making their 500 debuts.

            “Yeah, I want to get in there, I want to mix it up, I want to run three-wide with every driver in there who’s a hero of mine,” Pastrana said. “This is pretty awesome. But Conor, he's like, ‘Man, people are avoiding me like the plague.’

            ""All us guys with yellow stickers on the back, we’re going to have to really start working with each other if we want a chance to get up there. There’s a couple of great cars back there, but they’re going to try to get rid of us as fast as they can.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814638,Israelis protest judicial overhaul plans for 7th week,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis marched Saturday in several cities against judicial overhaul plans proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

            The demonstration took place in the central city of Tel Aviv, part of a weekly protest campaign that has kicked off since Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced the proposed changes in early January.

            Netanyahu and his supporters, members of the most religious, right-wing government in the country’s history, say the changes are needed to rein in a judiciary that wields too much power.











            But critics, who include large sectors of Israeli society, say the overhauls would weaken Israel’s Supreme Court and damage the country’s fragile system of democratic checks and balances. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, is motivated by a personal grudge against the legal system and has a deep conflict of interest. Netanyahu has said he is a victim of a witch hunt.

They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, is motivated by a personal grudge against the legal system and has a deep conflict of interest. Netanyahu has said he is a victim of a witch hunt.In Tel Aviv, protesters raised large Israeli flags and held banners reading “Bibi (Netanyahu) everything has its end.” Other posters read “Freedom, Justice, Peace” and “Rotten Banana Republic.”“This legislation is unacceptable, said Ret.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814639,Poland's president hails significance of upcoming Biden trip,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s president said Saturday that he thinks a two-day visit by U.S. President Joe Biden to mark the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will produce developments of global significance. 

            Biden is set to arrive in Warsaw on Tuesday. During the trip, he plans to hold talks with the leaders of NATO's nine eastern flank nations and to give a speech on “how the United States has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine,” according to the White House. 

            “I have no doubt that the visit of President (Joe) Biden in Poland and his address in Warsaw will be of world dimension,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. 











            Poland’s leaders are stressing it will be Biden’s second visit in less that a year to Poland, a country offering Kyiv substantial military and humanitarian support. 

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also was in Munich on Saturday, said Biden “will make a very significant speech in Poland next week.”

            “I think it’s safe to say that as well, that he’s likely to talk about the road that we’ve traveled together over the last year, where we are today and, as I said, our enduring commitment to Ukraine’s success, which is all of our success,” Blinken said.

            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he thinks Biden’s address will be “far more significant and consequential” than the state of the nation address Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to give Tuesday to the Federal Assembly, Russia's national legislature. 

            Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Stiff Ukrainian resistance and supplies of Western weapons have forced Moscow to scale back its military goals. But the diplomatic consequences of the yearlong war have reverberated worldwide.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814640,DeGrom delay shows potential peril for new Rangers pitchers,"The continued delay of Jacob deGrom's debut at spring training shows the potentially perilous situation the Texas Rangers could have with the veteran starting pitchers they added during the offseason. 

            Two-time National League Cy Young Award winner deGrom, former All-Star right-handers Nathan Eovaldi and Jake Odorizzi, and left-handers Andrew Heaney and Danny Duffy have more than 1,000 combined big league starts among them. Each is in his 30s and going into at least his 10th season in the majors.

            Except none of them pitched a full season for their former teams in 2022. 











            Their biggest offseason acquisition was deGrom, who was limited to 156 1/3 innings over 26 starts the past two seasons for the New York Mets. After throwing off the mound a half-dozen times before getting to Arizona, the right-hander, who signed a $185 million, five-year contract in December, mentioned to Rangers officials before the first scheduled workout Wednesday that he felt some tightness in his left side. 

            “I did a lot of throwing, more than normal just to get in a good spot,” deGrom said. “And then, you know, I was very aggravated with something little like this too pop up. But I think the bright side is how good my arm feels and where my stuff was at throwing off the mound at home.”

            Manager Bruce Bochy said he expected deGrom to throw “real soon,"" but not Saturday. The Rangers have described holding out deGrom as precautionary, and not unusual. Especially the day of the first official workout with unseasonably cold temperatures in Arizona and rain-slicked fields that curtailed the planned activities of other pitchers as well. 

            The Rangers, after their sixth consecutive losing season, started the offseason by acquiring Odorizzi in a trade from Atlanta before retaining All-Star left-hander Martin Pérez on a $19.65 million qualifying offer. 

            Then came the signing of deGrom even before baseball's winter meetings, and the additions of Heaney and Eovaldi on multiyear deals later in December. Duffy, who never pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers last year while recovering from left elbow surgery, is in camp as a non-roster invitee. 

            “It’s exciting. I think everybody should be excited. I know I am,” catcher Jonah Heim said about the pitching additions before going to spring training. “It’s going to be a great staff. If everybody can stay healthy, we’re going to have a great year.”

            That certainly is the key. 

            “Ultimately we have targets in mind, in terms of opening day being a significant one. And then obviously, wanting these guys healthy in October as well, and finishing strong,” said general manager Chris Young, a former big league pitcher. “We need to have these guys over the duration of the season and if we’re going to get to where we want to go, our hope is to be playing baseball in October.”

            
                There were nearly 13 months between big league appearances for deGrom before he went 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 starts after his '22 season debut on Aug. 2. He had a career-low 1.08 ERA over 92 innings in 2021 before missing the final three months with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, then was shut down late in spring training last year because of a stress reaction in his right scapula.

            Eovaldi ($34 million, two-year deal with vesting option for 2025) had an AL-high 32 starts for Boston in 2021, and the Texas native was 6-3 with a 3.87 ERA while limited to 20 starts last year because of shoulder and leg injuries. Heaney ($25 million, two-year deal) was 4-4 with a 3.10 ERA in 16 games for the Dodgers while dealing with a pair of shoulder injuries. Odorizzi had 22 starts combined for Atlanta and Houston in a season interrupted by a leg injury. 

            Pérez, who rejoined Texas at the start of spring training last year, was 12-8 with a 2.89 ERA in 32 starts. Young right-hander Dane Dunning made 29 starts, but had arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip at the end of last season. 

            Jon Gray got a $56 million, four-year deal from the Rangers at the same time they signed infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien to long-term deals worth a combined value of $500 million before the lockout that preceded last season. Gray was 7-7 with a 3.96 ERA, but had three IL stints. 

            “We have a lot of new faces and hopefully, you know, the bigger thing is stay healthy all year. That’s one of our goals,” Pérez said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814641,"Sheriff: Gunman fatally shot, 2 wounded near barn fire","BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Florida sheriff's deputies opened fire, fatally shooting an armed man who had wounded two people and set fire to a barn before barricading himself inside a house, authorities said Saturday.

            The dead gunman was identified as 64-year-old Steve John Roosa, the Hernando County Sheriff's Office said in a news release. The deputies involved in the shooting were members of the agency's SWAT team but were not identified by name.

            According to the sheriff's office, deputies and firefighters were originally called to a residence Friday afternoon near Brooksville by neighbors who saw smoke from a fire in a barn at the rear of the property. Soon, more 911 calls came in reporting that someone was firing shots at the property and that two people had been struck.











            One victim, a female, was able to get away from the home on her own and into a waiting ambulance. The second victim, a male, was lying on the property but deputies were unable to immediately get to him because Roosa was continuing to fire shots. Eventually the man was rescued and taken to a hospital.

            Meanwhile, the sheriff's office said Roosa barricaded himself in the house and refused all communication. The SWAT team ultimately “breached the residence and deployed chemical agents,” the news release said. Roosa came out the front door — still armed — and deputies opened fire, fatally shooting him.

            The female victim was treated and released at a local hospital. The male victim was hospitalized Saturday in critical condition, the sheriff's office said. Their identities were not made public, nor their relationship if any to Roosa. No deputies were injured.

            The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the circumstances of the shooting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814642,PSL cricket to continue despite deadly attack in Karachi,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — The Pakistan Super League will continue in Karachi after militants launched a deadly suicide attack on the police headquarters, cricket authorities said on Saturday.

            The attack which killed three security personnel and a civilian on Friday in the port city was “an isolated one which was unrelated to cricket,” Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi said.

            The PCB has been ""working very closely with all stakeholders, including the local and foreign security experts, who have provided assurances and comfort that the event can proceed as there was no threat to cricket.”











            On Saturday, New Zealander Martin Guptill hit his maiden century in the PSL as the Quetta Gladiators handed the Karachi Kings their third successive home defeat despite Shoaib Malik’s onslaught.

            Guptill’s sensational 117 off 67 balls lifted Quetta to 168-7 from trouble at 23-4. Karachi left-arm spinner Imad Wasim provided a perfect start with a double-wicket maiden first over.

            Karachi also collapsed to 35-3 within the batting powerplay before Malik hit a belligerent unbeaten 71 off 49 balls. But it was all in vain and the home team ended up at 162-5 to lose by six runs.

            Imad started the match by trapping England's Jason Roy off his second ball and had rookie Abdul Banglazai stumped off the fifth ball.

            Pakistan discard Umar Akmal went for a reckless shot in Imad’s second over and was clean bowled, and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed left Quetta in disarray when he was brilliant caught by Irfan Khan at short mid-wicket.

            Guptill rebuilt the innings, raising his half-century in 44 balls and sprinting to his hundred off the next 19 deliveries. He was caught on the long off boundary in the final over.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814643,No. 7 Virginia slips past Irish 57-55 with Clark's late FTs,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Kihei Clark's fifth season at Virginia has been one of breaking numerous records, and a few opponents' hearts, too.

            Clark scored 15 points, including a pair of critical free throws with 22.6 seconds left, and added Virginia's career assist record to his resume in the No. 7 Cavaliers' 57-55 victory over Notre Dame on Saturday. 

            After the Fighting Irish closed to 55-54, Clark converted both ends of a one-and-one. Trey Wertz made the front end of a one-and-one with 3.9 seconds left for the Fighting Irish, but missed the second after a timeout. The ball was tipped out to Dane Goodwin for a potential game-winning 3-pointer, but his wide-open shot bounced off the rim.











            “We couldn't ask for a better look,” said Notre Dame coach Mike Brey, who is stepping down after this season. Then he, like several other coaches have this season, bid Clark a hopeful farewell.

            “I really don’t want to see him anymore,"" Brey said. “He is the ultimate winner, man. I said, you are a big-time winner, man,”

            Clark, who broke John Crotty's school assist record when he fed Jayden Garden for a short jumper with 17:52 left, downplayed the mark, just the latest he's established this season. 

            “I think being a point guard, I think this is something to do with, you know, being in that position, but it’s a team award,"" Clark said, ""... the guys make a lot of shots and I give the credit to them.”

            Armaan Franklin added 12 points and Reece Beekman had 11 for Virginia (21-4, 13-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who assured themselves at least a share of first place in the conference pending a game between Virginia Tech and co-leader Pittsburgh later Saturday.

            Virginia shot just 36.5% (19-52), but made Notre Dame the 40th consecutive ACC school to fail to score 70 points at John Paul Jones Arena.

            Nate Laszewski led Notre Dame (10-17, 2-14) with 18 points and Goodwin had 12, including a pair of 3-pointers. The Fighting Irish are now 0-10 away from home this season.

            Notre Dame scored the first six points after halftime to take a 31-29 lead. Jayden Gardner later hit a short jumper and Reece Beekman followed with a 3-pointer, sparking a 13-5 run to put the Cavaliers ahead 53-45. The Irish closed to within three twice in the closing minutes. 

            The Cavaliers used a 10-2 run over a span of 8 1/2 minutes to open a 27-18 lead, but the Irish outscored them 7-2 to finish the half trailing 29-25. 

            A TRIBUTE, WITH WHISKEY

            Virginia coach Tony Bennett said he wanted to say something to honor Brey's 23 years at Notre Dame on the PA system, but the coach declined. Instead, the school gave him a bottle of Irish whiskey.

            “I'm going to try it tonight, I can tell you that,” Brey said.

            Bennett and Brey had a lengthy chat before the game.

            “I really appreciate Coach Brey and all he’s done for the game and whatever his future holds, he’s a good man,"" Bennett said. “And so I want to acknowledge that because it’s hard to last in this game.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Note Dame: The Irish arrived averaging just 8.8 turnovers but had six by halftime and came precariously close to numerous shot clock violations, which resulted in desperation shots. The Cavaliers did force a shot clock violation after halftime, their 17th at home this season.

            Virginia: Clark's third of four assists was his 684th, moving him past Crotty (1988-91), who attended the game. He is the program's career leader in wins, ACC wins, minutes and games — and also now the leader in starts with his 133rd, passing London Perrantes (2014-17).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814644,Man recounts home assault amid 6 fatal Mississippi shootings,"ARKABUTLA, Miss. (AP) — A gunman authorities say killed six people in Mississippi busted into his ex-wife's home and smashed her boyfriend in the head with the butt of a gun before shooting her in the head, her boyfriend told The Associated Press on Saturday. 

            The fatal shooting of 60-year-old Debra Crum in the home she shared with boyfriend George Drane in Coldwater, in rural northern Mississippi, came a little more than four years after her divorce from the man authorities identified as the shooter, Richard Dale Crum, 52, also from Coldwater. Drane said the murder of his girlfriend — whom he often called his wife — “didn't seem real” as he lay on the ground of their home, bleeding and dazed.

            Drane said Richard Crum had come straight from a convenience store in nearby Arkabutla, Mississippi, where, according to Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance, Crum had shot Chris Eugene Boyce, who was sitting in the driver' seat of a pickup outside. The sheriff said deputies arrested Crum at his home after the shooting of his ex-wife and then found the bodies of two fatally shot handymen outside, as well as the bodies of his stepfather and the stepfather's sister inside a neighboring home. 











            Drane hadn't seen Richard Crum in years before he broke or kicked down the door of the home he shared with Debra Crum, he said Saturday outside the same convenience store where the previous shooting occurred. Drane, 64, wore a bandage on his head and over his left ear and said that when Crum left the convenience store, he came straight to Drane's house, ran up to the porch and busted in. The shooter was armed with a shotgun and two handguns, authorities said. 

            Drane said he fought with Crum, got smashed in the head, and Crum fired at his ex-wife, after telling Drane not to make noise or move or he would be killed as well. Drane said Crum went outside to get a second shell. 

            “I couldn't get up to do anything,” Drane said. “He reloaded, come back in the house, and shot her at point-blank range in the head, killing her instantly. Right between the living room and the kitchen.""

            Investigators still were looking for clues Saturday for what motivated the rampage in Arkabutla, a town of 285 people about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Memphis. 

            “Without being able to say what triggered this, that’s the scary part,” Lance said in an interview Friday.

            The U.S. has seen a deadly start to 2023, including six mass killings in a three-week period in January, according to an Associated Press/USA Today database. It defines a mass killing as four or more people dead, not including the perpetrator.

            There have also been a number of mass shootings in which fewer people were slain, such as Monday’s shooting at Michigan State University in which three people were killed and five were wounded.

            Crum was jailed on a single charge of capital murder over the first killing outside the convenience store, of Boyce, 59, of Lakeland, Florida. Boyce’s brother was in the truck with him at the time and fled, according to the sheriff. Lance added that Crum chased the brother through a wooded area before he escaped unharmed. 

            Besides Crum's ex-wife, authorities identified the others killed as Charles Manuel, 76; John Rorie, 59; George McCain, 73; and Lynda McCain, 78. Drane said he didn't know about the first shooting when Crum burst into his home.

            Ashley McKinney, a 38-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee, dated Debra Crum’s son, Sid Furniss, when the two were teens and recalled when Debra Crum started dating Richard Dale Crum. At first all was well, but then signs of Richard Dale Crum’s mental illness became apparent, with him suddenly imitating the moves of Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan. Sometimes he even had swords.

            “He ain’t never been right,” said McKinney, who has remained friends with the family. 

            She said Debra Crum was hopeful that the psychiatric facilities could fix him. But eventually she grew uncomfortable working her overnight shifts at the Waffle House restaurant alone, unsure what Richard Dale Crum would do, and asked McKinney to keep her company.

            She said that Richard Dale Crum largely worked odd jobs, like cutting firewood. McKinney said he told Debra Crum that when he qualified for disability that he would leave her. And that is exactly what happened, said McKinney.

            Online court records show that Debra Crum filed for divorce in Tate County in September 2018, and a judge granted one a little more than two months later. A case summary listed the grounds as irreconcilable differences, but her complaint and the property settlement agreement were not available online Saturday. 

            Drane said the two had been separated for five or six years before they divorced. Drane said she had a stroke in October and the two of them had been at a physical therapy session Friday morning. Drane said she also had a daughter living nearby.

            Drane said he hadn’t seen Crum in seven or eight years.

            “I thought it was a random act. I don’t know about the rest of it,” Drane said. “He left us alone. We left him alone.”

            Crum and his stepfather lived on 7 wooded acres of land owned by the stepfather on the west side of Arkabutla Lake, north of Arkabutla, which has 285 residents. The Rev. Dr. J.Q. Wooten Sr., pastor of the nearby Ella Green Missionary Baptist Church, said he shook hands with Crum two weeks ago after a conversation, and “I never would thought that I was shaking hands with a murderer.” 

            Wooten said McCain, the stepfather, would watch for problems with the church building or grounds so that they could be fixed. He said Crum was nice but “seemed a little weird” because at least once every couple of months, he'd spend hour sitting in his black SUV, listening to country music.

            “It’s beyond explanation or imagination,” he said of the shootings.

            In the lobby of the Sheriff’s Office, Norma Washington told The Associated Press that Boyce was her nephew. She said he and the brother, Doug, who lives in Alaska, had been in town cleaning up a property they inherited from their deceased uncle.

            It was unclear whether Crum knew either of the brothers.

            The sheriff, who has lived in the area his entire life and served in law enforcement for 25 years, said he could recall no prior problems with Crum.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814645,Milan resurgence continues with win at Berlusconi's Monza,"MILAN (AP) — Resurgent AC Milan won at Silvio Berlusconi’s Monza 1-0 and moved back into Serie A's Champions League qualifying spots on Saturday.

            Junior Messias scored the only goal of the derby to help Milan to its third straight victory.

            The Rossoneri appear to have turned things around after a terrible start to the year. They moved into third, three points behind second-placed Inter Milan after the Nerazzurri beat Udinese 3-1.











            Runaway leader Napoli was 15 points clear.

            Monza’s first league loss in 2023 upended the last unbeaten team in Serie A this year.

            It was a special match as Berlusconi, along with Monza CEO Adriano Galliani, oversaw 29 trophies in 31 years at Milan before selling the club in 2017. He bought Monza the following year and took the club from the third division to its first appearance in Serie A this season.

            “Playing Milan here at Monza is a dream come true,” Galliani said. “Playing with Milan in the same league is incredible, both for me and for President Berlusconi. 

            “There are incredible emotions that I’m struggling to put into words . . . this match was amazing and what we are doing so far is amazing.”

            Monza started aggressively and Milan goalkeeper Ciprian Tătărușanu had to make two saves in the opening 72 seconds.

            But those were to be Monza’s only attempts on goal in the half.

            Home goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio was by far the busier goalkeeper and kept Milan at bay until the 31st minute. Matteo Pessina tried to head clear a cross but it fell to Messias, who controlled it before firing into the right side of the net.

            Monza almost leveled in the 73rd but Patrick Ciurria’s shot bounced off the right upright, hit Tătărușanu on the back and ricocheted off the post again.

            The 41-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimović was on the bench for a second straight Serie A match but he will have to wait longer for his first appearance since knee surgery last May.

            LUKAKU GOAL

            Romelu Lukaku converted a penalty at the second time of asking for his first Serie A goal in six months.

            Lukaku, who has struggled with poor form and injury, saw a weak penalty saved by Udinese goalkeeper Marco Silvestri but it had to be retaken for encroachment and the Inter forward drove his second attempt into the bottom right corner.

            It was Lukaku’s first league goal since August. He also scored in a Champions League group stage match in October, against Viktoria Plzen.

            Sandi Lovrić leveled on the stroke of halftime but Henrikh Mkhitaryan restored Inter's lead in the 73rd minute, following a counterattack, and substitute Lautaro Martínez sealed the match in the final minute.

            It was a much changed Inter side, just four days before it hosts Porto in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.

            WAIT ENDED

            Sampdoria’s lengthy wait for a home goal ended but a missed penalty and a late winner saw it lose to Bologna 2-1.

            Substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri converted a penalty with practically his first kick of the match in the 68th for Samp’s first home goal in the league since September.

            But Bologna goalkeeper Łukasz Skorupski saved Sabiri’s second penalty attempt three minutes later.

            Roberto Soriano gave Bologna a first-half lead and Riccardo Orsolini snatched all three points in the final minute.

            Samp remained eight points from safety while Bologna moved into the Europa Conference League qualifying spot.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814647,Liverpool beats 10-man Newcastle to boost EPL top-4 hopes,"NEWCASTLE, England (AP) — Liverpool won at 10-man Newcastle 2-0 and boosted its push for a top-four finish in the English Premier League on Saturday.

            The result ended Newcastle's 17-game unbeaten streak in the league and handed Eddie Howe's team just a second loss of the season — both of them against Liverpool. 

            A rampant Liverpool was already two goals up by the time Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope was sent off in the 22nd minute for a straight red card after handling the ball outside the area. That made the rest of the game largely a matter of seeing things out for the visitors, who cut the gap to fourth-placed Newcastle to six points and have a game in hand to boot.











            Darwin Nunez opened the scoring with an emphatic finish in the 10th minute after Trent Alexander-Arnold sent a ball over the top of the defense to the Uruguayan forward, who managed to control it with the help of his chest before firing past Pope.

            Mohamed Salah then picked out Gakpo in the area with a delicate chip seven minutes later and the Netherlands international finished clinically to double the lead. Gakpo, who joined from PSV Eindhoven in January, netted his first Liverpool goal on Monday in the 2-0 win over Everton. 

            Matters only got worse for Newcastle when Pope rushed out to meet a kick up the field by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker and attempted a diving header to prevent Salah from coming clear on goal. Pope made a total mess of his attempt, though, and then grabbed the ball with his hand in what looked like an inadvertent reflex.

            Going a man down seemed to galvanize Newcastle and Allan Saint-Maximin managed to force a good save from Alisson in the 31st.

            Liverpool missed chances to increase the lead in the second half. 

            The visitors passed their way through the Newcastle defense in the 75th to give Andy Robertson a chance but he opted to square the ball back toward Salah, whose pass was off target.

            Salah tried to tee up Alexander-Arnold after a quick counter in the 80th, but that pass was deflected for a corner. The Egyptian went for goal himself a minute later but shot only tamely at substitute goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. 

            Newcastle had its best chance to get back in the game when Anthony Gordon led a counterattack and fed Callum Wilson, whose low shot was saved by Alisson. 

            Pope's red card means he will be suspended for the League Cup final against Manchester United next weekend, while Joelinton also went off with an apparent hamstring problem. 

            A moment of silence was held before the game for former Newcastle forward Christian Atsu, who died in the earthquake in Turkey at the age of 31.

            Liverpool center back Virgil van Dijk made his return after sitting out for nearly six weeks with a hamstring injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814649,Hawkins leads No. 20 UConn over Seton Hall 64-55,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — UConn's outside shots weren't falling on Saturday, so the Huskies went to the rim.

            Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points, despite going 3 for 11 from behind the arc, and No. 20 UConn used seven dunks and a big second-half run to beat Seton Hall 64-55 on Saturday.

            Andre Jackson had a career high 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for UConn (20-7, 9-7 Big East), which has won four of their last five games after losing five of their previous seven.











            “It kind of felt like how we were at the beginning of the season,” Jackson said, referring to the team's 14-0 start. “Just playing off one another, playing in transition, getting stops and pushing the pace. It was a lot of fun. I think we played with a lot of joy.""

            Al-Amir Dawes and Tyrese Samuel each had 16 points for Seton Hall (16-12, 9-8), which trailed by 16 points with six minutes to play, before a late run that fell short.

            “We've lost these types of ugly, kind of mud-fight type of games, physical, choppy types of games,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “We knew we had a team coming in here that was kind of in that bubble range and we knew we'd get a great effort from them. So, I'm thrilled to win.”

            UConn led by six points at halftime and just 36-34 after a 7-0 Seton Hall run early in the second half. The Pirates kept the Huskies without a field goal for a span of almost nine minutes, stretching back into the first half.

            But UConn responded by holding Seton Hall without a point for over 6 1/2minutes. A 3-pointer from Hawkins that capped a 14-0 run put the Huskies up 56-40.

            Seton Hall made a run to cut the lead to six points twice, but could get no closer.

            UConn led the game for all but two minutes and that came early in the first half.

            A driving dunk by Hawkins gave the Huskies their first double-digit lead at 30-19. But UConn missed its final eight shots of the half.

            Seton Hall's Kadary Richmond, who scored 18 points in the Pirates January win over the Huskies, left the game early in the first half with an apparent back injury.

            Seton Hall declined to make its players or coach Shaheen Holloway available to the media after the game. But Holloway, in his post-game radio interview on Learfield, said the injury did have an impact on his team's performance.

            “I thought once we got our rhythm back in the second half, it kind of helped us, but I thought the first half, once Kadary went down, our rhythm, it just wasn't there,” he said.

            KC Ndefo kept Seton Hall in the game, scoring all 13 of his points in the first half, while hitting five of his first six shots. But he took just three shots in the second half, missing all of them.

            KEY STATS

            Fifty-two of UConn’s points came from two-point range or the foul line (16 of 22). The Huskies were 4 of 22 from 3-point range. Seton Hall had just two 3-point baskets on 11 attempts.

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: The Huskies jumped a half-game ahead of Seton Hall and into fifth place in the Big East standings. The top five teams in the league will get byes into the the quarterfinals of the conference tournament next month. ... The Huskies secured their second straight 20-win season after a five-year drought.

            “I think we're in a good spot to create the momentum in the last four (games),” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. 

            Seton Hall: The Pirates, who beat UConn 67-66 in New Jersey last month, have not swept a season series from UConn since 1992-93. Seton Hall will have a hard time cracking the top-tier of the conference.

(AP) — UConn's outside shots weren't falling on Saturday, so the Huskies went to the rim.Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points, despite going 3 for 11 from behind the arc, and No. 20 UConn used seven dunks and a big second-half run to beat Seton Hall 64-55 on Saturday.Andre Jackson had a career high 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for UConn (20-7, 9-7 Big East), which has won four of their last five games after losing five of their previous seven.“It kind of felt like how we were at the beginning of the season,” Jackson said, referring to the team's 14-0 start. “Just playing off one another, playing in transition, getting stops and pushing the pace. It was a lot of fun. I think we played with a lot of joy.""Al-Amir Dawes and Tyrese Samuel each had 16 points for Seton Hall (16-12, 9-8), which trailed by 16 points with six minutes to play, before a late run that fell short.“We've lost these types of ugly, kind of mud-fight type of games, physical, choppy types of games,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “We knew we had a team coming in here that was kind of in that bubble range and we knew we'd get a great effort from them. So, I'm thrilled to win.”UConn led by six points at halftime and just 36-34 after a 7-0 Seton Hall run early in the second half. The Pirates kept the Huskies without a field goal for a span of almost nine minutes, stretching back into the first half.But UConn responded by holding Seton Hall without a point for over 6 1/2minutes. A 3-pointer from Hawkins that capped a 14-0 run put the Huskies up 56-40.Seton Hall made a run to cut the lead to six points twice, but could get no closer.UConn led the game for all but two minutes and that came early in the first half.A driving dunk by Hawkins gave the Huskies their first double-digit lead at 30-19. But UConn missed its final eight shots of the half.Seton Hall's Kadary Richmond, who scored 18 points in the Pirates January win over the Huskies, left the game early in the first half with an apparent back injury.Seton Hall declined to make its players or coach Shaheen Holloway available to the media after the game. But Holloway, in his post-game radio interview on Learfield, said the injury did have an impact on his team's performance.“I thought once we got our rhythm back in the second half, it kind of helped us, but I thought the first half, once Kadary went down, our rhythm, it just wasn't there,” he said.KC Ndefo kept Seton Hall in the game, scoring all 13 of his points in the first half, while hitting five of his first six shots. But he took just three shots in the second half, missing all of them.KEY STATSFifty-two of UConn’s points came from two-point range or the foul line (16 of 22). The Huskies were 4 of 22 from 3-point range. Seton Hall had just two 3-point baskets on 11 attempts.BIG PICTUREUConn: The Huskies jumped a half-game ahead of Seton Hall and into fifth place in the Big East standings. The top five teams in the league will get byes into the the quarterfinals of the conference tournament next month. ... The Huskies secured their second straight 20-win season after a five-year drought.“I think we're in a good spot to create the momentum in the last four (games),” UConn coach Dan Hurley said.Seton Hall: The Pirates, who beat UConn 67-66 in New Jersey last month, have not swept a season series from UConn since 1992-93.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814650,"Jackson-Davis scores 26, leads No. 14 Indiana past Illinois","BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Trayce Jackson-Davis quickly caught and surpassed his coach on Indiana's career scoring list Saturday. It took the senior more time to help the No. 14 Hoosiers surpass Illinois.

            Jackson-Davis finished with 26 points, 12 rebounds, five blocks and added yet another milestone to his expansive list, while Jalen Hood-Schifino made the go-ahead free throws with 30.7 seconds left to finally give Indiana the lead and a 71-68 victory.

            “It's an accomplishment,"" Jackson-Davis said. “I'm just glad we found a way to get that one. They were without one of their best players and those dudes showed a lot of heart. So just finding a way down the stretch and getting stops, that was big for us.”











            Jackson-Davis and the Hoosiers (19-8, 10-6 Big Ten) have won nine of their last 11 and 15 in a row on their home court. And thanks to the last of Hood-Schifino's 13 points and Jackson-Davis' final basket — a breakaway dunk in the waning seconds — Indiana had just enough to erase a nine-point deficit over the final 12 1/2 minutes.

            Illinois guard Jayden Epps could have tied it with 16.7 seconds left but missed the first of two free throws. RJ Melendez could have forced overtime with a 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it was off the mark.

            And while Jackson-Davis could have celebrated after finishing the game with 2,081 points — 20 more than Hoosiers coach Mike Woodson scored during his college career — it was the second-year coach who seemed most appreciative of the feat.

            “I’ve been sitting in that spot for a long time, and for him to surpass it, man, it’s special,” Woodson said. “But he can’t stop there. It’s just points. He’s still staring at two things, a Big Ten title and a national title, and that’s where I’m trying to get him.”

            The latest win should help Indiana's case. At halftime, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee announced it had projected Indiana as the overall No. 13 seed. 

            
                Matthew Mayer and the Fighting Illini (17-9, 8-7) certainly had other plans — even with their top scorer, Terrence Shannon, in the concussion protocol. Mayer scored 16 of his 24 points and made all four of his 3-pointers in the first half. Epps added 12 points.

            Illinois led from the moment it took a 25-23 lead midway through the first half until Hood-Schifino's free throws in the game's final minute. The Illini were up 48-39 with 12:41 to play when Miller Kopp made a 3-pointer, Jackson-Davis answered with back-to-back baskets and a three-point play and eventually tied the score at 56 on a layup with 6:27 to go. 

            “It was a great college basketball game,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. “I thought we did a great job on Trayce and he still had 26 points. I know what Mike is feeling when you've got one of the best players in the country, if not the best player in country.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Illinois: Underwood's team has won more road games than any other Big Ten school during the past four seasons. This year, though, the calculation has been simple. If they give up fewer than 70 points in league play, they win. If they give up 70 or more, they lose. It barely happened again Saturday.

            Indiana: The Hoosiers have been unbeatable at home this season and weren't about to let their longshot chance of winning a conference crown slip away here. If Indiana replicates its second-half performance next week on the road, it could meet those lofty preseason expectations.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Even though Indiana's rally came up short at Northwestern on Wednesday, the Hoosiers shouldn't lose much — if any ground — in the rankings after sweeping Illinois this season.

            NEXT MOVE

            Jackson-Davis, the first Indiana player to top 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, told Stadium's Jeff Goodman that he will leave school after this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814651,Omoruyi's late block preserves Rutgers win over Wisconsin,"MADISON, Wisc. (AP) — Cam Spencer scored 22 points and Clifford Omoruyi's block of a shot attempt as time expired helped send Rutgers to a 58-57 win over Wisconsin on Saturday.

            The Scarlet Knights (17-10, 9-7 Big Ten) snapped a season-high, three-game losing streak.

            In the frantic last 11.3 seconds following a Badgers timeout, Connor Essegian missed a runner in the lane and the ball got batted to Wisconsin's Max Klesmit. Klesmit got cut off on a drive attempt at the right elbow, pivoted and threw to an open Essegian before Omoruyi sprinted, closed out and deflected Essegian's shot attempt.











            Aundre Hyatt threw down a dunk with 1:08 left to give Rutgers the lead. Wisconsin (15-11, 7-9) missed its final four shot attempts.

            Rutgers was absent Caleb McConnell (9.7 points per game, 2.5 steals per game) due to back spasms during pre-game warmup.

            Omoruyi scored 12 points and had eight rebounds and Hyatt grabbed nine rebounds.

            Klesmit scored 11 points and Steven Crowl grabbed 11 rebounds for Wisconsin. Badgers' leading scorer Chucky Hepburn (12.7 ppg) got into foul trouble early and never found an offensive rhythm scoring just six points on 2-for-7 shooting. Essegian (11.8 ppg) scored his only two points from the foul line and missed all 10 of his shot attempts.

            Rutgers hosts Michigan on Thursday. Wisconsin hosts Iowa on Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814652,Texas Tech beats Mountaineers on road for third straight win,"MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) — Jaylon Tyson had a career-high 27 points and Fardaws Aimaq scored Texas Tech's last eight points in leading the Red Raiders to a 78-72 win over West Virginia on Saturday.

            Tyson and Aimaq combined for 25 second-half points for Tech (15-12, 4-10), which started the day tied with Oklahoma for last in the Big 12, a game back of the Mountaineers (15-12, 4-10). The Raiders have won three straight including wins over No. 6 Texas and No. 12 Kansas State.

            The Mountaineers lost their third straight.











            Tyson shot 11 of 15, and while Aimaq was only 2 of 11 he made all 10 of his free throws in finishing with 14 points, and grabbed 12 rebounds. Pop Isaacs returned after missing six games with an ankle injury suffered in the teams' Jan. 25 meeting won by the Mountaineers to score 15 points. De'Vion Harmon added 13 points.

            Erik Stevenson scored 27 points and made 6 of 14 3-point attempts for West Virginia. Kedrian Johnson added 20 points. Joe Toussaint, who scored 22 points in the Mountaineers' 76-61 win in the previous meeting, scored five.

            A 14-3 run fueled by 12 straight points from Stevenson gave the Mountaineers the largest lead of the game at eight with nine minutes left. Tech responded with 11 straight points and took the lead for good on two Aimaq foul shots with five minutes remaining. West Virginia got its last field goal on a 3 from Johnson to get within one but the Mountaineers missed their last six shots over the final three minutes.

            West Virginia is host to Oklahoma State on Monday. Texas Tech is at Oklahoma on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814666,"Blues trade O'Reilly, Acciari to Maple Leafs, look to future","ST. LOUIS (AP) — The St. Louis Blues are looking to the future after trading captain and center Ryan O’Reilly along with center Noel Acciari to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday night.

            St. Louis acquired Toronto’s 2023 first-round draft pick and 2024 second-round draft pick and Ottawa’s 2023 third-round pick from the Maple Leafs along with AHL forwards Mikhail Abramov and Adam Gaudette. Toronto also traded its 2025 fifth-round pick to the Minnesota Wild for the rights to forward prospect Josh Pillar in exchange for the Wild picking up 25% of O’Reilly’s salary.

            The 32-year-old O'Reilly, who won the 2019 Conn Smythe trophy with St. Louis, had 12 goals and seven assists in 40 games this season while Acciari, 31, had 10 goals and eight assists in 54 games. Both players are set to be unrestricted free agents this offseason.











            The trade comes with St. Louis sitting eight points out of a playoff spot with a 26-25-3 record entering play Saturday. The Blues traded forward Vladimir Tarasenko and defenseman Niko Mikkola to the New York Rangers on Feb. 9.

            “This actually in a crazy way, made my job easier, not harder,” Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said. “It would have been difficult to be sitting in front of you today if we had five more wins, which is 10 more points and telling you why it was a good idea to move Vladimir Tarasenko, why it was a good idea to move Ryan O’Reilly and Mikkola and Noel for draft picks on a team that was fighting for a playoff spot or in a playoff spot fighting for a championship.” 

            St. Louis had won three straight after dropping five in a row, but Armstrong wasn’t influenced by the recent streaks.

            “It was probably a little bit before that,” Armstrong said. “This year we haven’t been able to find Ground Zero. Good teams don’t fluctuate the way we fluctuated, win three and lose eight, win seven, lose five win three. What that indicates to me is a team that doesn’t have a foundation and something to fall back on quickly when things are going bad.”

            St. Louis was looking to build off last season when it fell to the Stanley Cup Champion Colorado Avalanche in six games in the Western Conference Semifinal.

            “I was hoping to be here and celebrate a Stanley Cup,” Armstrong said. “I was also prepared to be here and lose in the first or second round and be getting drilled by ‘well, now you’ve lost and you have no future assets and you’ve done all this stuff, you’re an idiot.’ I was hoping to have to be labeled like that as a guy that didn’t maximize his assets. This year, I didn’t have that.”

            St. Louis now owns Toronto’s first-round pick and the later of the New York Rangers’ two first-round picks in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft in addition to its own.

            Armstrong did not rule out making additional moves ahead of the NHL's March 3 trade deadline.

            “I think that the equity in the NHL now to have is first-round picks,” Armstrong said. “One thing that I do know what we’re going to do though is if we move picks, players, it’s not going to be for one-year players. We need to again retrench with players that are 25, 26 and under that have term under contract so they can grow with that next core of players we have.”

Good teams don’t fluctuate the way we fluctuated, win three and lose eight, win seven, lose five win three. What that indicates to me is a team that doesn’t have a foundation and something to fall back on quickly when things are going bad.”St. Louis was looking to build off last season when it fell to the Stanley Cup Champion Colorado Avalanche in six games in the Western Conference Semifinal.“I was hoping to be here and celebrate a Stanley Cup,” Armstrong said. “I was also prepared to be here and lose in the first or second round and be getting drilled by ‘well, now you’ve lost and you have no future assets and you’ve done all this stuff, you’re an idiot.’ I was hoping to have to be labeled like that as a guy that didn’t maximize his assets. This year, I didn’t have that.”St. Louis now owns Toronto’s first-round pick and the later of the New York Rangers’ two first-round picks in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft in addition to its own.Armstrong did not rule out making additional moves ahead of the NHL's March 3 trade deadline.“I think that the equity in the NHL now to have is first-round picks,” Armstrong said. “One thing that I do know what we’re going to do though is if we move picks, players, it’s not going to be for one-year players. We need to again retrench with players that are 25, 26 and under that have term under contract so they can grow with that next core of players we have.”___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814668,Norfolk Southern CEO visits East Palestine after derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — The president of Norfolk Southern made a visit to East Palestine, Ohio, on Saturday following criticism from residents and political leaders about the company's response to the fiery derailment of a freight train carrying toxic materials earlier this month.

            Fox Business reports that company president and CEO Alan Shaw told reporters Saturday he was there “to support the community” but declined further comment.

            Earlier in the week, representatives of Norfolk Southern were absent from a public meeting attended by hundreds of people, with officials saying they were worried about physical threats. Gov. Mike DeWine was upset by the no-show at the Wednesday meeting and said Shaw needed to go to East Palestine and answer questions.











            Norfolk Southern said in a statement Friday that it was “committed to coordinating the cleanup project and paying for its associated costs,” saying the company wanted to ensure that East Palestine’s residents and natural environment “not only recover but thrive.”

            “Our company will be working tirelessly every day to get East Palestine back on its feet as soon as possible,” Shaw said in the statement. “We know we will be judged by our actions, and we are taking this accountability and responsibility very seriously.”

            Despite repeated assurances that air and water testing has shown no signs of contaminants, residents of the town along the Pennsylvania state line have complained about lingering headaches and irritated eyes and some have said they are afraid to return to their homes. DeWine said a medial clinic opening early next week to evaluate residents and analyze their symptoms will include a team of experts in chemical exposures being deployed to eastern Ohio.

            Chemicals that spilled into nearby creeks killed thousands of fish, and a smaller amount made it into the Ohio River. While officials said the contamination posed no threat, cities in Ohio and West Virginia that get their drinking water from the river were monitoring a slow-moving plume and a few temporarily switched to alternative water sources.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — The president of Norfolk Southern made a visit to East Palestine, Ohio, on Saturday following criticism from residents and political leaders about the company's response to the fiery derailment of a freight train carrying toxic materials earlier this month.Fox Business reports that company president and CEO Alan Shaw told reporters Saturday he was there “to support the community” but declined further comment.Earlier in the week, representatives of Norfolk Southern were absent from a public meeting attended by hundreds of people, with officials saying they were worried about physical threats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814670,"Zelenskyy 'born for this moment,' Sean Penn says at Berlin","BERLIN (AP) — Just hours before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, actor Sean Penn had his first on-camera meeting with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            “It was as if he was realizing himself, that he was born for this moment,” Penn recalled in an interview with The Associated Press at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on Saturday, a day after the festival premiere of his documentary “Superpower.” 

            Penn and his co-director Aaron Kaufman were in Kyiv to film a profile of the comedic actor-turned-president when the war broke out. It would be the image of the president walking into the room for that first interview that would have the biggest impact on Penn.











            “It’s hard to explain, but there was a resolve in reaction to something that no one has ever faced before,” Penn said.

            At a press conference also Saturday, Penn said they returned to the hotel after the interview and the shelling started that very night. When they first met Zelenskyy, he had “a proper suit and a proper office.”

            “The next time we saw him, he was in camos and his country was at war,” Penn said.

            The outbreak of war sent the documentary on an unexpected track. The film contains further interviews with the president conducted over the past year.

            After completing the project, the pair have continued to speak off camera. Zelenskyy presented the Hollywood star — who has been involved in numerous international humanitarian and anti-war efforts over the years — with the Ukrainian Order of Merit last year. Penn was also given a plaque on a Kyiv walkway honoring world leaders who have shown solidarity with Ukraine.

            Penn told the AP that people would be most surprised by Zelenskyy's “command of the mechanisms of government.”

            “Not only his, but all of those upon whom he is reliant, his sense of mapping the diplomatic territory,"" he said. ""He’s on fire. He has that extreme gift for politics.”

            Penn recalled the “civility” he saw when leaving Ukraine via the Polish border a few days after the invasion began.

            “No one was honking. No one was trying to drive around the other and take and there was a kind of quiet acceptance,"" Penn said during the interview. ""You know, and these were families being torn apart. Some, most remain torn apart.” 

            During a later visit to Ukraine, Penn loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskyy, telling him: “When you win, bring it back to Malibu.”

            “The Oscar is there in his office and it’s ready to be melted anytime he wants to melt it,” Penn clarified in the press conference after threatening to smelt his awards in public if Zelenskyy was not on the program for last year's Oscar telecast. 

            The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not include a video address from the president, opting instead for a moment of silence in support of the people of Ukraine. Zelenskyy did address the opening of the Berlinale on Thursday, exhorting artists and filmmakers to express support for Ukraine.

            Penn said at the press conference that the gift of the Oscar was inspired by his “continuing shame towards the leadership of the Academy, the motion picture academy, in choosing to present Will Smith smacking Chris Rock rather than the greatest symbol of cinema and humanity living today on their broadcast.”

            Penn's two Oscars both were for best actor, in 2003 for “Mystic River” and in 2008 for “Milk.” His previous directing credits include “Flag Day,” “Into the Wild” and “The Pledge.”

            While it is not unusual for entertainment personalities to get behind a cause, “Superpower” sees Penn travel all the way to the front line of the war to talk to soldiers in the trenches. When it comes to his drive and determination, the star couldn’t tell you where that comes from. 

            “I could make up a number of answers” he joked to the AP. “It’s something I just don’t really ultimately think about, though I’ve been asked many times. … I don’t have the words for it.”BERLIN (AP) — Just hours before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, actor Sean Penn had his first on-camera meeting with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“It was as if he was realizing himself, that he was born for this moment,” Penn recalled in an interview with The Associated Press at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on Saturday, a day after the festival premiere of his documentary “Superpower.”Penn and his co-director Aaron Kaufman were in Kyiv to film a profile of the comedic actor-turned-president when the war broke out.

            The Volunteers (20-7, 9-5 SEC) trailed by 20 points at halftime and lost in their first game since toppling No. 1 Alabama.

            The Wildcats (18-9, 9-5) earned their first regular-season sweep of Tennessee since the 2011-12 season. Kentucky defeated the Volunteers 63-56 on Jan. 14 in Knoxville.











            Wallace had totaled nine points in the Wildcats’ previous two games.

            “He was ready to play,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. “He hasn’t been good in afternoon games, and I reminded him (before the game), this team needs everybody.”

            Chris Livingston added 12 points and completed a double-double with 10 rebounds. Jacob Toppin had 11.

            Coming off their 68-59 home win over Alabama on Wednesday, the Volunteers failed to duplicate the same defensive prowess they displayed against the Crimson Tide, especially in the first half.

            Tennessee coach Rick Barnes was disappointed in his team’s ability to maintain the focus it had earlier in the week against Alabama, a problem that has plagued his team the entire year.

            “I wish I knew about the (inconsistency issues), we’d fix it,” he said. “I think it goes back, and I don’t understand, with as much time as we spend, older guys talking about doing your job, playing your role night in and night out, and not letting emotion get the best of us.""

            Tennessee struggled during the first 20 minutes and trailed 39-19 at the break. The Volunteers shot 31% in the first half whole going 1 for 13 from 3-point range.

            “What I liked was how we defended and how we rebounded,” Calipari said. “We outrebounded them by eight, you understand, in the country they’re like the best, they’re a plus eight rebounding and we ended up being plus eight in the first half.""

            Santiago Vescovi led Tennessee with 17 points and Jahmai Mashack had 16.

            Both teams were shorthanded. The Volunteers were minus starter Julian Phillips (hip) and senior reserve Josiah Jordan-James (ankle). Kentucky was missing senior guards Sahvir Wheeler (ankle) and C.J. Fredrick (ribs). 

            BIG PICTURE

            Kentucky: The Wildcats continue to make a late push for an NCAA Tournament berth and notched their second straight Quad 1 victory and third of the year. Kentucky positioned itself for a higher seed in the SEC Tournament with two weeks remaining in the regular season. “Talking us out of the NCAA tournament does not work,” Calipari said. “You either play yourself in or you play. … we’ve had two losses that you would like to have back.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814673,White House criticizes Youngkin over menstrual tracking bill,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The White House rebuked Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this week for supporting state lawmakers' rejection of a bill that that would have prohibited police from issuing search warrants for digitized data about women’s menstrual cycles.

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Friday that the Republican governor's push to block the bill at a time when abortion access is diminishing “attacks the principles of freedom and a woman’s fundamental right to privacy,"" the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

            Virginia’s Democrat-controlled state Senate had passed the bill 31-9, with nine Republicans joining Democrats to send it to the House, where Republicans hold a majority. A Republican-controlled House subcommittee voted along party lines Monday to table the measure, with Youngkin’s support.











            Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter defended the governor's position to the Times-Dispatch and said the data-gathering limits that Democrats had proposed were “unsafe.”

(AP) — The White House rebuked Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this week for supporting state lawmakers' rejection of a bill that that would have prohibited police from issuing search warrants for digitized data about women’s menstrual cycles.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Friday that the Republican governor's push to block the bill at a time when abortion access is diminishing “attacks the principles of freedom and a woman’s fundamental right to privacy,"" the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.Virginia’s Democrat-controlled state Senate had passed the bill 31-9, with nine Republicans joining Democrats to send it to the House, where Republicans hold a majority. A Republican-controlled House subcommittee voted along party lines Monday to table the measure, with Youngkin’s support.Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter defended the governor's position to the Times-Dispatch and said the data-gathering limits that Democrats had proposed were “unsafe.”State Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814675,"Australia into T20 World Cup semis, England nearly there","GQEBERHA, South Africa (AP) — Australia clinched a place in the semifinals at the Women's T20 World Cup by beating South Africa and ending the group stage with four wins from four on Saturday.

            Unbeaten England is nearly there after coming out on top in its matchup with India for a third win.

            Australia, the top-ranked team and defending champion, was impressive again to cruise past South Africa by six wickets, comfortably chasing down the tournament host's 124-6 and finshing on 125-4 with more than three overs to spare.











            Australia was without injured opening batter and wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but that made no difference to the performance. Middle-order batter Tahlia McGrath thumped 10 fours in her 57 from 33 balls as Australia raced to victory and was confirmed as the Group 1 winner.

            England came through its toughest test yet by holding off India by 11 runs in their top-of-the-table meeting in Group 2. 

            India, which also came into the game in Gqeberha unbeaten, fell short of England's total of 151-7 despite 52 from opener Smriti Mandhana and another fighting innings at the end by wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who made 47 not out but wasn't able to take her team home this time.

            India managed only 140-5 and England is clear at the top of the group and within a whisker of a place in the last four. England plays Pakistan in its last group game on Tuesday.

            England began the game under pressure when seamer Renuka Singh struck in each of her first three overs, removing Danni Wyatt for a duck, Alice Capsey for 3 and Sophia Dunkley for 10.

            Nat Sciver-Brunt rescued England from 29-3 with her 50 from 42 balls, and her partnerships of 51 with Heather Knight and 40 with Amy Jones ensured the English posted a competitive total at St. George's Park.

            Mandhana was up for the challenge, crashing seven fours and a six. But she fell in the 16th over and straight after hitting her six, caught at long-on attempting another big shot, to leave India too much to do.

            “It’s good to see that our batting group showed character even after 29 for 3,” England captain Knight said. “We haven’t really played against a big team recently and to play like this against this Indian team was fantastic.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814677,NBA All-Star Game: All you need to know about Sunday's event,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The fans in Salt Lake City used to serenade Donovan Mitchell with “MVP” chants when he played for the Utah Jazz, a sign of their appreciation and respect.

            He plays for Cleveland now. But he wouldn’t mind hearing those cries again Sunday.

            The 72nd NBA All-Star Game is Sunday night with almost all of the league’s biggest names set to take part in Utah. 











            Captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks will pick their teams before the game, leaving Team LeBron coach Michael Malone of the Denver Nuggets and Team Giannis coach Joe Mazzulla of the Boston Celtics about five minutes to come up with an actual game plan.

            “It never gets old,” Antetokounmpo said Saturday. “Every day, every time I step to my locker and I see my jersey with my name and I’m around all these great players, which are the best players in the world, it’s always a great feeling. I never take it for granted. God has blessed me enough to be seven times an All-Star so far, and this might be my last one, so I try to enjoy to the fullest and appreciate every moment with the best players in the world.”

            And most of the best are indeed in Salt Lake City.

            There's James, who just passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's leading scorer. There’s Dallas’ Luka Doncic and Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid, currently No. 1 and No. 2 in the NBA scoring race, both of them just over 33 points per game. Antetokounmpo and James also are averaging at least 30 points, as are Portland’s Damian Lillard, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Boston’s Jayson Tatum.

            “It’s always great just being out here with these guys, honestly,"" DeMar DeRozan of the Chicago Bulls said. “I look forward to just being able to compete. You know, we go against all these guys all season, so just to kind of detach and play with these guys is definitely an honor.""

            James will be honored at halftime with a ceremony to celebrate his passing Abdul-Jabbar for the scoring record.

            “I think he’s probably going to slow down whenever he wants to slow down,"" Toronto All-Star forward Pascal Siakam said. “It feels like he can play forever. It looks like it.""

            There's never any real defense in these games until the fourth quarter, when players get serious, and there inevitably will be a bunch of them scoring a bunch of points. After all, that's been a trend this season: 20 times a player has scored 50 points in a game, a list topped by Mitchell scoring 71 for the Cavaliers against Chicago on Jan. 2.

            He isn't flat-out going for the MVP, but acknowledged that he's thought about it. 

            “That would be nice,"" Mitchell said. “I’m not going to try and shoot every shot, but close to every shot. Just have fun. That’s the biggest thing is kind of going into these spaces and really appreciating the moment. It’d be great to win MVP. I’ve had a lot of full-circle moments this year. That would be another one.”

            THE FORMAT

            The first three quarters can be considered mini-games, with the score starting at zero — but with the total score is still tracked because it comes into play later. The winning team in each quarter gets $100,000 for their charity; if the quarter is a tie, that money gets split.

            In the fourth quarter, the total score from the first three quarters becomes the score again. The final target score will be the leading team’s score to that point plus 24 points. There’s no game clock, but there is a shot clock.

            The winning team reaches the target score first. If the score is Team LeBron 100, Team Giannis 99 entering the fourth, the winning score would be 124. The winning team also picks up another $150,000 for its charity.

            MVP AWARD

            The MVP award is named for Kobe Bryant, and there will be a new winner this year. Last year’s MVP, Golden State guard Stephen Curry, was voted into the game as a starter but is out with an injury.

            Antetokounmpo was MVP in 2021 and James has been All-Star MVP three times, most recently in 2018. The only other past MVP in this year’s game is Kyrie Irving, the 2014 winner.

            WELCOME TO THE SHOW

            There are six players in the All-Star Game who’ll be making their debut: Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards, Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox, Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, Memphis’ Jaren Jackson Jr., and — last but certainly not least to Jazz fans — Utah’s Lauri Markkanen.

            With those six names, there are now been 450 All-Stars in NBA history.

            MOVING UP

            If Antetokounmpo scores 26 points Sunday, that would put him at 200 for his career in All-Star Games.

            Only 10 other players have scored that many in their combined All-Star appearances: James, Bryant, Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson, Bob Pettit, Julius Erving, Elgin Baylor and Shaquille O’Neal.

            Antetokounmpo has averaged 29 points in his six previous All-Star Games — the most in NBA history for those who have appeared in at least three games.

            BACK IN UTAH

            Salt Lake City becomes the 19th city (or region) to play host to multiple All-Star Games. The Jazz also had the NBA’s midseason showcase in 1993.

            Indianapolis joins that list next year when it plays host to the weekend’s events. It’ll be the first time that the Pacers’ home city has been the All-Star site since 1985.

            The Iowa star scored 30 points, Monika Czinano added 20 and the seventh-ranked Hawkeyes pulled away in the second half for an 80-60 win over the Cornhuskers on Saturday.

            Clark has never had fewer than 30 in any of her seven games against Nebraska, and she and Czinano led the way again in Iowa's eighth straight win in the series.











            The game drew a Nebraska record crowd of 14,289, with many in the building to see a national player of the year candidate in Clark.

            “I like coming here,” Clark said. “I think they support women's basketball well here and I love playing in front of a big crowd. I have a lot of family from the state of Nebraska who are always here supporting us. We play them pretty well every time.”

            The Hawkeyes (22-5, 14-2) moved a game behind Big Ten-leading Indiana with two regular-season games left. 

            Jaz Shelley had 19 points and nine rebounds and Alexis Markowski had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Cornhuskers (14-13, 6-10), who lost their fourth straight.

            Clark and Czinano combined for 15 of the Hawkeyes’ 21 points in the third quarter, when they stretched their 40-33 halftime lead to 61-47.

            “Teams really have to pick their poison when they play us,” Czinano said. “They can focus on playing the post and maybe my points are limited, but my teammates are so open for shots or vice versa. Throughout the whole game they were kind of picking and choosing which one they wanted to do, and we were doing a good job of realizing that and reading it.”

            Clark's layup midway through the fourth quarter gave her 30 points, then she took a seat for the rest of the game while her teammates built the lead to as many as 29 points.

            Clark also had five rebounds and eight assists, with five leading to baskets by Czinano. Clark leads the country with 14 games with at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists.

            In her seven games against Nebraska, Clark is averaging 34.3 points, 7.9 assists and 8.9 rebounds. She's shooting 41.6% on 3-pointers (27 of 65) after making 4 of 10 on Saturday.

            “She's done the same thing against everybody she goes up against,"" Nebraska coach Amy Williams said. ""She's been a pretty special talent that you don't run across very often and she has the mentality to match, and that's tough to stop.""

            Iowa was up 21-14 after the first quarter but had its momentum stall early in the second. Shelley's deep 3 got the Huskers within 29-26, and after she and Clark traded layups, Isabelle Bourne banked in a 3 to tie it 31-all.

            The Hawkeyes closed the half on a 9-2 spurt with Clark leading the way. She snaked through the lane for a layup, left Maddie Krull on the floor with a slick move on her way to another layin, sank a nearly 30-foot shot from the halfcourt logo and then threaded a pass to Czinano in the paint for an easy basket.

            “You come into someplace and they have their attendance record and you win by 20, that's a good road win,"" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “We just talk about how we have to be really locked in on the road. We've had some good road wins at Ohio State, at Michigan. For us, this is just another one of them.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa: The Hawkeyes survived a potential trap game that came between two blowout wins and a Tuesday trip to No. 8 Maryland. Plus, they found out Thursday ESPN's College Gameday show would be televised from Carver-Hawkeye Arena before next Sunday's showdown with No. 2 Indiana.

            Nebraska: The Huskers' hopes for a second straight NCAA Tournament bid are in peril unless they can make a strong run in the Big Ten Tournament.

            BARK AT CLARK

            Clark hit nothing with a turnaround jumper in the lane in the first quarter, briefly making her a target for heckling.

            The “air ball” chant was to be expected, but the student section continued to razz her on Iowa’s next possession, serenading her with ”air ball” when she touched the ball and again when she shot a pair of free throws, which she made.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814682,"Jimmy Carter, 39th US president, enters hospice care at home","ATLANTA (AP) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who at 98 years old is the longest-lived American president, has entered home hospice care in Plains, Georgia, a statement from The Carter Center confirmed Saturday.

            After a series of short hospital stays, the statement said, Carter “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.”

            The statement said the 39th president has the full support of his medical team and family, which “asks for privacy at this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.”











            Carter was a little-known Georgia governor when he began his bid for the presidency ahead of the 1976 election. He went on to defeat then-President Gerald R. Ford, capitalizing as a Washington outsider in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office in 1974.

            Carter served a single, tumultuous term and was defeated by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980, a landslide loss that ultimately paved the way for his decades of global advocacy for democracy, public health and human rights via The Carter Center.

            The former president and his wife, Rosalynn, 95, opened the center in 1982. His work there garnered a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

            Jason Carter, the couple's grandson who now chairs The Carter Center governing board, said Saturday in a tweet that he “saw both of my grandparents yesterday. They are at peace and—as always—their home is full of love.”

            Carter, who has lived most of his life in Plains, traveled extensively into his 80s and early 90s, including annual trips to build homes with Habitat for Humanity and frequent trips abroad as part of the Carter Center's election monitoring and its effort to eradicate the Guinea worm parasite in developing countries. But the former president's health has declined over his 10th decade of life, especially as the coronavirus pandemic limited his public appearances, including at his beloved Maranatha Baptist Church where he taught Sunday School lessons for decades before standing-room-only crowds of visitors. 

            In August 2015, Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. The following year, Carter announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer.

            Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October with family and friends in Plains, the tiny town where he and Rosalynn were born in the years between World War I and the Great Depression.

            The Carter Center last year marked 40 years of promoting its human rights agenda.

            The Center has been a pioneer of election observation, monitoring at least 113 elections in Africa, Latin America, and Asia since 1989. In perhaps its most widely hailed public health effort, the organization recently announced that only 14 human cases of Guinea worm disease were reported in all of 2021, the result of years of public health campaigns to improve access to safe drinking water in Africa. 

            That's a staggering drop from when The Carter Center began leading the global eradication effort in 1986, when the parasitic disease infected 3.5 million people. Carter once said he hoped to live longer than the last Guinea worm parasite.

            Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, to a prominent family in rural south Georgia. He went on to the U.S. Naval Academy during World War II and pursued a career as a Cold War Naval officer before returning to Plains, Georgia, with Rosalynn and their young family to take over the family peanut business after Earl Carter's death in the 1950s.

            A moderate Democrat, the younger Carter rapidly climbed from the local school board to the state Senate and then the Georgia governor's office. He began his White House bid as an underdog with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and policy plans reflecting his education as an engineer. He connected with many Americans because of his promise not to deceive the American people after Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia.

            “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,” Carter said often as he campaigned.

            Carter, who came of age politically during the civil rights movement, was the last Democratic presidential nominee to sweep the Deep South, before the region shifted quickly to Reagan and the Republicans in subsequent elections.

            He governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. 

            Carter's foreign policy wins included brokering Mideast peace by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy. At home, Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres in Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and non-whites to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. 

            Carter also built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy.

            Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat.

            For years after his loss, Carter largely receded from electoral politics. Democrats were hesitant to embrace him. Republicans made him a punchline, caricaturing him as a hapless liberal. In reality, Carter governed more as a technocrat, more progressive on race and gender equality than he had campaigned but a budget hawk who often angered more liberal Democrats, including Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts senator who waged a damaging primary battle against the sitting president in 1980.

            Carter said after leaving office that he had underestimated the importance of dealing with Washington power brokers, including the media and lobbying forces anchored in the nation's capital. But he insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to “protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully” and “enhance human rights here and abroad” — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term.

            And years later, upon his cancer diagnosis as a nonagenarian, he expressed satisfaction with his long life.

            “I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,” he said in 2015. “I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.”ATLANTA (AP) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who at 98 years old is the longest-lived American president, has entered home hospice care in Plains, Georgia, a statement from The Carter Center confirmed Saturday.After a series of short hospital stays, the statement said, Carter “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.”The statement said the 39th president has the full support of his medical team and family, which “asks for privacy at this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.”Carter was a little-known Georgia governor when he began his bid for the presidency ahead of the 1976 election.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814690,Arizona city considers replacing street names tied to KKK,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — An Arizona city council scheduled a vote next month on replacing park and road names that have century-old ties to the Ku Klux Klan.

            Tempe councilmembers will consider replacement names during a March 2 meeting. The new names were proposed by community members and vetted by council-appointed volunteers who met several times. 

            The renaming effort began in 2021 after historical research determined that several parks and streets were named after former community leaders who were members of an area Klan chapter in the 1920s. Resident Drew Sullivan helped start the initiative and staffers at the Arizona Historical Society and Tempe History Museum had a hand in the research, which also used records from the Phoenix Public Library.











            A Klan chapter called Butte Klan No. 3 included many prominent Tempe residents, including mayors, council members, bankers and other power brokers, according to documents released by the city. At the time, the city’s elementary schools were segregated, as was a swimming pool at Tempe Beach Park.

            The Tempe Elementary School District already has renamed three schools bearing some of the associated names. 

            Tempe city officials in February settled on the list of proposed replacement names, which includes civil rights activists, the first African American landowners in what is now Tempe, and married pioneers Adolfo Romo and Joaquina Jones, who fought and won in court for their children to be able to attend school with white children. Their 1925 case helped pave the way for desegregation in the United States. 

            “This is really touching to me because I’ve had people (in my family) who have died by hanging by the Ku Klux Klan, so I understand what this means emotionally,” Berdetta Hodge, the first Black woman to sit on the city council, told the Arizona Republic.

            Pending action by the City Council, it could be the summer for the actual name changes are made. 

            The city is still organizing how it will reimburse residents who have to update their addresses. Residents will have one year to file claims after the properties are officially renamed.TEMPE, Ariz.

            Norchard Omier had 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting while Jordan Miller added 14 points for the Hurricanes (22-5, 13-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), who won their sixth straight and improved to 15-0 at home.

            “Every game is one game,” Hurricanes coach Jim Larrañaga said. “You never know what’s going to happen on the next game. What I’m most proud of is these guys continue to compete home and away.”











            Miami opened the second half with nine unanswered points. The Demon Deacons (17-10, 9-7) rallied from three double-digit deficits, including Andrew Carr’s 3-pointer with 2:22 left cutting Miami’s lead to 90-84. But Wong’s jumper and Miller’s layup provided Miami with a cushion. It was the Hurricanes’ largest point total in regulation since they joined the ACC in 2004-05.

            Tyree Appleby scored 15 points and Damari Monsanto and Cameron Hildreth had 14 each for the Demon Deacons. Carr and Mathew Marsh finished with 12 points each.

            Wong surpassed Jack McClinton for seventh on Miami’s career scoring list with 1,710 points. Pack followed his 23-point performance at North Carolina on Monday by going 9 of 17, including 4 of 8 from behind the arc.

            “Just playing with confidence, obviously taking what the defense is giving me,” Pack said. “My teammates keep finding me and obviously my coaches running things for me. I am motivated and playing hard on the court.”

            Appleby also had nine assists but committed 12 turnovers, tied for second most in a Division 1 game in the last 13 years.

            “This was a hard loss today for us today because it was a Quad 1 opportunity on the road,” Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes said. “Miami wanted to knock us out a couple of times. We went to the canvas and spit it out and came back swinging. I respect that about my team.”

            Wong scored all of Miami’s points during a 13-0 run late in the first half that helped the Hurricanes erase a three-point deficit. His fastbreak dunk with 3:53 remaining capped the surge and put Miami ahead 42-32. Wake Forest pulled within 3, 47-44, at halftime.

            “It was kind of a heat check, I felt,” Wong said of his surge. “I scored my first one and kept on rolling. It was just a hot streak and I kept on shooting and it kept going in.”

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The Hurricanes completed their 10th week in the AP Top 25. The NCAA tournament committee also has Miami on the periphery of a top four regional seed in its preliminary list released Saturday.

            LIMITED SECOND HALF

            Monsanto, of neighboring Pembroke Pines, converted four 3s but picked up his third foul during Miami’s early second half run. He was assessed a technical and subsequent fourth foul for throwing his headband as he disagreed with the call and sat the next 13 minutes.

            “Obviously, we’d like to have Damari in there but that’s part of it,” Forbes said. “I thought he was just tossing his headband. I don’t really understand what the technical is about.”

            Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons have been on contrasting streaks since Jan. 7, when they began a five-victory string. Then they lost four straight before a three-win streak was snapped Saturday.
