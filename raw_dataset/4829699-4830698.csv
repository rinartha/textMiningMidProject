This is the first time that the baseball legend has visited Taiwan and baseball fans quickly spotted Rivera, dubbed the ""Hammer of God"" for his achievements on the mound.After meeting former Yankees teammate Wang Chien-Ming (王建民), a native of Tainan City, he visited Dajia Jenn Lann Temple in Taichung City, reported ETtoday. As soon as he arrived, Taiwanese baseball fans swarmed Rivera, capturing photos and videos.(Facebook, Dajia Mazu ㄅ ㄜˊ like photo)Rivera reciprocated by waving and posing for photos with fans, among which included a little league baseball team from Taoyuan City's Hsing-Fu Elementary School.The visit to the temple was part of Rivera's private itinerary and temple management did not know about it in advance.(Facebook, Dajia Mazu ㄅ ㄜˊ like photo)(Facebook, Dajia Mazu ㄅ ㄜˊ like photo)(Facebook, Dajia Mazu ㄅ ㄜˊ like photo)(Facebook, Dajia Mazu ㄅ ㄜˊ like photo)Rivera interacts with baseball players from Hsing-Fu Elementary School.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829713,Google ups journalism funding in Taiwan with NT$300 million in grants,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Google will provide NT$300 million (US$9.8 million) in funding for journalistic projects in Taiwan over the next three years, but Taiwan's media industry has still not come to an agreement with big tech companies as it seeks payment for use of its content.Google launched the Taiwan News Digital Co-Prosperity Fund on Wednesday (March 8) to provide grants for Taiwan news media organizations and journalists in a move the company said will support the “transformation, development, and sustainability of the news industry."" Applications for funding will open in May.Despite the grants, the issue of tech giants' unpaid use of news content on their platforms still looms large. Taiwan's media industry has joined other countries in calling on the big tech companies to pay for the use of its content, but interested parties have still not reached an agreement.In December 2022, Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) and media industry representatives launched the first round of discussions with Google and Meta. Deputy Digital Minister Lee Huai-jen (李懷仁) said the next round of discussions is likely to happen in March.News Partner Manager of Google Taiwan Adrian Gregory Lui (陳漢隆) said that Google was focused on ""common prosperity"" instead of ""profit sharing."" He said that Google only displays snippets of news content in its search results, such as titles, pictures, and abstracts.Lui also said this helps Taiwanese news outlets by directing traffic to their websites, which Google does not profit from. Despite this, many in the media industry believe that Google's massive ad revenue is built on the backs of news content it does not pay for, though this is not universally agreed upon.Government interventions requiring big tech companies to pay news outlets for content have yielded mixed results. Google pulled its news services from Spain in 2014 after the country passed legislation requiring it to pay news outlets for content. It relaunched in Spain eight years later, after the country adopted EU regulations that allowed it to publish very short extracts of news.In 2021, Facebook also briefly removed news content from Australian users' feeds after Australia passed a law requiring tech companies to pay local operators for content. Services were restored only a few days later, but as a result of the law, Australia's national broadcaster said it was able to hire 60 more regional journalists, expand existing bureaus, and open new ones.Companies like Google and Facebook certainly have changed the way news media is consumed. Market research commissioned by Google indicates that 81% of people now obtain their news through the internet or social media, and between 2003 and 2020, ad revenues for ""traditional publications"" dropped by 70%.",2023/03/08,1441,Politics

These ingredients are typically used in small quantities and are often more expensive than standard food ingredients. Specialty food ingredients include flavorings, emulsifiers, enzymes, food preservatives, and functional ingredients such as proteins and fibers.The global specialty food ingredients market is expected to grow steadily in the coming years, driven by the increasing demand for processed food products and the growing awareness of the health benefits of specialty food ingredients.

As consumers become busier and more time-constrained, the demand for ready-to-eat and processed food products is increasing, driving the demand for specialty food ingredients. Another factor contributing to the growth of the specialty food ingredients market is the increasing awareness of the health benefits of specialty food ingredients.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829834,India helps Apple supplier diversify from China,"China may have scrapped its zero-COVID policy — three years of strict lockdowns that caused supply chain delays and stymied economic growth — but that hasn't stopped Apple's top supplier from seeking out alternative production sites, including in  India.Foxconn, which makes iPhones for the US technology company, was forced to cut production during the peak season last fall when many Chinese workers at its factory in Zhengzhou went down with the virus. The company locked thousands of staff inside the facility to avoid a government shutdown, which fueled angry protests.Geopolitical issues, including concerns over a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, are also a growing concern for many manufacturers in China, including Foxconn, as firms could be vulnerable to any future Western sanctions imposed on Beijing.""Technology vendors are looking to diversify their supply chains out of China and reduce the risk of having all production reliant on one country, where relationships with the US are problematic,"" Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, told DW.India has many advantages. The country is on course this year to be the world's fastest-growing economy. It also has a huge young workforce — around 44% of the population is aged between 18 and 25. Indian minimum wages are a third or half of that in China.Foxconn, which first entered India before the pandemic to produce lower-end iPhones, is now stepping up plans to expand into the South Asian country, according to media reports.The Wall Street Journal said last week that the Taiwanese electronics giant is set to triple the number of workers to as many as 100,000 at its facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu to help ramp up iPhone production to around 20 million units.The state minister of the neighboring Indian state of Karnataka told local media this week that Foxconn will also set up a new facility employing a similar number of people in the tech hub of Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. The new plant is rumored to be costing $700 million (€664 million).While Foxconn says it has yet to enter into any formal agreement about the new plant, Indian officials said the factory will be spread over 300 acres (121.4 hectares). Local media said the plant will likely include some production for the firm's nascent electric vehicle (EV) business. Other plans in India include a possible site near Hyderabad in neighboring Telangana state.Ivan Lam, senior research analyst at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, told DW that Foxconn's production in India is still on a small scale, with just eight assembly lines running to date.""That compares with more than 90 assembly lines at Zhengzhou alone,"" he said, referring to the world's largest iPhone factory in China.Lam added that Foxconn wants India to account for up to 25% of iPhone production over the next five to 10 years, up from the current 5-7%.Foxconn's expansion into South Asia is a major coup for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is keen to close the technology gap with China. His government has created incentives worth billions of dollars to encourage global manufacturers to invest in the country.Foxconn's chairman Liu Young-way has met with Modi twice over the past year. During the most recent talks last month, he underscored the firm's plans to ""continue to build an ecosystem in India allowing all our stakeholders to share, collaborate and thrive.""But with Foxconn's supply chain so reliant on China, where most of the iPhone components are produced, some analysts are wary of too quick a shift to India.India's prowess is in software, not hardware, and while state governments are keen to steal clients away from China, poor infrastructure and bureaucracy could slow progress.""India is many things, but providing large-scale efficient and effective technology products is not its expertise. So we would expect many teething issues,"" Atwal said.China's two-decade advantage was illustrated last month when the Financial Times (FT) reported that only half of the components made at a casings factory in southern India were good enough to be forwarded to Foxconn to help build iPhones.A separate FT report described how Apple engineers and designers have recently been spending weeks or months at Indian factories to oversee manufacturing and iron out faults.A report by China's Caixin in December wrote of worker competency issues that were presenting challenges for Foxconn in India.Although China's geopolitical risk is creeping higher, the Asian powerhouse is set to remain Foxconn's main global manufacturing hub. Last month, Chinese media reported that the iPhone manufacturer has leased a new near-300-acre plot in Zhengzhou to build smart warehouses.Lam told DW that as well as enhancing its relationship with Apple, Foxconn has promised investors an aggressive expansion into new areas.""[These include] high-end wearable products, XR [extended reality] products, high-precision modules, semiconductor modules, automotive products,"" he said.Most of these new products will, for now, still be produced in China, where Foxconn's Lui said the largest portion of capital investment for this financial year is headed.Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829835,Who is Erdogan challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu?,"The opposition had long been searching for a joint candidate to challenge longtime President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the upcoming election in Turkey. It seems to have finally found him: Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu will run against Erdogan in the May 14 election.Who is the man they hope will oust Erdogan, who has been in power for more than 20 years?Kemal Kilicdaroglu was born the son of a civil servant in 1948 in a village in the eastern Anatolian province of Tunceli. His family is Alevi, which is an ethnic-religious minority in Turkey. He was the fourth of seven children, and the only one who went on to university. Kilicdaroglu graduated in Ankara with a degree in economics and finance, his first job in 1971 was as an advisor to the Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance. He worked his way up the Turkish administration, and was named director of the social security authority SSK — in 2006 replaced by the SGK— in 1992. Two years later, a financial magazine chose him as ""Bureaucrat of the Year."" He retired in 1999.He is known for his honesty and reliability — qualities that are not to be taken for granted in politics, especially in Turkey. As a bureaucrat, he fought corruption. Thanks to his many years in the insurance business, he is said to be skilled at finding the proverbial needle in a haystack: ""In a room full of official documents, Kilicdaroglu can quickly identify any irregularities and corruption,"" a CHP member told DW, adding that ""staying honest in the process is not only a virtue, but also a necessity.""Kilicdaroglu made a public name for himself as the bureaucrat who was tough on corruption. His political career began with a report on corruption he had prepared for the pro-secular, center-left CHP — the report was well received by then-party leader Deniz Baykal and prompted Kilicdaroglu's move to politics. He won a seat in the Turkish parliament in the 2002 election, the year incumbent President Erdogan came to power.In 2007, he became deputy speaker of the CHP's parliamentary group. His media presence increased significantly after he published evidence of corruption in Turkey. A few heated arguments with several deputies from Erdogan's conservative AKP party boosted his renown. In 2009, he ran for Istanbul's mayoral office, but lost to an AKP candidate.A sex scandal cost longtime CHP party leader Baykal his office in 2010. Kilicdaroglu ran as a candidate for the party lead and received all 1,189 valid votes at the party congress. But although the vast majority of CHP supporters backed his candidacy at the time, his popularity has waned since. Today, the party base is divided when it comes to its leader.In 2017, Kilicdaroglu's fame spread beyond Turkey when he walked from Ankara to Istanbul. Along with his supporters, he traversed about 450 kilometers (280 miles) as part of the ""March for Justice"" protest campaign to draw attention to increasing repressions by the AKP government. A prison sentence for CHP politician and journalist Enis Berberoglu sparked the 25-day march.Kilicdaroglu, who could become Turkey's 13th president, is also known for staying calm. His nicknames include ""Gandhi Kemal"", or ""Turkey's Gandhi"" — for his supposed resemblance in looks and style to Mahatma Gandhi — the ""quiet force"" and ""democratic uncle.""He never gets upset, he once said in an interview. ""He is nice and very calm — a little too calm,"" his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu said. ""Kemal never raises his voice, he never shouts. You can't even have a decent argument with him. The fact that he is so quiet sometimes really drives me crazy.""He has reportedly been the subject of more physical attacks and assassination attempts than any other politician in Turkey. That includes a 2019 attempt to lynch him in Ankara. A CHP politician told DW how he remembered Kilicdaroglu after the attack: ""We waited outside his door. He came out. There were bruises on his face. He didn't look unhappy at all. He invited us to his office and ordered us tea. Told us not to blow things out of proportion. We were angrier and more agitated than he was. But he stayed completely calm, as if we were the ones who had survived an attempted lynching, not him.""Kilicdaroglu also survived an armed attack by the Kurdish militia PKK, an attack in parliament, and an attempted IS (Islamic State) bombing while on his 2017 March for Justice.Despite his positive image, the public has for years charged Kilicdaroglu with not being charismatic enough to be a fitting alternative to Erdogan.The six-party opposition alliance was of two minds about his candidacy. The CHP and five other opposition parties have been working together for more than a year to increase their chances of winning against Erdogan. The parties gathered several times for ""Table of Six"" meetings.The Table of Six almost became a Table of Five when the second-largest party, the right-wing nationalist Good Party (IYI) threatened to leave the alliance after it became clear that Kilicdaroglu would be nominated. IYI leader Meral Aksener had been campaigning against Kilicdaroglu's candidacy for months, arguing that someone who ""can win against Erdogan should run."" In her opinion, Kilicdaroglu did not fit the bill. In fact, Kilicdaroglu has never won an election.After a flurry of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the crisis in the opposition seems to have been resolved for the time being. Aksener is back at the table saying she supports Kilicdaroglu's candidacy. Time will tell whether the strained alliance will suffice for an electoral victory in May.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829836,Train crash protests: Strikes bring much of Greece to a halt,"Thousands of Greek workers went on strike on Wednesday over the deadly train crash that left 57 people dead.Striking labor unions brought transport to a near-standstill, halting ferries to the islands and disrupting public transport.Thousands of people are expected outside parliament around midday to participate in protests.The collision between a passenger train carrying more than 350 people and a freight train last week was one of Greece's deadliest rail accidents. The crash killed several university students and injured dozens of others.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's center-right government has come under fire for initially blaming the collision on human error, but the prime minister later issued an apology saying, ""We cannot, will not, and must not hide behind human error.""Rail workers have been striking almost every day since the crash, saying their demands for improvement in safety protocols have gone unaddressed for years.The Greek government has requested assistance from European governments to modernize safety procedures on the relatively limited rail network.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said experts from the European Union Agency for Railways would visit Greece. They are expected to arrive in Athens on Wednesday.Greece's civil servants' union, Adady, has also called for a 24-hour walkout.""We will impose safe railways so that no one will ever experience the tragic accident at Temp ever again,"" a major railway union said in a statement. ""We have an obligation towards our fellow humans and our colleagues who were lost in the tragic accident.""Students and teachers' groups have said they will take part in rallies in Athens later today.""It's not the time to fall silent, it's time to speak up and fight,"" a teachers' union said in a statement.Mitsotakis, who faces elections before the summer, has pledged full cooperation with a judicial inquiry into the deadly crash.rm/sms (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829837,Georgia: Dozens arrested during 'foreign agent' law protest,"Officials in Georgia said that 66 people were arrested on Wednesday after protests against a controversial ""foreign agents"" draft law turned into clashes with police in the capital, Tbilisi.""Law enforcement detained 66 people in accordance with articles... on petty hooliganism and disobeying police,"" the Interior Ministry said, adding that some 50 police officers had also been injured.Protesters reportedly threw stones and petrol bombs and broke through barriers around the parliament building. Police deployed tear gas and water cannons.Thousands of people had taken to the streets after a majority of lawmakers backed draft legislation under the name ""On Transparency of Foreign Influence"" on Tuesday. Protesters say the law could be used to silence critics.It follows a similar law in Russia that has been used to shut down voices critical of the Kremlin and especially Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.If enacted, the Georgian law would see organizations, including media outlets, that receive more than 20% of their funding from outside of the former-Soviet republic being classed as ""foreign agents.Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili restated his support for the law on Tuesday during a visit to Berlin. He said it was in line with ""European and global standards.""Critics of the law have said that it will hinder their chances of joining the European Union, an opinion that has only been strengthened by comments from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. He called the draft legislation a ""very bad development,"" adding that it could hurt Georgia's ties with the bloc.President Salome Zourabichvili has also said she would veto the law if it reached her desk.""You represent a free Georgia, a Georgia which sees its future in the West, and won't let anyone to take this future away,"" she told protesters in a video recorded from the US during an official visit.The imitation of the Russian law has also fanned the flames due to the animosity many in Georgia feel towards their northern neighbor.Some protesters shouted ""No to the Russian law"" and ""You are Russian"" at lawmakers.Moscow backed separatists in the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the 1990s and occupied part of Georgia in 2008.ab/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829838,"EU defense ministers discuss 'war economy,' ammo for Ukraine","Defense ministers from the EU's 27 member states are meeting in the Swedish capital on Wednesday to debate plans to refill Ukraine's ammunition stockpiles from their own while also ramping up production within the bloc.The meeting comes amid concerns that Ukraine will run out of the 155-millimeter howitzer shells that have played a key role in the country's defense against the full-scale Russian invasion that began in February 2022.The EU ministers will discuss the possibility of sending €1 billion worth ($1.06 billion) of shells from their own stockpiles while at the same time considering how to ramp up the bloc's homegrown arms production capacities.Kyiv has been firing thousands of howitzer shells every day and is facing a critical shortage.The EU's short-term plan is to dip into the joint European Peace Facility fund to rapidly restock Ukraine's howitzer ammunition from the bloc's own stockpile.Officials have said that member states have enough shells that the deliveries to Ukraine would not leave them vulnerable to attack.The bloc also aims to incentivize arms manufacturers to ramp up production by putting in massive joint orders.But some member states have questioned whether this will be enough to support Ukraine's war effort.""According to Ukrainian needs, they would need at least 350,000 155-mm rounds per month,"" Madis Roll, a senior official at  Estonia's Defense Ministry, told the AFP news agency.""Therefore, Estonia has proposed the initiative to jointly procure at least 1 million 155-mm ammunition rounds to Ukraine, which is the absolute minimum military requirement for Ukraine.""This suggestion of joint procurement, similar to how vaccines were acquired during the coronavirus pandemic, has been backed by the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.Slovak Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad told DW that ""it will be easier if there were an entity, let's say the European Commission,"" to organize the procurement of ammunition which other countries could then join.He said this was due to different procurement laws among the member states and the fact that there aren't that many ""companies across the European Union who would be able to produce 155-milimeter ammunition.""Another source of tension within the EU has been the question of whether they should prioritize speed by purchasing arms and munitions from outside the bloc or whether the priority should be boosting the EU's own defense industry.Proponents of the latter point to the years of low investment since the end of the Cold War which have led to the current shortages.""European industry is not adapted for the needs of a high-intensity conflict,"" European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists Tuesday.""Our defence industry must quickly switch to 'war economy' mode,"" he added.Following Wednesday's meeting between defense ministers, officials say they hope for a finalized plan for sending ammunition to Ukraine to be agreed upon at a meeting of foreign ministers on March 20.Alexandra von Nahmen contributed reporting to this article.ab/sms (AFP, dpa)",2023/03/08,,

The COA is cooperating with the Japanese vending machine industry to try servicing Japanese customers with this new sales method.Japanese supermarket chain Olympic is already in contact with the COA, but it is not yet possible to evaluate the benefits of this new approach.FOODEX Japan is the largest food event in Asia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829886,Comparing the Rolex Submariner Kermit vs. Submariner Hulk: What’s the Difference?,"When it comes to green Rolex watches, there has always been confusion among the Hulk, Kermit, and Starbucks models. Perhaps, the most significant confusion lies between the Hulk and Kermit models of Rolex. While an experienced watch collector might pick up on the differences between these watches, a new collector or investor may not. Hence, in this article, we provide all the details pertaining to both these watch models by Rolex.Kermit and Hulk are the nicknames given to the Rolex Submariner green bezel watch. The Kermit model reference no. 16610LV was released in 2004 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Submariner model. This particular watch was produced in 2010 and was then replaced by the Rolex Submariner Hulk reference no. 116610LV.The Rolex Hulk was the first watch produced by the brand featuring a green bezel and dial. It was introduced as a replacement and improvement over the Kermit watch. Although at first glance you might think these watches are similar, there are notable differences.As mentioned above, a Rolex Hulk and a Rolex Kermit are both variants of the Submariner. These watches were introduced in different time periods and have impacted marketing differently. Therefore, we must understand all those aspects that made a Hulk watch different from Kermit.The following are the most prominent factors that vary between a Rolex Kermit watch and a Rolex Hulk.Rolex Kermit and Hulk have different bezel materials. Rolex Submariner reference no. 16610LV [Kermit] features a stainless steel bezel while the Hulk features a Cerachrom bezel. The difference between these two bezels is not very evident but can be noticed over a period of time.Based on tests conducted, a stainless steel bezel is more prone to scratches as compared to a Cerachrom-inserted bezel. Therefore, the durability of the Hulk is improved over the Kermit.Coming to the dial of the watch is where most people can make a noticeable difference. A Kermit watch features a simple glossy black dial, whereas the Hulk features an emerald green-colored dial.Although both the Submariner models feature the color green, there’s still a notable difference. The shade of green featured on a Rolex Hulk is more deep and dark.On the other hand, a Rolex Kermit has a lighter, lime-green tone on its bezel. Therefore, if you are looking for a green Rolex Submariner watch, perhaps, the preference comes down to the shade of green you choose.Something that most collectors are just learning is that the Hulk looks marginally larger as compared to the Hulk. Although both these models have the exact same diameter, the Submariner Hulk still looks larger in size.One of the main reasons why the Hulk looks bigger than the Rolex Kermit is because of the use of a special case typically referred to as the Rolex Super Case. This particular watch architecture provides the watch with a much more rugged outlook and also aids in the durability of the watch.Yes. The bracelet and clasp designs of Kermit and Hulk are also different. While the Kermit features an Oystersteel bracelet with a standard Oysterlock clasp, the Hulk is equipped with an Oysterlock Safety clasp. It also has something known as the Glidelock extension system, which enables instant adjustment of the bracelet up to 2 mm.Yes. Rolex Submariner reference no. 116610LV also known as the Hulk, was discontinued in 2020. The watch had maintained a strong streak of success for 10 years, since its launch in 2010. During its time, the Rolex Hulk had great demand only to multiply by a great margin post its discontinuation.Today, a Rolex Hulk watch sells for incredibly profitable prices in the secondary market. In the UAE, you can pick up a Rolex Hulk from a well-known pre-owned dealer for prices starting at AED 75,000 and going up to AED 110,000. If you are an avid watch collector and are thinking about buying a stunning watch for your collection, the Rolex Hulk is your best pick.Absolutely. You must definitely consider buying a Rolex Submariner Kermit if you are thinking of investing in a Rolex watch. It goes without saying that any and every watch made by Rolex showcases the highest standards of luxury watchmaking.Hence, if you are interested in acquiring a quirky-looking but premium watch, the Rolex Submariner Kermit is a great choice. The reference number of this particular watch is 16610LV.The Kermit was discontinued in 2010 and has since been available for sale in the pre-owned markets only. A Kermit watch is available for prices varying between AED 70,000 to AED 120,000. Perhaps, if you are interested in buying a Rolex Green watch, with a lighter tone, the Kermit is the watch to go for.The intent behind buying a Rolex watch differs from customer to customer. While some choose these watches as an asset for investment others purely buy them as collector’s pieces. The reason for which you want to buy a watch will determine the best choice for you. Based on the stats so far, the Rolex Hulk watch has performed substantially better than the Rolex Kermit in the pre-owned market.Therefore, based on your preference, you may choose between the Rolex Hulk or the Kermit model. Also, if you were to ask us our best pick, we would go with the Rolex Submariner Hulk.The watch is not only an upgrade over the Kermit but also features the right tint of green on its bezel and dial. Moreover, the watch is easily recognizable and highly lucrative, considering it as an investment. People from all over the world travel to the UAE to buy luxury watches, hence you should look into this market to find your desired Submariner model.",2023/03/08,127,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830003,Freiburg shedding underdog tag after careful growth,"For decades, modesty, continuity, and youth development have been central at SC Freiburg. The strategy is clearly working.Club President Eberhard Fugmann told DW that plenty of the credit belongs to their enigmatic frontman.""I can see a certain development within the last 10 years with Christian Streich being our head coach. Even with him we were relegated twice but we always came back. The last three seasons always being among the top 10, this tells me as well that we are not an underdog anymore.""The club from southwestern Germany's Black Forest are now grappling with a clash between their culture of humility and an unprecedented level of success. Everyone at the club still insists Bundesliga survival is the priority despite only one relegation since 2009. Though Freiburg has been progressing to bigger and better things, the club aren't quite ready to view themselves as a contender.""We should never forget that we started out as so-called underdogs. When we first won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1993, everybody expected it to be a one-season event and that's it,"" added Fugmann.""We wouldn't be the club we are without our history, without that tradition, without having that modesty. But today there is some sort of romantic notion to be being an underdog. We aren't the underdog anymore, no.""The continuity at the club is embodied on the pitch by captain and one-club man Christian Günter, who joined the academy at age 13. He strikes a cautionary tone when speaking to DW about the risks of success to the club's values.""Team spirit, solidarity, leaving your ego behind, all these sort of things… If we lose them, then we lose a bit of our identity and I believe we can't ever lose that. Should that ever happen, I say it's better to take a step back rather than lose that. You can grow, but always within reason.""Sporting Director Klemens Hartenbach also feels the recent results carry some danger: ""I don't want to be the person hitting the brakes. But while it's a positive period, it's also a dangerous one. Of course, the nectar is sweeter at the top of the table and it's incredibly fun playing internationally [in European competition]. But that can't ever become a pressured expectation for us.""So far, the changes at the club have been minimal. Hartenbach oversees transfers, together with head of sport Jochen Saier and coach Christian Streich, a trio the President refers to as ""the magic triangle"". In fact, Hartenbach and Streich were even roommates during their playing days.""This magic triangle is another example of the continuity in our club,"" said Fugmann. ""Christian Streich has been here for 25 years, Klemens Hartenbach and Christian Streich have been friends for just about the same number of years and Jochen Saier has been working for the club for the past 20 years. That's unique. And that's why any other club in Germany can't just copy the SC Freiburg model. Because it takes years and years to reach that level.""Streich is currently the Bundesliga's longest-serving coach, second to only Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid in terms of longevity in Europe's top five leagues. The ethos of continuity has its roots long before the current setup though.Achim Stocker was club president for 37 years, starting in 1972, and oversaw the coaching tenure of Volker Finke, who was in charge for just under 16 years. Both are German records.Hartenbach can tell the club is being viewed differently in recent seasons, especially when it comes to negotiations: ""Now when I pick up the phone, whether it's a colleague or an agent they say: 'You can't tell me about getting just 40 points and avoiding relegation anymore.'""But Freiburg have continued to sell off some of their top homegrown talents like Nico Schlotterbeck to Dortmund for €25 million ($26.4 million) in May 2022, with Kevin Schade set to earn them the same sum from English Premier League side Brentford at the end of the season.In October of 2021, Freiburg moved into their brand new 34,700-capacity Europa-Park Stadion, which is likely to impact their strategy in the coming seasons.""In the long run, we couldn't have survived in the first division, in the Bundesliga with the previous stadium,"" confesses Fugmann. ""This stadium finally offers financial possibilities that we've never had before.""Now that their continuity and modesty have paid dividends, Freiburg's next step could be bankrolled by the new stadium and regular European football. But for their sporting director, there is more to be gained from sticking to their current principles.""If the coach changes every half year because a club issues aims like qualifying for Europe or the Champions League and that's how the squad is strengthened… then young guys at certain clubs have a hard time taking the next step,"" said Hartenbach.""Our approach is that if a young player has the quality, we make it our mission to always integrate those youngsters gradually. That really motivates the players in the academy here.""The days of Freiburg being a plucky underdog seem to be over. Is that something people at the club still yearn for?""Not at all,"" said captain Günter.""I experienced several years here where you had incredible pressure to get points until the final matchday, otherwise you'd be relegated. There is more positive pressure now. The fans haven't changed at all though.""The club's president agrees, seeing the shedding of the underdog tag as a badge of honor.""I think the people working for the club can be proud of what it has reached over the years. It's an achievement not being an underdog anymore. That's part of our history which is very important.""Freiburg are one of the last four Bundesliga clubs to be 100% owned by their fans, and membership has more than doubled in the last five years. In the last six months alone, 10,000 new members joined, bringing the total to 50,000. For now, Freiburg are still a top six hopeful with the mentality of a relegation-threatened side. So where does the Sport-Club rank amongst their Bundesliga rivals?""We are not a big club, but in terms of the values we stand for we are a giant,"" Fugmann said. ""The ethos we stand for, our values, make us a big club. But in a metaphorical way, not in terms of our sheer size.""Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830004,How are China's neighbors viewing Beijing's military plans?,"At the opening of China's rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang announced an increase to the nation's military spending, pointing to ""escalating"" security threats from abroad.Beijing now plans to spend about 1.55 trillion yuan ($225 billion, €213 billion) on its military for the year, marking a 7.2 percent rise and the quickest rate of increase since 2019.The military must ""devote greater energy to training under combat conditions, and... strengthen military work in all directions and domains,"" Li said.China's defense spending still pales in comparison with the United States, which has allocated over $800 billion for its military this year.But Western analysts believe Beijing spends much more on defense than the officially announced sums.""China has embarked on a long-term, comprehensive military modernization and expansion program since 2000,"" said Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. ""I think the most recent budget increase for the PLA is very consistent with what we've seen over the last 22 years.”Tzu-Yun Su, an analyst at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan, said that China's defense spending plans reflect Beijing's intention to transform itself from being a land power to a naval power.""The Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea and the East China Sea will be the areas covered by the first stage of Beijing's military expansion,"" he said.""Then China will set its eyes on expanding to the 'second island chain,' where it wants to influence the rebalance of power,"" he added. The second island chain consists of the islands of Japan stretching to Guam and the islands of Micronesia.The boost to defense spending comes amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific.A number of countries, from Japan and South Korea to the Philippines, have been increasingly wary of Beijing's growing assertiveness and influence in the region.Their perceptions of increased threat to the regional security landscape have prompted them to focus on their defense preparedness and hike military spending.Japan, for instance, announced record military spending of 6.82 trillion yen ($51.7 billion, €49 billion) for the next year, an increase of around 26% from the previous year.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government also unveiled the nation's biggest military build-up since World War II, marking a dramatic shift away from seven decades of pacifism.The military reform plan will see Tokyo double defense spending to 2% of GDP and procure missiles that can strike ships or land-based targets 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) away.South Korea is also increasingly worried about China's military might, but Seoul's most immediate and pressing security challenge revolves around North Korea.Pyongyang has dramatically stepped up its aggressive maneuvers in recent months, with a record number of missile launches last year.""South Korea has to be more sensitive about the threat posed by China because of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, where China could intervene on the North's side in the event of a contingency, but Seoul is also reluctant to get involved in 'great power competition' between Beijing and Washington,"" said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a project assistant professor at the Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo.South Korea shares deep security ties with the US, but China is its most important trade partner — a situation that forces Seoul to walk a diplomatic tightrope to ensure good relations with both Washington and Beijing.While President Yoon Suk-yeol's administration has announced plans to increase military spending, most of the new equipment will be deployed to face the threats posed by North Korea.To counter China, Seoul is seeking to strengthen its security alliances. South Korea this week agreed to draw a line under a long-running dispute with Japan over grievances linked to Tokyo's brutal rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945 — a decision widely seen as a trade-off for better defense ties.""China's foreign policy assertiveness and increasing military spending are among the drivers of South Korea and Japan strategically improving relations,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, an associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.""The Yoon administration's new understanding with the Japanese government of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reflects a will to advance reconciliation and ensure that urgent cooperation for regional security is not held hostage to history.""Washington supports its allies in Asia in the interest of trilateral efforts to deal with various challenges posed by North Korea and China,"" he added. ""But a key question is whether leaders in Seoul and Tokyo will be able to complete the domestic political homework to make their international coordination sustainable.""Beijing's increasing military capabilities have also been a source of anxiety in Taiwan, which China views as its own territory and has vowed to bring under its control.Top American officials have repeatedly warned that China may invade the democratic self-ruled island in the coming years, pointing to Beijing's increasingly assertive military moves in the Taiwan Strait.According to the analyst Tzu-Yun Su, China's 2023 military spending is over 11 times that of Taiwan's, putting a lot of pressure on the territory's finances.""But since China has five combat zones, its defense resources will be more spread out,"" he pointed out.He called on Taiwan to fully adopt ""asymmetric warfare,"" something that even US officials have urged Taipei to do.""If Taiwan prioritizes investment in anti-ship missiles and air defense missiles, it will have a high chance of offsetting China's numerical advantage in its ammunition and military personnel,"" Su stressed.Tensions between China and the Philippines have also been on the rise in recent months.The Philippines has filed dozens of complaints against China's activities in the South China Sea, including accusing a Chinese vessel of using a ""military-grade laser"" against a Philippine patrol boat in the disputed waters.While China claims almost complete sovereignty over the sea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei all have overlapping claims to parts of the water body.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has vowed that his country ""will not lose one inch"" of territory. His administration has strengthened the military alliance between Manila and Washington, granting US troops access to four more military bases in the Southeast Asian country and resuming joint patrols in the South China Sea.INDSR expert Su said shared concern over China's growing aggressiveness and assertiveness might prompt countries in the region to consider the possibility of setting up something like a ""maritime NATO.""""Security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region is centered around the US, and in recent months, we've seen Washington strengthening bilateral military cooperation with countries like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines,"" he noted. ""These are important efforts to balance the power dynamics in the region and stop the expansion of China's maritime power.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830005,"India's domestic workers face abuse, exploitation","An educated and affluent Delhi-based couple was arrested last month on suspicion of assaulting, torturing and sexually harassing their 14-year-old domestic worker in the Delhi suburb of Gurugram.Authorities managed to rescue the girl after she was allegedly confined to the house for five months. Police claimed the child's injuries were consistent with torture.""The girl was being tortured and sexually harassed by the couple,"" assistant police commissioner Preet Pal Sangwan told DW. ""She was not given food and assaulted for no reason and there were injuries on her face and feet.""The recent case prompted comparisons with a separate case last year, when Seema Patra, a senior representative of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was arrested for allegedly physically abusing her domestic help in the eastern state of Jharkhand.The 29-year-old maid was allegedly beaten with a hot pan and iron rods. Civil society workers say she was tortured, and, at times, forced to lick the urine on the floor and locked in a room without food and water for days.While these cases prompted public outrage, they are believed to be symptomatic of abuse which happens in metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.There are widespread reports of domestic workers in India being underpaid, overworked, and abused by their employers. During the pandemic, many part-time workers lost their jobs and some live-in domestic workers found themselves trapped with abusive employers for months.For years, activists have pressed the government to implement protections for domestic workers. They are not recognized as formal workers under Indian labor laws, which means they do not have access to basic rights such as minimum wages, social security benefits, and protection against exploitation and abuse.""It is extremely frustrating to get the authorities to guarantee benefits and protection for these domestic workers. We run a helpline for them to report abuse but there are thousands who suffer silently,"" Anita Juneja of the Delhi Domestic Workers Union told DW.Juneja estimates there are between 800,000 to 1 million part-time domestic workers in New Delhi alone, together with about 150,000 working full time. The activists says the workers are vulnerable and therefore overworked and exploited, which is due to the lack of awareness about their rights and insufficient support structures.In many cases, it has been found that women workers who migrated from India's states of Jharkhand, Odisha, and central Chhattisgarh to India's metropolitan cities became victims of exploitation and forced labor. Such incidents were more common among underage workers.Recruiting agencies contribute to the exploitation by deceiving workers about job conditions as well as binding workers to the employer for lengthy periods of time.Sujata Mody is the president of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam (PTS), a trade union for women workers, and has been advocating for improving working conditions and living standards for over a decade in southern Tamil Nadu.She believes that domestic workers in Chennai face massive challenges due to evictions and relocations in slum settlements beyond the city.""Such workers lose their jobs, are unable to travel and manage their families. The city's housing policy saw a complete reversal because of this relocation. It led to a catastrophic fall in wages, living standards and transport-related accidents,"" Mody told DW.Rights organizations argue that the country has only two laws that view maids as workers — to a certain degree. Those laws are the Unorganized Workers' Social Security Act of 2008 and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013.While the first law is a social welfare scheme, the other aims to protect working women in general. Importantly, neither law recognizes domestic workers as having legal rights.It is for this reason that labor unions, civil society organizations and human rights groups have spared no efforts to advocate for the rights and protection of domestic workers. These efforts resulted in the adoption of the ILO Convention 189, an international document setting standards for domestic workers.India is a signatory to the document, known as the Convention on Domestic Workers, but has not ratified it yet.Most state governments have added domestic work to the list of scheduled employment, but implementation remains an issue.In 2020, the Indian parliament amended and consolidated old labor laws and passed the Code on Social Security with an aim to extend benefits like insurance, a retirement fund, and maternity assistance to laborers in some informal arrangements.But it has not helped domestic workers because individual households are not recognized as workplaces. Moreover, only a small fraction of domestic workers in the country are unionized or part of organized groups, leaving a huge swathe of workers at the mercy of their employers.""What needs to be done urgently is an interim code of practice to be made mandatory on employers and a grievance redressal mechanism with involvement of all stakeholders,"" Geeta Menon, a veteran social activist and joint secretary of Domestic Workers Rights Union, told DW.""Authorities must activate the defunct welfare boards, and quickly act on raising resources for ensuring social security benefits to domestic workers,"" said Menon.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830006,Iran sentences French-Irish national to 6.5 years in prison,"An Irish-French citizen, Bernard Phelan, is facing six and a half years in prison after Iranian authorities detained him in October on national security charges, his sister said in a statement.Phelan's family, who said that ""his life is in danger,"" have expressed concerns over his health.Early in October, Phelan — a travel consultant based in Paris — was arrested in the northeastern city of Mashhad as anti-government demonstrations  erupted nationwide.He was indicted for taking photographs of a burned mosque and police officers and sending them to a British newspaper.He has also been accused of stealing 900-year-old pottery pieces from a village.Phelan and his family have denied the charges.At the first hearing held on February 20, where a state-appointed lawyer represented him, he was convicted to three and a half years in prison.The duration of the sentence accounted for his health issues and age.But on February 26, a second hearing was held where the sentence was increased to six and a half years.Phelan's health has ""deteriorated considerably"" during imprisonment according to his family.He requires regular supplements for his heart condition, and his family is concerned that his supplies will soon finish.Phelan's sister said that his eyesight is deteriorating.Due to his heart condition, France has requested Iranian authorities to provide urgent medical care for Phelan.An official from Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs also expressed the government's concern over the case due to Phelan's physical condition.Over the past few years, Iran has arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners on suspicions of involvement in security and espionage-related activities.Currently, six French citizens are detained in prisons by the Iranian government according to the French Foreign Ministry, who the ministry says are ""hostages.""Tehran has also been accused by human rights organizations of using such arrests as a means to gain diplomatic leverage from other countries.These claims have been denied by Iran, which does not recognize dual nationality.aa/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830007,Czech cyber watchdog calls TikTok a 'security threat',"The Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency has cautioned that TikTok is a security threat.TikTok, a Chinese video sharing app, has come under increased scrutiny recently in many countries over data handling procedures.The watchdog further warned that TikTok could pose a security threat if installed on 'devices accessing critical information and communication infrastructure.'Western countries are worried that the popular app may give Chinese authorities access to sensitive user data.""The agency is concerned about a potential security threat stemming from the use of TikTok primarily due to the amount of user data that is collected by the app as well as the way the data is handled,"" the regulator said.Further concerns stem from the fact that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance,""falls under the legal jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China.""The Czech cyber authority further added that ""Such large-scale data collection is concerning due to the legal and political environment of the People´s Republic of China (PRC), given that ByteDance, the developer and administrator of TikTok, falls under the legal jurisdiction of the PRC.""Politicians and officials were advised against using the app, and the wider public was urged to consider whether to use the app as well.ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has previously said that concerns about the app are fueled by misinformation and has denied using the app for spying on Westerners.Beijing on the other hand has denied having any intentions of using the app for espionage purposes.The Czech Republic joins a list of several countries that have taken steps to limit TikTok´s use.The U.S. gave a 30-day limit last month to remove the app from all federal devices and systems.The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU Council have banned TikTok from all staff phones.Canada and Denmark have also barred their staff from having TikTok on their phones.In an earlier report released in 2022, the Czech national intelligence agency based in Prague named China as a major threat targeting Czech cyberspace.dmn/ar (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/08,,

They even carried out an operation across three countries which resulted in the recovery of some of the diamonds.But it remains unclear if the mastermind behind the operation, or the rest of the loot, will ever be found.ab/ar (AP, dpa)",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830009,International Women's Day: A fight for freedom,"Women around the world are celebrating International Women's Day on Wednesday.The annual event on March 8 has its roots in the socialist and labor movements of the 20th century in the US and celebrates the social, economic and political achievements of women or the fight for it, as in Iran or Afghanistan.Iranian women filmmakers have been exploring their country through films for years, determined to amplify the voices and lives of women in the country. One Iranian girl told DW, ""If freedom is not for anyone, if it's not for everyone.""In Afghanistan, Taliban rulers have banned women from attending universities as well as middle and high school.At an International Women's Day event in Berlin, Afghan women in Germany and Netherlands urged the government to intensify its efforts in bringing Afghans to Germany.In Mexico, women marched in protest against gender violence that has intesified in recent years. Government data shows that more than 10 females are slain on average every day in Mexico, making it one of the dangerous countries in the world for girls and women.In Indonesia, people took to the streets to demand higher minimum wages for women as well as an end to physical and emotional violence against women.In Berlin, where the day is a bank holiday, women took to the streets to show solidarity with Ukrainian women caught up in the war wtih Russia.Almost one in two African women has experience violence at some point in her life, with a 2020 study showing that 44% of African women experience gender-based violence. African filmamkers are determined to hold up the mirror to reveal the characters of their movies: the strong women watching their films in the audience.While women are pushing for equal rights, there's still a long way to go.In China, wives of detained human rights lawyers are taking matters into their hands. They are speaking out against the Chinese government's abuses on socia media and in interviews, even though its dangerous for them.In India, the fight to protect domestic workers, many of whom are underpaid and abused, goes on. On the political level, fight for political respresentation also continues.On the national level, many European countries are adopting feminist foreign policies, with Germany's minister for family affairs saying that ""the feminist perspective in this digital world is still lacking and, therefore, this meeting is so important because we put now in the female perspective in digitization, on the complete agenda.""The UN set this year's theme to ""DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality"" to highlight the role of innovative technology in promoting gender equality and meeting the developmental needs of women and girls.Even though women are entering the tech force in numbers, they often have to work harder to prove themselves because of their gender.There are some examples of progress when it comes to women's rights. Canada on Tuesday expunged historic indecency and anti-abortion laws targeting women and the LGBT community in a criminal justice reform that will allow people convicted under such offenses to clear their records.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged to ""work even harder"" to tackle gender inequality, including one of the world's gender pay gaps.Marches and other events are planned in Paris, Beirut, Baghdad, Istanbul, among other cities.rm/ar (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830010,Women's Day: Why so few women in India's state legislatures?,"India's northeastern state of Nagaland has passed an equality landmark this week by swearing in Salhoutuonuo Kruse, from the regional NDPP party, as its first female minister.Kruse is one of only two women in the state's 60-seat state legislature. She and her party colleague Hekani Jakhalu broke another taboo last week by becoming first female lawmakers in the state assembly.Nagaland-based journalist Monalisa Changkija called it the breaking of the ""bamboo ceiling.""Following the election of Jakhalu and Kruse, Changkija wrote in the Nagaland Page, a newspaper that she owns, edits and publishes, that ""the floodgate (…) in the decision-making at numerous levels has been opened for generations of women to come.""But despite the good news from Nagaland, the level of female representation in India's politics is dire.While female lawmakers hold less than 10% of seats in most state assemblies, the state of Mizoram and the union territory of Puducherry have none.According to data collated by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which measures women's political participation, India ranks at 141 globally with only 15.1% women representation in the lower and 13.8% in the upper houses of parliament, as of February 2023.Incidentally, Mizoram, which has no female lawmakers in its assembly, boasts the second-highest level of female literacy (89.4%) in India.Baryl Vanneihsangi Tlau, an elected member of the Aizawl Municipal Corporation in Mizoram, said the high literacy rate does not reflect the political reality, despite being a matter of pride.She said the patriarchal system deems that political institutions should be reserved for men only.""The unwritten law states that women belong within the four walls, while men dictate what happens in and outside the walls,"" Baryl Tlau said.Political experts say patriarchal norms have the ultimate sway over legislative representation.""Politics is a reflection of society and the patriarchy in society is even more amplified in politics,"" said Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder of Political Shakti, a group campaigning for more women lawmakers.Krishnaswamy pointed out that politics is a zero-sum game, and for that reason men refuse to share political power, or make room for women legislators. ""This means that women's voices go unheard,"" she said.Baryl Tlau said that women need to be made aware that politics is not a male dominion alone and ""both men and women have their places in it.""Activists say that boosting women's representation in politics will require a multi-faceted approach that involves changing societal attitudes, implementing policies and empowering women to take on leadership roles.Political parties and advocacy groups can help by providing women with training, mentorship and resources to support their campaigns. There is also a need to address inherent gender biases that may discourage women from running for office. This is especially true in the nomination process. Baryl Tlau said that political parties often parrot the line that they tried to nominate a woman electoral candidate but couldn't find ""a capable one.""Nagaland reporter Changkija comments on the same issue in her piece, asking for a ""more inclusive ticket distribution.""""So much more is expected of women than men simply because women are capable of so much more,"" she wrote.Tara Krishnaswamy notes the importance of laws that ensure more women in politics.""Many of the countries that rank above ours in the IPU rankings have some form of reservations for women — either for nominations for candidacy or for seats ­— to the highest legislative houses,"" said Krishnaswamy.In 2010, India's upper house of parliament passed the Women's Reservation Bill (WRB) ensuring the reservation of one-third of the seats in the country's national and state legislatures for women.The bill encountered significant resistance then, particularly from regional caste-based parties, who contended that it would only benefit privileged women and not those from marginalized communities.Critics even threatened to withdraw support for the then Congress Party-led coalition government if the bill was passed. But since the lawmakers in the lower house never voted on it, the bill has lapsed, and has not been reintroduced in parliament.Now, K. Kavitha, a political leader from the southern state of Telangana, is set to stage a day-long hunger strike in New Delhi this week to demand the introduction of the bill during the current parliamentary session.Kavitha points out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can pass the bill without opposition due to the majority his party enjoys in the legislature.One of the primary arguments against the WRB, especially by regional political parties, is that the bill will adversely impact marginalized communities, especially women.Krishnaswamy dismissed this notion and said the Supreme Court of India has said WRB is a horizontal reservation and not vertical reservation.In India, vertical reservations refer to the reservation system for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC). On the other hand, horizontal reservations cut through the vertical categories and provide benefits to specific groups such as women, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and the transgender community.Thus, the 33% reservation for women that the WRB calls for can be implemented to include women from marginalized groups.""Women's reservation must be inclusive of caste, religion, gender, all different kinds of women that we have in India, the strata of women that we have in India. So, it must be inclusive,"" Krishnaswamy said. ""It is not the reservation… that is going to create exclusivity. It is the mindset of the men that is the problem.""Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/08,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830011,Afghanistan: 'World's most repressive country' for women says UN,"Harsh restrictions on women's rights and the reversal of progress women and girls made in education, employment and public life make Afghanistan the ""world's most repressive country"" for women, the UN mission to Kabul said Wednesday, marking International Women's Day.""Afghanistan under the Taliban remains the most repressive country in the world regarding women's rights,"" the UN mission said.Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Kabul, added that ever since they returned to power, the Taliban have almost focused on imposing rules ""that leave most women and girls effectively trapped in their homes.""Afghanistan's 11.6 million women and girls require humanitarian aid, according to the UN statement.After their return to power in August 2021, the Taliban had initially promised a moderate system for protecting the rights of women and minorities. But later, the Islamist rulers returned to their strict and rigid interpretation of Islam reimposing restrictions on women.Education for girls beyond the sixth grade is currently banned under the hardline rule. Women have also been barred from visiting public spaces, including parks and gyms.The Taliban also ordered women to cover themselves head to toe in public. Females are not allowed to work in national and international organizations, including non-governmental organizations.Hafiza, a 22-year-old former law student, who now weaves carpets at a factory in Kabul after the ban, told the Associated Press: ""We all live like prisoners, we feel that we are caught in a cage.""Otunbayeva said, ""It has been distressing to witness their methodical, deliberate, and systematic efforts to push Afghan women and girls out of the public sphere.""Women outside of Afghanistan are also raising their voices and urging Western governments to speed up the aid process.At an International Women's Day event in Berlin, Afghan women residing in Germany and the Netherlands urged governments to intensify their efforts in bringing the Afghans to Germany, to rescue them from the Taliban.""We feel betrayed by Western states,"" stated a declaration signed by the group.Efforts made by the German government have not been enough, the group said.A special admission program is being set forth by Berlin to enable 1,000 asylum-seekers from Afghanistan to come to Germany every month.Activists, however, demanded the authorities increase this number and make the visa process simpler for applicants.They also asked for special protection for the women who escaped from the ""misogynistic"" Taliban regime.Despite international condemnation, the Taliban have maintained their stance on the restrictions.They claim that the bans are temporary and were put in place because women were not correctly following the Islamic dress code of wearing the hijab or the headscarf.Also, according to Taliban leaders, gender segregation rules were not being properly observed, which led to the curtailment of the public liberties of women.The Islamic fundamentalist regime has said  university education restrictions were enacted since some of the subjects taught in the institutions were not in line with their strict interpretation of Afghan and Islamic values.Afghanistan is currently suffering a humanitarian and hunger crisis that affects nearly 38 million people, according to aid agencies.The situation was further aggravated last year with the leadership's work ban on women, forcing many NGOs to shut down.Alison Davidian, the special representative for UN Women in Kabul, said the outcome of the current governmental policies ""impact all Afghans and will resonate throughout generations.""aa/sms (AFP, AP, dpa)",2023/03/08,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830045,Putin friend allegedly moved millions through Swiss accounts,"Russian cellist Sergey Roldugin allegedly moved millions of Swiss francs through Swiss bank accounts without proper checks, Swiss prosecutors said on Wednesday.Roldugin is a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the godfather of the leader's eldest daughter.Prosecutors made the comments in a trial of four bankers accused of helping Roldugin.The four bankers appeared at Zurich District Court and denied charges of lacking diligence in financial transactions.The hearing was then adjourned. A decision is scheduled for the end of the month.Prosecutors alleged that the bankers failed to sufficiently determine the identity of the owner of the funds.Public prosecutor Jan Hoffmann said that around 30 million Swiss francs ($31.84 million or €30.22 million) were involved in the case.""All the evidence runs contrary to Sergey Roldugin being the real owner of the assets,"" Hoffmann said. ""The bankers have not followed the rules and should therefore be punished.""Defense lawyer Bernhard Loetscher argued that doubts about the identity of the true owner of the funds were ""not enough from a criminal point of view.""The defense said it was ""plausible"" that Roldugin had accured his wealth as a friend of Putin, benefiting from beneficial financing and unsecured loans.Roldugin was named the owner of two accounts at Gazprombank Switzerland in 2014. He had no listed activity as a businessman.Putin has in the past said that Roldugin earned some money from a minority stake in a Russian company. The Kremlin has previously dismissed claims that the funds are linked to Putin.In 2016, the Panama Papers alleged that friends of Putin's funneled millions abroad and financial employees may have turned a blind eye to the funds.The cellist ended up on the sanctions list of a number of Western states, including Switzerland, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The US Treasury Department describes Roldugin as ""part of a system that manages President Putin's offshore wealth.""It is ""publicly known that Russian President Putin officially has an income of just over 100,000 Swiss francs and is not wealthy, but in fact has enormous assets managed by people close to him,"" the indictment at the Zurich District Court said.sdi/ar (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/08,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830074,Critics slam UK government proposals to curb migration,"The British government has unveiled a new proposal to prevent unauthorized immigration to the UK. ""They will not stop coming here until the world knows that if you enter Britain illegally you will be detained or swiftly removed,"" British Home Secretary Suella Braverman told Parliament on Tuesday. ""Removed back to your country if it is safe or to a safe third country like Rwanda,"" she continued.Tackling illegal migration to the UK is one of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's top priorities. For months, his government has come under pressure from some quarters because of rising numbers of migrants entering the country in small boats. In 2022, 45,000 migrants arrived after crossing the Channel, up from 30,000 in 2021.Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg intervened and brought about a halt to plans by the previous government to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda by plane.If the proposed legislation is approved, migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and arriving in Britain through unauthorized means will not be allowed to apply for asylum. They will be detained and then deported and will receive a lifetime ban on returning. They will not be able to obtain British citizenship in future.The home secretary explained that the new law would provide for the detention of people arriving for 28 days, ""without bail or judicial review."" She added that their subsequent deportation would only be suspended in exceptional cases, and specified that ""any other claim will be heard remotely, after removal.""Describing the proposals as ""robust and novel,"" she said she was ""confident that this bill is compatible with international obligations.""However, critics pointed out that this was not necessarily the case. The Refugee Council and other NGOs have denounced the proposals.Human rights expert Lena Riemer pointed out to DW that the UK was bound to the principles of international law, and that these stipulated ""that individuals seeking protection cannot be returned to a country where they are at risk of bodily harm."" She explained that whether the UK government proposals were possible would also depend on which country an individual might be sent to, and that Rwanda did not fulfil certain criteria.Talking to DW about the proposed legislation before it was unveiled, Rob McNeil from Oxford University's Migration Observatory agreed: ""The idea is that it would lead to the removal of people who arrive in the UK without the legal right to do so. The question is where would they go? There isn't a clear plan of the UK government where the people would go.""He added that there were also no agreements with countries of origin or even France, from which people trying to reach the UK often embark on their crossing of the Channel.""What we do know is that the (…) primary objective of this legislation is to deter people from making this dangerous journey,"" he said.Riemer referred to the Geneva Refugee Convention, which stipulates that refugees cannot be penalized for seeking protection in another country. ""If these people are deported without it being verified whether they are in need of protection, this too will be violated, in my view,"" she said.For now, the proposals still need approval from the Lower and Upper Houses of Parliament. A lot can still change in the course of this process, but whatever the outcome, McNeil is skeptical: ""What we do know that academic analysis shows (is) that there is not good evidence to support the idea that deterrence policies work effectively, quite often because people in the countries of departure are not conscious of the ins and outs of law in the countries to which they travel,"" he said.On Friday, Prime Minister Sunak will discuss the proposals with French President Emmanuel Macron at a bilateral summit between their two countries.Last November, Britain and France agreed to work together to thwart illegal migration, with their interior ministers signing a €72.2 million ($74.5 million) deal to increase the number of patrols along the French coast and promote more cooperation.""We have signed a new deal providing more technology and embedding British officers with French patrols,"" Braverman said this week. ""And I hope Friday's Anglo-French summit will further deepen that cooperation.""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/08,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830076,Görlach Global: There's a hint of truth in Xi's criticism of the US,"Chinese President Xi Jinping voiced rare direct criticism of the US as part of the National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing. He and his new foreign minister, Qin Gang, both recently accused the US of implementing a systematic policy of ""containment and suppression,"" threatening ""catastrophic consequences"" if this were to continue.For a while, China's US policy seemed headed in the direction of detente. Qin Gang, who has served as ambassador to the US, was supposed to build bridges. But as soon as a Chinese spy balloon was spotted over the US earlier this year, it became clear that relations had taken a different course. A meeting between Qin Gang and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was called off.Now, according to Chinese state media, Xi Jinping has told the National People's Congress that the US and its allies are encircling the People's Republic and hampering its economic progress. He is clearly mixing elements that do not necessarily belong together: the power of alliances and military strength on the one hand, and economic strength on the other.It is largely thanks to the US that China was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, a move that allowed it to become a veritable player in the world economy at the height of globalization in the 2000s.Washington was not acting altruistically and always had its own economic interests in mind but the development helped China, the world's factory, lift millions and millions of people out of abject poverty. Economic interdependence has existed between the two nations ever since. China needs the free world's markets of to sell its products, while the free world needs China to manufacture its products cheaply.With or without geopolitical rivalry, the two states found themselves at a moment of crisis that Asian heavyweights such as Taiwan and South Korea have also been confronted with: When a country's productivity rises, so does the cost of living and thus the cost of production.The rise of Taiwan and South Korea began with major changes in the agricultural sector, which then led to textiles and other sectors of production, until the two ultimately grew to become major high-tech players. Today, they are among the world's top microchip producers. But from Taipei to Seoul, life has become so expensive that young people are becoming less likely to have children and are beginning to fundamentally question the economic growth model of the past.China's Communist Party had intended for the People's Republic to follow a similar path but to remain a ""democratic dictatorship,"" unlike Taiwan and South Korea, which went from military dictatorships to democracies during their economic modernization in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the plan misfired: Productivity in China is no longer rising. In Xi's surveillance state, it is loyalty that counts, not competence, and people who live in constant fear of saying or doing the wrong thing cannot be drivers of innovation.The country's uniformity has long since reached the big tech companies as well. Instead of using technology made in China to promote the well-being and prosperity of the population, Beijing is developing increasingly pernicious surveillance and military technologies, which has led to the US wanting to ban them. Thus, the US is in a sense impeding the rise of China, as Xi said. But in doing so, it is doing itself and the world a favor because one look at Xinjiang shows where the country as a whole is heading. In this region of northwestern China, Xi Jinping and his cronies are effectively committing genocide against 10 million Uyghurs, who are deprived of their rights and monitored at their every turn, living in an open-air prison. Some 1 million are languishing in ""reeducation"" camps.Diplomatically and militarily, Xi's and Qin's statements reveal that the People's Republic is neither a regional leader nor a superpower. The US has sustained alliances with many of China's neighbors for decades: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Australia. All of these countries have recently sought closer proximity to the US as China's ruler becomes increasingly aggressive, threatening China's neighbors with military escalation if they do support his territorial claims, building new bases in the South China Sea, and investing heavily in the military.India and China already exchanged fire in 2020, with dead soldiers on both sides. The fear of China's vassal North Korea has also led to a rapprochement between erstwhile rivals Japan and South Korea, which are both allies of the US.Xi Jinping is thus lamenting the fact that the countries in China's vicinity are taking their fate into their own hands and trying to shape their future in accordance with the rights granted them by the UN Charter. Enter Taiwan, whose status remains unresolved. United Nations Resolution 2578, which states that the People's Republic is the only representative of China in the UN, leaves open the future of Taiwan, which has never been under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi Jinping has said that his ""rejuvenation"" policy will not be complete until Taiwan is annexed into the People's Republic. But just because an autocrat wants something, that does not mean it so.Beijing's strategy regarding Taiwan can be surmised from the way the Chinese Communist Party has behaved since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine: In a strategy paper published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, it is made clear that China would prefer a Russian victory. In barely veiled terms, NATO is blamed for the war, while Ukraine and Russia are held equally responsible.This is wrong: Russia attacked Ukraine. The free world is supporting Kyiv against the aggressor, in accordance with the Responsibility to Protect norm. But by constantly repeating falsehoods, Beijing hopes that over time it will be able to shape the debate equally and impose its view of the situation.In the same way, by constantly referring to the US presence in Asia, Beijing wants to present China as a victim and to ensure that any future military escalation in the western Pacific is regarded as an act of self-defense.Alexander Görlach is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs and a research associate at the Internet Institute at Oxford University. After residencies in Taiwan and Hong Kong, this part of the world — particularly the rise of China and what it means for the free world — has been his primary area of focus. He's also held various positions at Harvard and at Cambridge University.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/08,,

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. summoned China's ambassador to Manila and later said the Philippine military has shifted its focus from fighting Muslim and communist insurgents and other internal threats to external defense amid long-seething South China Sea territorial disputes.“I'd like to emphasize that the best way to address Chinese ‘gray zone’ activities in the West Philippine Sea is to expose it,” coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said, referring to China's use of ostensibly civilian fishing and research vessels to perform military tasks to avoid a military response from rival claimant states.Tarriela used the Philippine name for the stretch of the South China Sea close to its western coast. He spoke at a Manila forum about China's “gray zone” operations in the disputed sea.The Philippine coast guard's role as a mouthpiece against Chinese aggression “allows like-minded states to express condemnation and reproach which puts Beijing in a spotlight,” he said. “Chinese actions in the shadows are now checked, which also forced them to come out in the open or to publicly lie.""Tarriela said Manila's outrage over the laser-pointing incident prompted China, including its ambassador to Manila, to explain its position when asked about the incident at news conferences.Chinese officials said the Philippine patrol vessel trespassed into Chinese territory and that the Chinese coast guard acted “professionally and with restraint” and used a harmless laser to track the Philippine boat's movement.By making public unedited coast guard videos and photographs of such Chinese actions, “we can once again reshape public opinion to weigh things objectively based on facts and not just propaganda,” Tarriela said.The U.S. State Department reacted to the incident by saying that China's “dangerous operational behavior directly threatens regional peace and stability” and ""undermines the rules-based international order."" It renewed a warning that it would defend the Philippines, a treaty ally, if Filipino forces, aircraft and ships come under attack in the South China Sea.Raymond Powell, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel who has studied China's strategies, praised the Philippine coast guard's efforts to publicize China's actions in the South China Sea but warned that the Philippine government would come under Chinese pressure to ""stop making so much trouble, stop releasing things.”China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, putting it on a collision course with other claimants such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.Despite friendly overtures to Beijing by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his successor, Marcos Jr., who visited Beijing and met President Xi Jinping in January, tensions have persisted, resulting in a strengthening of the military alliance between the Philippines and the U.S.",2023/03/09,716,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830116,Taiwan suspects Chinese ships cut islands’ internet cables,"NANGAN, Taiwan (AP) — In the past month, bed and breakfast owner Chen Yu-lin had to tell his guests he couldn’t provide them with the internet.Others living on Matsu, one of Taiwan’s outlying islands closer to neighboring China, had to struggle with paying electricity bills, making a doctor’s appointment or receiving a package.For connecting to the outside world, Matsu’s 14,000 residents rely on two submarine internet cables leading to Taiwan’s main island. The National Communications Commission, citing the island’s telecom service, blamed two Chinese ships for cutting the cables. It said a Chinese fishing vessel is suspected of severing the first cable some 50 kilometers (31 miles) out at sea. Six days later, on Feb. 8, a Chinese cargo ship cut the second, NCC said.Taiwan’s government stopped short of calling it a deliberate act on the part of Beijing, and there was no direct evidence to show the Chinese ships were responsible.The islanders in the meantime were forced to hook up to a limited internet via microwave radio transmission, a more mature technology, as backup. It means one could wait hours to send a text. Calls would drop, and videos were unwatchable.“A lot of tourists would cancel their booking because there’s no internet. Nowadays, the internet plays a very large role in people’s lives,” said Chen, who lives in Beigan, one of Matsu’s main residential islands.Apart from disrupting lives, the loss of the internet cables, seemingly innocuous, has huge implications for national security.As the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shown, Russia has made taking out internet infrastructure one of the key parts of its strategy. Some experts suspect China may have cut the cables deliberately as part of its harassment of the self-ruled island it considers part of its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary.Couple takes photos near antiquated 240mm howitzer at observation deck at base turned into amuseum on Nangan Island. (AP photo)China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships toward Taiwan as part of tactics to intimidate the island’s democratic government. Concerns about China’s invasion, and Taiwan’s preparedness to withstand it, have increased since the war in Ukraine.The cables had been cut a total of 27 times in the past five years, but it was unclear which country the vessels hailed from, based on data from Chunghwa Telecom.Taiwan’s coast guard gave chase to the fishing vessel that cut the first cable on Feb. 2, but it went back to Chinese waters, according to an official who was briefed on the incident and was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Authorities found two Chinese ships in the area where the cables were cut, based on automated identification system data, similar to GPS, which shows a vessel’s location.“We can’t rule out that China destroyed these on purpose,” said Su Tzu-yun, a defense expert at the government think tank, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, citing a research that only China and Russia had the technical capabilities to do this. “Taiwan needs to invest more resources in repairing and protecting the cables.”Internet cables, which can be anywhere between 20 millimeters to 30 millimeters (0.79 inches to 1.18 inches) wide, are encased in steel armor in shallow waters where they’re more likely to run into ships. Despite the protection, cables can get cut quite easily by ships and their anchors, or fishing boats using steel nets.Even so, “this level of breakage is highly unusual for a cable, even in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait,” said Geoff Huston, chief scientist at Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a non-profit that manages and distributes Internet resources like IP addresses for the region.Without a stable internet, coffee shop owner Chiu Sih-chi said seeing the doctor for his toddler son’s cold became a hassle because first they had to visit the hospital to just get an appointment.A breakfast shop owner said she lost thousands of dollars in the past few weeks because she usually takes online orders. Customers would come to her stall expecting the food to be ready when she hadn’t even seen their messages.Faced with unusual difficulties, Matsu residents came up with all sorts of ways to organize their lives.One couple planned to deal with the coming peak season by having one person stay in Taiwan to access their reservation system and passing the information on to the other via text messages. Wife Lin Hsian-wen extended her vacation in Taiwan during the off-season when she heard the internet back home wasn’t working and is returning to Matsu later in the week.Some enterprising residents went across to the other shore to buy SIM cards from Chinese telecoms, though those only work well in the spots closer to the Chinese coast, which is only 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) away at its closest point.Others, like the bed and breakfast owner Tsao Li-yu, would go to Chunghwa Telecom’s office to use a Wi-Fi hot spot the company had set up for locals to use in the meantime.“I was going to work at (Chunghwa Telecom),” Tsao joked.Chunghwa had set up microwave transmission as backup for the residents. Broadcast from Yangmingshan, a mountain just outside of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the relay beams the signals some 200 kilometers (124 miles) across to Matsu. Since Sunday, speeds were noticeably faster, residents said.Telecom equipment seen on top of hill in Beigan, Matsu Islands on Sunday, March 5, 2023. (AP photo)Wang Chung Ming, the head of Lienchiang County, as the Matsu islands are officially called, said he and the legislator from Matsu went to Taipei shortly after the internet broke down to ask for help, and was told they would get priority in any future internet backup plans.Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs publicly asked for bids from low-Earth orbit satellite operators to provide the internet in a backup plan, after seeing Russia’s cyberattacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the head of the ministry, Audrey Tang, told The Washington Post last fall. Yet, the plan remains stalled as a law in Taiwan requires the providers to be at least 51% owned by a domestic shareholder.A spokesperson for the Digital Ministry directed questions about the progress of backup plans to the National Communications Commission. NCC said it will install a surveillance system for the undersea cables, while relying on microwave transmission as a backup option.Many Pacific island nations, before they started using internet cables, depended on satellites — and some still do — as backup, said Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications consultant from New Zealand who works across Asia and the Pacific.There’s also the question of cost. Repairing the cables is expensive, with an early estimate of $30 million New Taiwan Dollars ($1 million) for the work of the ships alone.“The Chinese boats that damaged the cables should be held accountable and pay compensation for the highly expensive repairs,” said Wen Lii, the head of the Matsu chapter of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.Wang, the head of Lienchiang County, said he had mentioned the cables on a recent visit to China, where he had met an executive from China Mobile. They offered to send technicians to help. But compensation, he said, will require providing hard proof on who did it.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a faxed request for comment.For now, the only thing residents can do is wait. The earliest cable-laying ships can come is April 20, because there are a limited number of vessels that can do the job.A month without functional internet has its upsides too. Chen Yu-lin, the bed and breakfast owner, has felt more at peace.It was hard in the first week, but Chen quickly got used to it. “From a life perspective, I think it’s much more comfortable because you get fewer calls,” he said, adding he was spending more time with his son, who usually is playing games online.At a web cafe where off-duty soldiers were playing offline games, the effect was the same.“Our relationships have become a bit closer,” said one soldier who only gave his first name, Samuel. “Because normally when there’s internet, everyone keeps to themselves, and now we’re more connected.”",2023/03/09,3167,Politics

            The charity event, held in partnership with SKAL International Taipei Club, was originally planned to be a cultural one, but after the earthquake occurred, it shifted its focus to affected Syrians. “The goal of the event was to spread awareness of the Syrian victims of the earthquake and to show Taiwan’s support and solidarity not only to Syria but all the countries that were affected by this earthquake,” according to the chamber of commerce.

            When the earthquake happened, the press only spoke about Turkey, chamber of commerce chairman Wael Hamouie said. “Nothing has been mentioned about Syria.”

            Hamouie said Syria is still suffering from a nine-year civil war and is now dealing with two challenges since the earthquake struck. Because of the war, Syria has no friends to help, he said. He lamented that the international community mostly provided aid to Turkey, while Syria barely received any assistance.











            The chairman said he wanted to raise money at the event to provide food and supplies for 700 families in Aleppo in a matter of two weeks. The boxes of supplies will have the name “Taiwan” clearly displayed, he added.

            “I want to let the people of Syria know that this is from the Taiwanese.”

            Hamouie mentioned that his office is currently working with multiple NGOs including the Red Crescent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830131,Few signs of US companies curbing profits after Powell says it could cool inflation,"NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week inflation could fall if companies curbed their profits - but the biggest U.S. retailers and consumer products makers have reported one key measure of profitability hardly budging in recent years.
Gross profit margins, watched closely by investors and measuring profits as a percentage of sales, have remained flat or slightly down at manufacturers and sellers of household basics like toilet paper and cereal.
Companies such as Tide maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) have passed through once-in-a-generation levels of price hikes to try to keep this metric of financial health steady as they face sky-high costs.
But Powell took aim at Corporate America this week, saying if companies and shareholders took less for themselves, inflation could fall and workers' wages may continue to rise.
Procter & Gamble's profit margins rose through the pandemic, and then inched lower last year. Walmart's margins have followed a similar pattern as it tries to keep prices low for consumers, and maintain traffic for its stores.
Kroger Co's (KR.N) margins also rose sharply in the pandemic, as food prices have spiked.
P&G, Kroger and Walmart did not immediately return requests for comment.
P&G executives said at an industry conference last month that as inflation continues, it becomes harder to increase prices.
Executives at Walmart said last month inflation in food and consumables has persisted, with food inflation higher than what they thought it would be.
U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative David Cicilline have taken companies to task over price hikes on items shoppers buy every day.
The situation is not unique to the United States, with data shared at a recent European Central Bank retreat showing companies there are profiting from high inflation.
""Corporate profits and higher margins have been a key driver of inflation and as they start to ease we will see lower prices in real life,"" said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative. ""What works going up, works coming down. If we see margins ease, companies bring prices down, we'll see lower inflation.""
Some manufacturers of household goods are easing price hikes. Ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co, (KHC.O) Clorox Co (CLX.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) have indicated they are pressing pause on further raising prices.
Clorox declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz and Pepsico did not immediately return a request for comment.
P&G and Stouffer's frozen meal maker Nestle SA (NESN.S) have said they are planning to continue increasing prices, even as shoppers are buying less and trimming their budgets. Nestle did not immediately return a request for comment.
Former Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said in the fall that retail margins - a measure of the price chains charge for a product compared to what they paid for it - have risen ""significantly more"" than wages for the typical store associate.
Lowering those margins could help reduce inflation pressures in consumer goods, she said.NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week inflation could fall if companies curbed their profits - but the biggest U.S. retailers and consumer products makers have reported one key measure of profitability hardly budging in recent years.Gross profit margins, watched closely by investors and measuring profits as a percentage of sales, have remained flat or slightly down at manufacturers and sellers of household basics like toilet paper and cereal.Companies such as Tide maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) have passed through once-in-a-generation levels of price hikes to try to keep this metric of financial health steady as they face sky-high costs.But Powell took aim at Corporate America this week, saying if companies and shareholders took less for themselves, inflation could fall and workers' wages may continue to rise.Procter & Gamble's profit margins rose through the pandemic, and then inched lower last year. Walmart's margins have followed a similar pattern as it tries to keep prices low for consumers, and maintain traffic for its stores.Kroger Co's (KR.N) margins also rose sharply in the pandemic, as food prices have spiked.P&G, Kroger and Walmart did not immediately return requests for comment.P&G executives said at an industry conference last month that as inflation continues, it becomes harder to increase prices.Executives at Walmart said last month inflation in food and consumables has persisted, with food inflation higher than what they thought it would be.U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative David Cicilline have taken companies to task over price hikes on items shoppers buy every day.The situation is not unique to the United States, with data shared at a recent European Central Bank retreat showing companies there are profiting from high inflation.""Corporate profits and higher margins have been a key driver of inflation and as they start to ease we will see lower prices in real life,"" said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative. ""What works going up, works coming down. If we see margins ease, companies bring prices down, we'll see lower inflation.""Some manufacturers of household goods are easing price hikes. Ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co, (KHC.O) Clorox Co (CLX.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) have indicated they are pressing pause on further raising prices.Clorox declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz and Pepsico did not immediately return a request for comment.P&G and Stouffer's frozen meal maker Nestle SA (NESN.S) have said they are planning to continue increasing prices, even as shoppers are buying less and trimming their budgets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830138,"Dutch to restrict semiconductor tech exports to China, joining US effort","AMSTERDAM/WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - The Netherlands' government on Wednesday said it plans new restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining the U.S. effort to curb chip exports to China.The announcement marked the first concrete move by the Dutch, who oversee essential chipmaking technology, toward adopting rules urged by Washington to hobble China's chipmaking industry and slow its military advances.The U.S. in October imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of American chipmaking tools to China, but for the restrictions to be effective it needs other key suppliers in the Netherlands and Japan, who produce key chipmaking technology, to agree. The allied countries have been in talks on the matter for months.Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher announced the decision in a letter to parliament, saying the restrictions will be introduced before the summer.Her letter did not name China, a key Dutch trading partner, nor did it name ASML Holding NV ASML.AS, Europe's largest tech firm and a major supplier to semiconductor manufacturers, but both will be affected. It specified one technology that will be impacted is ""DUV"" lithography systems, the second-most advanced machines that ASML sells to computer chip manufacturers.""Because the Netherlands considers it necessary on national security grounds to get this technology into oversight with the greatest of speed, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list,"" the letter said.A White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ASML said in a response it expects to have to apply for licenses to export the most advanced segment among its DUV machines, but that would not impact its 2023 financial guidance.ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, multimillion dollar machines that use powerful lasers to create the minute circuitry of computer chips.The company expects sales in China to remain about flat at 2.2 billion euros in 2023 -- implying relative shrinkage, as the company expects overall sales to grow by 25%. Major ASML customers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and Intel Corp INTC.O are engaged in capacity expansion.ASML has never sold its most advanced ""EUV"" machines to customers in China, and the bulk of its ""DUV"" sales in China go to relatively less advanced chipmakers. Its biggest South Korean customers, Samsung and SK Hynix 000660.KS both have significant manufacturing capacity in China.The Dutch announcement leaves major questions unanswered, including whether ASML will be able to service the more than 8 billion euros worth of DUV machines it has sold to customers in China since 2014.Schreinemacher said the Dutch government had decided on measures ""as carefully and precisely as possible ... to avoid unnecessary disruption of value chains.""""It is for companies of importance to know what they are facing and to have time to adjust to new rules,"" she wrote.Japan is expected to issue an update on its chip equipment export policies as soon as this week.",2023/03/09,294,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830149,Thailand to escalate the creative economy through Bangkok Design Week,"Bangkok Design Week 2023 event aims to promote ongoing development and encourage economic growth within the Bangkok area. The event has continued to play an essential role in promoting creative industry and generating economic value for the country.

BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 - Thailand has rapidly expanded throughout the years in all dimensions – economy, social, environment, science and energy. When the Royal Thai Government has included Creative Economy in the country’s strategic plan as a tool to scale up development, it acts as a call for commitment, collaboration and support from all sectors of the economy under the supervision of the Creative Economy Agency (public organization) or CEA.            Entrusted with the responsibilities of driving the creative economy forward, CEA has organized a number of events and campaigns bringing together think tanks and experts, talents and creative minds to share their insights, explore best practices and address a common ground for future growth since it launched in 2019. The three main annual projects under design week platforms that contribute to Thailand’s GDP each year are Bangkok Design Week, Chiang Mai Design Week, and Isan Creative Festival. For Bangkok Design Week 2023 which was held for the 6th time, CEA also aims to attract interests and inspire those involved to join together in developing the city of Bangkok to become an even more friendly place for all highlighting six essential dimensions - environment, travelers, culture, business, community and diversity. Over 530 programs were organized featuring four key activities namely showcases and exhibitions, talks and workshops, events and programs, and creative market platforms and promotions to provide business opportunities and generate income and those related to atmosphere and environment. The activities brought together the cooperation of some 60 private and public entities and over 2,000 creative individuals including international creative industries, Taiwan and Moscow also took part in this event showcasing their exhibition.   Addressing the opening of the recent Bangkok Design Week 2023, Mr. Chakrit Pichyangkul, Executive Director of the Creative Economy Agency explained that CEA is working in support of the government’s policy in driving Thailand’s creative economy through creative individuals, businesses and places. The Thailand Creative District Network (TCDN) project was launched in response to the creative areas element with the Bangkok Design Week event as one of the essential platforms. The past five Bangkok Design Weeks during 2018 - 2022 helped generate an economic value of some 1.368 billion Baht (40 million US dollars) and were attended by over 1.75 million visitors.   The Bangkok Design Week 2023 event in February was organized under the concept “urban’NICE’zation”, placing special emphasis on design and creative concepts/ideas to improve living conditions and surrounding areas of Bangkok.  “Corresponding with the goals of the network, Bangkok Design Week 2023 event aims to promote ongoing development and encourage economic growth within the Bangkok area. The event has continued to play an essential role in promoting creative industry and generating economic value for the country” said Mr. Chakrit Pichyangkul.   The Royal Thai Government is also pleased to announce that since 2019 Bangkok was designated as a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) under the Design category (UCCN – Bangkok City of Design). In conjunction with the Bangkok Design Week 2023, the Bangkok Creative City Dialogue, an equally important event was held, bringing together member cities from the Asian and European regions including the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom. This is an arena where they shared their insights and experiences, on “Becoming and Creating Impact as a Creative City” on issues related to the category each city was named for such as design, gastronomy, and crafts and folk art. An aspect of culture was included in the discussion as it has become an increasingly critical issue in strengthening international relations, driving business and future economic expansion.   Representing Thailand at the Bangkok Creative City Dialogue was Mr. Pichit Virankabutra, Deputy Director of the Creative Economy Agency, reinforcing the ideas of using creativity to overcome the challenges of Bangkok under the topic “Transforming Bangkok with Design and Creativity”.  “Creativity will be an important element to make Bangkok an attractive place for living, investment and travel. Design has been highlighted as an element to help solve existing problems for Bangkok with the aim of promoting better welfare of the people. In doing so, plans were made focusing on four important dimensions of the city. First, City design focuses on increasing green areas and effective use of available areas. Second, Social dimension with the use of the Traffy Fondue system designed by the National Science Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) where the public are able to take photos and notify the problems with immediate remedial actions. Third, Economic and wealth using the know-how of talented designers to promote business sustainability where CEA has worked with various organizations to ensure its continuity for other branches of businesses. Last but not least, Transportation under the Green City policy such as the introduction of electric boats to reduce water pollution. I am pleased to say that CEA has put together a Creative City Index to collect data of creative economy growth and factors that encourage creative economy in five key cities in Thailand. The lessons learned from data collection have been used to further develop other 33 cities through Thailand Creative District Network (TCDN)” said Mr. Pichit Virankabutra.   CEA and other related organizations are committed to putting together a robust framework and roadmap to success for Thailand’s creative economy, making Bangkok a hub for good living location, travel, and investment. And to position Bangkok on a global stage as the City of Design under the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.   For more information, please visit  www.cea.or.th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830182,Bayern Munich expose PSG as Messi departs the stage,"Thomas Müller summed it up in his post-game interview: ""I think the difference was that we were altogether the better team.""A simple sentence on the face of it but an acknowledgment of what makes Bayern Munich everything PSG are not. This isn’t a vintage edition of Bayern, who usually have the Bundesliga sewn up by about now, but they found the winning formula against a PSG team blessed with individual talent but cursed by a lack of cohesion.Bayern are a formidable force at home, having now won 16 of their last 18 Champions League games at the Allianz Arena, and while PSG accounted for the sole loss in that run two years ago, they never got close to derailing Bayern here.But Yann Sommer did his best to make it interesting. The Bayern goalkeeper is still finding his feet as the replacement for the injured Manuel Neuer and he sleepwalked into danger when he decided to dribble between Kylian Mbappe and Achraf Hakimi in his own box. That didn’t go well and for a horrifying moment it seemed like he’d put it on a plate for Vitinha – only for Bayern defender Matthijs de Ligt to have spotted the danger to clear with a vital intervention on the line.""My emotions were very negative when I saw (the mistake by Sommer) but then when I saw the shot on the goal and Matthijs fighting to get to the ball then my emotions were positive,"" Müller said of the game’s turning point.""You always need a big moment of luck in games like these. Matthijs cleared it off the line and that was a big moment for us and in the second half we deserved to win. Maybe we even deserved to score one or two more,"" Müller added.In the end it was two, but more wouldn’t have been flattering. Julian Nagelsmann’s side defended well, were controlled in midfield, and knew that while one goal would put PSG on the ropes, a second would be the knockout blow.The first came from Müller mugging Marco Verratti on the edge of the PSG box, allowing Leon Goretzka to put it on a plate for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who obliged from close range. Just as Kingsley Coman had come back to haunt PSG in Paris last month, this time it was the turn of the player who sat on the bench for PSG’s Champions League final defeat by Bayern in 2020.The second came late on the break and was a combination between the substitutes Joao Cancelo, who picked out Serge Gnabry for a pinpoint finish into the bottom corner to put PSG on the canvas.Lionel Messi spent the final few minutes of the game wandering around and scratching his head before walking off the field alone. At 35 and out of contract at the end of season, this may well have been his final act in a competition he has won four times. The lure of a distant land grows ever stronger for a player whose stunning career peaked in Doha in December and appears to be on a rapid slide with Paris.Even the great Messi can’t paper over the cracks of Project PSG, which has never looked further from a winning the Champions League. Neymar may be out for the season, the injured Presnel Kimpembe is a miss in defense, and captain Marquinhos limped off early. But for a club bankrolled by Qatar with unlimited blank cheques, one still expects more.PSG look like a team of strangers and misfits, ending the game with a 36-year-old in defense, a 35-year-old in attack and two 17-year-olds. Money can buy PSG anything but since the departure of sporting director Leonardo, the club appears to be a dysfunctional unit without a clear sporting vision. A marketing exercise that has lost its way.Bayern on the other hand know exactly what it takes to win these heavyweight contests and this victory has the potential to energize them for the key tests ahead.",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830187,Europe has second mildest winter on record — climate monitor,"Europe has had its second-warmest recorded winter, European Union scientists said on Wednesday, with above-average temperatures over eastern Europe and parts of north-eastern Europe.While the unusually mild winter offered some short-term relief amid high gas prices after Russia slashed fuel deliveries to Europe, the high temperatures attributed to man-made climate change pose a risk to wildlife and agriculture.Data published by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service showed the average temperature in Europe from December to February was 1.4 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average for the northern hemisphere.That makes it Europe's joint-second warmest winter on record, with only the winter of 2019-2020 proving even milder.February saw ""much above-average temperatures over eastern Europe and parts of north-eastern Europe,"" the Copernicus report said. Those high temperatures followed a severe winter heatwave in late December and early January. Record-high winter temperatures hit countries from France to Hungary and meant ski resorts had to be shuttered because of a lack of snow.The Copernicus researchers previously reported that the summer of 2022 was the hottest in Europe since their records began. Scientists link Europe's warmer periods over the long term to human-caused climate change.To some extent, the milder weather has been welcome, with European countries having feared they might run out of natural gas used to heat homes this winter in light of Russia switching off gas supplies to the continent.However, milder winters can have an impact on farming and habitats as temperature spikes can cause plants to start growing prematurely or coax animals out of hibernation early. That makes them vulnerable to being killed off by cold snaps later in the season.The Reuters news agency cited Tilly Collins, deputy director of Imperial College London's Centre for Environmental Policy, as saying plants and animals were struggling to move habitats to maintain their ideal temperature because of climate change.""For species with small populations or restricted ranges this can easily tip them on a path to extinction,"" Collins said.The Copernicus report also highlighted other climate-linked extremes, including a drop in Antarctic sea ice extent to its lowest February level since satellite data records began almost half a century ago.""Our latest data show that Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent in the 45-year satellite data record. These low sea ice conditions may have important implications for the stability of Antarctic ice shelves and ultimately for global sea level rise.""""Polar ice caps are a sensitive indicator of the climate crisis and it is important to closely monitor the changes occurring there,"" said Copernicus Deputy Director Samantha Burgess.Edited by: John Silk",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830188,China can use TikTok to drive Taiwan narrative in US before attack: FBI,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When expressing concerns about the threat to national security, FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday (March 8) said the Chinese government can control the data of millions of users in the U.S. through TikTok and use this to influence public discourse, including discussions about Taiwan.The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on global security threats on Wednesday. When Marco Rubio, committee vice chairman, asked the director whether the Chinese government through TikTok's parent company ByteDance can ""control data on millions of users,"" Wray replied ""Yes.""Rubio then asked if Beijing can utilize TikTok to ""control software on millions of devices,"" to which Wray also replied ""Yes."" The senator then asked whether China might leverage TikTok to ""drive narratives"" to divide the American public.Rubio asked if it is plausible that during preparations to invade Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use TikTok to ""make sure Americans are seeing videos arguing why Taiwan belongs to China"" and why the U.S. should not intervene. Wray again replied affirmatively and warned that there may not be many outward signs if such a propaganda campaign was launched.Wray stressed that what the American people need to understand is that while in the U.S., the distinction between the private sector and the public sector is sacrosanct, ""that's a line that is nonexistent in the way the CCP operates.""Responding to a request from Senator Michael Bennet to describe the dangers of TikTok to Americans, Wray said most Americans would object to handing their private data to the CCP if they were aware of this risk. Wray said the CCP can use TikTok user information to conduct big data operations that involve activities such as espionage and IP theft.Wray said that ""data is the coin of the realm"" and that ""those who have the best information have the power."" The FBI director then said that TikTok provides the CCP with three major digital weapons to conduct hostile actions against the U.S., including data, their recommendation algorithm, and software.He then explained that TikTok hands Beijing ""the control of the data, to conduct all sorts of big data operations, it's the control of the recommendation algorithm, which allows them to conduct influence operations, it's the control of the software, which allows them to then have access to millions of devices."" Combining those three elements together with the fact that it is a tool controlled by the CCP, ""and to me, it screams out with national security concerns.""A dozen U.S. senators introduced a bipartisan bill on Tuesday (March 7) titled the RESTRICT Act that would allow the government to issue bans on foreign-based technologies that pose a threat to U.S. national security, such as TikTok. Mark Warner, the bill's sponsor and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that this legislation enables the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose a number of restrictions, including prohibitions on foreign technology platforms such as TikTok that are used by foreign adversaries to pose an ""undue or unacceptable risk to national security.""White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also issued a special press release on Tuesday praising the bipartisan bill. Sullivan said in the statement that the bipartisan bill ""would empower the United States government to prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans’ sensitive data and our national security.""Today, #FBI Director Christopher Wray joined the directors of other U.S. intelligence agencies to testify on global security threats before the Senate Intelligence Committee. pic.twitter.com/qmWgqeAKwQDuring the discussion on the Chinese government during today's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, when asked about TikTok, #FBI Director Wray said that platforms within the control of the Chinese government pose a serious threat to American national security. pic.twitter.com/kKETsNe7Qw",2023/03/09,1626,Politics

            China Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Mao Ning (毛寧) said that China was ""seriously concerned” about Tsai’s travel plans to the U.S. and has lodged stern representations with Washington for clarification, per Up Media.

            Mao said that China “firmly opposes any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan.” “No one should underestimate the firm determination of the Chinese government and people to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she said.

            Mao added that the ""Taiwan independence forces"" threaten peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.











            On Tuesday (March 7), McCarthy confirmed his plans to meet with President Tsai during her trip to the U.S. this year, but he emphasized that the meeting does not mean he is ruling out a trip to Taiwan in the future.

            McCarthy said his meeting with Tsai ""has nothing to do with my travel, if I would go to Taiwan."" “China can’t tell me where and when I can go,"" he added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830201,Taiwan’s move to limit use of disposable toiletries criticized by hotels,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Hotels in Taiwan have voiced concern about the effectiveness of a policy to cut waste by providing disposable toiletries only when requested.A draft bill announced in January asks the hotel sector to stop providing single-use toiletries unless requested by guests from July 1. Some hotels oppose the measure, saying this creates a hassle for staff at a time of acute manpower shortages.“The measure will send hotel managers scrambling to deliver toiletries,” UDN quoted Hsu Mei-tzu (徐美子) from The Landis Taipei, a five-star hotel, as saying. Rather, the days of free toiletries should be in the past and the items should be charged and offered at check-in, some industry representatives urged at a meeting called by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) on the new rule on Wednesday (March 8).Providers of disposable toiletries have also blamed the government for introducing the measure abruptly, disregarding massive stockpiles. Meanwhile, more effort is needed to communicate the rule to both local and foreign visitors, said tourism officials and accommodation businesses.The EPA has promised a review of the draft and a one-year buffer period before it takes effect, per the Environmental Information Center. It stipulates restricted use of 11 items, including toothbrushes, razors, travel-sized (less than 180 ml) bottles of body wash and shampoo, and slippers.As part of the guidelines to enforce the Waste Disposal Act (廢棄物清理法), hotels will also be asked to implement a 5% discount on room rates following the waste-reducing measure.",2023/03/09,1342,Travel & Cuisine

As part of the Taiwan International Festival of Arts program, it is slated to take place at the National Theater and Concert Hall (NTCH) on Friday (March 10).Eyal explained that the theme for her work is always centered on love. The upcoming show takes inspiration from American novelist Yanagihara Hanya’s 2015 bestselling novel “A Little Life,” which was nominated for the Booker Prize.In a clip released by NTCH, the dancer said she loves clubbing and working with young musicians. When creating a new show, her free soul takes the reins. ""It is not about my mind, but my feelings, spirit, and dreams. It is more about letting go than knowing,” said Eyal.The eye-catching costumes for the show were designed by Dior’s creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, who brought life to 29 keywords, such as silence, emptiness, and impulse, provided by Eyal. Each outfit represents a different state that the heart can feel.“This work came from sad feelings, but it is a bit like when you cry like crazy and you feel like laughing. It is a combination of these extreme feelings,” said Eyal.Sharon Eyal.

Under the new plan, mild COVID cases would undergo zero days of quarantine and up to 10 days of self-health monitoring, depending on how soon they test negative.In addition, Wang said that the CECC was considering only reporting hospitalized patients with severe illness, while those with mild symptoms will not be required to report their positive test to the CECC. Meanwhile, acting Cabinet Spokesman Lo Ping-cheng (羅秉成) said that during a Cabinet meeting Chen said the pandemic has slowed down recently and Asia-Pacific countries have begun to relax their epidemic prevention measures.Chen noted cases did not rebound after the indoor mask mandate was lifted, while the CECC has launched a vaccination campaign to boost herd immunity. With these facts in mind, Chen said that it is time to expand the easing of epidemic prevention regulations.During the Cabinet meeting, Chen agreed with the CECC's plan to change the ""case definition"" for COVID as well as exempt mild cases from quarantine and reporting their positive results. He also agreed with the implementation of the ""0+n"" policy for self-health monitoring in mild cases.The premier expressed the hope that as the outbreak is brought under control, medical capacity can be maintained as people return to normal life.He said relevant details would be announced at a CECC press conference on Thursday. In addition, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labor will explain the policy on leave for self-health monitoring for students, faculty members, and the general public who test positive for COVID but are asymptomatic.",2023/03/09,1768,Society

(TSXV: GRB) (OTC Pink: GEBRF) (""Greenbriar"") is pleased to announce the following updates:   Sage Ranch  Greenbriar is providing our project lender all of the final Sage Ranch project documents for the first tranche of our USD $40 million project loan package. We expect to start construction a few weeks after the approval of the PDP and permits. The first tranche will include funding for all the onsite and offsite improvements including water purchases, grading, roads, traffic lights, sidewalks, sewer, water, dry electrical, parks, clubhouse, soccer field and swimming pool. Sage Ranch is moving ahead full speed. Greenbriar is working with engineers to have Sage Ranch certified as a green community due to solar panel roofs, smart meters, recycled gray water, all electric low energy use appliances, and location of adjacent high school, middle school and elementary school. (a near-zero driving carbon footprint)   Montalva Solar Project  Greenbriar has reviewed and approved the proposed settlement agreement.   On February 10, 2023, PBJL ENERGY (""Greenbriar"") and PREPA filed a Joint Motion with the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau stating that both parties are in the process of reaching an agreement in principle that would allow them to end the case shortly and to complete the process, including drafting the settlement agreement to obtain all the necessary regulatory approvals. Both parties are working in good faith to move the Montalva Project forward through the process within the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau.   Green Credit Program  Greenbriar executed several months ago a formal and substantial agreement to provide certified green credits to a leading on-line consumer company with millions of followers and potential customers. The program will formally launch in April, as the back-end accounting and systems was created to manage the program. Details of the program and its significance will be released in April.

            Pictured in floral print dresses, Otoboke Beaver does not hold back in attacking gender stereotypes, including domesticity and office life, and the arrogance of native English speakers.


Otoboke Beaver is busy creating an original sound. (Mayumi Hirata photo) 

            After releasing the album ""Itokema Hits"" in 2019, the band quit their day jobs to go on tour. The COVID pandemic briefly altered their plans, but with a new album ""Super Champon"" they are back with daily performances across the U.S. and Europe.











            Along the way, they have won over critics and fans, including the ""Godfather of Grunge"" Dave Grohl, who added a blurb to the band’s website: ""It will blow your mind, dude. It’s the most intense s@#! you have ever seen.”

            Taiwan News exchanged messages with Otoboke Beaver's guitarist and backup vocalist Yoyoyoshie about the band's current motivation.

Otoboke Beaver is the name of a love hotel. I checked it online. It looks cheap. Only 3 stars. Do you go there for rest? What is special about this love hotel?

            There was this hotel on the way to high school. This hotel is already gone. I've never been to a love hotel. I have a feeling that I want to try.

Do people throw bras and panties onstage when you play?

            I found a bra on stage in New York. We don't need bras and panties from strangers. I feel better when I see a mosh pit.

You started as a college rock band in 2009 doing love songs but now play loud and fast. What did your office workers think? Do you want to go back to comfortable office life?

            Balancing the company and the band was hard and busy, but it was also fun. I'm still good friends with my colleagues at that company. But I never wanted to go back.

You sing “I am not maternal, I give you puppy.” What does your mother think? 

            My family enjoys our songs and activities.

Another song goes, “Pardon? I don’t know what you mean … shut up!” Is this because people think foreigners are stupid?

            There were jerks pointing out our pronunciation and English in the YouTube comments section. Accorinrin got the idea from there and made this song.

You have a yakitori song and also a champon song. Will you do a sushi song? Maybe curry rice song?

            NO

What is the best thing about touring the U.S.? Do you like burgers or veggie burgers? Ramen?

            Kazama Ramen in Minneapolis is epic.

What do you like about Taiwan? We have good gyoza! Xiaolongbao!

            I love Taiwan!!!!! Yeah I love eating Taiwanese foods, going to live house, night clubs, and shopping!!!! And music is awesome, too. Touming Magazine is one of my favorite bands.

Do you always enjoy the show? 

            Yes, of course.

Thank you, I look forward to the show …

              Yes yes!

Other organized crime groups were later revealed to have hosted similar events, provoking public concern about their visibility.At Thursday’s regular weekly Cabinet meeting, Chen said police at every level should take action to counter such behavior. Officers should more frequently check criminals' gathering places and collect evidence about illegal activities.In addition to the Ministry of Interior overseeing the police, the Ministry of Justice should play its part by mobilizing prosecutors to step up their investigations into organized crime, a Cabinet spokesman quoted the premier as saying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830280,Cyber-Threat Detections Hit a Record-Breaking 146 billion in 2022,"Trend Micro annual roundup report warns of exponentially expanding attack surface

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 -  Trend Micro (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cybersecurity leader, today announced a massive 55% increase in overall threat detections in 2022 and a 242% surge in blocked malicious files, as threat actors indiscriminately targeted consumers and organizations across all sectors.   To read a full copy of the report,    Rethinking Tactics: 2022 Annual Cybersecurity Report, please visit: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/rethinking-tactics-annual-cybersecurity-roundup-2022   Jon Clay, VP of threat intelligence at Trend Micro: ""The unrivaled breadth of Trend Micro threat intelligence* reveals 2022 as a year when threat actors went 'all-in' to boost profits. A surge in backdoor detections is particularly concerning in showing us their success in making landfall inside networks. To manage risk effectively across a rapidly expanding attack surface, stretched security teams need a more streamlined, platform-based approach.""   The roundup report reveals several interesting trends for 2022 and beyond:   The top three MITRE ATT&CK techniques show us that threat actors are gaining initial access through remote services, then expanding their footprint within the environment through credential dumping to utilize valid accounts.   An 86% increase in backdoor malware detections reveals threat actors trying to maintain their presence inside networks for a future attack. These backdoors primarily targeted web server platform vulnerabilities.   A record number of Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisories (1,706) for the third year in a row is the result of a rapidly expanding corporate attack surface and researcher investment in automated analysis tools, which are finding more bugs. The number of critical vulnerabilities doubled in 2022. Two out of the top three CVEs reported in 2022 were related to Log4j.   The ZDI observed an increase in failed patches and confusing advisories, adding extra time and money to corporate remediation efforts and exposing organizations to unnecessary cyber risk.   Webshells were the top-detected malware of the year, surging 103% on 2021 figures. Emotet detections were second after undergoing something of a resurgence. LockBit and BlackCat were the top ransomware families of 2022.   Ransomware groups rebranded and diversified in a bid to address declining profits. In the future,  we expect these groups to move into adjacent areas that monetize initial access, such as stock fraud, business email compromise (BEC), money laundering, and cryptocurrency theft.   Trend Micro recommends that organizations adopt a platform-based approach to managing the cyber-attack surface, mitigate security skills shortages and coverage gaps, and minimize the costs associated with point solutions. This should cover the following:     Asset management. Examine assets and determine their criticality, any potential vulnerabilities, the level of threat activity, and how much threat intelligence is being gathered from the asset.     Cloud security. Ensure that cloud infrastructure is configured with security in mind to prevent attackers from capitalizing on known gaps and vulnerabilities.     Proper security protocols. Prioritize updating software as soon as possible to minimize the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Options such as virtual patching can help organizations until vendors provide official security updates.     Attack surface visibility. Monitor disparate technologies and networks within the organization, as well as any security system that protects them. It may be difficult to correlate different data points from siloed sources.     *  It covers endpoints (Android & iOS, IoT, IIoT, PCs, Macs, Linux, servers), email, web and network layers, OT networks, cloud, home networks, vulnerabilities, consumers, businesses, and governments globally.

Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Rubber Molding for the Automotive Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Rubber Molding for the Automotive Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2353Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Rubber Molding for the Automotive Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Rubber Molding for the Automotive market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830343,"Special Vehicle Tire Inflator Market Size, Growth Statistics, Share, Key Players, and Forecast 2028","In the past few years, the Special Vehicle Tire Inflator Market experienced a huge change under the influence of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine War, the global market size of Smart Generation Solutions reached $$ million $ in 2022 from $$ in 2017 with a CAGR of $$ from 2017-2022. Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Special Vehicle Tire Inflator Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Special Vehicle Tire Inflator Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2358Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Special Vehicle Tire Inflator Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Special Vehicle Tire Inflator market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Strategic Bomber Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Strategic Bomber Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2361Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Strategic Bomber Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Strategic Bomber market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Report Ocean predicts that the global Submarine Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) Systems Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2362Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery.

This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

UK Autodrive, a publicly funded consortium that includes Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, and TATA Motors, announced a new set of trials with a focus on self-driving cars and vehicles that can instantly share information with other motorists and city infrastructure. Recent testing and development signaling systems, that can be disseminated by emergency services – ambulances, fire trucks and police cars – to nearby drivers, advising about areas that should be avoided, are being developed.UK Autodrive is constantly looking at connected traffic lights that could help self-driving vehicles optimize their speed limits, avoid red lights and reduce congestion. The team’s autonomous vehicles are tied to a half-mile route in the city center, while a second group focused entirely on “connected” features navigate a longer six-mile course.
Initiatives are currently taken to make self-driving cars a reality very soon; the self-driving cars are expected to have a backup driver in case of an emergency. The test routes are small as of now. Milton Keynes, for instance, has been using the Lutz Pathfinder pod as a potential form of public transportation. A larger, four-person shuttle was also tested at the Greenwich Peninsula, while a self-driving van delivered groceries in the quiet neighborhood near Woolwich Arsenal station.Key growth factorso Demand for a connected driving experience is growing rapidly in this region.

Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Tire Balance Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Tire Balance Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2365Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Tire Balance Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Tire Balance market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Request To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: -https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/mvno-market/QI042The Global Mobile Virtual Network Operator Market is expected to reach USD 91.18 Bn by 2023 expanding, at a CAGR of 6%.The key players in the Global MVNO market are Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile USA, Lebara Group, Tracfone Wireless, Inc, Red Pocket Mobile, Tesco Mobile Ltd, Globecomm Systems, Inc, Drillisch Telecom, KDDI Mobile, and PosteMobile.Mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) resell wireless network communication services by using the infrastructure, licenses owned by a mobile network operator (MNO). The model benefits both the MVNO and MNO. MNO have extra unused network bandwidth which they provide at a lower price to a MVNO, to make optimum use of the network bandwidth. The MVNOs then offer these services to its customers.The MVNO operator business model and strategies are evolving with the changes in the industry dynamics and regulatory evolution. The players are shifting from the discount based approach to a value-added service with a focus on product innovation. Balancing cost and product differentiation are expected to have a significant impact on the current business model around the forecast period. The second brand and branded reseller business models are expected to witness faster growth in the developed region, such as Western Europe and North America, where the MVNO market reached more than 30% penetration in selected countries by 2015.Technical flexibilities are expected to be the significant factor driving the growth of this market. The year on year growth in the number of new telecom subscribers is expected to slow down considerably during the forecast period, because of the maturity of the telecom market. However, the growing demand for mobile internet in developing countries is expected to provide significant growth opportunities for vendors during the forecast period. The presence of more than 1,000 MVNOs globally in 2016, together accounted for around 10% of mobile subscribersDownload Free Sample of This Strategic Report -https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/mvno-market/QI042Key growth factorsThe growth of the MVNO market largely depends on the weakness of MNOs in their marketing and sales strategies in particular geographies. The successful MVNOs make optimum utilization of the existing telecom infrastructure according to geographies, such as channel infrastructure, media and telecoms brands, and current existing customers that of the MNOs.
Also, the success of MVNOs brands depends mainly on unique brand positioning and value proposition to attract target customers, with the likes of specific ethnic groups, including migrant workers and tourists. Proper identification of emerging niche telecom markets through innovative marketing channels which are beyond the reach of MNOs is expected to drive the MVNO market in that region. Segment-targeted pricing strategies and creative distribution tactics by the players of this industry in developed countries are also expected to drive the growth of the MVNO market worldwide.Threats and key playersAs the competition increases in the wireless industry, the markets are getting more saturated and innovation for product differentiation is becoming scarce, which will in all likelihood affect the MVNO players. Subscriber acquisition is already high, fueled by cheaper available handsets in the market other than those MVNOs can provide. Strong brand competition no longer guarantees success. However, affinity by a group of the customer base for a particular brand does exist. Monetizing brands is not that simple. All of these are seen as major challenges.What’s covered in the report?1. Overview of the Global MVNO market.

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/near-field-communication-market-1/QI042The global near field communication market is expected to have a significant compounded annual growth rate of 21.30% and reach a market size of USD 23.82 Bn by 2023.Key Companies Covered in the Near Field Communication Market Research are NXP Semiconductors, Broadcom, Gemalto, Inside Secure and other key market players.Near Field Communication is a technological innovation that uses magnetic field induction to allow communication between devices to exchange information when they are tapped together, or brought within a few centimetres of each other.The near field communication (NFC) market is gaining traction due to its broad adoption in smartphones and tablets. NFC is widely used to pair devices like headphones and speakers and to exchange data between smartphones/tablets or other NFC enabled devices.

Among these segments, the retail segment accounted for the most significant share of the market in 2017, as retailers like Burberry, Harvey Nichols, etc., are continuously adopting NFC technology to enhance shopping experiences in brick and mortar stores. Beyond reforming payments, NFC is creating opportunities for retailers to inform and persuade shoppers.By product type, the global near field communication market is categorized into NFC controller chips, NFC tags, NFC readers, and NFC secure elements. The NFC controller chips are expected to have the highest growth rate owing to its wide adoption in contactless payment systems within various industries.By mode of operation, the market is segmented into peer to peer, card emulation, and reader/writer segments. The peer to peer segment has the largest market share while the card emulation segment is expected to show the highest growth rate during the forecast period as card emulation mode provides the scope for an NFC enabled mobile device to function as a contactless smart card, and will go on to cater to the raised demand for making cashless transactions smoother in the near future.By regions, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Asia-Pacific is projected to grow with the highest CAGR through the forecast period of 2018-2023.Key growth factorsThe growing proliferation of smartphones across the globe and the demand for smooth and prompt cashless transactions are driving the near field communication market forward. Mobile transactions as a percentage of all retail store transactions have risen manifolds in developed countries over the last few years. The use of smart passes/cards while travelling within the transportation industry is also driving the market forward. Also, the integration of the NFC technology by Apple and Android is expected to create more scope for the development of the market.NFC technology is less prone to hacking compared to other forms of wireless connectivity solutions like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc., since NFC connections can be enabled only when two devices are brought close to one another, thus, driving the adoption of NFC in companies involved in money transactions.Threats and key playersAlthough the global near field communication market is expected to have significant growth, the biggest challenge to the growth of the market is low awareness among people of many regions about its uses. Also, the high cost of NFC chips often deters its adoption especially by those in developing regions of the world.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2370Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery.

Enterprise file-sharing products include security capabilities like authentication, data encryption, containerization, and tracking features to protect enterprise data. EFSS allows files to be stored in an approved data repository which can be remotely accessed by employees from personal computers, tablets or smartphones which support the EFSS product.The EFSS market is classified into four major segments by deployment, by component, by organisation size, and by end user industry verticals. Based on region, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa.
Based on deployment, the market is segmented into cloud, on-premises and hybrid.
Based on component, the sub-segments are integrated solutions, standalone solutions, and services.
Based on end user industry verticals, the market is segmented into software and technology, media, BFSI, healthcare, and others.Key growth factorsIT can do away with worries regarding unauthorised company file sharing, with the adoption of enterprise file sync and share. Administrators can set security parameters and create user account permissions to limit accessibility to sensitive data. Content is also typically encrypted when shared and scanned using antivirus software to minimize the risks of data leaks. These advantages increase the adoption of EFSS solutions and services in organisations. The implementation of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) programs in organisations, increasing penetration of smartphones across businesses, rise in mobile workforce, increasing collaboration between employees and enterprises, and stringent government regulations for data security are some of the drivers of the EFSS market.Download Free Sample Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/enterprise-file-synchronization-and-sharing-efss-market-1/QI042Threats and key playersRisk related to security and privacy of files and data, integration, control, compliance and regulatory issues are some of the reasons that may slow down the adoption of enterprise file sharing and synchronisation among various industry verticals and domains. According to Information Week, most organisations are unable to migrate all their files to Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing, and NAS vendors have been slow to use the technology. These challenges often cause files to end up in multiple repositories.Whats covered in the report?1. Overview of the global EFSS market

Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Truck Driving Recorder Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Truck Driving Recorder Market size will reach $$ million $in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2369Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Truck Driving Recorder Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Truck Driving Recorder market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830434,Taiwan’s overseas Mandarin learning centers hit by Chinese cyberattacks,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Mandarin education center in Paris came under Chinese cyberattacks last year amid Beijing’s ongoing “united front” campaigns, a Taiwanese official said on Thursday (March 9).Hsu Chia-ching (徐佳青), minister of the Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC), confirmed at a legislative briefing that the website and Facebook page of a Mandarin school in Paris sponsored by the Taiwanese government was hacked in April 2022. A French investigation pointed to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) overseas police stations as the culprit and that the institute has since improved its cybersecurity.The attack appeared to be part of the CCP’s drive to push political narratives in its favor and interfere with activities among local Taiwanese communities, she said. Similar incidents have also been reported in Australia, Canada, and Latin America, CNA quoted her as saying.L’Encrier Chinois, the attacked institute, had not experienced cyber threats in its 17 years of history until after it joined the network of the Taiwan Center for Mandarin Learning (TCML) in late 2021, said Lin Shu-ling (林淑琳), head of the school, in November. Attacks hit when new information was published on the school’s website and social media.TCML is an initiative that promotes Mandarin acquisition with Taiwanese characteristics and is touted as a “free and democratic alternative” for learners. The government eyes putting in place 100 TCML institutions across the U.S. and Europe by 2025.",2023/03/09,1400,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830439,Taiwan's banks must embrace FinTech,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Banks often get their basic Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations wrong, even without incorporating ESG reports.
Sometimes it is human failure to ensure all the necessary documents are obtained and maintained and this is caused by lack of oversight or even a lack of resources. One of the most common problems is keeping up with the ongoing reviews of existing customers based on their risk ratings.
High risk customers should be reviewed every 12 months, medium risk every three years, and low risk every five years. When you add the complexity of ESG reports into the review process, I become concerned about how banks will manage the process.

            Taiwan's banks rely on ""back office"" staff, but can they sustain or enlarge their workforces? Factors such as an aging workforce and a younger generation of bank employees should be considered.

            How should Taiwanese banks overcome the operational burden of ESG reports? We must look at FinTech solutions to find a third party system that will reduce the burden and meet regulatory expectations. Some banks may create their own proprietary FinTech solutions, but they are often extremely costly and never properly maintained.

            These are the ""bare bones"" of an ESG related FinTech solution. Taiwan's banks should seek to avoid the following:

A solution that fits their scale of operations but can be upscaled as per requirements
Ensure the solution contains data that meets globally recognized frameworks such as UN Sustainable Development Goals
There must be clear insight into the customer's business activity, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, geopolitical risk, due diligence and supply chain.
Be careful of any solution that relies solely on a questionnaire format, as this format has proven to be susceptible to greenwashing
Look for scoring based on fact rather than some corporate narrative
A solution that updates its scores regularly and avoids out-of-date data
Find a solution that covers all customers and remember there will also need to be a map of the customer supply chain 
The solution should provide an automated ESG score mapped to Taiwan's regulatory framework
With an automated assessment, the bank can focus its resources on customers with areas of concern and make best use of the bank's resources
If possible, find a solution provider that will allow the bank to give rated customers access to their ESG scoring tool
Access to the scoring tool allows customers to support their ESG rating growth, making them more attractive to investors and providing even cheaper access to financing












            Put simply, FinTech has the ability to provide efficient ESG reporting solutions. The future should see ESG scores and data points provided to retail bank customers, giving them the ability to make informed, sustainable lifestyle decisions. A future to look forward to.
Paul Shelton has a 30-year history in banking, working as head of Legal and Compliance and MLRO for the Asia Pacific branches of major international financial institutions in Japan, Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong.

The 26-year-old soldier is a member of the Lieyu Garrison Battalion and serves as a cook.The MND said Chen began serving in Kinmen in late April 2020. In the days leading up to his disappearance, Chen had been regularly reporting for duty and nothing appeared to be amiss when he retired to his quarters on Wednesday (March 8).Erdan Island covers an area of about 0.28 square kilometers and is about 800 meters away from Dadan Island, the latter of which opened to tours for Taiwanese in 2019. The two islands are about 12 km away from Kinmen's main island and about 4.4 km from China's Xiamen Island.",2023/03/09,2187,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830462,abrdn Islamic World Equity Fund marks its 10-year anniversary,"Shariah-compliant fund offers diversity, sustained growth and stability to face dynamic market conditions

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 - abrdn today marked the 10th anniversary of abrdn Islamic World Equity Fund. The fund is well diversified across multiple sectors and countries, providing investors with a combination of growth and stability in sectors such as IT, communications, consumer discretionary and health care.   Gerald Ambrose, CEO for abrdn Islamic Malaysia Sdn Bhd, said: ""Amid increasing geopolitical tension and economic uncertainty, we believe that it is important to invest in a globally diversified portfolio which can ride market volatility and capture growth potential. With compound growth of 7.2% per annum over the past 10 years, abrdn Islamic World Equity Fund has delivered sustained growth for Malaysian investors and allowed them to achieve long-term savings goals. I am confident that our award-winning team will continue to bring value for investors through all conditions for many decades more.""   Launched in February 2013, the Malaysia-domiciled global Islamic fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments in Shariah-compliant equities and equity-related securities. The MYR 577 million strategy[1] has dedicated resources in place including a Shariah compliance officer, plus Shariah screening and monitoring by an independent Shariah Adviser. Shariah-compliant companies typically have less debt compared with conventional firms, and companies that have less debt, particularly during downturns, can focus on their businesses with fewer concerns about their cash flows, hence are better positioned to offer steady growth for investors.   abrdn's bottom-up stock-picking approach allows the fund to invest in high quality companies that produce less volatile earnings streams, have greater margins of safety and can better navigate an uncertain future. This is achieved by drawing on the Group's expertise of a 120+ strong equity investment team operating across 13 markets worldwide [2], combining local insights with global perspectives. Research is fundamental to our investment process and the significant majority of our fundamental stock research is produced by our own investment professionals.   Martin Connaghan, co-manager of abrdn Islamic World Equity Fund and Investment Director of Global Equities, said: ""As we continue to face a challenging backdrop globally, we seek to maintain a diversified portfolio focused on businesses best positioned to manage financial pressures through to times of greater market stability. We believe periods of market weakness represent an opportunity for the long-term investor. Therefore, we reiterate the importance of a diversified portfolio with a bottom-up investment approach focused on quality characteristics. Come rain or shine, the portfolio aims to offer sustainable growth and stability when it matters most. Market downturns are unavoidable, however we embrace a team-based approach in an effort to capture the best Shariah-compliant investment opportunities for our clients, regardless of the external environment.""   abrdn opened its Kuala Lumpur office in 2005 and has over a decade of experience in managing global, regional and domestic Shariah portfolios, reaching an AUM of USD 800 million[3]  .

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830487,"Georgia withdraws 'foreign agents' bill, ruling party says","The ruling Georgian Dream party said Thursday that it was dropping a controversial bill on ""foreign agents."" The announcement came after two nights of violent protests and criticism that the draft law represented an authoritarian shift in the country.The Georgian Dream party said in a statement it would ""unconditionally withdraw the bill we supported without any reservations."" It cited the need to reduce confrontation in society.The proposed bill, similar to laws in Russia, would have classified non-governmental organizations and media outlets as ""foreign agents"" if they received 20% of their funding from abroad.The proposal was officially to target the disclosure of money flows from abroad, but protesters feared it would be used to harass government critics and clamp down on the opposition.Tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside the parliament building shortly after the bill received initial parliamentary approval on Tuesday.Protests were dispersed with 77 arrests, but reignited again on Wednesday night, seeing violent confrontations with the police on both nights.Some protesters used petrol bombs, stones and plastic bottles to attack security forces. Police responded with tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons to disperse the protests.The bill has garnered much criticism due to its similarity to a 2012 Russian law that also brands organizations receiving foreign funding as ""foreign agent."" The notorious Russian law has been used to crackdown on dissent, particularly since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.The Georgian government said the bill was modelled on US foreign agents law, which have been used since the 1930s.The Georgian Dream Party had previously defended the need for the law, arguing it would reveal critics of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The church is among Georgia's most powerful institutions.rmt/sms",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830488,Ukraine updates: Russia renews major missile attacks,"Russia unleashed a massive missile barrage on Thursday targeting infrastructure across cities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said early Thursday.Air raid sirens sounded across the country, including the capital, Kyiv. The wave of attacks is the first of its kind in three weeks.Ukrainian officials said that at least five people had been killed in the wave of attacks, four of which were killed in the western Lviv region and one in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, ""Two people were injured"" in the Svyatoshynsky district of the capital following the strikes. Officials added that 40% of households were without heating as electricity infrastructure had been hit.The governor of the northeastern Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said there had been more than 15 strikes on Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv. ""Objects of critical infrastructure are again in the crosshairs,"" Syniehubov said in a Telegram post.In the southern Odesa region, Governor Maksym Marchenk said energy facilities and residential buildings had been hit in strikes. ""Fortunately, there were no casualties,"" he said but added that ""power supply restrictions"" were in place.The attacks were reported to have struck a wide arc of other targets. Explosions were also reported in the cities of Chernihiv, Dnieper, Lutsk, and Rivne, as well as the western Lviv region.Moscow has been launching massive missile attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, in particular targeting energy infrastructure and often plunging whole cities into darkness, since last October.The barrages were initially weekly but eventually became more intermittent, leading to speculation that Moscow may be saving up ordnance. The last major wave was on February 16.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Thursday, March 9:The Ukrainian air force said that Russian forces fired 81 missiles — of which six were Kinzhal hypersonic missiles — and eight drones in its Thursday morning barrage.The statement also said that Ukraine shot down 34 missiles and four of the Iranian-made Shahed ""kamikaze"" drones. A further eight missiles and drones were prevented from hitting their targets, the air force added.Ukrainian air defenses are unable to intercept Kinzhal hypersonic missiles.In the wake of Russia's wave of airstrikes, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — the largest in Europe — has been left without power, Ukraine's nuclear energy operator Energoatom said.""The last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Ukrainian power system was cut off as a result of rocket attacks,"" they wrote in a statement.The plant is now running on diesel generators, with enough fuel for 10 days. The fifth and sixth reactors have also been shut down, Energeoatom said.""The countdown has begun. If it is impossible to renew the external power supply of the station during this time, an accident with radiation consequences for the whole world may occur,"" the operator said.Zaporizhzhia is occupied by Russian forces and Thursday marks the sixth time since the occupation began that the facility has lost power. Previous incidents have triggered a site inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Russia's own nuclear energy operator Rosenergoatom confirmed that power had been cut, but said that it was Ukraine that had cut the power.The European Union is looking at how to boost ammunition supplies in both the short and long term at a meeting in Stockholm. A top EU official has called for ""a war economy.""German authorities searched a vessel suspected of involvement in Nord Stream pipeline explosions, the German Prosecutors Office said. German ministers warned against hasty conclusions about responsibility for the blasts.EU countries agreed to buy more shells to help Ukraine but still have to work out the specifics.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830518,Frontier countries to suffer most if Fed rate gets to 6% - analysts,"NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Emerging markets are facing their demons as traders mull whether U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates will rise as high as 6%, a level that could kick weaker countries when they're down, while diverging global growth paths and China's reopening might cushion some of the blow for the bigger ones.
Expectations for where the Fed's terminal rate would peak have been rising at breakneck speed: Markets are pricing in a 5.5%-5.75% range for September, while the CME FedWatch toolshows a near 50% chance for the band to hit 6% that month.
The scale and pace of the move makes for uncomfortable reading for investors in developing stocks, bonds and currencies that have often buckled under rising global rates.
""The current repricing risk in the Fed's terminal fed funds rate to perhaps 6% in a short period of time is in the context of (the) response to inflation running stubbornly well-above target in a weakening global GDP growth environment,"" Satyam Panday, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings told Reuters.
""This mix is generally a net negative for emerging markets.""
Expectations for further Fed hikes had been for 25 basis point increments, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday brought a faster pace back to the table. Few expect a smooth ride for the remainder of the week, with the monthly U.S. jobs report for February providing markets with more evidence to chew over.
""Fed tightening towards 6% would firmly test historical 'pain thresholds' for emerging market assets,"" said UBS strategist Manik Narain in a note, predicting India's rupee, China's yuan and the Philippine and Chilean pesos could weaken as much as 5% if the Fed ramped up rates to 6%.
A recent Barclays analysis showed a 50 basis point Fed rate hike would increase interest rate volatility, which ""would be more destabilizing initially, as it typically comes with EM FX underperformance, which could trigger a further leg up in EM rates.""
Analysts at JPMorgan expect the dollar to weaken once the terminal rate stabilizes, but a 50-basis point Fed hike ""would be a regime-shift in favor of outsized USD-strength.""
FRONTIER PAIN
""Frontier markets is where you'll likely see the brunt of the hit"" of sharply rising rates, said Sahil Mahtani, multi-asset strategist at investment firm Ninety One.
The number of smaller, riskier emerging markets where investors demand a premium of 10 percentage points or more over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has remained broadly steady at around 30 countries, with a recent rally bringing no relief, analysts at Tellimer found. These countries, which include Kenya, Egypt and Pakistan, are essentially locked out of capital markets.
But local fixed-income markets in bigger developing economies are also set to feel the pinch. A 6% Fed rate environment alongside still-hot inflation does make short-term rates in Chile and India as well as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary most vulnerable, UBS found.
Flows to EMs soared in January but slowed to a crawl in February, signaling a warning to investors. Citi data showed on Monday that outflows resumed last week, with real money leaving Latin America and emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa while hot money, or speculative capital, left Asia and Latam.
Investors, especially on the equities side, could see China's reopening somewhat offsetting a looming downturn in the United States and some of Fed rates' historic weight on emerging markets.
Emerging stocks (.MSCIEF) are up just 2% this year after a combined 26% drop in the previous two and broadly lag developed peers. Chinese equities could provide a safe haven in a 6% fed funds rate scenario, UBS said.
The emerging market universe being more Asia-centric than in previous sharp increases of global rates means that investors can't ""look at the textbook of history"" according to Nuno Fernandes, a New York-based portfolio manager for GW&K’s Emerging Wealth Equity Strategy.
China accounts for nearly a third in the EM equity benchmark (.MSCIEF) and near 5% in the fixed-income hard-currency index (.JPMEGD), which is supportive of the asset class.
""Investors are conditioned to think that EM tail risk emerges in the context of aggressive U.S. rate hiking cycles,"" said Ninety One's Mahtani. ""I think it's dangerous to say this time is different, but it feels like it's not that mechanical this time.""NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Emerging markets are facing their demons as traders mull whether U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates will rise as high as 6%, a level that could kick weaker countries when they're down, while diverging global growth paths and China's reopening might cushion some of the blow for the bigger ones.Expectations for where the Fed's terminal rate would peak have been rising at breakneck speed: Markets are pricing in a 5.5%-5.75% range for September, while the CME FedWatch toolshows a near 50% chance for the band to hit 6% that month.The scale and pace of the move makes for uncomfortable reading for investors in developing stocks, bonds and currencies that have often buckled under rising global rates.""The current repricing risk in the Fed's terminal fed funds rate to perhaps 6% in a short period of time is in the context of (the) response to inflation running stubbornly well-above target in a weakening global GDP growth environment,"" Satyam Panday, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings told Reuters.""This mix is generally a net negative for emerging markets.""Expectations for further Fed hikes had been for 25 basis point increments, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday brought a faster pace back to the table. Few expect a smooth ride for the remainder of the week, with the monthly U.S. jobs report for February providing markets with more evidence to chew over.""Fed tightening towards 6% would firmly test historical 'pain thresholds' for emerging market assets,"" said UBS strategist Manik Narain in a note, predicting India's rupee, China's yuan and the Philippine and Chilean pesos could weaken as much as 5% if the Fed ramped up rates to 6%.A recent Barclays analysis showed a 50 basis point Fed rate hike would increase interest rate volatility, which ""would be more destabilizing initially, as it typically comes with EM FX underperformance, which could trigger a further leg up in EM rates.""Analysts at JPMorgan expect the dollar to weaken once the terminal rate stabilizes, but a 50-basis point Fed hike ""would be a regime-shift in favor of outsized USD-strength.""""Frontier markets is where you'll likely see the brunt of the hit"" of sharply rising rates, said Sahil Mahtani, multi-asset strategist at investment firm Ninety One.The number of smaller, riskier emerging markets where investors demand a premium of 10 percentage points or more over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has remained broadly steady at around 30 countries, with a recent rally bringing no relief, analysts at Tellimer found. These countries, which include Kenya, Egypt and Pakistan, are essentially locked out of capital markets.But local fixed-income markets in bigger developing economies are also set to feel the pinch. A 6% Fed rate environment alongside still-hot inflation does make short-term rates in Chile and India as well as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary most vulnerable, UBS found.Flows to EMs soared in January but slowed to a crawl in February, signaling a warning to investors. Citi data showed on Monday that outflows resumed last week, with real money leaving Latin America and emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa while hot money, or speculative capital, left Asia and Latam.Investors, especially on the equities side, could see China's reopening somewhat offsetting a looming downturn in the United States and some of Fed rates' historic weight on emerging markets.Emerging stocks (.MSCIEF) are up just 2% this year after a combined 26% drop in the previous two and broadly lag developed peers. Chinese equities could provide a safe haven in a 6% fed funds rate scenario, UBS said.The emerging market universe being more Asia-centric than in previous sharp increases of global rates means that investors can't ""look at the textbook of history"" according to Nuno Fernandes, a New York-based portfolio manager for GW&K’s Emerging Wealth Equity Strategy.China accounts for nearly a third in the EM equity benchmark (.MSCIEF) and near 5% in the fixed-income hard-currency index (.JPMEGD), which is supportive of the asset class.""Investors are conditioned to think that EM tail risk emerges in the context of aggressive U.S. rate hiking cycles,"" said Ninety One's Mahtani.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830519,Oscars 2023: raising the curtain on the recovery and risks in the entertainment industry,"Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) has insured five of the 10 movies nominated in the Oscars' Best Picture category this year         The recovery of the entertainment sector is well underway after the pandemic, but it is not immune to the current challenging economic environment         Health and safety protocols, crowd safety, more extreme weather and technology risks are key industry concerns while ESG has a growing influence.       SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 - With the Oscars taking place on March 12, all eyes are on the global entertainment industry. The glamour, revenues and audiences may all be returning post-pandemic, but the movie and live events business has yet to fully recover from the Covid crisis and is having to constantly evolve in a new environment driven by economic, technology and sustainability risk trends, according to insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS)' new  outlook for the sector. AGCS is a major player in the global entertainment insurance market and has insured five of the 10 movies nominated in the Oscars' Best Picture category  in 2023, continuing a long tradition of partnership with the film industry that goes back as far as the movies of Charlie Chaplin 100 years ago.   ""The entertainment industry had a very positive year in 2022 and a welcome recovery is definitely underway, but we are not out of the woods yet,"" says  Michael Furtschegger, Global Head of Entertainment at AGCS. ""In the three years since the coronavirus first hit the headlines, the world has changed. The sector must continue to evolve in line with new technologies, proliferating platforms, and seismic shifts in patterns of consumption, as well as changes in the public mood, particularly among younger generations.""   Despite the headwinds, consumers are heading back to their favorite entertainment venues or platforms in encouraging numbers.  Global box office receipts hit $25.9bn in 2022, reports Gower Street Analytics, a 27% gain on 2021, but still 35% behind the average for the three years before the pandemic (2017 to 2019). Live music revenue is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with digital music streaming subscriptions fueling growth in recorded music, where revenues are projected to reach $45.8bn in 2026, up from $36.1bn in 2021, according to  PwC. Live theater is also staging a comeback with rising receipts and attendances, while the global sports industry is proving particularly resilient supported by media rights, sponsorship deals, and a calendar of fixed international events and tournaments.   The big picture  However, as with other industry sectors, the entertainment sector is not immune to economic trends such as rising costs or staff shortages. ""Our entertainment clients are feeling the effects of inflation, with increased production and live-event costs.,"" Furtschegger explains. ""Staffing costs have risen following the skills shortage that occurred in the wake of the pandemic when many left the industry. Venues are scarcer than they were because there are still many shows postponed from the pandemic that need to take place in addition to new events and festivals. Bigger events may be thriving, but smaller events are more challenged by factors such as venue, transportation, and energy costs. We expect to see more consolidation in the industry, with smaller, struggling production companies and venues being bought by larger operators.""   Quality not quantity  Technology has lowered the barriers to entry for content creators, when almost anyone can upload to TikTok, YouTube or Instagram, while at the other end of the scale, the major studios and tech businesses are launching their own platforms. The sheer volume of content that is now being created and distributed makes quality a key differentiator in a crowded market.   ""We see a move towards quality in film production, but this doesn't come cheap,"" says  Wanda Phillips, Head of North America Entertainment Insurance at AGCS. ""Businesses need to know they have sufficient insurance cover for sophisticated productions. Where costs increase, so, too do exposures because the costs are higher with each day of shooting, and this could be reflected in any insurance loss.""   Getting vigilant about sustainability   There is a growing influence of ESG, or environmental, social, and governance issues on the sector. This year's Oscars ceremony will see green dresses on the red carpet as the Academy encourages a more responsible approach to awards-season fashion. In live events, British band Coldplay has pledged to halve the carbon emissions associated with its current 'Music of the Spheres' world tour, compared to 2016-2017, and has made a raft of sustainable commitments, including paying a surcharge for aviation fuel, sourcing ethical, sustainable merchandise, and planting a tree for every ticket sold.   ""Younger generations are particularly concerned about sustainability, and festival organizers are responding to this,"" says Furtschegger. ""More and more entertainment organizations are committing themselves to sustainability targets to reduce the emissions associated with live tours.""   The virtual future  With streaming now fundamental to the entertainment and media landscape, virtual conferences are a particular growth area. The  global virtual events market was valued at over $114bn in 2021 and is  expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.4% from 2022 to 2030. Even without a live audience, virtual conferences still carry risks, including transmission failure because of a weather event or natural catastrophe, fire affecting the broadcast unit, or network issues impacting broadcasting infrastructure. Rented equipment and studio space can also be vulnerable to property and casualty liabilities.   Reality and live content are also continuing to grow, facilitated by on-demand services and social media platforms. Virtual reality (VR) is the fastest-growing entertainment and media segment, reports  PwC, with global VR growth between 2021 and 2026 expected to bring the segment to $7.6bn. Gaming is forecast to be 85% of total VR revenue by 2026.   ""As the worlds of gaming, music and entertainment continue to converge, gaming platforms such as Fortnite and Roblox are increasingly serving as entertainment and social hubs, while gaming content is crossing over to social media and streaming platforms,"" says Furtschegger. HBO debuted 'The Last of Us', a video-game adaptation set in a post-apocalyptic world, in January 2023 to critical acclaim. Meanwhile, video games continue to develop as a spectator sport, with the total number of esports viewers worldwide possibly  exceeding 640 million by 2025 according to a recent report.   Emerging risks on the scene  Health and safety protocols, particularly in the event of future pandemics, increasing weather hazards and crowd safety are some of the key risk concerns that the entertainment industry needs to monitor closely. ""The Covid crisis and the recent tragic shooting incident on a film set have shown that the industry needs to remain vigilant about its health and safety protocols,"" says Furtschegger. Climate change is another cause for concern. ""We're seeing more abnormal weather-related events – heavy storms and flooding in Europe and bushfires in California, for example. These inevitably cause havoc for live events, both in terms of cancellation exposure but also damages and human safety.""   ""Crowds have always carried inherent risks,"" adds  Kurt Miner, Managing Director, Entertainment, at Allianz Risk Consulting, North America. ""Event organizers are now better able to monitor large groups of people and keep them safe, as well as artists, with the use of real-time video monitoring. Safety experts can remotely monitor two or three events, which could each be taking place over 15 acres or more, spotting risks concerns such as blocked exits or damaged barriers. They can also monitor social media to pre-empt gate-rushing and prevent stampedes, sending a security contingent to the location before the situation gets out of hand."" Slips and falls are the most common cause of claims from live-event policies, so organizers should ensure medical staff and transport to local medical facilities are on site.

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief, Azam Baki, did not give further details, but said the agency will issue a statement later on Thursday.
Muhyiddin, who was prime minister for 17 months between 2020 and 2021, arrived at the MACC offices on Thursday morning for questioning.
Muhyiddin and his party have faced graft investigations since losing to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in a tightly contested election in November.
Anwar last year ordered a review of government projects worth billions of dollars approved by Muhyiddin, including COVID-19 relief programmes, alleging they did not follow proper procedures.
Muhyiddin has previously denied the accusations, describing them as a political vendetta.
Anwar on Thursday said he has not interfered in graft investigations involving Muhyiddin, state media Bernama reported.
Two leaders belonging to Muhyiddin's party have been charged by the MACC with bribery over an economic recovery project launched by his government.
The MACC questioned Muhyiddin last month regarding the same project and has also frozen bank accounts belonging to Muhyiddin's party.

Yoon will hold a summit meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
""The visit... will be an important milestone in the improvement and development of relations between South Korea and Japan,"" Yoon's office said in a statement.
South Korea said on Monday that its companies would compensate victims of forced labour under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-1945, seeking to end a dispute that has undercut U.S.-led efforts to present a unified front against China and North Korea.

The Anal Fistula Treatment study also looks at the various regulations and policies that the firm has implemented. This report discusses the industry in terms of research technology and precise prospective utilization, innovation, and future advancements in the Anal Fistula Treatment.Global Anal Fistula Treatment Market is valued at approximately USD $ billion in 2021 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 3.8% over the forecast period 2022-2029. Anal fistula is a condition in which a tiny, tunnel-like structure forms between the anus and the point where the gut terminates. They arise when an infection spreads nearby to the area where an abscess is developing. After the abscess is removed, a condition develops where a little tunnel forms.Surgery is typically advised as a therapy for this, since the condition may be so uncomfortable, causing bowel incontinence, pain, fever, and other symptoms including irritation and aches and pains. The market growth is driven by key factors such as high incidence rate of anal fistula and recurrence rate and rising cases of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Such As Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.The market for anal fistula treatment is predicted to expand quickly because of the rise in inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, the introduction of new products, and the increased popularity of non-surgical treatments like fibrin glue injection and adipose-derived stem cell therapy. For instance, study conducted in 2022 by researchers at the University of Nottingham with funding from Crohn’s & Colitis UK and Coeliac UK revealed that Crohn’s and Colitis are far more common than initially assumed in the population of the United Kingdom (UK).Request For a Free Sample Report- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw6888According to the same survey, 1 in every 123 individuals in the UK suffers from ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease.

Report Ocean predicts that the global market size will reach (2028 Market size) million $in 2028 with a CAGR of % from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830615,"Port Equipment Tire Market Size, Predicted to Witness Steady Growth During the Forecast Period 2022 to 2028","In the past few years, the Port Equipment Tire Market experienced a huge change under the influence of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine War, the global market size of Smart Generation Solutions reached $$ million $ in 2022 from $$ in 2017 with a CAGR of $$ from 2017-2022. Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Port Equipment Tire Market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Port Equipment Tire Market size will reach $$ million $ in 2028 with a CAGR of $$% from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.us/sample-request/report_id/BIS2346Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Port Equipment Tire Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Port Equipment Tire market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830650,The Mystery of Facebook Profile Lock Absence on iPhone Unveiled,"If you’re an iPhone user and have ever attempted to lock your Facebook profile, the feature may have been missing from the app. This has been a mystery for many users as this feature can be found on Android versions of the same app and why Facebook profile lock is not available on iPhone. Fortunately, an explanation has recently been provided as to why this feature is unavailable to iPhone users.Facebook profile lock is a feature that enables users to prevent those not their friends on the platform from viewing their profile picture and cover photo, nor enlarging them. It’s an essential privacy measure for those wanting to keep personal information hidden from strangers or potential stalkers. Unfortunately, iPhone users have been unable to access this feature for some time on the app.This is due to an iOS feature called App Tracking Transparency, introduced in iOS 14.5. This requires apps to request permission from users before tracking their activity across different apps and websites. Facebook has vocally opposed this measure as it hinders its ability to collect user data and target ads efficiently.Facebook has had to modify its app in order to meet the new regulations, resulting in the absence of the profile lock feature on the iPhone. A spokesperson from Facebook stated, “We are working with Apple on bringing this feature to iPhone users at some point in the future; however, we do not have an estimated timeline at present.”Facebook may want to collect user data for its advertising needs, but it is essential that user privacy and security come first. A profile lock feature is an indispensable tool for those who wish to control who can view their personal information; thus, its availability across all platforms should be ensured.iPhone users can still take advantage of this feature through their mobile browser. Simply log in to your Facebook account on Safari or another browser, go to your profile picture, select “More,” and then choose “Lock Profile” to activate it.Finally, the mystery of why the Facebook profile lock is missing from the iPhone has been solved: it’s due to iOS App Tracking Transparency. While it may be frustrating that this feature is currently unavailable in the app, it is essential for protecting user privacy and security. Hopefully, Facebook and Apple can work together again soon to bring back this feature for iPhone users.",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830671,77% of Americans view Taiwan favorably,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — More than three-quarters of American adults have a favorable opinion of Taiwan, according to a Gallup survey released on Tuesday (March 7).

            The survey found that 77% of U.S. adults view Taiwan favorably, the highest of eight Gallup polls taken since 1996 on the topic and five percentage points higher than the last one in 2021. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have deepened relations with Taiwan, while former White House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the country in August angered Beijing and led to increased hostility against Taiwan and America, Gallup said.

            Gallup also noted the latest survey, which was taken from Feb. 1-23 in its annual World Affairs poll, was finished before Washington announced it would sell more than US$600 million (NT$18.48 billion) in arms to Taiwan.

            Looking more closely at the results, 81% of Democrats view Taiwan favorably, followed by 78% of Republicans, and 75% of independents.











            In addition, 47% of Americans, a trend high, said conflict between Taiwan and China is a critical threat to America's vital interests in the next decade. Another 42% said it is important but not a critical threat, while 10% said it is not important.

            Two previous surveys in 2004 and 2021 found that the Taiwan-China conflict was a critical threat by 23% and 30% of American adults, respectively, while slim majorities said it was an important but not critical threat, according to Gallup. In this year’s survey, 59% of Republicans, 42% of Democrats, and 44% of independents thought the Taiwan-China situation to be a critical threat, per Gallup.

            Meanwhile, a record-low 15% of U.S. adults view China favorably , representing a five-percentage-point drop from a year earlier. Gallup has measured Americans’ views on China since 1979.

            Gallup said the U.S. public’s view on China has been gradually falling in recent years and is down 38% since 2018. It also said more than eight in 10 American adults have a negative opinion of China, including 45% who view it very unfavorably and 39% unfavorably.

            The survey also found that 66% of Americans consider Chinese military power to be a critical threat to U.S. interests, while 27% think it is an important but not critical threat and 6% say it is not an important threat.
