https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834700,Hotels in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung fined for price-gouging amid flurry of concerts,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Kaohsiung has cracked down on accommodation businesses that have jacked up room rates amid a boom in demand due to the city hosting an array of pop concerts.Four businesses in Yancheng and Xinxing districts will be fined somewhere between NT$10,000 (US$327) and NT$50,000 for price gouging, according to the port city’s tourism bureau, after an inspection.They were found to have increased room rates to levels exceeding what had been submitted to the authorities, the bureau said. Visitors are advised to refer to Taiwanstay, a government-run website providing information on certified hotels and inns, before making reservations.Those who encounter disputes in the accommodation sector can report to the Consumer Protection Committee via hotline 1950 or the city’s tourism bureau by calling 07-7409802.Concerts taking place in Kaohsiung between February and April include those staged by American vocal group Backstreet Boys, Irish vocal group Westlife, South Korean girl group Blackpink, and Taiwanese band Mayday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834726,Vestas wins 373 MW order in South Africa featuring the first V163-4.5 MW wind turbines,"SANDTON, SOUTH AFRICA – EQS Newswire – 14 March 2023 - Independent power producer Red Rocket has placed a 373 MW order for the Brandvalley, Rietkloof and Wolf wind parks, to be located in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, South Africa.            The contract includes the supply and installation of 64 V150-4.5 MW wind turbines, 12 V163-4.5 MW wind turbines and five V162-6.2 MW Enventus wind turbines. Vestas will service the wind parks through a 15-year Active Output Management 5000 (AOM 5000) agreement.   Red Rocket's CEO, Matteo Brambilla said: ""Red Rocket has been investing and supporting South Africa's electricity crisis for more than a decade and with a portfolio of more than 1,000 MW of wind, hydro and solar projects under development, in construction or in operation in the country, we are delighted to continue making a significant contribution to South Africa and the rest of the continent."" Brambilla added: ""The projects will bring a 740-million-rand community investment over 20 years through local social projects. The wind farms will start operating in 2024"".   The order includes the first installations globally of the V163-4.5 MW wind turbine from Vestas' 4 MW platform. Featuring an 18 per cent increase in swept area, the V163-4.5 MW has a large rotor-size-to-rating ratio resulting in a higher capacity factor, enabling up to 10 percent higher Annual Energy Production at park level compared to the V150-4.5 MW depending on site-specific conditions. This increases power output at lower wind speeds significantly and improves predictability and stability in production, optimising the utilisation of the wind park as well as benefitting the energy grid.   ""I would like to thank Red Rocket for the trust they have placed in Vestas' latest evolution of technology. With three different wind turbine variants across platforms this order showcases that we are able to enhance the customer business case through optimising the layout on each wind project site with Vestas' flexible and diverse product portfolio. We firmly believe that our partnership can make a significant contribution to a more reliable, affordable and sustainable energy mix in South Africa"", says Vestas Sales & Business Development Senior Director, Malte Meyer.      Turbine delivery and commissioning are expected by 2024.   Vestas leads the South African wind power market with over 1.3 GW of installed and under construction capacity. The company is strongly committed to contribute to South Africa's new renewable energy targets, which include reaching 17.7 GW of wind capacity by 2030 and increasing the presence of renewables in its energy mix from the current 11 per cent to about 41 per cent by 2030.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834738,Saint Lucia finds true friend in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Saint Lucia Minister of External Affairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation Alva R. Baptiste on Monday (March 13) reaffirmed ties with Taiwan.

            Baptiste, who is visiting Taiwan, said he is here to “renew our commitment to our bilateral relations.” The opening of its embassy in 2015 is a “mark of respect” and proves that Saint Lucia is “here to develop true friendship,” Baptiste said.

            Saint Lucia cooperates with Taiwan and helps it participate in international organizations, he said. At the U.N. General Assembly, Saint Lucia’s vocal support is “a clear manifestation of our level of interest in seeing Taiwan participate meaningfully in international theaters,” the foreign minister said.

            Baptiste told Taiwan News that his country has been hit hard by many challenges over the decades, including ones related to the economy and climate change. As a result, there has been a decline in official development and climate change has decimated many aspects of Saint Lucian society, he said.











            Therefore, international cooperation is vital for a “small, open, and vulnerable economy” like Saint Lucia to survive and prosper. “It is only through international cooperation where countries large and small can cooperate under their respective mandates to bring about change,” he said.

            This is why partnering with Taiwan is such a big deal, Baptiste argued. Taiwan has intervened directly and improved the quality of life for everyone in Saint Lucia, he said.

            There is a personal relationship between Taiwan and the people of Saint Lucia, Baptiste said, adding that “it will be very difficult to break that bond of friendship.”

            In response to Taiwan’s call to defend freedom and democracy against expanding authoritarianism, Saint Lucia has “undoubtedly” followed suit, Baptiste said. He said his country allows people to “say whatever they want and without being tortured for honest opinion.”

            Even those who spread propaganda and criticize the nation, the government allows them to do it, he said. He noted that freedom of speech has been utilized as a weapon, but recommended that “we must never focus on the negatives of that freedom of expression.”

            Baptiste emphasized that a major goal of Prime Minister Philip J. Pirre is to have people “gainfully employed,” which is why it recently launched the Youth Economy Programme.

            The program aims to offer Saint Lucian youth the opportunity to participate in the economy and open up new avenues for economic growth and development, he said. It also allows young people to “sit around the table as equal and valuable partners in the development of our country.”

            The foreign minister said Saint Lucia is developing a partnership with the people and government of Taiwan and urged more bilateral investment and exchanges to bolster friendship.

            Additionally, Minister for Youth Development and Sports Kenson J. Casimir said that the Youth Economy Programme allows young Saint Lucians with innovative ideas an easier way of getting startup funds by providing soft loans “interest free and hassle free.”

            He expressed gratitude to Taiwan for donating funds to the program early on before it was officially launched.

            Casimir also said his ministry has established a platform called Skill 758, which lets individuals with qualifications upload their resume and certification online, thus giving the government “an idea on what our skill component is in Saint Lucia, and what we need to work on.”

            The platform helps the ministry identify gaps in education, where it can swoop in and provide training for individuals who desire to be certified in a particular field, Casimir said.

            Baptiste’s delegation, which also includes Senator Lisa C. Jawahir, arrived on Monday (March 13) and has already met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Baptiste and Tsai oversaw the signing of a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters at the Presidential Office.

            The delegation is scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) and visit the Civil Aeronautics Administration and Taiwan External Trade Development Council, per the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The group is scheduled to depart on Friday (March 17).TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Saint Lucia Minister of External Affairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation Alva R.

            The airline said in a press release that Boeing will begin delivery of the new planes in 2025 and be completed by 2027, according to CNA. The price for the new planes will not exceed US$1.777 billion (NT$54.34 billion), UDN reported.

            The Taiwanese airline also said it has four other Boeing 787-9s, seven 787-10s, and one 777 cargo plane on order that are expected to be delivered by 2025. Once the additional five 787-9s are delivered, EVA Air will have a fleet of 26 Boeing 787s, 13 797-9s, and 13 787-10s.

            EVA Air President Clay Sun (孫嘉明) said the 787-9s will be used to service its European and North American destinations. It is also planning for the 787-9s to be divided into three cabins, business, premium economy, and economy by the middle of 2024.











            Meanwhile, the airline’s 787-10s will primarily fly to destinations in the Asia-Pacific region, with the cabins split between business and economy class, according to Sun.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834741,Analysis: Grabbing play-in spots in the West will be tough,"Let’s go ahead and put Denver and Sacramento into the Western Conference playoffs. It’s hard to imagine Memphis and Phoenix falling out of the mix, even with Ja Morant away from the Grizzlies and Kevin Durant still not able to make his home debut for the Suns because of ankle trouble. Put them on the bracket as well.And from there, it’s anyone’s guess.The West is an absolute mess, and the middle of the pack — the race for the last two guaranteed playoff spots and the four berths into the play-in tournament — is as muddled and murky as possible.“Hope,” Utah coach Will Hardy said, “is a good motivator.”True. There’s plenty of hope still out there, too.The West has, more often than not in recent years, been the power-broker side of the NBA. Not this year. The shinier records are at the top of the Eastern Conference, which is on pace to finish with three of the best four records this season — something that hasn’t happened since 2008-09.The West has become a logjam this year. Entering Monday, it was the Los Angeles Clippers fifth, defending champion Golden State sixth, Minnesota seventh, Dallas eighth. Then came the most jumbled part of the mess — Utah was ninth, Oklahoma City was 10th, the Los Angeles Lakers were 11th and New Orleans was 12th — with all four clubs starting the day 33-35.Put another way, 2 1/2 games separated the fifth-place Clippers from the 12th-place Pelicans. Only 4 1/2 games separated the Clippers from the 13th-place Portland Trail Blazers. It’s hard to envision a scenario, given how tight the standings are right now, where at least some West races for seeding don’t go down to the final day.“No one’s really out of it right now, at this point in the Western Conference,” Hardy said. “There’s a couple teams that have fallen, I guess, out of the race, but 5 through 13 are so tight that every team is competing each night with that hope of like, ‘Hey, if you string a few together, you can really vault in the standings.’ We’d all be lying if we say we don’t check the standings. We definitely do, but it can be a little distracting.”This is exactly what the NBA wanted when it added the play-in tournament — intrigue all the way to the end of the season. Only the top six teams in each conference are guaranteed playoff spots when the regular season ends on April 9; the next four from the East and West go to a play-in tournament to decide the No. 7 and No. 8 seeds on the respective brackets.Only three teams — Houston, San Antonio and Detroit — have been eliminated. Charlotte isn’t too far away from joining that trio. Everyone else still has a legitimate chance, at least at the play-in.“You do have to embrace the competition,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “When you’re dreaming about things in the middle of the summer, this is what you want. You want games with incredible pressure and context. You don’t want games to have no meaning, to play for lottery balls. You want to have this kind of context. And you want to see what this competition can bring out of you.”Teams will find out, whether they want to know or not.There are no fewer than 24 matchups the rest of the way that will pit those teams vying for spots 5 through 8 on the West bracket against one another, meaning those nights could lead to a big swing in the standings.It also might come down to which teams get somebody back in time to help the cause.The Lakers may get LeBron James back at some point. The Warriors aren’t sure when Andrew Wiggins — out for personal reasons — could return, or if he will. The Mavericks are dealing with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving both having injuries. The Timberwolves hope Karl-Anthony Towns is close to a return from a calf injury. The Pelicans have remained in the race despite not having Zion Williamson, which they’re probably used to by now.Buckle up. Denver might not get caught atop the West. The trio of Milwaukee, Boston and Philadelphia will finish 1-2-3 in the East in some order. But everything else is pretty much up for grabs, especially in the super-cluttered West.“It’s funny what a couple of wins can do right now,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834742,"Q&A: Actor John Cena makes time for wrestling, Hollywood","With a wave of his hand in front of his face, John Cena built a WWE career trash talking his opponents by telling each one, “ You Can’t See Me.”Can’t see Cena?The 45-year-old ubiquitous Hollywood heavyweight can be spotted pretty much everywhere these days, from studio lots to the squared circle. Cena just wrapped a role in Peter Farrelly’s new comedy “ Ricky Stanicky,” played the flawed DC Comics superhero in the “ Peacemaker ” series and will voice the brutish rhinoceros Rocksteady in the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.Wearing his trademark jorts, Cena hasn’t forgotten his wrestling roots. He returns to fight WWE United States champion Austin Theory next month at WrestleMania at SoFi Stadium and can be seen — and played — as the cover boy for various editions of the WWE 2K23 game, with the WWE 2K23 Deluxe Edition and Icon Edition out Tuesday and the standard edition and Cross-Gen on Friday.What’s a wrestling game without a shocking twist? Cena guides gamers in the “You Can’t Beat Me” 2K Showcase mode through some of the biggest losses of his career to wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Kurt Angle, rather than highlighting all his championship wins.“Perseverance is a core value of mine,” he said. “Never give up is written on all my stuff. I like the fact that it walks you through my toughest opponents, my toughest losses. That’s very much a personal touch of mine and I’m glad 2K was very receptive to that.""Cena, not much of a gamer, calls the cover “a tip of the cap” from 2K for building a game around his 20-year body of work.“There’s been some very important moments where I didn’t live up to the hype,” Cena said.In a recent phone interview with The Associated Press from Georgia, where he was filming “ Grand Death Lotto,” the Hollywood heavyweight discusses wrestling retirement, his starring role in the “WWE 2K23” video game and his relationship with embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon. Answers have been shortened for clarity and brevity.AP: What did you mean in your tweet after your return to WWE last week when you wrote, “ it might be the last time.” Are you nearing the end of your WWE career?CENA: I tried to put it in words in Twitter. I guess I didn’t explain myself correctly. It was the first time I came out into the arena knowing that this has a definitive end. Normally, you come out, you get all excited, OK, this is the next one and I’m waiting for the next one. I’m not done, of course. I made that statement accepting a match at WrestleMania so I know I have at least one more in front of me. But what I was trying to convey was, that was the first time I looked at all that excitement and energy and realized this is the twilight of that journey.AP: Why come back to feud with Austin Theory?CENA: You would be surprised at my answer. Because that’s what I was told would happen. I don’t do that. I don’t say, I want to do this. I want to work with that person. I don’t ever do that. I’ve never done that. I just try and do what I’m told to do and do it to the best of my abilities. Instead of dictating my terms, I often just try to make the performance the best it can be. What I don’t do and what I’ve never done is curate the direction of the narrative. I don’t pick opponents, but I love to tell stories. I didn’t pick Austin Theory but I certainly spoke from the heart (on RAW).AP: How do you feel about the fact WWE could be on the market?CENA: That’s way above my paygrade. I just don’t know what’s going on with that. I love Vince McMahon. He’s everything you could want in a great friend, business partner, father, mentor. I love the man. But his business dealings are his business and what he shares with me, that’s between us. But I don’t know what’s going on with the corporate structure in the WWE or the creative direction of the WWE. But when I’m there as a performer, it’s (WWE champion) Roman Reigns’ show. In my mind, he needs to be in the conversation, and in my mind, he’s the greatest of all time.AP: Is it tough to reconcile the feelings you have toward Vince McMahon with the sexual misconduct accusations made against him?CENA: No. I mean, everyone has the right to have their perspective. I have the right to have mine. When you love somebody, you take them as imperfectly perfect as they are. We all make mistakes, we all have poor decisions. Lord knows I’ve made my collection of poor choices. That doesn’t mean I’m not going to love somebody. There’s no way I can go on record and say I don’t love Vince McMahon.AP: You have WrestleMania coming up and a slew of acting projects including “Grand Death Lotto.” Has the pace of your schedule ever become too much?CENA: I’m feeling my age, so to speak. I could use a little bit of rest, but all my choice. These are wonderful things to be a part of. This one I’m really excited for because this movie does not stop. It is going to be action from the opening credits. We have a great team that mixes action and comedy. I’m also trying to do my best to, I hate the term work-life balance, but I’m trying to do my best to not fall into the trap of workaholism where I just hide in my work and I’m not a fully open, vulnerable human being to the people around me, the people that I love.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834743,"England wins toss, fields in bid to avoid T20 series sweep","MIRPUR, Bangladesh (AP) — England captain Jos Buttler has won the toss and sent Bangladesh in to bat in bid to avoid a sweep in the Twenty20 series. Bangladesh won the series-opener by six wickets and the second game by four wickets in two low-scoring contests. England fielded an unchanged starting lineup.“It gives us the best chance of winning the game,” Buttler said of his decision to bowl first. “In the last game we were exceptional with the ball defending a low total. ”Bangladesh made two changes. Left-arm spinner Tanvir Islam will make his debut in place of Nasum Ahmed and Shamim Hossain has returned to replace Afif Hossain. ___Lineups:Bangladesh: Liton Das, Rony Talukdar, Najmul Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Towhid Hridoy, Mehidy Hasan, Shamim Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tnavir Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Mustafizur Rahman England: Jos Buttler (captain), Phil Salt, Dawid Malan, Ben Duckett, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Rehan Ahmed. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World

The study examines the market’s current and future developments.A bioreactor bag, a single-use, sterile container that is intended for bioprocessing or cell culture applications, is one such container. It is usually made from flexible plastic materials like polyethylene or polypropylene or a combination thereof.The bioreactor bag can be used to grow microorganisms and cells in controlled conditions. The bag is stocked with a nutrient rich medium that provides nutrients and growth factors for the support of cell growth or microorganism growth. The bag also has sensors and probes that monitor and control environmental variables such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and other factors.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-bioreactor-bag-market-yhr/1465847/#requestforsampleIn recent years, the market for bioreactor bags has seen significant growth. Bioreactor bags can be used to produce biopharmaceuticals such as vaccines, monoclonal antibody and cell-based therapies. Bioreactor bags are gaining popularity due to their many advantages over traditional manufacturing processes. Bioreactor bags have the advantage of being flexible. Bioreactor bags can be used for small-scale or large-scale production. They can also be scaled up and down according to demand. Bioreactor bags are also quicker to set up than traditional stainless-steel systems.Bioreactor bags are also less likely to cause contamination because they are intended for one-use only. They are cost-effective and more efficient than traditional manufacturing processes because they don’t require sterilization or cleaning. Due to increasing demand for biopharmaceutical product, the market for bioreactor bags has seen significant growth over the last few years. This growth is restricted by several factors that hinder the industry’s progress. Regulative hurdles make it difficult for bioreactor bags to be approved.The cost of producing bioreactor bags is another limitation. Manufacturers have difficulty producing these bags at a low price while maintaining high quality due to the high cost of raw material. This hinders their ability to grow their customer base and business.Entegris

The study examines the market’s current and future developments.Music publishing administration tools are an essential component for artists and music publishers to manage their rights, royalties, and licensing agreements. These tools enable creators to keep track of their music catalogs and ensure that they receive proper compensation for their work. With the rise of digital streaming platforms, the need for efficient and reliable music publishing administration tools has become more critical than ever before.One of the most useful features of music publishing administration tools is that they allow artists to register their songs with multiple performance rights organizations (PROs) worldwide. This means that whenever a song is played on radio or TV or used in a movie or commercial, the artist can collect royalties from all relevant PROs. Additionally, these tools provide detailed reports on where and how often a song has been played so that creators can monitor its usage accurately.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-music-publishing-administration-tools-market-yhr/1465833/#requestforsampleThe music publishing industry has undergone a significant transformation in the past two decades, thanks to the evolution of digital technology. Music Publishing Administration Tools have emerged as a game-changer for musicians and publishers alike. These tools streamline the entire process of music publishing, from copyright registration to royalty collection and distribution.The market for music publishing administration tools has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years, driven by factors such as digitization of music catalogs, increasing demand for online streaming services, and rising awareness among musicians about the importance of protecting their intellectual property rights. Moreover, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are pushing the boundaries of what these tools can achieve.One major limitation is the lack of awareness among musicians and publishers about these tools. Many people are still unaware of their existence or how they can benefit from using them. Additionally, some users may find these tools too complicated or expensive to use effectively.Songtrust

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834783,Taiwan airports to start charging NT$500 transit fee,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Transit passengers at Taiwan airports will be charged a NT$500 (US$16.26) facility fee beginning March 31.The charge will be collected by airlines when tickets are issued and is in-line with other regional airports, such as Japan’s Narita Airport (NT$360, US$10), South Korea’s Incheon Airport (NT$250), and Singapore’s Changi Airport (NT$200), according to the Department of Aviation and Navigation Deputy Director-General Han Chen-hua (韓振華), per UDN.Han said airline passengers holding tickets issued before the transit fees go into effect will be asked to pay at airline counters during check-in. He added the transit fee will have little effect on Taiwan citizens as most transit passengers are foreigners traveling onward to other destinations.The transit fee is expected to result in NT$550 million (US$18 million) in revenue this year for Taoyuan International Airport, an important stop-gap financial measure as the airport suffered a COVID-related drop in passengers from 2019-2022. The airport previously charged a service fee only for outbound passengers.In 2019, the airport had approximately 24 million outbound passengers, resulting in NT$10.6 billion in airport service fees. By 2021, passenger volume had plummeted to only 2% of pre-pandemic levels.It is expected that recovering passenger volume will allow the airport to generate more service fees. This is in addition to the soon-to-be enacted transit fees, funding ongoing construction at Taoyuan International Airport, as well as a new terminal at Kaohsiung International Airport.",2023/03/14,1705,Travel & Cuisine

Among them, 57.1% have tooth decay in permanent teeth, 20% have gum disease, 14.6% have cavities in baby teeth, and 8.8% suffer total tooth loss.Vice President of the Association of Family Dentistry, Yao-Hui Huang (黃耀慧), said oral diseases are not only linked to chronic diseases but will also affect the state of mental health as the impairment of oral functionality can lead to anxiety or the loss of confidence stemming from troubles communicating and socializing with people. The cost of bad oral health to a nation could be huge as it usually ends up with lower productivity from multiple hospital trips, financial losses and time.Huang advised good oral hygiene practices to improve the quality of life, including regular oral health checks, brushing teeth in the mornings and evenings with a toothpaste that has a concentration of 1,000 ppm or more of fluoride ions, using toothpicks or dental floss if necessary, and chewing sugar-free chewing gum after meals.Taking sugar-free chewing gum has been proven to be able to reduce the incidence of tooth decay by 28% and the amount of bacteria associated with dental cavities, according to research papers published by Frontier in Oral Health, BMC Oral Health, and JDR Clin Trans Res among others, he added.""Through proper methods of persistently cleaning and maintaining dental health, you can have a healthy life with quality and good interpersonal relationships,"" Huang said.",2023/03/14,206,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834869,'Everything Everywhere All at Once' love song to Taiwanese parents,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Fresh off their multiple wins at the 95th Academy Awards, two key figures behind the making of the film said it was an homage to their Taiwanese parents.After raking in seven Oscars on Sunday (March 12), Daniel Kwan (關家永), who co-directed with Daniel Scheinert, said the film is a tribute to his Taiwanese mother. Similarly, Johnathan Wang (王慶), one of the film's producers said, ""This film is a love song to our Taiwanese parents.""At the start of a backstage press conference after the awards ceremonies, a reporter from CNA observed that Kwan's mother is from Taiwan, and given that the film focuses on a mother, he asked what she is like. Kwan responded by saying that, like himself, she ""loves to change her passions every couple years. She's always chasing after new dreams. She's always doing a really good job of it and getting bored, and moving on to the next thing.""Kwan said his mother sacrificed a great deal for her children and at one point bluntly told him that she never actually wanted to be a mother. He said this made it ""even more beautiful,"" given knowledge of the sacrifices she made for him and his siblings.He shared a story about how his mother discovered that his writing had deteriorated from one grade to another. This caused her to fear that her ""storyteller is dying in this school"" and therefore chose to homeschool him for ""two or three years.""Kwan was unaware of her motivation for doing this when he was younger, but he is very appreciative now. ""That's the kind of mother my mom was, and this film is a tribute to that.""Wang then chimed in by saying in Mandarin ""我爸也是台灣人"" (My father is also Taiwanese). He said his father passed away before he could see the movie but the film is dedicated to him.In the film, Evelyn, played by Michelle Yeoh misinterprets the title for the film ""Ratatouille"" as ""Raccaccoonie,"" resulting in a raccoon sitting on a chef's head. Wang said that this was inspired by the way his father was a film buff in a ""very Taiwanese dad way where he would always get movie titles wrong.""Directors and producer pose with cast of the film.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834880,Confident Kolek leads Marquette to 2 seed in March Madness,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Tyler Kolek adopted the acuity and audacity that defines his game with every bruise he took playing against his older brother while growing up in Rhode Island.Kolek was two years younger than his brother, Brandon, but wanted to prove he was every bit as good. The two brothers stopped playing one-one-one by the time they reached high school since each matchup inevitably ended with a scuffle.“We were both really competitive,” recalled Brandon Kolek, who just finished his final season at Division II school Franklin Pierce. “I’d be bigger than him so I would post him up, and he would get mad that I’m doing that and he can’t stop it. So a couple of punches are thrown, a couple of elbows are thrown and it would just turn to an all-out fight after that.”Kolek’s fearlessness has been a hallmark of Marquette’s stunningly successful season.The approach also helped Kolek develop from a mid-major prospect into the Big East player of the year who led Marquette to its first Big East outright regular-season title and tournament championship since joining the conference for the 2005-06 season. Now he wants to help Marquette get beyond the opening round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2013.Marquette (28-6) is the No. 2 seed in the East Region and faces Vermont (23-10) on Friday.“I’ve just got to be a chip-on-my-shoulder kind of guy,” Kolek said. “That’s where I feel like it comes from. Just being that underdog, that under-recruited guy, you’ve got to have some gumption to you.”Kolek definitely has that. It was apparent well before the season.When he was asked at Big East media day what he thought about the league’s coaches picking Marquette to finish ninth out of 11 teams, Kolek offered a two-word response. The second word was an abbreviated version of “them.” The first word was an expletive.""I thought that was hilarious,” his brother said. “It just goes to show who he is. He doesn’t really care about what anybody says. He’s going to do what he’s got to do, no matter what.”Kolek has the game to back up his bravado.Marquette boasts one of the nation’s most efficient offenses because its starting lineup features two outstanding passers in Kolek and 6-foot-9 forward Oso Ighodaro. Kolek ranks among the top five Division I players in assists per game (7.7) and assist-turnover ratio (3.22).Kolek inherited those passing skills from his father, Kevin Kolek, who dished out 6 assists per game from 1984-88 while helping UMass Dartmouth earn three straight Division III NCAA Tournament appearances.“He knows what the defense is going to do, and he can just read what’s going to happen two, three steps ahead,” teammate David Joplin said.Kolek already had proved himself as a distributor last year by collecting 5.9 assists per game. The questions surrounded his shooting, which led to a rare crisis in confidence.After Kolek played one season at George Mason, the firing of Dave Paulsen caused him to enter the transfer portal. Marquette coach Shaka Smart said he called Kolek to make his pitch the day he got the job.Kolek shot just 32% overall and 28.1% from 3-point range his first year at Marquette after shooting 39.9% overall and 35.8% from beyond the arc at George Mason. For once in his life, that swagger was missing.“I was miserable last year, honestly,” Kolek said. “I kind of let basketball determine my whole mood on and off the court. As you grow and learn as a person, you understand you’re more than just the game. You’re a human being, too.”Kolek’s father had faith Tyler’s shot would return because he knew his son’s work ethic.Kevin Kolek noted how he came back from dinner one recent Saturday night at about 11 p.m. and called his son, who was in the gym even though Marquette had played a game early that afternoon.“He lives in the gym,” Kevin Kolek said. “I knew it would turn around.”Sure enough, Kolek is shooting 48.3% from the floor and 39.4% from 3-point range, helping his scoring average improve from 6.7 last season to 13.3 this year.“It’s so much fun to see him out there with no hesitation,” Smart said. “Because that was the biggest challenge last year. When he got off to a tough start, he hesitated a little bit when he was open, and then it snowballed a little bit. This year, particularly during the second half of the season, there’s been none of that.”That’s changing the way opponents defend Marquette.“Teams aren’t going under screens as much as they did last year,” Ighodaro said. “Tyler put so much work into his shot that any time teams go under, we want him to shoot that shot. He’s a good shooter. It’s really opened our offense up.”It’s also opened Kolek up.Smart says the biggest growth Kolek has shown is in his leadership, citing a recent example in which the third-year sophomore took Stevie Mitchell out to eat on his birthday. That’s not the only way Kolek has shown his personality.He’s even found a way to profit off his preseason statement. Kolek has a website selling T-shirts including a censored version of his media day comment on the Big East preseason poll.His marketing skills reveal the same brashness he consistently brings to the court.“I like to go out and play like that every day and practice like that every day,” Kolek said. “That’s just who I am.” ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834881,Jackson-Davis' Indiana legacy tied to March Madness run,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Trayce Jackson-Davis' storybook career can be told many ways.His stat sheet is one of the greatest in Indiana history: First player with 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, career leader in blocks and rebounds, No. 3 all-time in scoring.The accolades — first team preseason Associated Press All-American, four-time all-conference selection and first Hoosier in a decade to make consecutive Big Ten all-defensive teams — show how he's revered by those outside the program.Teammates speak glowingly of Jackson-Davis' leadership, determination and commitment to restore the Hoosiers' once proud and annual postseason tradition.Yet the 6-foot-9 forward enters this year's NCAA Tournament understanding the book has not closed on his college career.“Gentleman, we've got a lot of ball left to be played,” he said following his final home game as he referenced the program's championship history. “We've got to go get one of those (Big Ten titles) and then we've got to go get No. 6.”At Indiana, after all, legacies are established by hanging banners.Jackson-Davis' first title run opportunity came up two wins short at last weekend's conference tournament. His second shot, and likely his last, begins Friday as Indiana (22-11), the No. 4 seed, faces Mid-American Conference tourney champ Kent State (28-6) in Albany, New York.Jackson-Davis certainly has done his part in ways that defy today's trends.The 2019 IndyStar Mr. Basketball Award winner could have gone to college anywhere but chose to play one hour from his home in Greenwood, Indiana, to don the trademark candy-striped pants.He arrived as the latest in-state recruit expected to lead Indiana's program back to national prominence and a sixth national championship. He has stuck around four years, despite the ever-changing script.And while his 2,211 points, 1,124 rebounds, 260 blocks, 265 assists and 49 career double-doubles reveal one chapter, the respect he's earned from others tells another tale.“Trayce is fabulous, great person, great player,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said. “He's added more pieces to his game. His decision-making when he first started was just OK. Now he's gotten really good. When we made moves, our guys just bounced off him. He's got a bright future.”Many thought he was bound for the NBA after making the Big Ten's all-conference and all-freshmen teams in 2019-20. Instead he came back to develop his right hand, extend his range and become a stronger post presence.His sophomore season was marred by pandemic restrictions, mostly empty seats, unfulfilled dreams and eventually a coaching change that again nearly again prompted him to turn pro. One meeting with new coach Mike Woodson changed everything.“I want to get Indiana basketball back on track. That's my goal, that's why I came back,” he said at the time. “I believe in the tradition. I believe what we have here is something special. I didn’t want to be someone who ran away when it was tough.”Jackson-Davis made good on his promise over the past two seasons.When a five-game losing skid late last season threatened to extend the Hoosiers NCAA Tournament drought to six years, Jackson-Davis put the team on his back and carried them to four wins in six games and a victory over Wyoming in the play-in round. Eight games in 15 days proved to be too much for the weary Hoosiers in a blowout loss to Saint Mary's.He was headed to the NBA draft combine until a positive COVID-19 test kept him home. He took it as a sign he should return for Year 4, setting up a battle royale with Purdue center Zach Edey to become the top big man in the Big Ten if not the nation.“What sticks out to me is him telling me he was coming back and, you know, that kind of set the stage for where we are today,” Woodson said.While the 7-foot-4 Edey had the size advantage, Jackson-Davis relied on his nimble moves, an advanced passing game, uncanny timing to thwart opponents' shots and the vision to lead fast breaks in his most productive season yet. Former Northwestern sharp-shooter and current Indiana teammate Miller Kopp has watched the progression up close.“I remember playing against him my freshman year. It’s like, the dude has been doing it since then, you know, been that dominant,” Kopp said. “It’s one thing to be a good player, a really good player in college, but to be able to do it year after year shows a lot.”Jackson-Davis recently announced this would be his final college season, though the Senior Night crowd chanted “one more year” because they're not ready to bid farewell to their popular star.With a Friday matchup against former Hoosiers assistant coach Rob Senderoff and a potential Sweet 16 contest against top-seeded Houston and former Indiana coach Kelvin Sampson, could there be a more fitting final chapter for Jackson-Davis?One memorable, banner-winning run would cement his place in Hoosiers' history.“I know I left everything I have out there on the court. I think Indiana fans and fans that enjoy college basketball will appreciate that,” he said. “But at the same time, we’ve still got some ball left to be played, and we’re just going to see what happens.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834882,Michael Henn returns to March Madness with Penn State,"Growing up in Washington, Michael Henn fell in love with basketball — the family sport.That love took him to UC Davis, California Baptist, Portland, Denver and, finally, Penn State. It kept him going through bone spurs, and it carried him all the way back to the NCAA Tournament.At the very end of his circuitous college career, Henn returns to March Madness when 10th-seeded Penn State takes on Texas A&M on Thursday. The 6-foot-8 forward also played in the 2017 NCAA Tournament as a true freshman with UC Davis.“It's so rewarding and it's just joyous to be in the moment and be able to see your name called again,” Henn said. “Going back to my freshman year, that was six years ago now, and so for it all to come full circle is really a beautiful thing.”After that first season at Davis, Henn decided to transfer to Cal Baptist because of what he described as a difference of opinion with the school's coaching staff. Following a redshirt year, he averaged 6.4 points and 4.1 rebounds in 30 games with the Lancers.He missed the 2019-20 season because of lingering issues with bone spurs in his ankle. It took at least two surgeries before the injury was resolved, but Henn said he never considered walking away from hoops.“It was cool to have breaks in different parts of my college career because it gave me a lot of perspective,” he said. “I was coming back from injury, I was working, I was doing things that your normal college student would do, and so to be able to have that perspective and come back into this, I have a great appreciation for just being able to play every day.”Henn graduated from Cal Baptist with a bachelor’s degree in entrepreneurship and a minor in real estate. He was playing for the University of Portland when the school fired coach Terry Porter in February 2021, and the new staff “got rid of our whole team,” Henn said.After spending last season at Denver, Henn planned to play professionally, but he had another year of eligibility left because of the pandemic. He put his name in the transfer portal and ended up at Penn State.The Nittany Lions (22-13) had a pair of freshmen big men in Kebba Njie and Demetrius Lilley, and coach Micah Shrewsberry was looking for more experience.“He's an older guy that's tough. Has some toughness to him,” Shrewsberry said of Henn. “He's going to compete every single time.”Henn has played in 27 games this season, averaging 2.6 points and almost nine minutes. He is 13 for 30 from 3-point range, fitting right in on a team that likes to take aim from deep. He scored a season-high 11 points in 29 minutes in an 80-60 loss at Purdue on Feb. 1.Basketball is practically a member of Henn's family. His father, David, and his uncle, Matt, played semi-pro ball and served as his first coaches. His great uncle, Jerry Vermillion, is the career leading rebounder at Gonzaga, and another great uncle, Greg Vermillion, played at Seattle University.“I mean, my whole family's involved. ... Just had great guidance that has led me all the way to this point,” Henn said.Henn also has a master's degree in real estate from Denver, and he said he is close to finishing his MBA from Portland. He is working on a graduate certificate from Penn State in business sustainability strategy.Long-term, Henn said he wants to build a real estate portfolio and start some of his own businesses. But first up, he is hoping for a long NCAA Tournament run with Penn State.When Henn played in the tourney in 2017, UC Davis beat N.C. Central 67-63 in their First Four game in Dayton, Ohio, and then lost 100-62 to top-seeded Kansas.“It's going to go by even faster as we go forward, and so you just got to stay in the moment and enjoy it,” Henn said.___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834883,Drake's DeVries among under-the-radar March Madness stars,"Drake’s Tucker DeVries was an interested spectator when the father-son team of Greg McDermott and Doug McDermott helped Creighton make consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances in 2013 and 2014.DeVries’ father, Darian, was an assistant on Greg McDermott’s Creighton staff back then as Doug McDermott led the nation in scoring and earned national player of the year honors. Now it’s Darian DeVries who will be coaching his son on the March Madness stage.Tucker DeVries is the Missouri Valley Conference player of the year after turning down some high-major offers to enroll at Drake. DeVries said watching the McDermotts helped give him an idea of what it might be like to play for his dad.“I think there was a lot to be learned from, being able to experience and see how that relationship worked,” the sophomore guard/forward said. “Part of what went into me wanting to come and play for my dad here is being able to have a little taste of that myself.”So far, it’s been just about everything DeVries could have imagined.DeVries averages 19 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, and he has shot 38.7% (87 of 225) from 3-point range. He was named the most outstanding player in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament.“I grew up at Creighton my whole life,” DeVries said. ""When they decided to recruit me, it was tough to turn that down – playing in the Big East where I grew up. Iowa State, 45 minutes away. Oregon. Just some of those schools are obviously schools you grow up watching on TV, dreaming about playing for. But I don’t think any of them had what was home for me here.”Now he has the chance to find out what it’s like to play for his father in the NCAA Tournament. Drake (27-7) is the No. 12 seed in the Midwest Region and will face Miami (25-7) on Friday.“To be able to experience it with my dad as a coach is definitely pretty cool and special – to be able to experience it together,” DeVries said.DeVries is one of several players from one-bid conferences who bear watching this week. Here’s a look at some others.MAX ABMAS, ORAL ROBERTSAbmas already has shown he can make an impact in March. Abmas averaged 26.8 points in the 2021 NCAA Tournament while leading Oral Roberts to the Sweet 16. This season, the 6-foot senior ranks seventh among all Division I players in points per game (22.2) and sixth in 3-pointers per game (3.5). The two-time Summit League player of the year has scored over 22 points per game each of the last three seasons. First-round game: Thursday vs. Duke.JORDAN BROWN, LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTEBrown isn’t the typical under-the-radar recruit who ends up at a mid-major program. The 6-foot-11 forward was a 2018 McDonald’s All-American. He began his college career at Nevada and was a Pac-12 sixth man of the year at Arizona last season before transferring to his third school. Brown earned first-team all-Sun Belt honors while averaging 19.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, including 20 points in a loss to Texas. First-round game: Thursday vs. Tennessee.SINCERE CARRY, KENT STATECarry has earned first-team all-Mid American Conference honors and has made the league’s all-defensive team each of the last two seasons. He was named MAC player of the year last season. He has averaged over 17 ½ points each of the last two seasons at Kent State after transferring from Duquesne. The 6-1 guard has scored at least 21 points in four of his last five games. First-round game: Friday vs. Indiana.RAY HARRISON, GRAND CANYONHarrison helped Grand Canyon get here by collecting 31 points, eight rebounds and eight assists against Southern Utah in the Western Athletic Conference Tournament championship game. The 6-4 guard has scored at least 25 points in four of his last six games. Harrison, a Presbyterian transfer, has averaged at least 17 points each of the last three seasons. He has 17.7 points, 4 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game this season. First-round game: Friday vs. Gonzaga.DREW PEMBER, UNC ASHEVILLEThis Tennessee transfer has emerged as a star in two seasons at UNC Asheville. This year, he became the first player to lead the Big South in scoring (20.4), rebounding (9.2) and blocks (2.3) in one season. Pember leads all Division I players in free throws made (262) and attempted (314). The 6-11 forward averaged 29.7 points and 11.3 rebounds in three Big South Tournament games. First-round game: Thursday vs. UCLA.TUCKER RICHARDSON, COLGATERichardson had a triple-double in the Patriot League Tournament championship game with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists as Colgate defeated Lafayette, 79-61. The 6-5 guard was named the Patriot League’s overall player of the year and defensive player of the year. He’s the first player in league history to combine 1,600 career points, 700 rebounds and 600 assists. Richardson had 15 points and seven rebounds last year in an NCAA Tournament loss to Wisconsin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834884,"Army, resistance trade accusations over Myanmar killings","BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military government has denied reports of a new mass killing of civilians by its troops, instead blaming pro-democracy resistance groups for the deaths of more than 20 people, including three Buddhist monks and a woman.Members of armed resistance groups opposed to the military government have said the bodies of 22 people were found late Saturday in the compound of the Buddhist monastery in Nam Nein village, in the southern part of Shan State in eastern Myanmar. They blamed the army for the deaths.No independent witnesses have emerged. The military government's tight restrictions on travel and information make it virtually impossible to verify details of such incidents.The village is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the capital, Naypyitaw. The area is part of the Self-Administered Zone of the Pa-O ethnic minority. It is governed by the Pa-O National Organization, or PNO, which is allied with the military government. Other Pa-O support the resistance.Reports of the killings came about a week after accusations that troops earlier this month rampaged through several villages in western Myanmar, carrying out rapes and beheadings and killing at least 17 people.Critics of the military say there is strong evidence that the army has repeatedly carried out war crimes since seizing power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Opposition to military rule has turned into what some U.N. experts have described as a civil war.Earlier this month, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk accused the ruling generals of implementing “a scorched earth policy in an attempt to stamp out opposition.”Anti-government resistance groups and villagers who had fled Nam Nein earlier but kept in touch by phone with the monastery said about 30 people had been sheltering in its main building since fighting in the area escalated last month.Exactly what happened Saturday morning is unclear, but the aftermath was documented in photos and video.Those released on social media by the anti-government Karenni Nationalities Defense Force showed monks and other men with apparent bullet wounds lying near and against the wall of the monastery’s main building. They also show pools of blood and bullet holes dotting the wall.The Pa-O area is next to Kayah State, where the Karenni, an ethnic minority fighting against the government, are dominant.A local leader of the Karenni guerrillas who took the photos said that his group’s snipers in the surrounding area had used their rifle scopes to watch about 100 soldiers firing their guns and torching houses as they entered the village Saturday morning.He said the snipers were unable to watch more, because they had to withdraw when coming under fire from government aircraft.The Karenni guerrilla, who asked not to be identified because of fear of reprisals by the military, acknowledged that his forces had not witnessed the killings, but had only seen the bodies when they entered the village late Saturday and took photos. He strongly denied the resistance forces had been responsible for the killings, as had been alleged by the army and its supporters.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for Myanmar’s ruling military council, said the violence was initiated by the resistance forces who ambushed army troops and members of an associated militia force, and then entered the village where fighting continued.He described the resistance forces, the Karenni National Progressive Party — an ethnic minority militia battling the army — and their allies in the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force and People’s Defense Force, as “terrorist groups” that had been posing threats to the area since early this month.The Karenni have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. The People’s Defense Forces were formed by the pro-democracy movement after the 2021 military takeover, and are allied with groups such as the Karenni.“When (the) terrorist groups violently opened fire, it was seen that some villagers were killed and injured,” the military's spokesperson said in an interview published Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.Zaw Min Tun said that the army had only counterattacked against the three resistance groups, and reports that soldiers were responsible for killing villagers were misinformation.A 45-year-old Nam Nain resident who left the village in late February because of fighting told The Associated Press that he had been in daily touch by phone with the monastery’s presiding monk, who refused his entreaties to leave.“The monk called me at 8 a.m. on Saturday. He said ‘They are entering into the village. I can hear the sounds of gunshots and artillery,’ and he suddenly hung up the phone,” said the villager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being punished by the authorities,“He couldn’t say which groups entered. So it is not clear who killed the people,” the villager said Monday. He added that the monk, who was his nephew, and two of his brothers-in-law, were among those killed.A village elder who also left Nam Nein in late February told AP that all those killed in the monastery compound were civilians who had stayed to help look after the monks.“More than 20 people who were killed in the monastery were just our villagers. They are not the PDF members, not soldiers and members of PNO,” said the villager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being punished by both the authorities and local pro-democracy forces.He said he also was told over the phone by the presiding monk about troops entering the village on Saturday morning, but didn't know if they were from the army or the guerrillas.Manny Maung, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, speculated that the village's relative proximity to the country's capital might have caused the military to act to deter guerrilla activity in the area.“It’s impossible for independent verifiers or independent researchers to go in. But it has the classic hallmarks of military atrocities,"" she said. “I think that if we don’t get the opportunity to go in now, we’re likely never to know who the actual perpetrators were.”",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834885,"Biden on gun control: 'Do something, do something big'","MONTEREY PARK, Calif. (AP) — The grief is still suffocating, the anger still visceral, President Joe Biden said Tuesday, in this suburban Los Angeles community where a gunman stormed a dance hall and killed 11 in January. He announced fresh federal measures to curb gun violence but emotionally declared there must be more.“Do something. Do something big,” he implored.“I’m determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” Biden told the families of some of the victims who were in the audience for his remarks, along with the 26-year-old who wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from the gunman.Biden’s rhetoric has grown ever stronger about guns — he routinely calls for banning assault weapons — in pushing a gun-control platform even tougher than during the Obama administration when he was vice president. He has been emboldened by the midterm elections when his regular talk of gun control didn't result in massive Democratic losses, and he's expected to continue to argue for strong changes as he moves toward a 2024 reelection run, his aides say.“We remember and mourn today,” Biden said in Monterey Park. “But I’m here with you today to act.”The president told the crowd he’d signed an executive order aimed at stiffening background checks to buy guns, promoting more secure firearms storage and ensuring law enforcement agencies get more out of a bipartisan gun control law enacted last summer.But Biden has only limited power to go beyond that legislation that was passed after the killings of 10 shoppers at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store and 19 students and two teachers at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.His action on Tuesday does not change government policy. Rather, it directs federal agencies to ensure compliance with existing laws and procedures — a typical feature of executive orders issued by presidents when they confront the limits of their own power to act without cooperation from Congress.“Let’s be clear, none of this absolves Congress from the responsibility of acting to pass universal background checks, to eliminate gun manufacturers immunity to liability,"" Biden said.Using emotion to press Congress to act, he detailied the lives of Monterey Park victims: A dancehall manager who walked patrons to their cars after lessons. An adventurer ready for the next trip abroad. A devoted grandparent.Biden, whose own familiarity with grief is well known — his small daughter and wife were killed in a car crash in the 1970s and later his adult son died of cancer — touched on the everyday things he said hurt so much after the initial shock is gone; the way a closet still smells like a loved one, the sound of a laugh, the bend of a smile.The victims in Monterey Park, where 20 were shot after Lunar New Year celebrations, were older Asian Americans, mostly in their 60s and 70s. Biden said they represented a powerful vision of America: “Our diversity is the strength of this nation.”His order on Tuesday directs the Cabinet to complete a plan to better structure the government to support communities suffering from gun violence. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency can respond to natural disasters to provide on-the-ground support, the government should be able to do the same for a mass shooting, he said. More mental health support for grief and trauma, financial aid for victims and for businesses forced to close during a lengthy police investigations.He is directing Attorney General Merrick Garland to shore up rules for federally licensed gun dealers so they know they are required to do background checks as part of their licenses.He is also mandating better reporting of ballistics data from federal law enforcement for a clearinghouse that allows federal, state and local law enforcement to match shell casings to guns. But local and state law enforcement agencies are not required to report ballistics data, and many do not, making the clearinghouse less effective.And the president is asking the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market to minors and use military images to market to the general public.“President Biden’s executive order today is a home run for public safety,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. “This is the latest example of President Biden’s leadership on gun safety, and we’re proud to stand with him as he takes robust action to help close the gun-seller loophole — which will significantly expand background checks on gun sales, keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous people and save lives.”The bill passed last year, known as the Safer Communities Act, is viewed by gun control advocates as a good start but one that doesn't go far enough. After the law was signed, there were 11 other mass shootings, according to a database of mass killings since 2006 maintained by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. Those killings don't include shootings in which fewer than four people were killed — and gun violence is also rising nationwide.Pro-gun groups said the order would do little to stop growing gun violence.“The reality is that nothing in the president’s executive order today would have done anything to prevent the recent mass shootings in California, Michigan or elsewhere,” said Katie Pointer Baney who is the Managing Director of Government Affairs for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association. “It’s time for the president and political leaders across the country to have an honest conversation with the American people and acknowledge there is no legislative fix that will permanently solve the issue of gun violence.”Biden said he'd direct his Cabinet to make sure law enforcement agencies and citizens, too, understand the benefits of red-flag laws, which are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others.“So more parents, teachers and counselors know how to flag for the court that someone is exhibiting violent tendencies, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that make them a danger to themselves and others,"" he said.Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer red-flag laws and other crisis-intervention programs.___Long reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834886,China says AUKUS on 'dangerous path' with nuclear subs deal,"BEIJING (AP) — The United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are traveling “further down the wrong and dangerous path for their own geopolitical self-interest,” China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, responding to an agreement under which Australia will purchase nuclear-powered attack submarines from the U.S. to modernize its fleet.Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the arrangement, given the acronym AUKUS — for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States — arises from the “typical Cold War mentality which will only motivate an arms race, damage the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, and harm regional stability and peace.”“The latest joint statement issued by the U.S., U.K., and Australia shows that the three countries have gone further down the wrong and dangerous path for their own geopolitical self-interest, completely ignoring the concerns of the international community,"" Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.U.S. President Joe Biden flew to San Diego to appear with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as they hailed an 18-month-old nuclear partnership that enables Australia to access nuclear-powered submarines, which are stealthier and more capable than conventionally powered vessels, as a counterweight to China’s military buildup.Biden emphasized the ships would not carry nuclear weapons of any kind. Albanese has said he doesn’t think the deal will sour its relationship with China, which he noted had improved in recent months.Wang repeated China's claims that AUKUS poses a “serious risk of nuclear proliferation and violating the object and purpose of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.”“The three countries claim that they will abide by the highest nuclear non-proliferation standards, which is pure deception,” Wang said, accusing the three of “coercing” the International Atomic Energy Agency into giving its endorsement.Also Tuesday, Australia’s defense minister said AUKUS was necessary to counter the biggest conventional military buildup in the region since World War II. Australian officials said the deal will cost up to $245 billion over the next three decades and create 20,000 jobs.Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said it had made a huge diplomatic effort for months ahead of Monday’s announcement of the deal, including making more than 60 calls to regional and world leaders. Australia had even offered to keep China in the loop, he said.“We offered a briefing. I have not participated in a briefing with China,” Marles said.Speaking in a video call with reporters late Monday, U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink said the degree of transparency involved was one of the key features of the arrangement.“AUKUS partners have made our intentions clear, including our commitment to regional peace and stability,"" Kritenbrink said. “We have committed ourselves to the highest safety and nonproliferation standards, and we look forward to continuing to engage with our friends, partners, and allies in the region,"" he said.AUKUS is one of several U.S.-led security arrangements that have drawn fire from Beijing, which routinely rails against regional blocs from which it is excluded as vestiges of the Cold War.Along with Russia, China has denounced the Quad — a grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the United States — whose foreign ministers earlier this month made clear they aim to be an alternative to China. The ministers said they viewed with concern “challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas,” in a reference to China's aggressive moves to assert its territorial claims in a quest to replace the U.S. as the region's preeminent military force.China has also been unsettled by an agreement between Washington and the Philippines, giving U.S. forces greater access to Filipino bases along what is called the “first island chain” that is key to Chinese control of the region.U.S. military and political support for Taiwan have also drawn more threatening responses from Beijing in recent years.A 2022 visit to the island by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi prompted Beijing to fire missiles over the island, send ships and warplanes into the area and hold military exercises in a simulated blockade of the island. Amid tensions over the U.S. shooting down a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February, China refused to accept a phone call from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the matter.Recent days have seen officials from President Xi Jinping down issue dire pronouncements on U.S. China relations and Chinese security in general.Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Washington last week of possible “conflict and confrontation” if the U.S. doesn’t change course to mend relations strained over Taiwan, human rights, Hong Kong, security, technology and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.A day earlier, Xi told delegates of China's rubber-stamp legislature that “Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented grave challenges to our nation’s development.”On the legislature's closing day Monday, Xi said it was necessary to modernize the armed forces and ""build the people’s army into a great wall of steel"" that protects China's interests and national security. Xi also reiterated China's determination to bring Taiwan under its control by peaceful or military means amid rising concern abroad over a possible attack on the island Beijing claims as its own territory.China must “resolutely oppose interference by external forces and Taiwan independence separatist activities, and unswervingly promote the process of reunification of the motherland,” Xi said.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834888,Competition or exhibition? WBC's pitching rules loom large,"PHOENIX (AP) — Mark DeRosa said last week that one of his most important jobs as United States manager during the World Baseball Classic is making sure his players understand the tournament is a competition, not an exhibition.Just two games in, he sort of undercut his own message.“Obviously, I want nothing more (than) for these guys to repeat as champions and hold up the trophy,” DeRosa said following Sunday's 11-5 loss to Mexico. “But I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize these guys’ big league careers.”Those two sentences are a good encapsulation of what makes the WBC such an intriguing, but frustrating endeavor.Sure, it's cool to have an Olympics-style tournament in baseball. But no matter how much players and coaches say they want to win, there are limits to that competitiveness.Lots of limits, actually. Particularly when it comes to pitching.DeRosa's comments came in the aftermath of a U.S. pitching meltdown against Mexico. Brady Singer and Daniel Bard both got hit hard and struggled with their command. In a normal, competitive setting, DeRosa probably would have pulled each pitcher before the damage could get worse.But the U.S. manager's hands were tied. The tournament's rules — along with directives from MLB clubs — make pitching decisions the toughest part of the job for all skippers in the WBC.Pitchers for all countries are limited to 65 pitches per outing in the first round. If a player throws more than 50 pitches in an outing, he can't pitch for the next four days. If he throws more than 30, he can't pitch the next day. Finally, if he throws on back-to-back days, he must sit out the next day.And that's just the official rules of the WBC.Major League Baseball teams — who are allowing their high-priced pitchers to play in the tournament while risking injury — often have even tighter requests of managers.Some MLB teams don't want their pitchers throwing on back-to-back days. Others don't want them to come into the game in the middle of an inning. Still others don't want them to pitch multiple innings.It's a big jigsaw puzzle for DeRosa and all the WBC managers. In some games, it goes smoothly. But in others — like against Mexico — it doesn't go well.“There’s a lot of guys that mean a lot to these big league ballclubs and their seasons,” DeRosa said. “I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize them. I would have loved to have put Kendall (Graveman) back out there after five pitches. I would have loved to put Devin (Williams) back out there after one. But that’s not what we’re doing.”The trepidation for big league teams is understandable. During a normal year, most MLB pitchers are just starting to ramp up their workload during mid-March spring training games instead of enduring high-stress moments in competitive games.The worry about potential pitching injuries has also affected the makeup of team rosters. Using the U.S. as an example, the lineup is full of stars like Mike Trout, Nolan Arenado, Mookie Betts and Paul Goldschmidt. The pitching staff has a lot of guys casual baseball fans probably haven't even heard of, like Jason Adam or Aaron Loup.The pinch on pitching staffs isn't just a U.S. problem. Venezuela manager Omar López mentioned some of the same issues.“The limit in the Classic is 65 pitches but for me it’s 60,"" López said. ""If the limit were 25, mine would be 20 because in any at-bat there is the risk of surpassing the limit. Then I’d be getting phone calls the next day.”Later he added: ""I am a person who always abides by the rules set by any organization. I know the country is extremely important, but so are the organizations.”Minnesota Twins pitcher Pablo López, who threw for Venezuela on Sunday, echoed his manager's comments.“The tournament is extremely important, but it is also an extension to the preparation of a long and intense season,"" Lopez said. ""The decision is understandable. Obviously, in the heat of the moment, you feel you’re in midseason with 120 pitches in the tank, but that is not the case.""It is a decision based on the parameters of the tournament of which I agree with 100%.”The WBC rules — and MLB requests — might make for strange baseball moments, but it's not clear if fans care much about the restrictions. More than 47,000 packed Chase Field in Phoenix on Sunday, mostly rooting for Mexico, in a raucous atmosphere that only got louder as Mexico's lead increased.Even an hour after Mexico's win, thousands of fans could be heard in downtown Phoenix celebrating.“It’s a very beautiful day for all of Mexico, for the tournament, I believe,” Mexico manager Benji Gil said.___AP freelance writer Santos Perez in Miami contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834894,Madrid tries to avoid Liverpool comeback in Champions League,"MADRID (AP) — Real Madrid got used to pulling off dramatic comebacks in the Champions League last season. Now it needs to avoid one to keep its title defense going.It will be Liverpool needing to do something magical at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Wednesday to reverse a 5-2 loss from the first leg in the round of 16.It definitely won’t be easy — no away team has ever erased a three-goal loss from the first leg in the Champions League. Only five times the team that lost at home rallied in the second leg, with Manchester United the only one to overcome a two-goal deficit in a round-of-16 matchup against Paris Saint-Germain in 2019.""Even if there’s only a 1% chance, we have to give it a try,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said Tuesday. “It’s clear we’re not here telling Madrid: ‘Be careful, we’re coming’. But we’re here to try to win the game.”Liverpool did manage a huge comeback at home in the 2019 semifinals, rallying against another Spanish club, Barcelona. It had lost 3-0 at the Camp Nou before pulling off a 4-0 win in the second leg at home to keep alive a run that eventually ended with the team winning the trophy. Only three other teams overcame a deficit of three or more goals — Barcelona, Roma and Deportivo La Coruña.""We have nothing to lose,"" Liverpool midfielder Fabinho said. “Everyone expects Real Madrid to win and go through. We have a responsibility to wear the shirt. This squad of players have had nice experiences, like Barcelona in 2019, we changed that tie. We know it’s possible.”Madrid, which beat Liverpool in last season’s final for a record-extending 14th European title, pulled off thrilling comebacks on its way to that final, rallying from behind against PSG in the round of 16, Chelsea in the quarterfinals and Manchester City in the semifinals.Madrid also rallied against Liverpool in the first leg this season after going down 2-0 in the first half in England, eventually building its comfortable three-goal advantage with two goals each by Vinícius Júnior and Karim Benzema. Éder Militão also scored for Madrid at Anfield.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti expected an open second leg and said his team will not play too defensively.“The message to the team is simple,” Ancelotti said. ""We have to try to play as well as possible, just like in the first leg. We won’t try to speculate, we have to be in the game from the first minute. We have to go into the game with maximum intensity and enthusiasm and try to win it.”The only time Madrid failed to advance in the Champions League after winning the first leg on the road was in 2019 when it was eliminated by Ajax in the round of 16.Madrid has won six of its last seven matches against Liverpool in the Champions League, drawing the other one.The team ended a three-match winless run with a 3-1 victory over Espanyol at the Bernabéu in the Spanish league on Saturday. The coach is expected to have Ferland Mendy and Benzema available after recovering from injuries.Liverpool took another hit to its confidence with a 1-0 loss at relegation-threatened Bournemouth over the weekend, hurting its chances of moving closer to the top four in the Premier League. Mohamed Salah missed a penalty in that game.Klopp will have fewer midfield options for the game against Madrid. Jordan Henderson has an illness and didn't make the trip, while Stefan Bajcetic was ruled out with an adductor injury.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834900,Biden seeks to show stability in bid to avert banking chaos,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In 2016, Vice President Joe Biden warned against efforts to unravel banking regulations that Democrats had fought to implement following the nation’s financial crisis, just as the emerging Trump administration was determined to loosen those strict banking rules.Biden argued that without the far-reaching 2010 banking overhaul known as Dodd-Frank, financial institutions would continue to gamble with consumers’ cash and ultimately hurt the middle class.“We can’t go back to the days when financial companies take massive risks with the knowledge that a taxpayer bailout is around the corner when they fail,” Biden said in a speech at Georgetown University in the waning days of the Obama administration.Now there’s a banking crisis on his watch as president, and Biden is moving aggressively to assure the public that it is contained, bank executives will be fired, deposits are safe and taxpayers aren’t on the hook — measures also designed to calm jittery financial markets.As he contemplates an announcement for a second term, Biden’s ability to avert a contagion among financial institutions will test his contention that his administration represents competence and stability in contrast to the chaos of the Donald Trump years.His call for additional regulation, though, is likely to run into stiff resistance in the Republican-controlled House and even among some moderate Democratic lawmakers who joined Republicans to loosen some rules in a 2018 law — not to mention criticism from the still-forming 2024 Republican field that has already labeled his actions a bailout by just another name.Privately, Biden has been adamant that the government’s intervention would not be like that of 2008, when Congress authorized billions in taxpayer cash to rescue financial institutions that were deemed too big to fail. That’s according to a senior White House official, who was not authorized to describe private discussion by name.But administration officials believe that this time they had to act substantively despite bad decision-making by bank executives, given the economic risks and the potential impact on customers who did nothing wrong.Unlike in 2008, Biden was insistent that bank executives had to pay a price, said the official, granted anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.“The management of these banks will be fired,” Biden declared Monday. If an institution is taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., “the people running the bank should not work there anymore.”On Monday, Biden also stressed that taxpayers will not bear the cost of his administration’s penalties on the two failed banks, instead tapping into an insurance fund that is paid for by bank fees. And while customers and small businesses who stashed their money with the penalized banks would be protected, Biden emphasized that investors would not.“They knowingly took a risk and when the risk didn’t pay off, investors lose their money,” Biden said. “That’s how capitalism works.”California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said that Biden, like others, cannot ignore the lessons of the 2008 financial collapse and that having endured it firsthand, the president was well aware of the stakes. In conversations over the weekend, the White House assured her he was on top of it.“I think that his main concern was how to, No. 1, take care of the depositors and avoid contagion so that we would not basically, seriously, disrupt the banking system in this country,” Waters said.Regulators put Silicon Valley Bank under FDIC control on Friday afternoon after panicked depositors rushed to withdraw all their funds within a matter of hours. That’s a bank run. Top administration officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed that they were monitoring the situation, as reports of companies struggling to figure out how to manage their finances amid the two banks’ shutdown rippled throughout the media and threatened regional banks around the country.By Sunday night, Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be able to access their money, as would depositors from Signature Bank in New York, which similarly failed and would be taken over by state regulators. As administration officials were working behind the scenes, Biden was regularly briefed by his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, National Economic Council director Lael Brainard and Yellen throughout the weekend, according to the White House.Biden also spoke with outside economists, although the White House declined to identify them.Administration officials also worked to brief lawmakers over the weekend, although several Republicans were left off a call for senators with Treasury and FDIC officials on Sunday night. After Republicans protested publicly, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed out to Treasury that GOP senators were excluded, the administration quickly convened a separate briefing for Senate Republicans on Monday afternoon.There, several GOP senators conveyed their concerns to administration officials that Silicon Valley executives were being rescued in a way that could ultimately harm community banks in their home states, according to a person with knowledge of the call who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation. That would be because these banks would be assessed new fees to replenish the insurance fund that the administration tapped to aid the two failed banks’ depositors.Indeed, the political specter of the word “bailout” will linger over the White House for some time.Republicans angling for the 2024 presidential nomination are already arguing that customers will ultimately bear the costs of the government’s actions even if taxpayer funds weren’t directly used. Some economists believe more fees levied on banks will just get passed onto consumers, such as increased rates for loans.“Joe Biden is pretending this isn’t a bailout. It is,” former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said, arguing that depositors at other banks now are “forced to subsidize Silicon Valley Bank’s mismanagement” and that bank customers will ultimately be responsible for the costs if the insurance fund is drained.Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee who is eyeing a presidential bid, also criticized what he called a “culture of government intervention,” arguing that it incentivizes banks to continue risky behavior if they know federal agencies will ultimately rescue them.White House and other administration officials are insisting their actions are not a bailout. But Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff said while he agrees that the government is rightly protecting the two banks’ depositors, the money spent to make them whole is “certainly a bailout.”“The government swore after the financial crisis it was not going to bail out uninsured depositors and it was not going to bail out money funds,” Rogoff said. “It basically, as I understand it, is guaranteeing everything. So that’s certainly a bailout.”",2023/03/14,107,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834907,China to raise retirement age to deal with aging population - media,"HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - China is planning to raise its retirement age gradually and in phases to cope with the country's rapidly aging population, the state-backed Global Times said on Tuesday, citing a senior expert from China's Ministry of Human Resources.
Jin Weigang, president of the Chinese Academy of Labor and Social Security Sciences, said China was eyeing a ""progressive, flexible and differentiated path to raising the retirement age"", meaning that it would be delayed initially by a few months, which would be subsequently increased.
""People nearing retirement age will only have to delay retirement for several months,"" the Global Times said, citing Jin. Young people may have to work a few years longer but will have a long adaptation and transition period, he said.
""The most important feature of the reform is allowing people to choose when to retire according to their circumstances and conditions.""
China has yet to formally announce a change to its retirement age, which is among the lowest in the world at 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for women who work in factories.
Li Qiang, the country's new premier, said on Monday that the government would conduct rigorous studies and analyses to roll out a policy prudently in discourse.
As China's 1.4 billion population declines and ages, in part because of a policy that limited couples to one child from 1980 to 2015, pressure on pension budgets is escalating, creating more urgency for policymakers to address the situation.
China's National Health Commission expects the cohort of people aged 60 and over to rise from 280 million to more than 400 million by 2035 - equal to the entire current populations of Britain and the United States combined.
Life expectancy has risen from around 44 years in 1960 to 78 years as of 2021, higher than in the United States, and is projected to exceed 80 years by 2050.
At present, each retiree is supported by the contributions of five workers. The ratio is half what it was a decade ago and is trending towards 4-to-1 in 2030 and 2-to-1 in 2050.
Demographers and economists say that the current pension system, which relies on a shrinking active workforce to pay the pensions of a growing number of retirees, is unsustainable and needs to be reformed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834940,Tour de Taiwan Stage 3 rolls into Taichung,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan cyclists overcame yesterday’s equipment failure of two tire blowouts and worked to put lead rider Feng Chun-kai (馮俊凱) near the head of the pack for a fourth-place finish in Taichung.

            Feng achieved the second best performance by an Asian rider in the Tour de Taiwan, since recognition by the International Cycling Union (ICU). The previous best accomplishment was Peng Yuan-tang's (彭源堂) second-place finish in 2019, per UDN.

            “We can only compete in single stages now as we have a different strategy and don’t need to defend the yellow or blue jersey,” said Feng. The Taiwan team’s focus now is individual stage performances after falling too far behind due to mechanical problems.

            Stage 3, dubbed, “Taiwan Romantic Route 3,” started at Hsinchu High Speed Rail Station and ended at Taichung Shigang Visitor Information Center, covering 154.5 kilometers, with two sprint points along the route.











            Taiwan’s Sergio Tu (杜志濠) showed fighting spirit throughout the day, trying repeatedly to break through to the front of the race. Tu and Feng were able to eventually infiltrate the lead group and prepare themselves for the final sprint.

            With 500 m remaining, Feng found himself jostled out of an ideal sprint position, requiring him to break wide to the right for his final 100 m finish, which earned him fourth place.

            Twenty-one-year-old Belgian Tijl De Decker, a rider for Belgian’s Lotto, won Stage 3 with a time of 3:46:18. Dutch rider, Raymond Kreder of Ukyo Racing Team, took third place and retained the yellow jersey as the race leader with a total cumulative race time of 8:25:59.

            ""I am a sprinter and once fell behind on the last climb today. I was lucky to get back on the downhill area. I tried very hard to get back. Today’s route is very challenging,” said Kreder after the race, per UDN.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834941,Man gets 3-year banning order for racially abusing Toney,"NEWCASTLE, England (AP) — A man who racially abused Brentford striker Ivan Toney on social media has been banned from every soccer stadium in Britain for three years in what police described Tuesday as a “landmark ruling.”Antonio Neill sent a racist message to Toney on his Instagram account after the striker scored two goals against Brighton in a Premier League match on Oct. 14.Police started an investigation after Toney shared a picture of the abuse and the message was traced to the 24-year-old Neill, who lives in Blyth, a town in northern England.Neill appeared in a magistrates' court in Newcastle on Jan. 25 and pleaded guilty to sending an offensive message.On Monday, he was handed a four-month sentence suspended for two years as well as a three-year soccer banning order, the first to be issued under a government act which became law in 2022. That widened the scope for banning orders to be issued for online hate crimes relating to a person with a connection to a soccer organization.“If you are going to choose to be vile and abusive to others, doing it from behind a computer screen or on your phone doesn’t mean you’ll get away with it. Far from it,” Northumbria police and crime commissioner Kim McGuinness said in a statement released Tuesday.The order forbids Neill from attending any regulated soccer match in Britain and also prevents him from traveling abroad to watch international friendlies, qualification matches and tournaments.Brentford said the club hopes sentences for online abuse increase and called on social media companies to remove all hateful content to make their platforms safe for everyone.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834942,Lebanon's pound hits a new low as banks go back on strike,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's embattled currency hit a new low Tuesday, trading at an unprecedented 100,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar on the black market as the crisis-hit country's banks went back on strike.The pound has kept sinking since Lebanon's financial meltdown erupted in 2019, following decades of rampant corruption and mismanagement by the country's political and financial elite. Three-quarters of Lebanon's population of over 6 million now lives in poverty and inflation is soaring.The new rate of 100,000 pounds to the dollar was posted on mobile apps Tuesday used by private money exchangers. Exchange shops and businesses use rates off these apps, and authorities have failed to shut down the apps and crack down on a ring of suspected exchangers across the country who run the programs.While the official exchange rate is set by the Central Bank at 15,000 pounds for $1, the black market rate is now used for nearly all transactions.With trust in the pound declining, most grocery stores, restaurants and other businesses have opted to start pricing their goods and services in dollars. While this “dollarization” aims to ease inflation and stabilize the economy, it also threatens to push more people into poverty and deepen the crisis.In late 2019, Lebanese banks imposed informal capital controls, restricting cash withdrawals from accounts to avoid folding amid currency shortages. People with dollar accounts could only to withdraw small sums in Lebanese pounds, at an exchange rate far lower than that of the black market.This effectively evaporated the savings of many across the country. Angry depositors resorted to armed bank heists, demanding their own money. Others have filed lawsuits from abroad to retrieve their money in hard currency.Last month, Lebanese commercial banks went on an open-ended strike and angry protesters took to the streets, smashing windows and setting tires on fire outside two of the country’s biggest banks in Beirut.The banks reopened their doors in late February following caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s request to do so for people to retrieve their salaries.On Tuesday, the banks shuttered doors again to customers and slammed Lebanon's judiciary for not “correcting flaws” in a recent lawsuits against them.“The banks' cautious position unfortunately has been the right one, as the judiciary has issued more arbitrary decisions in recent days,” the Association of Banks in Lebanon said in a statement last week announcing the renewal of the strike.Lebanon has also stalled on implementing wide-range reforms agreed to with the International Monetary Fund to access $3 billion in a bailout package and unlock funds in development aid to make the economy viable again.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834943,US says Russian warplane hits American drone over Black Sea,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian fighter jet struck the propeller of a U.S. surveillance drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday in a “brazen violation of international law,” causing American forces to bring down the unmanned aerial vehicle, the U.S. said.But Russia insisted its warplanes didn't hit the MQ-9 Reaper drone. Instead, it said the drone maneuvered sharply and crashed into the water following an encounter with Russian fighter jets that had been scrambled to intercept it near Crimea.The incident, which added to Russia-U.S. tensions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, appeared to be the first time since the height of the Cold War that a U.S. aircraft was brought down after an encounter with a Russian warplane.U.S. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. He added that U.S. State Department officials would be speaking directly with their Russian counterparts and “expressing our concerns over this unsafe and unprofessional intercept.”State Department spokesman Ned Price called it a “brazen violation of international law.” He said the U.S. summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest and the U.S. ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, has made similar representations in Moscow.The U.S. European Command said two Russian Su-27 fighter jets intercepted the drone while it was operating within international airspace. It said one of the Russian fighters struck the propeller of the MQ-9, causing U.S. forces to bring it down in international waters.Prior to that, the Su-27s dumped fuel on the MQ-9 and flew in front of it several times in “a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement from Stuttgart, Germany.“This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional,” it added.U.S. Air Force Gen. James B. Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa, said the MQ-9 aircraft was ""conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9.” He added that “in fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash.”Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the incident occurred at 7:03 a.m. Central European time (0603 GMT; 2:03 a.m. EST) over international waters, and well clear of Ukraine, after the Russian jets had flown in the vicinity of the drone for 30 to 40 minutes. There did not appear to be any communications between the aircraft before the collision, Ryder added.The MQ-9 includes a ground control station and satellite equipment and has a 66-foot (20-meter) wingspan. It is capable of carrying munitions, but Ryder would not say whether it was armed. The U.S. had not recovered the crashed drone, U.S. Air Forces-Europe said in a statement, and neither had Russia, Ryder said.He said it appeared the Russian aircraft also was damaged in the collision, but the U.S. has confirmed that it did land, although Ryder would not say where.Russia's Defense Ministry said the U.S. drone was flying over the Black Sea near Crimea and intruded in an area that was declared off limits by Russia as part of what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, causing the military to scramble fighters to intercept it.“As a result of a sharp maneuver, the MQ-9 drone went into unguided flight with a loss of altitude and crashed into the water,"" it said. “The Russian fighters didn't use their weapons, didn't come into contact with the unmanned aerial vehicle, and they safely returned to their base.""The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, described the U.S. drone flight as a “provocation” and argued that there was no reason for U.S. military aircraft and warships to be near Russia's borders.Speaking after meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Karen Donfried, Antonov insisted that the Russian warplanes didn't hit the American drone or fire their weapons. He added that Moscow wants “pragmatic” ties with Washington, adding that “we don't want any confrontation between the U.S. and Russia.”Moscow has repeatedly voiced concern about U.S. intelligence flights close to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 and illegally annexed. The Kremlin has charged that by providing weapons to Ukraine and sharing intelligence information with Kyiv, the U.S. and its allies have effectively become engaged in the conflict.Kirby emphasized that the incident wouldn’t deter the U.S. from continuing its missions in the area.“If the message is that they want to deter or dissuade us from flying, and operating in international airspace, over the Black Sea, then that message will fail,” Kirby said. “We’re going to continue to fly and operate in international airspace over international waters. The Black Sea belongs to no one nation.”The U.S. European Command said the incident followed a pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots while interacting with U.S. and allied aircraft over international airspace, including over the Black Sea.“These aggressive actions by Russian aircrew are dangerous and could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation,” it warned.Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps, said this type of collision is his greatest concern, both in that part of Europe as well as in the Pacific.“Probably my biggest worry both there and in the Pacific is an aggressive Russia or China pilot or vessel captain, or something gets too close, doesn’t realize where they are, and causes a collision,” Berger said, in response to a question at a National Press Club event Tuesday.As fighting continued in Ukraine, a Russian missile struck an apartment building Tuesday in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, killing at least one person and wounding nine others in one of the major urban strongholds the Donetsk region.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a video showing gaping holes in the façade of the low-rise building, which bore the brunt of the strike that damaged nine apartment blocks, a kindergarten, a bank branch and two cars, said regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking with workers at a helicopter factory in southern Siberia, again cast the conflict in Ukraine as an existential one for Russia.“For us, it’s not a geopolitical task,"" Putin said, ""it’s the task of survival of Russian statehood and the creation of conditions for the future development of our country.”Russia had welcomed a Chinese peace proposal, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Kyiv’s refusal to talk leaves Moscow with only military options.“We must achieve our goals,” Peskov told reporters. “Given the current stance of the Kyiv regime, now it’s only possible by military means.”The Russian onslaught has focused on the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, where Kyiv's troops have been fending off attacks for seven months and which has become a symbol of resistance, as well as a focal point of the war.Zelenskyy discussed Bakhmut with the military brass and they were unanimous in their determination to face down the Russian onslaught, according to the presidential office.“The defensive operation in (Bakhmut) is of paramount strategic importance to deterring the enemy. It is key for the stability of the defense of the entire front line,” said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces.___Lolita C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834944,Garbage tarnishes Paris luster as pension strike continues,"PARIS (AP) — The City of Light is losing its luster with tons of garbage piling up on Paris sidewalks as sanitation workers were on strike for a ninth day Tuesday. The creeping squalor is the most visible sign of widespread anger over a bill to raise the French retirement age by two years.The stench of rotting food has begun escaping from some rubbish bags and overflowing bins. Neither the Left Bank palace housing the Senate nor, across town, a street steps from the Elysee Palace, where waste from the presidential residence is apparently being stocked, was spared by the strike.More than 7,000 tons of garbage had piled up by Tuesday. Some of that was seen being tossed into white trucks from a private company along the protest route ahead of a planned march Wednesday, the third in nine days. Police said the clean-up was for security reasons.Other French cities are also having garbage problems, but the mess in Paris, the showcase of France, has quickly become emblematic of strikers’ discontent.“It’s a bit too much because it was even hard to navigate” some streets, said 24-year-old British visitor Nadiia Turkay after touring the French capital. She added that it was ""upsetting, to be honest,” because on “beautiful streets ... you see all the rubbish and everything. The smell.”Turkay nevertheless sympathized with striking workers and accepted her discomfort as being ""for a good cause.”Even the strikers themselves, who include garbage collectors, street cleaners and underground sewer workers, are concerned about what Paris is becoming in their absence.“It makes me sick,” said Gursel Durnaz, who has been on a picket line for nine days. “There are bins everywhere, stuff all over. People can’t get past. We’re completely aware.”But, he added, President Emmanuel Macron has only to withdraw his plan to increase the French retirement age “and Paris will be clean in three days.”Strikes have intermittently hobbled other sectors including transport, energy and ports, but Macron remains undaunted as his government presses ahead with trying to get the unpopular pension reform bill passed in parliament. The bill would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 for most people and from 57 to 59 for most people in the sanitation sector.Sanitation workers say two more years is too long for the essential but neglected services they render.“What makes France turn are the invisible jobs. ... We are unfortunately among the invisible people,” said Jamel Ouchen, who sweeps streets in a chic Paris neighborhood. He suggested politicians go on a “discovery day” to learn first-hand what it takes to keep the city clean.“They won’t last a single day,” Ouchen said.Health is a prime concern within the sanitation sector, officially acknowledged with the current early retirement at 57, though many people work longer to increase their pensions. With the exception of sewage workers, there appear to be no long-term studies to confirm widespread claims of shortened life expectancy among sanitation workers.Still, health reasons were behind Ali Chaligui’s decision to switch his job as a garbage collector for an office position in logistics. Chaligui, 41, says he still suffers after-effects 10 years later, like tendinitis, shoulder and ankle problems.“Monsieur Macron wants us to die on the job,” said Frederic Aubisse, a sewer worker and member of the executive committee of the sanitation section of the leftist CGT union, at the forefront of the mobilization against the pension plan.The stakes will be high on Wednesday for both the government and striking workers. Unions are organizing their eighth nationwide protest march since January. The action is timed to coincide with a closed-door meeting of seven senators and seven lower-house lawmakers who will try to reach a consensus on the text of the bill. Success would send the legislation back to both houses for voting on Thursday.But nothing is certain, and the ticking clock appears to have fed the determination of strikers.Durnaz, 55, is among those on the picket line at an incineration plant south of Paris, one of three serving the capital — all blocked since March 6. He has only been home twice to see his wife and three children. “It’s cold, it rains, there’s wind,” he said.Even if the bill becomes law, “we have other options,” said Durnaz. “It’s not over.”“Nothing is written in stone,” Aubisse, the union official, added. He cited an unpopular 2006 law to promote youth employment that was pushed through by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin despite massive student protests that triggered a political crisis. Months later, it was abandoned in a parliamentary vote.If the pension reform is voted through, “Things will happen,” Aubisse said. “That’s sure and certain.”___Alex Turnbull in Paris contributed.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834946,Mongolia looks to copper to transform stagnant economy,"BEIJING (AP) — Mongolia plans to channel revenue from rising copper exports into an economic development fund as part of changes to reap more benefit from its mineral riches and root out corruption, the North Asian nation’s prime minister said in an interview Tuesday following the opening of a major expansion of its biggest mine.Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene attended a ceremony 1,300 meters (4,300 feet) below ground to mark the start of underground production Monday at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia. He was joined by executives of Rio Tinto, the Australian mining giant that owns a 66% stake in the mine. The government owns the rest.The multibillion-dollar expansion of Oyu Tolgoi is the latest effort to generate prosperity from Mongolia's copper, coal, gold and other minerals following three decades of complaints about economic malaise and corruption.Oyun-Erdene, who took office in 2021, represents a younger generation following leaders who grew up under the Soviet-allied former communist government. At 42, the politician with the burly build of an American college football player has a master’s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School and experience working abroad.“We are working hard to eliminate the old culture and introduce a new mindset,” the prime minister said by video link from Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital.Mongolia gets more than 90% of its export revenue from minerals and is benefiting from the surge in global sales of electric cars that use more than a mile (1,500 meters) of copper wire in their motors.Oyun-Erdene said his government plans to invest copper revenue in public health, education and developing technology, tourism and other new industries. He said his government will propose a law to create a sovereign wealth fund during the parliament session that begins Wednesday.“We do believe this will be a historic moment for the livelihoods and standard of living of the people of Mongolia,” Oyun-Erdene said. He said his government wants to make “the wealth and natural resources of Mongolia beneficial and equally distributed to all the people of Mongolia.”Mongolia’s economic growth is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to accelerate this year to 5% from last year’s 2.5%. But households have struggled with inflation that spiked to 14% last year. Economic output per person is about $4,500, barely one-third of neighboring China’s level.Government plans call for more than doubling average economic output for Mongolia’s 3.2 million people to $10,000 by 2030.The planned fund includes a pool of money for housing, education and health, a separate fund for development projects and a “stabilization fund” to cushion against changes in commodity prices, according to Oyun. That is similar to sovereign wealth funds operated by Chile, another big copper exporter, and oil producers to invest natural resource revenues.Other planned investments to “enhance our economic independence” include two hydroelectric power plants to reduce Mongolia’s need for electricity from its giant neighbors, China and Russia, according to Oyun-Erdene.To extract more value from its copper, Mongolia announced an agreement this week with Rio Tinto to look at building a smelter.Oyu Tolgoi, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) south of Ulan Bator, started digging copper from an open pit in 2012 before developing the underground mine that its operators say is more valuable. The mine, with a workforce of 20,000, says it has paid $4 billion in taxes and other fees to the government.Production is forecast to rise to 500,000 tons per year, or enough to equip 6 million electric vehicles. Its operators say that would make Oyu Tolgoi the world’s fourth-largest copper mine.“People of Mongolia will benefit greatly from this project,” Oyun-Erdene, wearing a green helmet with a mining lamp, said Monday at a ceremony with Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm.The mine faces complaints it uses too much scarce water in its desert setting and has displaced traditional nomadic herders. Activists say Rio Tinto and the government failed to carry out a 2017 agreement to compensate them.The mine’s operator responds that it recycles most of its water and has paid the provincial government some $40.5 million for what it draws from local sources. The company says it has repaired herder wells and installed solar panels to power pumps at 40 of them.“We are having talks with Oyu Tolgoi on how to improve the environment and especially how we can address the issue of environmental degradation,” Oyun-Erdene said.He acknowledged complaints about corruption in the government-dominated mining industry, saying his administration has declared this an “anti-corruption year” and is carrying out a five-part plan based on advice from Transparency International, a global anti-graft watchdog.Mongolia ranked 116th among countries last year in Transparency International’s “corruption perceptions index,” based on a survey of businesspeople and experts. That was down from No. 94 in 2012.In December, thousands of people protested in freezing weather in Ulan Bator after Oyun-Erdene's government announced an investigation into officials accused of profiting from the improper diversion of coal exports in 2013-19.The government aims to make mining more transparent and to reduce political influence by turning state-owned enterprises into companies with publicly traded shares. Oyun-Erdene said.“Some parliament members are involved in mining and own companies. This is a real challenge,” Oyun-Erdene said. “We have to make the private interests of parliament members and public officials separate from the public interests of Mongolia.”",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834947,Millennial Money: Job plus a side gig? Avoid these mistakes,"At the beginning of the year, many people have their eyes set on goals. Some of these goals may include increasing your income, starting a dream business, or both if you’re reaching for the stars. Before you get your hands dirty in the sometimes chaotic combination of formal employment and entrepreneurship, here are a few pitfalls to avoid.NOT HAVING A PLAN FOR YOUR SIDE HUSTLE INCOMEPeople get side hustles for different reasons. It could be to help make ends meet, save toward a dream vacation or grow your business to a point where you can quit your job. Catching up on my retirement savings is one reason I decided to start a side hustle.But you need a plan for that motivation to help make your side gig worthwhile. Think about having goals for your income and a strategy in place to help you achieve those goals.For instance, you could divert funds from your side hustle into retirement savings accounts like an IRA. This is a way to put away more for retirement, and you could reduce your taxable income, depending on how much you make, because contributions may be tax-deductible .The plan I conjured up thanks to my side gig income is increasing my 401(k) contributions at my full-time job so I’m on track to max out that account this year. I also opened a SEP IRA, a simplified employee pension plan, for 2023 to put more money away for retirement and potentially reduce my taxable income .Eric Nisall , an accountant in Coral Springs, Florida, suggests having what he calls a “failure fund” if your goal is to eventually transition into full-time entrepreneurship. It’s something he developed when he began the journey of full-time employment and building a business.“When at my last two CPA firms, I was working at building my own business at the same time. I realized, if I’m going to do this, I need to start putting money away so that if I don’t grow, I (won’t) suffer,” he says.Nisall put money he saved from coupons and any extra bucks he made from a raise or overtime into that fund.NOT BEING AWARE OF TAX IMPLICATIONSOftentimes, people think having a side hustle means they can make extra money without reporting it, says Atiya Brown , a certified public accountant and certified financial education instructor in Dallas.“I think that people need to realize all of their income is going to be taxed,” she says. “So, if they’re starting a side hustle, they need to get organized so that they don’t miss any income that needs to be reported, because then the interest and penalties are going to pile on.”The IRS says anyone who earns $400 or more from self-employment must file a tax return.I was not organized and didn’t have a solid plan for paying taxes when I first started. When I realized I owed the IRS almost $15,000 in both taxes and penalties, I clutched my pearls. I thought I would need to save and pay my taxes in one large sum. Now, I know there are multiple ways to pay self-employment taxes.“Because the government is an earn and pay system, you can choose.” says Brown.These choices include estimated quarterly tax payments, changing your W-4 withholdings so it covers your self-employed taxes, or paying in one lump sum, she explains.Brown adds that the IRS has penalties for underpaying on your taxes. To help avoid this, you can use the IRS withholding calculator to see how much you should withhold to cover your side hustle taxes . Depending on how much freelance money you made, you might have several new tax forms to fill out, so if you aren’t sure what the best option is, consider talking to a tax professional.PUTTING YOUR MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IN JEOPARDYHaving a 9-to-5 job and a side hustle means you’re choosing to work during your free time. For this reason, you want to make sure your side gig is worth your time financially and healthwise. I remember taking on too much freelance work and having to chip away at the work on evenings and weekends. By the time I sat down to calculate my per-hour earnings, I realized I was underpaid. I went back and did research on market rates and was intentional about saying yes only to higher-paid jobs. This meant I didn’t need to do as many side gigs and could earn more money than before.Overworking can also affect your health, which can put your main source of income at risk, says Nisall.“You gotta make sure that you’re eating, sleeping, taking care of your body and your mind,” he says. “Your mental and physical health are going to play a big part in this whole thing, especially if you’re trying to balance your 9-to-5 and growing a business.”Speaking of putting your main job at risk, consider asking your employer what its policies are around side gigs. When I joined my current place of employment, I was transparent about the side gigs I had. My employer shared rules around the type of side work I could do without violating company policy. If I wasn’t aware of the policies, I could have mistakenly breached them and risked the income that pays my bills.____________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance site NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4834948,Scientists say climate change goosed New Zealand storm fury,"Climate change worsened flooding from a tropical cyclone that shut down much of New Zealand last month in one of the country's costliest disasters, scientists said, but they couldn't quite calculate how much it magnified the catastrophe.A flash study Tuesday by 23 scientists from around the globe found that global warming from the burning of fossil fuels added to the downpours from Cyclone Gabrielle that included at least six hours of deluges of nearly an inch per hour (20 millimeters per hour) of driving rain. But normal methods to quantify how much climate change added to the disaster weren’t conclusive enough for scientists because weather records there don’t go back very far, the area affected was relatively small and the region is subject to naturally high weather variability.“Climate change is a serious concern for flooding in New Zealand and you've got to understand these are gigantic amounts of rainfall,” said Sam Dean, a co-author and scientist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. “I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind with my experience of my life as a climate scientist that climate change has influenced the event but do we know it's exactly 30%? No, we don't.”The study is not yet peer-reviewed, the gold standard in science, because it is such a recent event. But the scientists at World Weather Attribution follow well-established techniques for attributing climate change — comparing a given event to simulations of what would have resulted without accelerated warming — and later get their work published in peer-reviewed journals.More than 200,000 homes lost power for days on end, a nationwide emergency was declared and the storm caused $8 billion ($13 billion New Zealand) in damage to New Zealand, called Aotearoa in Indigenous Māori. In some places rainfall totaled as much as 15.7 inches (400 millimeters) in just two days, according to the Meteorological Service of New Zealand. The storm killed 11 people.The cyclone hit just a couple weeks after extensive flooding in the region had saturated the ground and essentially lived up to New Zealand officials' worst-case scenarios, according to the MetService.Based on extrapolations from weather records that go back to 1979, heavy rain like that recorded over two days was about 30% more intense and four times more likely than in a pre-warming world that is 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. But the scientists said there are large uncertainties in those figures because there's not a lot of data.Scientists also use computer simulations to see if global warming plays a role. But the area that got flooded is so small that most of the computer models couldn't deal with it. The ones that could found a much smaller climate fingerprint than the historical data shows or practically none.Still, scientists said they are certain climate change played a role, even if they can't put a precise number on it.University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t part of the study team, said the group probably is underestimating the impact of climate change on the New Zealand destruction because climate models in general are insufficient to describe all of climate change’s impacts on extreme weather.“Human-caused warming means there is more energy and moisture in every storm whether or not a study formally attributes it,” he said.In addition to climate change, researchers found that a recently concluded La Nina phenomenon, which changes weather worldwide, and an ocean heat wave were factors in goosing Gabrielle's impact.“Every additional bit of warming will make these kind of events worse,” said study co-author and team leader Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. “Climate change is not something that happens sometime in the future or to someone else but actually affects people, particularly vulnerable populations, affects people everywhere around the world today.”___ Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

It is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11.2% between 2023 and 2032. acing the complicated international situation, the future of the Service Order Software market is full of uncertainty.Request Sample Data To Learn More About This Report @ https://market.us/report/cruise-market/#requestSampleSince the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of the pandemic, the global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging markets and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging markets and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policymakers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download a Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://market.us/report/cruise-market/#requestSampleIn this complex international situation, Report Ocean published the Global Luxury Cruise Tourism Market Status, Trends, and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market, This Report covers the manufacturer data, including sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution, etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835024,India: Court rejects extra redress for Bhopal gas victims,"India's Supreme Court rejected a plea by the government on Tuesday, seeking more compensation for victims of a 1984 toxic gas leak.The leak in the central Indian city of Bhopal is known as one of the worst industrial disasters in the world.Thousands of survivors say they, their children, and even grandchildren, are still struggling with chronic health problems as a result of the toxic waste left behind by the leak.""We believe this would not be the appropriate course of action or method to impose a greater liability on the UCC (Union Carbide) than it initially agreed to bear,"" said the five-judge bench, dismissing the new petition.The court added it was ""dissatisfied"" with the government for bringing up the issue after many years, with no rationale behind it. It also noted that a settlement can only be set aside on the grounds of fraud, but no such claim had been made by the Union of India, as per Live Law, an Indian legal news site.The government had sought for the case to be reopened and an additional 78.4 billion rupees (€889 million, $952 million) to be paid by successor firms to the victims.The Supreme Court directed a sum of 500 million rupees held with the Reserve Bank of India to be used to clear the pending compensation claims, reported NDTV news channel.On December 3, 1984, there was a gas leak in the pesticide factory owned by Union Carbide Corporation. More than half a million people were exposed to the poisonous gas, and the official death toll was more than 5,000.The government had sued the company, and an out-of-court settlement of $470 million (€439 million) in damages had been agreed upon.The Indian government once again approached the Supreme Court in 2010, seeking further compensation for the victims.Union Carbide is now owned by Dow Chemical, which denied liability saying it bought the company 10 years after it had reached a settlement with the government.Thousands of survivors of the tragedy have said they and their children and grandchildren still suffer from chronic health issues due to the toxic waste left behind.tg/rc (Reuters)",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835025,Stock markets slump amid fears of SVB contagion,"Asian markets took a deep dive on Tuesday, as the impact of the closure of two US banks over the weekend reverberated, with signs that European stocks would also take a hit.Investors are fleeing the sector in fear of a potential US banking crisis, similar to the 2008 financial crisis.Equity markets were well in the red in Asian trade in major markets including Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney, Taipei, Manila, Jakarta, Bangkok, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Singapore.Japan's leading and most respected stock index Nikkei dropped 2.2%, whereas the Tokyo Stock exchange banks index fell over 7%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered dropped down to over 5%.Bank shares in Singapore and Australia also suffered drops.""Measures by authorities have so far prevented a US bank run on deposits but have not been enough to avert a bank run by investors,"" National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril was quoted as saying by the French AFP news agency .""The risk of a financial crisis remains elevated, and investors have rushed to reduce their exposure to the sector.""In initial deals, London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.6% to 7,503.85 points compared with the close of business on Monday.On Friday, US regulators pulled the plug on Silicon Valley Bank in the largest bank failure since the 2008/2009 financial crisis after a sudden run on deposits.Then on Sunday, New York's Signature Bank followed suit, as the US Federal Reserve took steps to shore up systemic confidence.A key lender to tech startups, SVB was the 16th-largest bank in the US.However, the continuous interest rate hikes aimed at quelling inflation took a toll on the bank's assets, as well as the bank's customers, prompting a migration of deposits. The bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals.US authorities were quick to pledge support to other lenders and depositors, as fears over a looming financial crisis grew. The move slightly reassured investors, but shares in several US banks were hammered on fears of a run by customers.Investors tensely await new decisions as the US Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet on interest rates next week.rmt/rc (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835035,Ex-sheriff convicted of civil rights abuses to be sentenced,"ATLANTA (AP) — A former Georgia sheriff convicted of violating the civil rights of people in his custody by unnecessarily strapping them into restraint chairs is set to be sentenced Tuesday with prosecutors seeking several years in prison.A jury in October convicted Victor Hill — who was sheriff of Clayton County, just south of Atlanta — on six of seven federal charges against him. Prosecutors recommended in a sentencing memo filed with the court that he serve three years and 10 months in prison, while defense attorneys are asking for a sentence of probation, home confinement and a fine.His trial included about a week of testimony from more than three dozen witnesses, including the men who were restrained. Prosecutors said Hill ordered detainees strapped into restraint chairs at the county jail for hours even though they posed no threat and complied with deputies’ instructions. The use of the chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment and caused pain and bodily injury in violation of the civil rights of seven men, prosecutors argued.Defense attorneys argued that Hill legally used the restraint chairs to keep order at the jail and didn't overstep his lawful authority. They also argued that he had no intention of violating the civil rights of detainees and had no warning that such conduct could be considered criminal.Jurors deliberated for several days, deadlocking more than once, prompting the judge to urge them to continue deliberating to reach a unanimous verdict. The jury foreperson raised concerns about one juror to the judge, who questioned both the juror and foreperson in open court.After the guilty verdict, defense attorney Drew Findling said he was concerned by the singling out of one juror during deliberations and told The Associated Press at the time that a review of case law indicated that “this conviction will struggle to survive legal review by an appellate court.”Federal sentencing guidelines are calculated based on a number of factors, including the offense itself and the person's criminal history, and are not binding on the judge.According to prosecutors' calculations, the guidelines for Hill include a sentencing range of three years and 10 months to four years and nine months. Prosecutors recommend a sentence at the bottom end of that range, saying in a sentencing memo that it is appropriate and “accounts for Mr. Hill abusing his authority and physically harming numerous pre-trial detainees under his care in the Clayton County Jail.”Defense calculations put the sentencing range at three years and one month to three years and 10 months. But they are asking U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross to use her discretion to depart from that and give him a sentence of probation, home confinement and a fine. Defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo that “such a sentence is wholly consistent with the case facts, Mr. Hill's history, and ultimately, will best serve the community that he has honorably served for decades.”In addition to legal arguments, the defense sentencing memo includes a brief personal history of Hill that stresses his lifelong desire to serve in law enforcement and his consistent goal to be “a difference-making law enforcement officer.” His attorneys also submitted two dozen letters from people — including family members, clergy and Clayton County residents — attesting to his good character and asking the judge for leniency.Hill, 58, was suspended by the governor after his indictment and filed for retirement after his conviction. He had been a magnet for controversy from the time he first took office as Clayton County sheriff in 2005. He fired 27 deputies on his first day, though a judge later reinstated them. He used Batman imagery in campaign ads and on social media and called himself “The Crime Fighter,” sometimes using a tank his office owned during raids.He failed to win reelection in 2008 after his first term and was under indictment — accused of using his office for person gain — when voters returned him to office in 2012. He stood trial in that corruption case, and jurors acquitted him on all 27 charges.He pleaded no contest in 2016 to a reckless conduct charge after he shot and injured a woman in a model home in Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta. Both he and the woman said the 2015 shooting was an accident that happened while they practiced police tactics.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835036,"Late-winter storm pummels Northeast with heavy, wet snow","PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) — A winter storm dumped heavy, wet snow in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday, causing tens of thousands of power outages, widespread school closings, dangerous driving conditions and a plane to slide off a taxiway.The storm's path included parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Snow totals by the time it ends Wednesday were expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.About two feet of snow fell in parts of northern New York and the Catskill Mountains, with Indian Lake in New York’s Adirondack Mountains recording 31 inches (79 centimeters) of snow. Gov. Kathy Hochul said some areas could get an additional foot by Wednesday morning.“Heavy snow has impacted much of the state today — and it’s not over yet,” Hochul said late Tuesday on Twitter. She said more than 74,700 households had lost power and that a windy night was anticipated.More than two feet of snow fell on some parts of New Hampshire Tuesday including the town of Bennington, which recorded 30 inches (76 centimeters), according to the National Weather Service.In Derry, New Hampshire, firefighters and police officers used chain saws, shovels and their bare hands to rescue a girl trapped under a fallen tree. Authorities said the girl had been playing outside near a parent who was clearing snow when the tree fell on her. The girl was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.All northbound lanes of Interstate 95 on the Piscataqua River Bridge between Maine and New Hampshire were shut down for about an hour after tractor trailer trucks became stuck on the bridge due to icy conditions. New Hampshire State Police said troopers across the state on Tuesday responded to more than 200 crashes and vehicles that slid off the road.In the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, heavy, wet snow made driving treacherous, weighed down tree limbs and caused spinouts. Further east in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where as much as 18 inches (45 centimeters) of snow was reported to have fallen, Jean Guerrer said the conditions were too dangerous for him to drive to work as a Boston-based taxi driver.The storm in the Northeast came as California faced warnings of more flooding, potentially damaging winds and difficult travel conditions on mountain highways as a new atmospheric river pushed into the swamped state early Tuesday. So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions.A Delta Air Lines plane veered off a paved surface as it taxied for takeoff from a Syracuse, New York, airport Tuesday morning. Flight 1718, which was bound for New York City’s LaGuardia Airport, slid into a grassy area, forcing passengers off the plane and onto buses back to the terminal, according to airport officials. No one was injured and the airport remained open.About 2,100 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.The storm shut down state and local government offices in Maine, where snow arrived later in the day and power outages climbed Tuesday with more than 80,000 customers affected Tuesday night. About 70,000 customers were without power in New Hampshire.In Massachusetts, more than 57,000 customers without power Tuesday evening. More than 30,000 electricity customers were affected in Vermont.The National Weather Service said that in New York, 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour or more fell in higher elevations in the eastern Catskills through the mid-Hudson Valley, central Taconics and Berkshires.Dustin Reidy, a county legislator who lives in Albany, said he stocked up on groceries and had prepared an emergency bin of candles, flashlights, and extra batteries.“I don’t think the storm is as bad in my neck of the woods, but I give a lot of credit to the snow plows,” said Reidy, who was working from home.The snowfall totals will be among the highest of the season, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the weather service office in College Park, Maryland.“It has been below average for snowfall across the Northeast this year, and so this nor'easter will be very impactful,"" he said.While higher elevations got snow, authorities warned residents in coastal areas to watch for possible flooding because of heavy rains. The National Weather Service in New York said wind gusts could reach 50 mph (80 kph) across Long Island and lower Connecticut.It was Election Day in New Hampshire for town officeholders, but more than 70 communities postponed voting because of the storm.In Kingston, New Hampshire, police offered voters rides to the polls. In Weare, power was knocked out at the polling place, forcing officials to set up battery-powered lights until a generator arrived. Interstate 93, the state’s main north-south route, was shut down in Londonderry in both directions after electrical wires came down.In Connecticut, state government offices and courts were closed Tuesday. State offices were also closed in New York.The weather service said expected snow totals from the storm, which is forecast to wind up Wednesday, ranged from more than 2 feet (1 meter) in higher elevations in New York, New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, to 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) in Boston.___McCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835037,Swedish leader: Finland likely to join NATO before Sweden,"HELSINKI (AP) — Sweden's prime minister acknowledged Tuesday that it is likely that neighbor Finland will join NATO before his country does, due to Turkey's opposition to the Swedish bid.Ulf Kristersson said during a news conference in Stockholm on Tuesday that it has been clear since NATO’s Madrid summit in June that Finland’s road into membership has been smoother than Sweden’s, and that it is now increasingly likely that Finland will enter NATO first.Turkey accuses both nations, but particularly Sweden, of being too soft on groups it deems to be terror organizations or existential threats to Turkey, including Kurdish groups. Last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.Since they announcing their intention to join the military alliance in May last year, Finland and Sweden have consistently stressed that they would become members of the military alliance at the same time “hand in hand.”Now, however, Kristersson told reporters, ""it’s not out of the question that Sweden and Finland will be ratified in different stages.”All 30 existing members of NATO have to approve a new member. They all signed the accession protocols for Finland and Sweden last year, and 28 of them have ratified the texts for both countries. Hungarian lawmakers earlier this month started debating the Nordic duo’s membership bids and Budapest may ratify them by the end of March, leaving Turkey as the final holdout. It says it is still seeking guarantees and assurances from the two countries.Kristersson said that the ultimate decision is in Turkey’s hands and that Sweden is ready to handle a situation where Finland enters NATO without Sweden.He repeated what NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said previously, that it would only be a delay.""Basically, this is not about whether Sweden becomes a NATO member but about when Sweden becomes a NATO member,” Kristersson told reporters.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835038,Armenian PM critical of Moscow-dominated security pact,"YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) — Armenia's prime minister on Tuesday accused a Moscow-dominated security alliance of leaving his country in the cold in the face of a threat of renewed hostilities with neighboring Azerbaijan.Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has been repeatedly critical of what he described as the failure of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, to protect member Armenia amid a standoff with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.Russia, which has sought to preserve strong ties with its ally Armenia while also maintaining friendly relations with energy-rich Azerbaijan, has engaged in a delicate diplomatic balancing act, avoiding any forceful action. The Kremlin’s clout in the region has become more limited as Russia has focused its resources on the war in Ukraine.Pashinyan said at a news conference that it wasn't Armenia that is pulling out of the CSTO, but, on the contrary, “the CSTO is pulling out of Armenia, whether it wishes so or not.”""We are concerned about that,” Pashinyan said.He emphasized that “the threat of escalation along Armenia's border and in Nagorno-Karabakh is very high now,” noting “increasingly aggressive rhetoric from Azerbaijan.”Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan soared in December when Azerbaijani protesters claiming to be environmental activists blocked the so-called Lachin corridor, the main road between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, leaving its 120,000 residents short of food and other basic supplies. Last month, the United Nations’ highest court ordered Azerbaijan to allow the resumption of free movement along the road, but the situation has remained tense.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. In 2020, Azerbaijani troops routed Armenian forces in six weeks of fighting that ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal allowing Azerbaijan to take a significant part of Nagorno-Karabakh and reclaim nearby areas which had been in Armenian hands for nearly two decades.During the latest standoff, Pashinyan and other Armenian officials strongly criticized Russia and the Moscow-dominated CSTO for the failure to ensure a free transit via the Lachin corridor.Reflecting its irritation with Moscow, Armenia has canceled a planned military exercise by CSTO members set for this year and refrained from naming its representative to the bloc’s leadership.Pashinyan said that he raised Armenian concerns about the situation during a call on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin and mentioned a recent protest staged by Nagorno-Karabakh residents in front of Russian peacekeepers' headquarters.The Armenian leader noted “objective problems” in relations with the Kremlin, but said that he doesn't think that they have grown into a crisis.In another sign of his irritation with Moscow, Pashinyan said that Armenia would welcome other countries, such as the United States and Germany, to help broker peace talks with Azerbaijan.He also noted that “the existing security architecture didn't work,” adding that Yerevan was taking efforts to “establish military-technical cooperation with many other countries.”",2023/03/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835040,Poland's justice minister seen carrying pistol in his belt,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro has drawn surprised comments after a gust of wind revealed that he carries a gun tucked in his belt.Ziobro was laying a wreath at a monument to victims of mining disasters in central Poland on Monday when the Glock pistol came into view.Poland, like most European Union countries, have strict rules about acquiring guns and very few people are allowed to own them or carry them in public.Critics on social media commented that the minister mustn't be confident in the protection he receives as a state figure, but supporters note that Ziobro, who is also prosecutor general, has received death threats.Ziobro said at a news conference on Tuesday that he obtained permission to have a gun after it was revealed some years ago that an organized crime boss had called for his assassination. The man, identified only as Jan S., has been detained for several years and his trial is underway.Ziobro said that he has victim status in the case.“Like any citizen, I have every right to use means that guarantee security to me and to my family,” Ziobro said.At a separate news conference, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that all citizens, including the justice minister, have the right to try to obtain permission to have a gun.Earlier, Ziobro said that he practices shooting at a range on weekends as a hobby. He said he had the gun on him because the alternative was to leave it in the car, which isn't allowed, as he stopped at the ceremony on his way back to Warsaw at the start of the working week.He said he doesn't carry the weapon all the time.Ziobro, 52, is head of a small party in the ruling conservative coalition and has strong views, including support for the death penalty. He authored changes to the justice system that have put Poland on a collision course with the 27-nation EU.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835041,Nigeria's old currency can be used longer amid cash crisis,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s central bank has extended the timeline to swap out its old currency for redesigned notes after the change triggered a cash shortage, forcing businesses to close and leaving millions unable to withdraw their money.The Central Bank of Nigeria announced late Monday that the old notes of 200 naira (43 U.S. cents), 500 naira ($1.08) and 1,000 naira ($2.16) will remain legal tender until Dec. 31. Bank spokesman Isa Abdulmumin said the extension was meant to comply with a directive from the country's Supreme Court, which ruled that the program's implementation broke the law.On Tuesday, both old and redesigned notes were still not available for thousands queued at banks in Nigeria’s capital of Abuja. There has been a cash shortage since early February because not enough redesigned notes have been printed to replace the old ones in the cash-reliant country.Analysts have accused authorities of poorly implementing the policy in Africa's largest economy, where digital payment services are usually not reliable and only 45% of adults have a bank account, according to the World Bank.The cash crisis has cost the Nigerian economy an estimated 20 trillion naira ($43 billion) because of “the crippling of trading activities, the stifling of the informal economy and contraction of the agricultural sector,” the Lagos-based Center for the Promotion of Private Enterprises said in a statement.The organization said the situation has further squeezed people and businesses in the country where 63% of the population is poor and 33% is unemployed.The loss of a major payment method “affects business transactions; you cannot buy and you cannot sell, especially for the segments of the economy that are driven largely by cash,” said Muda Yusuf, director of the center.Policymakers said the currency changeover would curb inflation, fight money laundering and limit the use of cash to buy votes in Nigeria's general elections, which started last month.But most of the program's desired results have not been achieved because of how badly it was implemented, according to Tunde Ajileye, a partner at Lagos-based SBM Intelligence firm.“The political goal is to attempt to stifle the flow of cash to make vote-buying more difficult. That was achieved. However, the political class moved from buying voters to influencing INEC (electoral body) officials,” Ajileye said. “The consequences have been dire ... so it is a lose-lose situation.”",2023/03/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835044,Clashes erupt in Pakistan as police try to arrest Imran Khan,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Clashes between Pakistan's police and supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan persisted outside his home in the eastern city of Lahore on Wednesday, a day after officers went to arrest him for failing to appear in court on graft charges.The police operation triggered clashes between Khan's supporters and police in the country's major cities, including Karachi, Islamabad, the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Quetta and elsewhere in Pakistan.For the past 18 hours, police were firing tear gas at the house as the 70-year-old opposition leader's supporters hurled rocks and bricks at the officers. The upscale area of Zaman Park where Khan lives was under siege since Tuesday. The government was sending additional police to tackle the situation after hundreds of Khan's supporters showed unexpected perseverance.Early Wednesday, Khan emerged from his house to meet with his supporters, who faced tear gas and police batons the whole night to save him from arrest. He said he was ready to travel to Islamabad on March 18 under his arrest warrant, but police did not accept the offer.The confrontation outside Khan's house continued.About a dozen police and some 35 of Khan's supporters were reported injured. Tear gas shells and pieces of bricks littered the pavement as Khan's followers fought back with batons they had brought to resist police, who were preparing for a final effort to arrest Khan.Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament in April, was ordered to appear before a judge in Islamabad on Friday to answer charges of illegally selling state gifts he had received during his term as premier and concealing his assets.The former premier has avoided appearances before the court since November, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in the eastern Punjab province, claiming he was not medically fit to travel from Lahore to Islamabad to face indictment.Last week, he went to Islamabad to appear before three courts, but he failed to appear before the fourth court to face indictment in the graft case, which is a legal process for starting his trial.Khan has claimed that the string of cases against him, which includes terrorism charges, are a plot by the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, to discredit the former cricket star turned Islamist politician.On Tuesday, Sharif told Pakistan's Geo television that Khan's arrest was ordered by a court, and it was not political victimization.“We will arrest him, and will do it on a court order,” Shahzad Bukhari, deputy-inspector general of Islamabad police, told reporters earlier in Lahore. Later, Bukhari was also lightly injured in the violence and received first aid from police medics at the scene.However, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, a top leader from Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, said the government was trying to disrupt law and order by sending police to Khan’s house.“We are ready to find a middle way through talks with police, but we should know what the purpose of today’s police raid is,” he said. “Don't worsen the situation. Let us sit and discuss what you want,” Qureshi asked the police.He said Khan could consider voluntarily offering his arrest, “but let us talk first.""Fawad Chaudhry, another senior party leader, said Khan’s legal team was in the process of submitting a request to the Islamabad High Court to have warrants against Khan suspended. Khan's lawyers were also legally challenging the warrants before another Islamabad court Tuesday.From inside his home, Khan urged his followers to fight on even if he is arrested. “They think this nation will fall asleep when Imran Khan is jailed,” he wrote on Twitter. “You need to prove them wrong.”Police said reinforcements were on their way to Khan's house to bring the situation under control.TV footage showed tear gas shells falling inside Khan's house.Angered over the expected arrest of Khan, his supporters took to the streets across Pakistan, blocking some key roads near Islamabad while asking the government to refrain from arresting Khan.“We will arrest this man on the court order and he ran away to avoid arrest,” said Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan, who is not related to the former premier. He said Khan will be produced before the court.___Ahmed reported from Islamabad.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835088,Infantino holds FIFA power as voters share World Cup wealth,"GENEVA (AP) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino will be re-elected this week to lead a richer-than-ever soccer body with an ambition to add new and bigger competitions despite growing wariness of him in Europe.FIFA’s wealth after the World Cup in Qatar — $4 billion in reserves to be shared among the 211 member federations and lots more to come from the expanded 104-game edition in 2026 in North America — is a big reason why Infantino has no opponent on Thursday in Rwanda for four more years in office.Since Infantino’s first re-election in 2019, two of soccer’s biggest issues were FIFA wanting biennial World Cups and storied clubs wanting a European Super League. Both plans failed.Infantino pushed hard for more World Cups, a prospect that would directly challenge the European Championship and Copa América and also unsettle the Olympic world. While not publicly backing the Super League, he spoke with rebel clubs and seemed at least sympathetic to them despite the intended disruption of European soccer's domestic structure.The governing bodies of European and South American soccer have stopped much of Infantino’s intended empire-building. However, combining for only 65 of 211 votes means they cannot win the presidency alone.Members that are typically more dependent on FIFA money are satisfied with Infantino, who has built a solid power base in Africa.All six regions will also get more places, and more FIFA money, from the first 48-team men’s World Cup in 2026. It should be the high point of Infantino’s next term in a presidency that might not yet have reached halftime.FIFA WINSSince Infantino’s previous election, FIFA organized two slick World Cups in packed stadiums on either side of a pandemic that shut down soccer for parts of 2020 and 2021, including some of its own youth tournaments.The 2019 Women’s World Cup in France drew a global broadcast audience of more than 1 billion viewers. The 2023 edition in Australia and New Zealand will grow from 24 to 32 teams.The 2022 World Cup in Qatar finally happened after a relentlessly problematic 12-year preparation. It ended on a high with an instant classic final of Lionel Messi winning the trophy with Argentina at the age of 35.Infantino inherited Qatar in 2016 from the turmoil of Sepp Blatter’s last years, and ultimately went to live in Doha — tying himself completely to the World Cup host. A remarkable eve-of-tournament news conference was a polarizing event seen as a big win by Qatar and Infantino’s allies. Much of Europe, as usual, had a different view to being criticized.Infantino and FIFA believe the World Cup in Qatar accelerated social change and was a model for other Middle East states.Infantino’s courting of actual politics and world leaders — Donald Trump, Mohammed bin Salman and Emmanuel Macron have been regular cohorts — can disguise achievements in FIFA’s basic work.Regulating the soccer industry has been more streamlined and progressive, such as protecting players’ maternity rights and trying to ensure small clubs get their entitled share of hundreds of millions of dollars from transfer fees of players they nurtured.FIFA embraces technology to help referees and a talent identification program aims to help each member federation find and develop young players.FIFA FINANCES“It’s your money, not the money of the FIFA president,” Infantino promised voters at his hard-fought first election win in 2016.FIFA money has flowed from Zurich ever since. Member federations who each got $250,000 per year plus a pre-election World Cup bonus now will get at least $8 million from 2023-26.FIFA outperformed its conservative budget to post $7.6 billion income for 2019-22, helped by late and little publicized World Cup sponsor deals from YouTube and tourism authorities in Las Vegas and Saudi Arabia.The budgeted $11 billion income through 2026 has been boosted by having many high-revenue NFL stadiums for the men’s World Cup and by creating separate deals for the women’s tournament.Another political and financial win was persuading American federal prosecutors to pay restitution of more than $200 million forfeited by corrupt officials and marketing agencies in the sweeping investigation that helped bring Infantino to power.FIFA shared that money with the soccer bodies for North and South America, CONCACAF in Miami and CONMEBOL in Paraguay.MISSED CHANCESA 24-team men’s Club World Cup in China in June 2021 was lost to the coronavirus pandemic. Launching a women’s Club World Cup is a long-time target but remains just an idea.A key soccer document — the FIFA-managed International Match Calendar, which mandates when clubs must release players to national teams — was long flagged as a priority to renew before it expires in 2024. The process is complex and involves confederations, clubs, leagues and player unions — all with self-interested views on playing more or fewer games. FIFA co-mingled it with the losing battle for biennial World Cups and it is still not signed.FIFA FLAWSFIFA has variously had close working relationships in Infantino’s presidency with Russia and China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. So, too, have clubs in the Premier League.Infantino’s eagerness to work with those countries and heads of state has exposed FIFA to claims from rights groups of enabling “sportswashing.”In his first term, FIFA mandated human rights assessments of World Cup bidders and created an independent advisory board. That board was shut down in 2021. Human rights advice was taken in-house with a lower profile as Infantino’s ties with Saudi soccer grew. A Saudi-led bid to host the 2030 or 2034 World Cup is expected.FIFA also shut down its once-vaunted Stakeholders’ Committee, the gathering for clubs, leagues and player unions to help shape decisions on competitions and rules affecting them.FIFA consultations have been unclear in proposals like biennial World Cups, launching a 32-team men’s Club World Cup in 2025, and changing the 2026 World Cup format despite it being previously agreed on six years ago.Infantino’s presidential term limit was also opaque. He was part of a FIFA modernizing panel in 2015 that said 12 years should be the maximum for future presidents. Once in office, as a hands-on executive president contrary to the panel’s proposal for a figurehead leader, his term limit was changed. With no public disclosure of the process, a decision in Moscow meant his first three years in office through 2019 do not count.Infantino is now eligible to have 15 years at the top of world soccer through 2031.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835089,Dutch set to vote in local elections with national impact,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch voters go to the polls Wednesday in local elections with a national impact, with campaign themes ranging from local bugbears like dwindling public transport in remote villages to global issues such as migration and the environment.It is also a test of strength for Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s four-party center-right coalition, especially since newly elected provincial lawmakers also pick a new upper house of the national parliament in May. A big shift could affect Rutte’s ability to pass legislation for the remainder of his coalition’s term in office.After increasingly populist campaigning, the vote for the country's 12 provincial parliaments is expected to highlight a simmering discontent with Rutte's government and the continuing rise of a party representing farmers angry at moves to contain their output in an attempt to rein in pollution.Across the nation of nearly 18 million people, dozens of parties take part in the elections, many of them small and local. Voters also will elect members of the country's 21 local water authorities, key institutions in a nation more than a quarter of which is below sea level and which has endless lines of dikes to protect its heartland.Often elections with little impact in the past, Wednesday's poll could be a turning point for Rutte.Rutte, who came to power in 2010 and is now the Netherlands' longest-serving leader, is under pressure after a parliamentary inquiry into earthquakes caused by natural gas extraction in the northern province of Groningen was critical of him and his government. Rutte's administration has not yet formally responded to the findings, but he acknowledged that the conclusions were “hard and painful.”His government also has faced massive protests by farmers over plans to slash emissions of nitrates that damage protected natural habitats. Thousands of farmers and others, including many from the far right of the political spectrum, gathered in a park in The Hague on Saturday for a protest demonstration.Sylvia Smits, a 61-year-old protester lamented what she sees as the demise of the country amid the cost of living crisis in the Netherlands that also is hitting many other wealthy European nations.""There’s a shortage of food, many people do not have enough money to eat every day. And it’s really horrible. The Netherlands, Holland, was once a very, very rich country, but now we are falling apart,” she said.Polls show that the populist Farmer and Citizen Movement led by lawmaker Caroline van der Plas is likely to win big in the elections as it taps into discontent in rural communities that perceive themselves as sidelined by the government in The Hague.The party, known by its Dutch acronym BBB, was formed in 2019 and is taking part in provincial elections for the first time. It won 1% of the vote in national elections in 2021 with Van der Plas, a former journalist focusing on agriculture, becoming a national lawmaker.Andre Krouwel, a political scientist from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam said Van der Plas' popularity now extends beyond just farmers.“The farmers party is basically using a sort of folksy nationalism, referring to traditional ways of life and traditional Dutch landscape in order to be open to traditional social and moral values,” he said. “This creates an appeal that goes far beyond farmers, which are a very small proportion of the ... population, and extends deep into suburban and urban voters who have a traditional and conservative right-wing outlook on life.”Van der Plas did not attend Saturday's farmers' protest in The Hague, telling Dutch media that she has been facing threats.The anti-immigration Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders performed poorly in the last provincial elections in 2019 but is tipped to regain ground this time. Wilders supports farmers and is calling for more investment in affordable housing and drastic reduction in immigration.“The Dutch people are in last place and I’m fed up with that,” he said in a speech at the farmers' protest.He said a vote for his party “will return the Netherlands to the Dutch people on Wednesday. Then we will put the Dutch people first again.”“There has to be more investment in the provinces,” he said in a recent television interview. “Good infrastructure, shops, services and bus stops must remain available for the people.”Forum for Democracy, the far-right populist party which won the last provincial elections, has been riven by defections and unrest in recent years and is expected to see its share of the vote decline.To the left of Rutte’s center-right coalition, the Dutch Labor and Green parties have said they will form a combined bloc in the senate after the elections, possibly making it the single biggest grouping.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835090,Puerto Rico breaks world record as baseball fans go blond,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The blonds are back.Puerto Rico on Friday broke the Guinness World record for the most hair dyed, with 192 men going blond to support the U.S. territory’s team that is vying to win the World Baseball Classic after finishing twice as runner-up.The team's players first dyed their hair blond ahead of the 2017 World Baseball Classic as a joke, unexpectedly unleashing a dyeing craze in Puerto Rico that left pharmacies and beauty supply stores bereft of hair dye.The tournament is usually held every four years, but the pandemic delayed it by two years, so after six years of no dye jobs and no “Team Rubio!” cheers, many Puerto Ricans were eager to see if the trend would continue.The players obliged and repeated the tradition this year, and people in the island of overwhelmingly dark hair once again responded via platinum blond, dirty blond and even burnt orange locks and beards to show their support.“The more blond hair, the more united we’ll be as a people,” photographer Miguel Rodríguez Camilo said while waiting for his dark hair to change color.He was one of more than 200 men who showed up for the mass bleaching event Friday. Some were disqualified for various reasons, including that they didn't take the obligatory “before” picture.Guinness World record adjudicator Natalia Ramírez noted that a handful were disqualified because they already had white or graying hair.“If you can’t really see a change, it doesn’t count,” she said.Participants sat in an outdoor area for up to 45 minutes wearing plastic shower caps as they laughed at each other, took selfies and observed themselves in their smartphones as colorists came by and peeked under the shower caps.“I wasn’t going to do it, but my colleagues pressured me into it,” said William Davidowski, a 51-year-old with naturally dark brown hair who works at the insurance company that helped organize the event.The World Baseball Classic just started, but Davidowski wasn’t sure how long he will stay a blond.“It depends on how it looks,” he said with a laugh.He walked out nearly an hour later with a baseball cap on.Organizers of the event had eight hours to beat the previous record, set in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in March 2013 when 160 people dyed their hair. More than five hours after Friday's event began, participant No. 161, the man responsible for breaking the record, walked in to the applause and yells of those gathered.“Let’s always support our guys,” Tomás Nieves, a 22-year-old air conditioning technician, said in a low whisper, explaining that he was nervous about all the attention.Team Rubio, as Puerto Rico’s team is known, almost adopted another hair color this year.There was talk about players dyeing their hair blue, “but some boys got a little shy,” New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor said at a recent news conference.Then Detroit Tigers shortstop Javier Báez posted a picture on Instagram with newly dyed blond hair and, “that was that,” Lindor said.This time, the team was prepared. It hired five barbers and colorists, compared with the lone barber and colorist from 2017. A local university that helped organize Friday's event bought 79 pounds of bleach.“The people of Puerto Rico embraced it. It did them and us well as a team. So why not continue with this tradition?” Yadier Molina, former St. Louis Cardinals catcher and Team Puerto Rico’s manager, said earlier this week.It remains to be seen whether all that blond power will translate into a win.Puerto Rico’s first game is Saturday against Nicaragua, and then it faces Venezuela on Sunday.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835091,"Oprah Winfrey reflects on book club, announces 100th pick","NEW YORK (AP) — For her 100th book club pick, Oprah Winfrey relied on the same instincts she has drawn upon from the start: Does the story move her? Does she think about it for days after? In a work of fiction, do the characters seem real to her?“When I don’t move on, that’s always a sign to me there’s something powerful and moving,” Winfrey told The Associated Press in a recent telephone interview.On Tuesday, she announced that she had chosen Ann Napolitano’s “Hello Beautiful,” a modern-day homage to “Little Women” from the author of the bestselling “Dear Edward.” The novel was published Tuesday by Dial Press, a Penguin Random House imprint, and Winfrey believes its themes of family, resilience and perspective give “Hello Beautiful” a “universal appeal"" that makes it a proper milestone.A Winfrey pick no longer ensures blockbuster sales, but it retains a special status within the industry; for authors, a call from Winfrey still feels like being told they've won an Oscar. Winfrey told AP that she is in “awe” of the club and its history, “the very notion” that someone might go and buy a copy of “Anna Karenina” or a little known book simply because she suggested it.“She is the queen,” says Jenna Bush Hager, who hosts the popular “Read With Jenna” club on NBC’s “Today” show. “I remember being a high school senior, in AP English, and reading (David Guterson’s) ‘Snow Falling on Cedars’ because I had walked into the local bookstore and seen that Oprah had recommended it.”Kristen McLean, an analyst for NPD Books, which tracks industry sales, says that Winfrey is especially effective these days when promoting a known author such as Barbara Kingsolver and her novel “Demon Copperhead,"" a bestseller since Winfrey picked it last fall that has far outsold her two previous works of fiction.Since 1996, Winfrey’s book choices have set her on a journey of extraordinary influence and success, frequent reinvention and the occasional controversy. It has endured through changes for both Winfrey and the publishing industry, through the rise of the internet and the end of Winfrey’s syndicated talk show, through immersions in the classics and unexpected lessons in the reliability of memoirs and the lack of diversity of book publishing.Thanks to Winfrey, contemporary authors such as Jacquelyn Mitchard and Jane Hamilton found audiences they never imagined, while picks published decades or even centuries earlier, from “Anna Karenina” to “As I Lay Dying,” placed high on bestseller lists. Winfrey didn't invent the mass market book club, but she demonstrated that spontaneous passion can inspire people in ways that elude the most sophisticated marketing campaigns.Her most troubled choices — James Frey’s fabricated memoir “A Million Little Pieces,” Jeanine Cummins’ “American Dirt,” a novel criticized for stereotypical depictions of Mexicans — made so much news in part because of the spotlight of a Winfrey endorsement.The club began as the extension of conversations between herself and her producer at the time, Alice McGee. They would talk about the books they liked until McGee finally suggested, in 1996, that Winfrey share the experience with her viewers. The first pick, Mitchard’s “The Deep End of the Ocean,” has sold more than 2 million copies. Other books also became major bestsellers, whether by established authors like Joyce Carol Oates (“We Were the Mulvaneys”) and Toni Morrison (“The Bluest Eye”) or then-emerging writers like Janet Fitch and Tawni O’Dell.The club was so successful that some suspected a catch. Winfrey remembers Quincy Jones asking her: “How much money are they paying you for that book club, baby?” The process was so informal that Winfrey at first didn’t even bother going through intermediaries.“I would just call Wally Lamb,” she says of the author of “She’s Come Undone,” her fourth pick. “In the early stages, I would finish the book and then find the author. When you’d go to the back of the book, it gives you the bio of the author and it would tell you what city the author lives. And, this is when we had phone books, in every instance I was able to get the author’s phone number because the author was listed.”Winfrey’s system is now only slightly more structured. Leigh Newman, books director of the online/print publication Oprah Daily, will call the publisher first and arrange a “surprise call” with the author and Oprah. Winfrey's staff will research the author’s background to make sure nothing problematic turns up — whether criminal charges or allegations of plagiarism. The vetting began, Winfrey says, after “A Million Little Pieces” turned out to have substantial falsehoods, leading to an extraordinary public scolding by Winfrey when she brought Frey back on her show to explain himself. (They have since reconciled).“I took it so personally,” she says. “I probably should haven’t taken it so personally but I felt like he had let me down and I let the audience down. ... I was the one saying, ‘Can you believe this is a true story?’ and shouting that from the rooftops. I felt foolish for doing that, embarrassed for doing that.”Winfrey's book choices are still in-house and intimate — mostly just determined by herself and Newman — although Winfrey says she made a rare exception for “Hello Beautiful,” recommended to her by the co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, Richard Lovett. Otherwise, Newman will seek out books she thinks Winfrey might respond to — fiction or nonfiction, as long as the story is “compelling,” Newman explains. Winfrey will also come upon books on her own.The club follows no real formula. For the first few years, Winfrey averaged a selection nearly every month, a pace she came to find exhausting. She paused the club for much of 2002-2003, focused on older works in 2004-2005, and in other years only selected one or two titles. After her talk show ended in 2011, she launched Oprah’s Book Club 2.0 the following year, with the emphasis on digital media.She is currently aiming for a new book every eight weeks, with author interviews and interactive reader discussions showcased on OprahDaily.com. Winfrey has no plans to stop, and no specific goals for selections. In the aftermath of “American Dirt,” selected early in 2020, she had vowed to open herself up “to more Latinx books.” But she has not since picked any for her club and is not committing herself for the future.“I’d never choose a book because the author is Hispanic, or Black, or Indian. I’m not going to be put in that box,” she says. “The book has to live on many different levels to me. It doesn’t mean there are not fantastic books by authors of every race and creed. It means I haven’t seen one yet (for the club). But we’re mindful of it and I’ve come close a couple of times.”Winfrey’s choices are influenced at times by a relatively recent trend — competition.Over the past few years, Hager and Reese Witherspoon have demonstrated that they too, can win the trust of large numbers of readers, whether Witherspoon’s early promotion of Delia Owens’ blockbuster “Where the Crawdads Sing” or Hager championing such debut works as Katy Hays' novel “The Cloisters.” The exuberance of young people on TikTok helped make Colleen Hoover the country’s most popular fiction writer.Winfrey is respectful: If she hears a book she might choose is also being pursued by Witherspoon or Hager, she will step back and pick another. But she also claims her place. Yes, Witherspoon, Hager and the BookTok kids are all great, but no one should forget who came first.“We started this conversation,"" she says.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835092,Assault on archaeologist triggers protests in Greece,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — State-employed archaeologists in Greece launched strike action Tuesday to protest an assault on an archaeologist responsible for the resort island of Mykonos, an attack they say may have been linked to commercial pressure to extend tourism development.Manolis Psarros, an employee of the state archaeological service, was beaten by an unidentified man with a possible accomplice in Athens last week and was left unconscious and bleeding in the street. The 53-year-old was taken to a state hospital in the Greek capital and is currently recovering at home.Archaeologists employed by the Culture Ministry staged a five-hour work stoppage to protest what their association described as a “mafia-style attack.”Despina Koutsoumba, the head of the protesting archaeologists’ association, said Psarros has dealt with multiple cases involving alleged violations on Mykonos and had been called as a witness in the past in trials resulting from those cases.“He has no trouble in his personal life ‒ debts or anything like that ‒ that would justify anything like this. This was a professional attack,” Koutsoumba told The Associated Press.“He was struck from behind before getting into his car. He lost consciousness and was hit after that. He has broken ribs and extensive bruising.”The protest was joined by ministry employees in Athens as well as the national Association of Archaeological Conservators. They are seeking additional police protection for public officials involved in contentious inspections and will refuse to handle cases from Mykonos until the end of the month when they plan to visit the island.Planning permission in Greece is often subject to a veto by the local archaeological service, which is tasked with protecting the country’s ancient heritage.One of Greece’s best known holiday destinations, Mykonos was settled in ancient times and hosts an archaeological museum. It is located next to the tiny and uninhabited island of Delos, an ancient commercial, religious and political center that is considered one of Greece’s most important archaeological sites.“There are problems caused by the high level of tourism development on many islands, but Mykonos is by far the worst,” Koutsoumba said.The Culture Ministry condemned the assault, while Mykonos Mayor Constantinos Koukas described the beating as a “criminal and brazen attack that has shocked us all.”",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835094,Bundesliga's longest serving coach keeps going at Freiburg,"FREIBURG, Germany (AP) — The Bundesliga’s longest serving coach is nowhere near finished yet.Christian Streich and his coaching team have extended their contracts with Freiburg, the club said on Tuesday.It did not give the length of the new deals, but Streich has traditionally extended his contract by only a year every season since he took over the modest club from the southwest of Germany in December 2011.“It’s nice that we still enjoy coming into the office every day and have an open and honest relationship,” Streich said on Freiburg’s website. “Life here is really special and I’m pleased that I will be able to carry on working for this club together with my fellow coaches.”Streich has already overseen more Bundesliga games in charge of Freiburg than any other. Overall, his record is 167 wins, 115 draws and 142 losses across all competitions.The 57-year-old Streich has become a favorite at Freiburg — and beyond — for his passionate displays on the sidelines during games, and his witty quotes and humility before and after.Streich took charge of Freiburg Under-19s in 1995 after his playing career ended due to injury, then took over the senior team as coach after a spell as assistant coach.“I should kneel 10 times and give thanks that I am a coach,” Streich previously told the DPA news agency.He has overseen progressive success despite seeing top players leave every offseason for better paying rivals. The team bounced straight back as second division champion in 2016 after relegation from the Bundesliga the season before, and has since established itself as a regular contender for European qualification.Freiburg reached the German Cup final last season, when it also finished sixth in the Bundesliga for Europa League qualification. Freiburg hosts Italian giant Juventus in that competition on Thursday with just a one-goal deficit from the first leg in Turin.“Christian Streich and his colleagues work extremely hard every day and give their best to ensure our team is developing,” Freiburg sporting director Jochen Saier said. “We’re continuing to do things our way and this successful and valued partnership will go into next season now as well.” ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835095,UK cybersecurity center looking into risks posed by TikTok,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's security minister said Tuesday he has asked the country's National Cyber Security Center to review threats posed by TikTok amid calls for the U.K. to impose a ban on the Chinese-owned social media app.Security Minister Tom Tugendhat said he was waiting for a review from the government's cybersecurity experts before deciding on the “hugely important question.”Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hinted a day earlier that the U.K. could follow the U.S. and the European Union in banning the app from government-issued mobile phones and devices.“We take security of devices seriously ... and we look also at what our allies are doing,” Sunak said during his visit to the U.S. on Monday.“We want to make sure that we protect the integrity and security of sensitive information,"" Sunak told ITV News. “And we will always do that and take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that happens.”The U.S. government said last month that employees of federal agencies have to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the White House, U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states had already banned TikTok, while the European Commission also temporarily banned the app from employee phones.The moves were prompted by growing concerns that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, would give user data such as browsing history and location to the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.Last year, Britain’s Parliament shut down its TikTok account — meant to reach younger audiences with Parliament content — just days after its launch following concerns from lawmakers.“What certainly is clear is for many young people TikTok is now a news source and, just as it’s quite right we know who owns the news sources in the UK … it’s important we know who owns the news sources that are feeding into our phones,” Tugendhat told Sky News on Tuesday.In a statement, TikTok said bans by other governments were “based on misplaced fears and seemingly driven by wider geopolitics.” It said it would be “disappointed” if the U.K. imposes a ban, and that it was committed to working with British authorities to address any concerns.“We have begun implementing a comprehensive plan to further protect our European user data, which includes storing UK user data in our European data centres and tightening data access controls, including third-party independent oversight of our approach,"" its statement said.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835096,Conn. woman 1st non-Vermonter granted assisted suicide right,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Lynda Bluestein has terminal cancer and knows she'll likely die soon, but until Tuesday, she didn't know if she'd be able to choose how or when and whether her family, friends and dog would be with her when the time comes.The 75-year-old from Bridgeport, Connecticut, reached a settlement with the state of Vermont that will allow her to be the first non-resident to take advantage of its decade-old law that allows people who are terminally ill to end their own lives, provided she complies with other aspects of the law.“I was so relieved to hear of the settlement of my case that will allow me to decide when cancer has taken all from me that I can bear,” said Bluestein, 75, who has fallopian tube cancer. “The importance of the peace of mind knowing that I will now face fewer obstacles in accessing the autonomy, control, and choice in this private, sacred and very personal decision about the end of my life is enormous.”Vermont is one of 10 states that allow medically assisted suicide, but only one, Oregon, allows non-residents to do it. Bluestein's settlement and pending legislation that would remove Vermont's residency requirement offer a ray of hope to other terminally ill patients who want to control how and when they die but might not be able to cross the country to do so.Bluestein and Diana Barnard, a physician from Middlebury, sued Vermont last summer, claiming its residency requirement violates the Constitution's commerce, equal protection, and privileges and immunities clauses.Barnard, who specializes in hospice and palliative care and who has patients from neighboring New York state, which, like Connecticut, doesn’t allow medically assisted suicide, lauded the settlement and called on the Vermont Legislature to repeal the residency requirement.“I am grateful that Lynda will be able to now access medical aid in dying without completely upending her final months. ... There is no good reason that non-residents should not be able to use Vermont’s medical aid-in-dying law that has eased the suffering of numerous terminally ill Vermonters since it took effect a decade ago,” Barnard said in a news release issued by Compassion & Choices, which filed the suit on behalf of Bluestein and Barnard and describes itself as a group that “expands options and empowers everyone to chart their end-of-life journey.”The Vermont attorney general's office said it was pleased to have reached an agreement.“We hope that this settlement will help those involved as they navigate important decisions around end-of-life care,” said chief of staff Lauren Jandl.Bluestein, who has had three different cancer diagnoses in a short time, said she knew she had to do something so that her death wouldn't be like that of her mother, who died in a hospital bed after a prolonged illness. She decided she wanted to die surrounded by her husband, children, grandchildren, wonderful neighbors, friends and dog.“I wanted to have a death that was meaningful, but that it didn’t take forever ... for me to die,” she said.Vermont's law, which has been in place since 2013, allows physicians to prescribe lethal medication to state residents with an incurable illness that is expected to kill them within six months. If the Democratic-led state Senate approves the current legislation and it is signed by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who supports the concept, Vermont would become the second state to allow non-residents who are terminally ill to end their own lives.A year ago, Oregon agreed to stop enforcing its residency requirement and to ask the Legislature to remove it from the law as part of a settlement. Legislation is also under consideration there.Although proponents of the Vermont legislation are optimistic it will pass, medically assisted suicide does have its opponents. Among them is Mary Hahn Beerworth, executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, who said the practice “was, and remains, a matter of contention.”“To be clear, Vermont Right to Life opposed the underlying concept behind assisted suicide and opposes the move to remove the residency requirement as there are still no safeguards that protect vulnerable patients from coercion,” Beerworth testified before a Vermont legislative committee. She said if the legislation moves forward, she has a number of concerns including what liability Vermont could incur if the drugs fail to end a patient’s life.David Englander, the state Health Department’s senior policy and legal advisor, said no complaints have been reported to the department or the attorney general’s office regarding the use of Vermont's law.Supporters of Vermont's medically assisted suicide law also say it has stringent safeguards, including a requirement that those who seek to use it be capable of making and communicating their health care decision to a physician. Patients are required to make two requests orally to the physician over a certain timeframe and then submit a written request that they signed in the presence of two or more witnesses who aren't interested parties. Witnesses must sign and affirm that patients appeared to understand the nature of the document and were free from duress or undue influence at the time.Bluestein, a lifelong activist, has pushed for aid-in-dying legislation to be passed in New York and her home state of Connecticut, where the Legislature is considering such a bill. She decided to look into Vermont as an option when a friend who had cancer moved there to establish residency so she could take advantage of its aid-in-dying law. That friend died last year, surrounded by her husband, son and daughter, Bluestein said.“One thing that surprised me about getting this latest terminal diagnosis is just how hard it is to die the way you want to die,” Bluestein said. “It seems like everybody has an opinion on what should be allowed and what shouldn’t be allowed in my one personal, private and very sacred moment of death.”“There are people who say, no, you have to suffer. It’s very important for you to wait until God decides that it’s time for you to die. But that’s not my faith. That’s not what I want and that’s not what I believe,” she said.Bluestein, who previously battled breast cancer and melanoma, is undergoing chemotherapy for her late-stage fallopian tube cancer. Over Thanksgiving, she told their children and grandchildren that she’ll likely die this year.“I want to live the way I always have, and I want my death to be in keeping with the way I wanted my life to be always,” she said. “I wanted to have agency over when cancer had taken so much for me that I could no longer bear it. That’s my choice.”___Follow Lisa Rathke on Twitter at https://twitter.com/LisaRathke ___Find more AP coverage of assisted suicide at https://apnews.com/hub/assisted-suicide",2023/03/15,,World

Many of the fraudulently purchased vehicles were exported out of the U.S.Rivera's alleged accomplices also used the stolen identities to open bank accounts and apply for credit cards, authorities said.Rivera personally used stolen identities to apply for credit and fraudulently purchase vehicles in a similar scheme in New Jersey between October 2017 and February 2018, prosecutors said.He pleaded guilty Monday to wire fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and false representation of a Social Security number",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835098,Novo Nordisk plans price cuts for several insulins,"Another major insulin maker has promised steep price cuts, as pressure grows on drugmakers and insurers to trim the cost of a medication that millions of Americans need.Novo Nordisk said Tuesday that it will slash some of its U.S. insulin prices up to 75% starting next year. The announcement comes less than two weeks after rival Eli Lilly said it will drop some of its prices by 70% or more later this year.The American Diabetes Association says more than 8 million Americans use insulin, which the body needs to convert food into energy. People who have diabetes don’t produce enough insulin.Research has shown that prices for the drug have more than tripled in the past couple of decades. High prices have prompted federal lawmakers including President Joe Biden to call for a broad cap on patient costs.Experts say rounds of price cuts from drugmakers are helpful, but more needs to be done to make insulin widely affordable.The price cuts laid out by Lilly and Novo Nordisk amount to “one step on one layer of the costs,"" said Dr. David Lam.“We can’t let up the foot on the gas just yet and say, ‘Oh well, all our problems are going away,’” said the medical director for New York-based Mount Sinai Health System’s Clinical Diabetes Institute.Insulin affordability in the United States depends largely on whether patients have health insurance and the details of that coverage.People with employer-sponsored coverage, for instance, may pay little out of pocket for their insulin, or they might pay hundreds of dollars if they must first meet a high deductible before the coverage kicks in.High deductibles also are common with coverage purchased through the individual insurance market. People with high deductibles or no insurance often are stuck paying high list prices that drugmakers initially charge for their products.Lam said more than half of his diabetes patients struggle to afford insulin, with some paying several hundred dollars a month. Many also have to buy other prescriptions on top of their insulin.“It becomes a huge bundle of medication costs,” Lam said.Lilly CEO David Ricks noted last week that discounts the company offers from its list price often don’t reach patients through insurers or pharmacy benefit managers.Major insulin makers like Lilly, Novo and the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi have several programs to help patients with costs. Those can include free refills for people with low incomes, co-payment assistance and caps on costs for the uninsured.But Lam said it can sometimes be hard for patients to qualify for drugmaker assistance programs.Novo Nordisk said Tuesday that pre-filled pens and vials of long- and short-acting insulins will see list price reductions. They include Levemir, Novolin, NovoLog and NovoLog Mix70/30.Novo also will drop the list price of unbranded products like Insulin Aspart to match the lower price of the branded insulins.The price cuts go into effect Jan. 1. A vial of NovoLog and NovoLog Mix 70/30 will drop 75% to $72.34 from $289.36. FlexPen options will fall to $139.71 from more than $500.Levemir and Novolin vials and FlexPens will drop 65% from their current list prices.The drugmaker price cuts come a couple of months after the federal government started applying a $35 cap on monthly out-of-pocket costs to patients with coverage through its Medicare program for people age 65 and older or those who have certain disabilities or illnesses. ____Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thpmurphy",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835143,First Phosphate Receives Report from Queen's University Pufahl Research Group Suggesting that the Lac à l'Orignal Deposit is a Unique and Highly Probable ESG-Compliant Source of North American Phosphate for the LFP Battery Industry,"Saguenay, Quebec - Newsfile Corp. - 14 March 2023 - First Phosphate Corp. (CSE: PHOS) (FSE: KD0) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has received the final research report from Queen's University Pufahl Research Group completed by Dr. Sandeep Banerjee, Postdoctoral Researcher and dated March 13, 2023:   The report is titled: ""Characterization of First Phosphate's Lac à l'Orignal Phosphate Deposit, Lac-Saint-Jean Anorthosite (LSJA) Complex, Quebec, Canada: Implications for Supplying Lithium Ferro (Iron) Phosphate (LFP) Batteries"" (the ""Report"") and is available on the Company's website at:    https://firstphosphate.com/partners/#queens   ""Collectively, the attributes indicate that First Phosphate's Lac à l'Orignal deposit is a source of North American phosphorus for the LFP battery industry that has a high probability of being ESG-compliant,"" attests Dr. Peir Pufahl, Co-Director, Queen's University Facility for Isotope Research. Report conclusions follow below:         The host-rock of First Phosphate's Lac à l'Orignal deposit is a gabbronorite composed of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, biotite, fluorapatite, ilmenite, and magnetite. Fluorapatite is the primary mineralization and ilmenite and magnetite are potentially important secondary commodities for the production of titanium oxide and iron.           The P2O5 concentration of apatite using in situ analytical methods is 41.7 ±0.26 wt.%, which is just slightly higher than values (40.5-41.2 wt.%) obtained by whole-rock analyses of the apatite concentrate produced by SGS Canada Inc.           The Lac à l'Orignal deposit is a promising viable source of P for the LFP battery market. P2O5 and CaO concentrations and CaO/P2O5 ratios are better than required for phosphoric acid production. Halogen concentrations are variable with F below concerning levels, whereas Cl contents are slightly higher than ideal values. Cl concentrations could be managed by mixing mineralization with different Cl contents. Advanced methods for the reduction of Cl should also be explored.           Other elements, such as Si, Fe, Al, Mg, As, Cd, U, and Th of the apatite concentrate are below deleterious threshold concentrations. During phosphoric acid production from beneficiated apatite concentrate, these low trace element concentrations may produce phosphogypsum that could be recycled into plaster and wallboard.           The low abundance of sulfide gangue minerals suggests that the environmental risks of acid mine drainage from tailings would be minimal. Such low concentrations of deleterious trace elements and sulfide minerals make the Lac à l'Orignal deposit an attractive and highly probable ESG-compliant source of North American P for the LFP battery industry.           Paragenetic relationships indicate that apatite precipitated throughout the crystallization history of the magma. However, the highest quality phosphatic mineralization is interpreted to have formed as apatite-magnetite-ilmenite cumulate layers that precipitated early to mid-way through the fractional crystallization process.           Further research should focus on the detailed characterization of other First Phosphate properties. The complexity of the LSJA Complex necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the mineralogy and geochemistry of these areas as a counterpoint to the Lac à l'Orignal region. Such a comparison will provide important new information required to fully assess the distribution of high-grade mineralized zones.      ""Advanced mineralogical data is essential for making decisions regarding site feasibility and how to cost effectively extract clean phosphate under strict Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") guidelines, with the lowest possible carbon footprint,"" said Peter Kent, President of First Phosphate Corp. ""This partnership has provided First Phosphate with a competitive edge by laying the foundation for developing proprietary and advanced methods of phosphate production for the LFP battery industry. Ultimately, we want to leverage our high-purity phosphate Mineral Resource to help Quebec and Canada become a leader in the electric vehicle industry, and advance on our national climate change goals.""   ""Most of the estimated world phosphate reserves are from sedimentary rocks (~95%) that generally contain high concentrations of deleterious trace elements. Consequently, they are less desirable for LFP battery production than phosphorus hosted in igneous rocks. Only a small portion of phosphate (~5%), however, is mined from igneous rocks, most of which is hosted in carbonatite. The Lac à l'Orignal phosphate deposit is unique because it occurs in anorthosite. Anorthosite is an igneous rock that is a new and sought-after source of phosphate for the North American LFP market. Collaborative research with the Pufahl Research Group at Queen's University shows that anorthosite may be ideal for producing phosphoric acid with low levels of trace elements, a critical step for producing high-quality, ESG-compliant LFP cathodes,"" further states Dr. Peir Pufahl.   The primary aim of the research partnership between First Phosphate and Queen's University was to assess the quality of phosphatic mineralization found at the Lac à l'Orignal property for the manufacture of lithium ferro (iron) phosphate (LFP) batteries. The purpose of the report was to describe and interpret the mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry of First Phosphate's Lac à l'Orignal igneous phosphate deposit. Lac à l'Orignal is part of the Lac-Saint-Jean Anorthosite Complex, Québec, which is the largest anorthosite complex in the world.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835154,1 victim's life still in danger after Hamburg shooting,"BERLIN (AP) — One victim's life is still in danger after last week's shooting at a Jehovah's Witness hall in Hamburg in which a former member of the congregation killed six people and then himself, authorities said Tuesday.Police and prosecutors said they are still working to pin down the motive of the shooter, a 35-year-old German who has been identified only as Philipp F. in line with local privacy rules.Officials say nine people were wounded in Thursday evening's shooting during a service, including a woman who lost her unborn child. Seven had gunshot wounds. Senior police official Uwe Stockmann said six were still in hospitals on Tuesday and one person's life was still in danger.The Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany have said that the man police identified as the gunman was a former member who left the church voluntarily two years ago.Investigators said last week that his departure from the church was “apparently not on good terms.”Hamburg prosecutor Arnold Keller said that, so far, investigators have come across nothing that pointed in advance to any plans for a rampage like Thursday's shooting. They are still looking into a website registered in his name and a self-published book it links to titled “God, Jesus Christ and Satan.”“In view of the previous history regarding the relationship between Philipp F. and the Jehovah's Witnesses, it at least can't be ruled out that Philipp F. acted out of hatred toward this community,” Keller told reporters in Hamburg. “It cannot be said conclusively today whether the motive for the crime is ultimately to be found here.”Stockmann said everything points to the perpetrator having acted alone, and that there were no indications that he was involved in any network or had far-right views.The Hamburg congregation that was holding a service when the attack happened currently has about 60 members and is one of 47 in the port city, which is home to almost 4,000 denomination members, according to the Jehovah's Witnesses.The Jehovah’s Witnesses claim a worldwide membership of about 8.7 million, with about 170,000 in Germany. The religious movement was founded in the United States in the 19th century and is headquartered in Warwick, New York.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835155,Swedish leader: Finland likely to join NATO before Sweden,"HELSINKI (AP) — Sweden's prime minister acknowledged Tuesday that it is increasingly likely that neighbor Finland will join NATO before his country does, due to Turkey's opposition to the Swedish bid.Ulf Kristersson said during a news conference in Stockholm on Tuesday that it has been clear since NATO’s Madrid summit in June that Finland’s road into membership has been smoother than Sweden’s, and that it is now increasingly likely that Finland will enter NATO first.Turkey accuses both nations, but particularly Sweden, of being too soft on groups it deems to be terror organizations or existential threats to Turkey, including Kurdish groups. Last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.Since they announcing their intention to join the military alliance in May last year, Finland and Sweden have consistently stressed that they would become members of the military alliance at the same time “hand in hand.”Now, however, Kristersson told reporters, ""it’s not out of the question that Sweden and Finland will be ratified in different stages.”All 30 existing members of NATO have to approve a new member. They all signed the accession protocols for Finland and Sweden last year, and 28 of them have ratified the texts for both countries. Hungarian lawmakers earlier this month started debating the Nordic duo’s membership bids and Budapest may ratify them by the end of March, leaving Turkey as the final holdout. It says it is still seeking guarantees and assurances from the two countries.Oscar Stenström, who is the chief Swedish government negotiator in the NATO accession process, said that Stockholm has done what has been required to be approved by Turkey. Among other things, Sweden last week presented a draft law to parliament aimed at making it illegal to support or participate in terrorist organizations — something that is hoped to reduce NATO opposition from Turkey.The activities of groups in Sweden and Finland that Ankara considers to be terrorists is one of the main objections by Turkey to the Nordic duo, and particularly Sweden, joining NATO. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, has waged a 38-year insurgency against Turkey that has left tens of thousands dead. It is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S and the European Union.Sweden has a Kurdish diaspora of around 100,000 people, while there are estimated 15,000 Kurds living in Finland.Last week, representatives from Sweden, Finland and Turkey met at NATO headquarters in Brussels after a hiatus of several weeks in attempt to clear the path to the Nordic nations' membership.Kristersson said Tuesday that the ultimate decision is in Turkey’s hands and that Sweden is ready to handle a situation where Finland enters NATO without Sweden.He repeated what NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said previously, that it would only be a delay.""Basically, this is not about whether Sweden becomes a NATO member but about when Sweden becomes a NATO member,” Kristersson told reporters.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835156,"States shield addresses of judges, workers after threats","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Following threats and attacks on public officials, state lawmakers across the U.S. have stepped up efforts to shield personal information from being publicly disclosed about judges, police, elected officeholders and various public employees.The measures generally are winning widespread support in state capitols — adding a layer of secrecy, in the name of safety, that could make it more difficult to determine whether public officials are complying with residency laws and paying their property taxes.The efforts to exempt more information from public disclosure come despite the fact that many governments are more transparent than ever when it comes to their meetings — making permanent the online streaming options spurred as a response to coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings.That's led to a split assessment of government openness during Sunshine Week, an annual recognition of public information laws that began Sunday and runs through Saturday.Though meetings may be more accessible, “basically, government is getting more secretive every year,” said David Cuillier, an associate journalism professor at the University of Arizona who has been analyzing data about government compliance with open-records laws.People requesting records from the federal government are successful only about one-fifth of the time, down from a greater than 50% success rate more than a decade ago, according to Cuillier's research.Information requests under state laws typically fair better, Cuillier said, but “every year, we get exemptions being passed in state legislatures all across the country, and that just seems to be accelerating.”On a case-by-case basis, many public records exceptions may appear reasonable and justified. The movement to shield the home addresses of judges provides one good example.In 2020, a man disgruntled with U.S. District Judge Esther Salas came to her New Jersey home disguised as a deliveryman and fatally shot her 20-year-old son while wounding her husband. New Jersey officials responded later that year by enacting a law that exempted the home addresses of current or retired judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officers from disclosure under public records laws. The measure, called Daniel’s Law in honor of the judge’s son, also allowed covered officials to ask businesses or individuals to remove their home addresses from internet sites they control.Though some states already had similar laws, the New Jersey case provided an impetus for action elsewhere. Most states now have laws prohibiting governmental entities from disclosing the home addresses of at least some public employees, with judges among the most commonly protected, according to research by Jodie Gil, an associate journalism professor at Southern Connecticut State University.A study panel of the Uniform Law Commission, a nonprofit organization that drafts potential legislation for state lawmakers, plans to recommend this spring that a common policy be drafted to exclude judges' home addresses and certain personal information from public-record disclosures, said Vince DeLiberato, director of Pennsylvania's Legislative Reference Bureau and chair of the study panel. The policy also could include an option to shield information for other public officials facing threats, he said.Meanwhile, states are pressing forward with their own information-exemption laws for certain officials.The Missouri Senate recently voted 30-1 for legislation that allows judges and prosecutors to request that their home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, marital status, children's identities and other information be removed from public display. The shield would apply not only to government records and websites but also to privately run sites such as online phone directories and internet search engines. That bill is now pending in the House.On the same day as the Missouri vote, the Georgia Senate voted 53-0 for legislation allowing federal, state or local public employees to request that their residential addresses and phone numbers be removed from online property records posted by local governments. That bill is now pending in the House.“We don’t want people to be able to track these folks down and cause harm,"" Georgia state Sen. Matt Brass, a Republican, said while explaining his bill to a Senate committee.But Richard Griffiths, a former president of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, raised concerns about the unintended consequences, asserting that the New Jersey law “turned into a bit of a train wreck.” Some governments shut down entire databases because of uncertainty about exactly whose information should be removed from which public records, he said.New Jersey lawmakers responded in January 2022 by tweaking the process in Daniel’s Law and establishing a state Office of Information Privacy — funded with $3 million — to create an online portal through which judicial and law enforcement officials can request that their information be redacted.Public records listing the home addresses of government officials can function as an important tool for journalists working on public accountability stories, Gil said. Addresses in voter registration files and property ownership records can be used to determine whether officials actually live in the district they represent or are delinquent on property taxes.When she was working as a journalist a decade ago, Gil reported that a local tax collector was certifying that some public officials had paid their vehicle taxes when they actually had not.“It's something that I could have never even attempted if public records were not connecting public officials and their addresses,” Gil said. “I didn’t publish any address — I didn't say the mayor lives at this house — but I needed his address to confirm that he was paying his taxes.”Lawmakers are taking a variety of approaches to address confidentiality this year. An Oregon bill would prohibit the home addresses of elected officials and candidates from being publicly disclosed on voter registration lists. A Connecticut bill would add court marshals, attorney general's employees and workers in a state unit that determines services for people with disabilities to a list of about a dozen types of public employees whose home addresses are confidential under the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act.The Connecticut bill is backed by state Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat who told lawmakers that his assistants are getting targeted online.“People get really angry when they’re the subject of an enforcement action,” Tong said, ""and sometimes they retaliate and they threaten people in my office with violence.”But redacting public employee addresses from state records won't necessarily prevent threats and “provides employees with a false sense of comfort and security,” said Colleen Murphy, executive director of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, a state agency that administers and enforces open-records laws.""For better or worse, the fact is that the residential addresses of most people are now readily available for free, or for a nominal charge, on the internet and through other commercial services,” Murphy said.In New Mexico, a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic elected officials prompted the Senate to pass legislation that would let public officials keep secret their home addresses on election-related documents and government websites. The provision was included in a broader election bill that is now pending in the House.Among the supporters is Democratic state Sen. Linda Lopez, of Albuquerque, whose home was hit by multiple shots while her 10-year-old daughter was sleeping.“I understand the issue on transparency,"" Lopez said, “but the day and time that we’re in, we really have to rethink what we are doing.”___Associated Press writers Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, and Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, contributed to this report.",2023/03/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835188,Saudi Arabia places order for up to 121 planes from Boeing,"Two Saudi Arabian airlines said Tuesday they will order 78 jetliners from Boeing and take options to buy 43 more in a major boost for the American aircraft manufacturer.The order for Boeing 787s will be divided between Saudi Arabia’s flag carrier, Saudia, and a planned new airline called Riyadh Air, which Saudi officials introduced over the weekend.At list prices, the combined deal would be worth about $37 billion if the options are exercised, but airlines routinely get deep discounts. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Relatively high oil prices have boosted Saudi Arabia’s economy and government, making it easier for the kingdom to close a multi-billion-dollar jet order.The creation of Riyadh Air by the Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and the growth of Saudia are part of a broader Saudi strategy to diversify its oil-based economy. Saudi Arabia hopes to become a global aviation hub and attract 100 million annual visitors by 2030.The kingdom's neighboring states of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have built up state-owned airlines and used their geographic location to become key connecting points for international travel.“The ambition here in the kingdom is huge, and this today ... is our first big order,” Tony Douglas, the CEO of Riyadh Air, told CNBC. “There will be more orders.""The planes covered by the orders and options are long-range, two-aisle “widebody” jets, in the industry jargon. Boeing and Europe's Airbus dominate the market.“Serving the Middle East, in our view, is a very, very important and critical market for widebodies, and we like that Boeing won this one,” said Boeing CEO David Calhoun, who traveled to Riyadh for the announcement.The Saudi deal is also a boost for the Boeing 787, which the company calls the Dreamliner. Boeing has struggled with interruptions in delivering new 787s for more than two years because of production flaws.Shares of Boeing Co., based in Arlington, Virginia, rose more than 4% Tuesday.Boeing had been talking to the Saudis about an order for three years, according to two senior U.S. administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been publicly announced. The officials said President Joe Biden did not directly lobby for the order when he met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last summer, but top aides made a pitch to Saudi government officials on Boeing's behalf.“We are particularly pleased that Boeing was able to finally conclude these deals with Saudi Arabia after years of discussions, and intensive negotiations over recent months,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. She called the announcement “another milestone in eight decades of cooperation between Saudi Arabia and American industry.”The Saudi deals will support about 1 million jobs in 44 states across the U.S. supply chain, including 150,000 new manufacturing jobs, according to administration officials.The planes will be powered by engines from General Electric Co.The Saudi orders come as a recovery in air travel boosts demand for jets made by Boeing and Airbus.Last month, Air India announced it had agreed to buy 220 planes from Boeing and 250 from Airbus. Both the Air India and combined Saudi Arabian order rank among Boeing's five largest.Boeing's history with Saudi Arabia goes back to early 1945, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented Abdulaziz al Saud— the founder of modern Saudi Arabia — with a DC-3 made by Douglas Aircraft Co., one of the forerunners of current-day Boeing.The relationship has stood through Democratic and Republican administrations ever since. President Donald Trump signed defense and commercial deals for Boeing during a 2017 trip to the kingdom. The crown prince toured a Boeing plant in the Seattle area the following year and signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture maintaining military aircraft in the kingdom.___Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835194,Class action suit filed against Silicon Valley Bank parent,"A class action lawsuit is being filed against the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, its CEO and its chief financial officer, saying that company didn't disclose the risks that future interest rate increases would have on its business.The lawsuit against SVB Financial Group, CEO Greg Becker and CFO Daniel Beck was filed in the U.S. district court for the Northern district of California. It is looking for unspecified damages to be awarded to those who invested in SVB between June 16, 2021 and March 10, 2023.The lawsuit from shareholders led by Chandra Vanipenta says some quarterly and annual financial reports from SVB didn't fully account for warnings from the Federal Reserve about interest rate hikes.In particular, the lawsuit said that annual reports for 2020 through 2022, “understated the risks posed to the company by not disclosing that likely interest rate hikes, as outlined by the Fed, had the potential to cause irrevocable damage to the company,” the lawsuit stated.It also claims that the company ""failed to disclose that, if its investments were negatively affected by rising interest rates, it was particularly susceptible to a bank run.”The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has shaken the technology industry and worried small businesses and individuals with deposits at the financial institution. The Biden administration’s move guaranteeing all Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits above the insured limit of $250,000 per account has brought relief to some.Silicon Valley quickly established itself as the “go-to” spot for venture capitalists looking for financial partners more open to unconventional business proposals than its bigger, more established peers who still didn’t have a good grasp of technology.Venture capitalists set up their accounts at Silicon Valley Bank just as the tech industry started its boom and then advised the entrepreneurs that they funded to do the same.That cozy relationship came to an end when the bank disclosed a $1.8 billion loss on low-yielding bonds that were purchased before interest rates began to spike last year, raising alarms among its financially savvy customer base who used the fruits of technology to spread warnings that turned into a calamitous run on deposits.",2023/03/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835195,Spanish police refloat homemade drug semi-submersible,"MADRID (AP) — Civil Guard police in northwestern Spain on Tuesday refloated a homemade semi-submersible vessel they suspect may have been used to transport cocaine.The 16-meter (52-foot) fiberglass vessel was spotted Monday sunk a kilometer (half a mile) off the coast in the Arousa estuary in the Ganorthwester. It will be towed to a nearby port where police will fully investigate it, but the national government's delegate to the local Galicia region, José Miñones, told reporters that initial checks show there are no drugs on board.He said police had been warned of a possible shipment of drugs arriving in Galicia.Police said it was too early to say whether the vessel had been used to transport cocaine or where it came from.A similar vessel with three metric tons of cocaine on board was found in another northern Spanish estuary in 2019. In 2021, Spanish police seized a homemade narco-semisubmersible able to carry up to two metric tons (2.2 tons) of cargo while it was being built in Malaga, on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol.Similar drug-smuggling crafts have been discovered in the Atlantic Ocean, especially off Central and South America.

(AP) — Corbin Carroll would make $134 million over nine years if the Arizona Diamondbacks exercise a 2031 option in his $111 million, eight-year contract.The deal for the 22-year-old outfielder, announced Saturday, is the largest guarantee for a player with less than 100 days of major league service. Carroll made his big league debut last Aug. 29 and has 38 days of service.He topped the $72 million, eight-year contract for Atlanta outfielder Michael A. Harris, who had 81 days of service when he reached agreement last Aug. 16 on a $72 million, eight-year contract that begins this season. Harris was voted NL Rookie of the Year.Carroll gets a $5 million signing bonus payable May 15 and salaries of $1 million this year, $3 million in 2024 and $5 million in 2025. He receives $10 million in 2026, $12 million in 2027, $14 million in 2028 — the three seasons he likely would have been eligible for arbitration.Carroll's deal calls for $28 million a year in both 2029 and 2030, years after he was in line to become a free agent. The Braves' 2031 option is for $28 million with a $5 million buyout.If he wins an MVP award in any year from 2028-30, his salaries for every following season would escalate by $5 million. If he finishes second through fifth in MVP voting those years, his salaries in remaining seasons would go up by $2.5 million. The maximum increase in any year is $7.5 million.Carroll, selected 16th overall by Arizona in the 2019 amateur draft, hit .260 last season with four homers and 14 RBIs in 32 games. ___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835199,EPA to limit toxic 'forever chemicals' in drinking water,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed the first federal limits on harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water, a long-awaited protection the agency said will save thousands of lives and prevent serious illnesses, including cancer.The plan would limit toxic PFAS chemicals to the lowest level that tests can detect. PFAS, or per- and polyfluorinated substances, are a group of compounds that are widespread, dangerous and expensive to remove from water. They don’t degrade in the environment and are linked to a broad range of health issues, including low birthweight and kidney cancer.“The science is clear that long-term exposure to PFAS is linked to significant health risks,” Radhika Fox, assistant EPA administrator for water, said in an interview.Fox called the federal proposal a “transformational change” for improving the safety of drinking water in the United States. The agency estimates the rule could reduce PFAS exposure for nearly 100 million Americans, decreasing rates of cancer, heart attacks and birth complications.The chemicals had been used since the 1940s in consumer products and industry, including in nonstick pans, food packaging and firefighting foam. Their use is now mostly phased out in the U.S., but some still remain.The proposal would set strict limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level that can be reliably measured, for two common types of PFAS compounds called PFOA and PFOS. In addition, the EPA wants to regulate the combined amount of four other types of PFAS. Water providers will have to monitor for PFAS.The public will have a chance to comment, and the agency can make changes before issuing a final rule, expected by the end of the year.The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators called the proposal “a step in the right direction” but said compliance will be challenging. Despite available federal money, “significant rate increases will be required for most of the systems” that must remove PFAS, the group said Tuesday.Environmental and public health advocates have called for federal regulation of PFAS chemicals for years. Over the last decade, the EPA has repeatedly strengthened its protective, voluntary health thresholds for the chemicals but has not imposed mandatory limits on water providers.Public concern has increased in recent years as testing reveals PFAS chemicals in a growing list of communities that are often near manufacturing plants or Air Force bases.Until now, only a handful of states have issued PFAS regulations, and none has set limits as strict as what the EPA is proposing. By regulating PFOA and PFOS at the minimum amounts that tests can detect, the EPA is proposing the tightest possible standards that are technically feasible, experts said.“This is a really historic moment,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. “There are many communities that have had PFAS in their water for decades who have been waiting for a long time for this announcement to come out.”The agency said its proposal will protect everyone, including vulnerable communities, and reduce illness on a massive scale. The EPA wants water providers to do testing, notify the public when PFAS are found and remove the compounds when levels are too high.Utilities that have high levels of a contaminant are typically given time to fix problems, but they could face fines or loss of federal grants if problems persist.The American Chemistry Council, which represents large chemical companies, slammed EPA’s “misguided approach” and said, “these low limits will likely result in billions of dollars in compliance costs.''In a statement Tuesday, the group said it has “serious concerns with the underlying science used to develop"" the proposed rule, adding: ""It’s critical that EPA gets the science right.''The proposal would also regulate other types of PFAS like GenX Chemicals, which manufacturers used as a substitute when PFOA and PFOS were phased out of consumer products. The proposal would regulate the cumulative health threat of those compounds and mandate treatment if that threat is too high.“Communities across this country have suffered far too long from the ever-present threat of PFAS pollution,″ EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. The EPA’s proposal could prevent tens of thousands of PFAS-related illnesses, he said, and stands as a ""major step toward safeguarding all our communities from these dangerous contaminants.”Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, which advocates for cleaning up a PFAS-contaminated stretch of North Carolina, said it was important to make those who released the compounds into the environment pay cleanup costs.The EPA recently made $2 billion available to states to get rid of contaminants such as PFAS and will release billions more in coming years. The agency also is providing technical support to smaller communities that will soon be forced to install treatments systems, and there's funding in the 2021 infrastructure law for water system upgrades.Still, it will be expensive for utilities to install new equipment, and the burden will be especially tough for small towns with fewer resources.“This is a problem that has been handed over to utilities through no fault of their own,” said Sri Vedachalam, director of water equity and climate resilience at Environmental Consulting & Technology Inc.Many communities will need to balance the new PFAS requirements with removing poisonous lead pipes and replacing aged water mains prone to rupturing, Vedachalam said.Fox said there “isn't a one-size answer” to how communities will prioritize their needs but said billions of dollars in federal resources are available for water improvements.With federal help, water providers that serve metropolitan areas should be able to spread out costs in a way ""no one will notice,'' said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that works to get toxic chemicals out of food, water, clothing and other items.Several states have already imposed PFAS drinking water limits. Officials in Michigan, which has the tightest standards of any state, said costs to remove PFAS in communities where it was found were reasonable.Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the EPA proposal crucial to protect public health. “Setting strong standards will help ensure the fundamental right of every family to have safe water flowing from their kitchen tap,'' he said.___Phillis reported from St. Louis.___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835200,Ohio Supreme Court to review block of near-ban on abortion,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Ohio Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to review a county judge’s order that is blocking enforcement of the state's near-ban on abortions, and to consider whether the clinics challenging the law have legal standing to do so.In its split decision, the court, however, denied Republican Attorney General Dave Yost's request to launch its own review of the right to an abortion under the Ohio Constitution, leaving those arguments to play out in lower court.This mean abortions remain legal in the state for now up to 20 weeks' gestation.Yost appealed Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins’ order to the state’s high court in January, after a failed effort to get it overturned by the First District Court of Appeals. The appellate court ruled the appeal premature, as it was only an interim step in the lawsuit challenging the so-called heartbeat law's constitutionality.Justices will now decide whether such orders are appropriate legal procedure, or attempts by lower courts to block laws they don't like, as Yost has asserted.Abortion rights organizations want the law to remain blocked, pointing to the chaos inflicted on patients, doctors and clinics during the 66 days that the Ohio ban was in effect last year.The law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibits most abortions after the first detectable “fetal heartbeat.” Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they’re pregnant. The law had been blocked through a different legal challenge until right after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.The ruling effectively nullified all abortion-rights lawsuits across the country that had cited the federal constitution, sending the question back to the states.The lawsuit filed in Jenkins' court argues a similar right exists under the Ohio Constitution.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835210,The Advancements and Future Implications of Artificial Intelligence: An In-Depth Analysis,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, becoming an integral part of many industries and sectors. From healthcare to finance, transportation to entertainment, AI has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate.The advancements in AI have been made possible by the development of sophisticated algorithms, powerful computing systems, and the availability of vast amounts of data. AI systems can now analyze complex data sets, recognize patterns, and make accurate predictions, all in real time.However, with these advancements come new challenges and implications for the future. The increasing use of AI raises concerns about privacy, security, and ethics. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, it is essential to consider its potential impact on society and the workforce.In this in-depth analysis, we will explore the current state of AI and its future implications. We will examine the ethical and societal considerations surrounding the use of AI and discuss how we can ensure its responsible development and deployment. Additionally, we will look at the potential benefits and risks of AI and its impact on the workforce.As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand its advancements and implications fully. By doing so, we can harness the power of AI to benefit humanity while mitigating any negative impacts.One of the primary concerns about AI is its potential impact on the job market. As AI systems become more sophisticated, there is a risk that they could replace human workers, leading to significant job losses. However, some experts argue that AI will create new job opportunities and improve productivity, leading to economical and technological growth.Another important consideration is the ethical implications of AI. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, there are concerns about privacy, bias, and the potential misuse of data. It is essential to establish clear ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI systems to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner.Additionally, the use of AI in decision-making processes raises concerns about accountability and transparency. It is essential to ensure that AI systems are transparent, and their decision-making processes can be explained and audited. This is particularly important in areas such as healthcare and criminal justice, where decisions made by AI systems can have significant consequences.Despite these concerns, there are many potential benefits to the development and deployment of AI. AI systems can improve efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in many industries, leading to economic growth and improved quality of life. For example, in healthcare, AI can help to diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently, leading to better patient outcomes.In conclusion, AI has the potential to transform our lives in significant ways. However, it is essential to consider its potential implications and ensure its responsible development and deployment. By doing so, we can harness the power of AI to benefit society while mitigating any negative impacts.",2023/03/14,,

The ""decisive action"" by regulators reduced the risk of further bank failures, Moritz Schularick, an economics professor at the University of Bonn, told DW.Secondly, the US today has much stricter regulations for banks, especially for the largest banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. As a result, the US banks are in much better financial health, in contrast to their overleveraged balance sheets in 2008.But Schularick cautions that the world should stay ""alert"" to the overarching problems facing the global financial sector at a time central banks have been raising interest rates at a hectic pace to bring down inflation.""These things are inherently difficult to forecast and the truth is that the problems that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are not limited to these two banks. So the question is: Who else is out there?""On Tuesday, Moody's placed six other US regional banks, including First Republic Bank, Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bancorp, under review for downgrade.""There is a possibility of indirect contagion, but at the moment we do not see this as a specific risk,"" European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said on Monday while speaking on risks posed by the current crisis to the European Union.Germany's financial services regulator Bafin imposed a moratorium on the Silicon Valley Bank's German branch, halting sales and payments. In a statement, the regulator stressed that the institution has ""no systemic relevance"" and therefore ""does not pose a threat to financial stability.""Swift action by the UK government, which facilitated the sale of the SVB's London branch to the global financial heavyweight HSBC, secured depositors there as well.Europe's banking index that tracks major European bank shares initially fell on Tuesday but recovered to rise 2.7%. The index posted its biggest percentage loss in more than a year on Monday amid fears of contagion.""A critical difference between the European and US systems, which will limit the impact across the Atlantic, is that European banks' bond holdings are lower and their deposits more stable,"" Moody's said in a note.The German startup sector has yet to witness any major fallouts from the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, which mainly catered to tech startups.""At its origin, this is not a startup crisis. It is about the refinancing problems of a bank,"" Christian Mile of the German Startup Association said. He, however, conceded that the consequences for German startups could not yet be conclusively determined.The current crisis came on the back of globally rising interest rates. Central banks use the lever of interest rates to cool business activity and in turn inflation. This tightening of monetary policy causes headaches for startups, as it dries up funding and restricts consumer spending.On the other hand, the banks' collapse and the financial vulnerabilities that it has laid bare could jeopardize the central banks' efforts to rein in price rises.""SVB's demise will pressure central banks into slowing interest rate hikes,"" said Arun Sai of Pictet Asset Management. ""Central banks will now have to consider the impact of any further interest rate hikes on the stability of the financial system.""The Silicon Valley Bank operated with a highly concentrated client base. The mostly venture capital-backed tech startups placed their deposits with the bank. After the bank received large deposits from its customers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, it invested the excess cash into government bonds, which turned into book losses amid rising interest rates.When clients weren't sure about funding conditions at SVB anymore, they started withdrawing their deposits, leading to a run on the bank.""This bank was particularly badly placed to cope with such a problem as they didn't even make a proper risk management of their interest rate exposure,"" Hans-Peter Burghof of the University of Hohenheim told DW.The failures of SVB and Signature Bank have ""exposed the inadequacy of regulatory reforms that have been made since the global financial crisis,"" said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University.Wilmarth noted that SVB grew rapidly between 2020 and 2022 and that its exposure to long-term fixed-interest bonds made it especially vulnerable to the shift in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. ""That's almost a sure-proof formula for failure. If the economy turns you begin to have trouble,"" Wilmarth said.Banking regulations that would have put the bank under stricter oversight were diluted in 2018 under the Trump Administration.""I'm going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely this kind of bank failure will happen again, and to protect American jobs as a small business,"" US President Joe Biden said on Monday.With inputs from Reuters, AP and AFPEdited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/14,,

She added that the bloc is preparing a proposal to cut gas use by 15% during winter months.The Commission is aiming to secure long-term electricity contracts which provide power at a stable price to consumers.EU member states are to guarantee a minimum power price to generators for all new investments requiring subsidies. Revenues above a set threshold are to be funnelled back to consumers, according to a press release.Such revenues would not apply to generators powered by fossil fuels.The proposal outlines public guarantees that aim to make long-term contracts signed between power producers and customers more viable.The commission said it aims to strengthen the rights of end users, giving them the right to choose between suppliers providing both fixed-price and dynamic contracts, as well as the possibility of acquiring more than one supply contract.The proposals include measures to manage varying demand, with more expensive sources like gas added to the mix at times of higher demand. The comission hopes that this measure will encourage investments in renewables.EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said of the measure that ""renewables are our ticket to energy sovereignty and ending our dependence on fossil fuels.""Energy prices in Europe are at present set by the final generator needed to meet demand. Since the final generator is often a gas plant, spikes in gas prices can have a substantial effect on overall energy prices.Last year, the bloc presented the reforms as a way to ""decouple"" gas and power prices.Some member states, such as Spain and France, had called for wider-reaching reforms of the energy market.Countries like Germany, Denmark and Latvia have warned against radical reforms, arguing that they could scare off investors.EU member states and the bloc's parliament must negotiate and approve the final changes.sdi/ar (Reuters, dpa, AFP)",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835261,Iran-Saudi deal: China's growing clout in the Middle East,"After China successfully brokered a deal last week to restore relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Beijing appears set to take on a larger role in the Middle East and potentially challenge US dominance in the oil-rich region.Under the agreement reached in the Chinese capital on Friday, Riyadh and Tehran agreed to reopen their embassies and exchange ambassadors after seven years of severed diplomatic ties and tensions.The rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, respectively the leading Shiite and Sunni Muslim powers in the Middle East, has dominated regional politics in recent years, affecting not only the two nations but also others with both sides backing rival camps in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria and elsewhere.Beijing described the result as a ""major outcome"" achieved through ""concerted efforts"" by the three countries, emphasizing that China ""pursues no selfish interest whatsoever in the Middle East.""""China has no intention to and will not seek to fill the so-called vacuum or put up exclusive blocs,"" Beijing said in a statement on Saturday, adding: ""China will be a promoter of security and stability, partner for development and prosperity, and supporter of the Middle East's development through solidarity.""The deal is a major triumph for Chinese diplomacy, said Camille Lons, a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.It also marks a shift in Beijing's strategy as ""until now, it had refused to get entangled in regional disputes, and smartly benefited from the US-led security umbrella while doing business with the entire region,"" she noted.""But by getting more involved in politics, China takes the risk of exposing its own limits.""Ian Chong, an expert on China's foreign policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS), shared a similar view.He pointed out that Beijing may find the Middle East to be a tricky region to operate in.""There are lots of complicated interests and tensions so how brokering this deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia will play out remains to be seen,"" he told DW.China has cultivated strong economic and political ties with both Riyadh and Tehran in recent years. Saudi Arabia is China's largest oil supplier, with trade between the two countries amounting to $87 billion (€81 billion)  in 2021.Commerce between Iran and China, meanwhile, was worth more than $16 billion in the same year, with Tehran depending on the Asian giant for as much as 30% of its foreign trade.China has also pledged to invest $400 billion in Iran over 25 years.Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to Saudi Arabia in December for a state visit, and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi visited Beijing in February.Chong from NUS said that by facilitating this deal, Beijing is signaling that it is now not just a leading economic player but is also willing to get involved in politics in the Middle East, a region which is the primary source of China's energy imports.Tuvia Gering, an expert on China-Middle East relations at the Diane and Guilford Glazer Center at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel (INSS), said Beijing hopes to carve out a bigger role for itself because the region has become ""strategically important"" to it.""It's not just for energy security, but on this wider gamut of areas,"" Gering told DW, pointing to Chinese investments in regional infrastructure as part of its massive multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.The Saudi-Iran deal comes at a time when many countries in the region perceive the US as winding down its engagement there.This doesn't mean Beijing could replace Washington in the Middle East, said Gering.""China said it doesn't want to be dragged into regional conflicts, and I don't think that wish has changed even though recent developments may have given Beijing a bit more appetite to become more active,"" he underlined, adding that China still needs to gain the region's trust before it can become a reliable partner. ""China is still a new actor and these things take a long time.""The US, meanwhile, welcomed China's efforts to help end the war in Yemen and deescalate tensions in the Middle East, but rejected the notion that it was stepping back from the region.It also stressed that the agreement was two years in the making.""This is not about China. We support any effort to deescalate tensions in the region. We think that's in our interests, and it's something that we worked on through our own effective combination of deterrence and diplomacy,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.John Calabrese, director of the Middle East-Asia Project at the Middle East Institute, said Beijing's role in brokering the deal doesn't fundamentally alter Washington's position.In his view, Beijing's main goal in the region is still ""maintaining its economic interests and expanding its economic equities.""""This requires regional stability to the extent that the US is still equipped to do so,"" he said, adding that de-escalation between Tehran and Riyadh is in the interest of the Middle East, China and the US.And despite US-Saudi tensions over an array of issues — ranging from human rights violations to Riyadh's continued participation in a pandemic-era oil pact with Russia — Saudi Arabia remains one of Washington's staunchest security partners in the region.Lons from IISS said the agreement shows that Gulf states like Saudi Arabia are willing to diversify their security and strategic partnerships so that they do not rely entirely on the US.She described these countries' approach as ""pragmatic"" and warned against overestimating Beijing's importance to the region.""When it comes to hard security guarantees, they are fully aware that the US remains their key partner.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/14,,

This is due to the fact that the human nose can filter out larger particles but smaller and ultrafine particles can get inhaled into the lungs where they can either enter the bloodstream or deposit within the lung lining.Lahore's air pollution rose to PM2.5 levels of 97.4 micrograms per cubic meter from 86.5 in 2021, replacing Bhiwadi in Indiaas the most polluted city globally.Bhiwadi and Delhi were next in the rankings, ,with pollution levels reaching up to 92.7 and 92.6 respectively.Indian cities filled 12 of the to 15 rankings of the most polluted cities in the world, the same as in last year's report.and Pakistan had India in the South Asia region, as well. Nearly 60% of the population in Central and South Asia live with PM2.5 levels that are seven times more than what the WHO guidelines have recommended.According to a World Bank pollution report on South Asia for the year 2022, nearly two million people died due to air pollution across the region.The central African nation of Chad was ranked the most polluted country in the world, with a 12 percent increase in annual PM2.5 concentrations from 2021. According to the report, this was mainly due to the burning of grasslands.Around 70% of global wildfires occur in Africa, NASA satellite data suggests.Iraq ranked as the second most polluted country with the pollution in the West Asia region being attributed to the rising dust storms.Pakistan ranked third, followed by Bahrain as the fourth most polluted country.Bangladesh improved its air quality ranking to the fifth position. Last year it was labeled as the most polluted country in the world with PM2.5 concentrations of 76.9. These now have come down to 65.8.Also, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Mongolia were able to improve their air quality while for Japan the levels remained the same as in 2021.Air quality also improved in the United States, with nine out of the ten most populated cities in the US has reduced PM2.5 levels in 2022 in comparison with 2021 levels.Australia's Canberra had the cleanest air amongst the world's capitals.Fifteen countries in Europe had reduced air quality levels than in 2021.IQAir collected data for PM2.5 concentrations from more than 30,000 air monitoring stations located in more than 7,300 spots in 131 countries and regions.The data was then analyzed keeping certain factors in check, such as the country's population.Material from the Reuters news agency contributed to this report.Edited by: Amanda Rivkin",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835264,Greece train crash: Protesters rage at political system,"""57 dead"" is printed in blood-red ink on a sticker one demonstrator has stuck to her sweater. Everyone in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city in Greece, knows what it means: 57 is the number of people killed in the devastating train crash that occurred when two trains traveling at top speed collided head-on just outside the village of Tempi near the city of Larissa on the evening of February 28.The 58-year-old woman with the sticker is one of hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets in over 50 towns and cities across Greece on March 8 to vent their anger.For her and the 20,000 other people crowded into downtown Thessaloniki, this tragedy is evidence of a complete political failure: ""It shows that all those who govern and have governed do not have our welfare at heart, just their own profit. This crime says it all,"" she says indignantly.""Crime"" is a word that appears on a lot of placards and banners at the protests; ""murderers"" is another. But the protests are directed against not only the current government, but also those that preceded it. People of all ages and political persuasions protested side by side on March 8 and agreed about one thing, namely that the entire political system must accept responsibility for the victims of the crash.The train crash seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back. With elections on the horizon, the anger of the people couldn't come at a worse time for the government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.There is nothing left of the promises of progress and modernization that swept Mitsotakis to power in the summer of 2019. The hopes many Greeks pinned on his premiership have now given way to outrage and disappointment.These days, it is not politicians who are being applauded, but trade unionists like Thodoris Varidakis. He is responsible for train maintenance at the privatized Greek train company Hellenic Train and has for years been drawing attention to what he says is the dreadful state of affairs in the sector.Now at last people are listening. When he takes to the podium, he speaks of the many failings and omissions he believes show that cost-cutting meant more to his employers than safety. Varidakis says that the company is chronically underfunded and understaffed. Everyone knew it, he told DW, but no one did anything about it.He dismisses the political gestures made by the government in Athens in the wake of the accident as farcical: ""It's not enough for the government to react with the resignation of a minister. On the day after the accident, the prime minister pointed the finger at the station master and blamed him,"" he says angrily.Thodoris Varidakis stresses that no ruling party from the last 20 years can wash its hands of the accident that killed 57 people near Tempi. He says that not only the ruling Nea Dimokratia, but also the social-democratic PASOK and the left-wing alliance led by former PM Alexis Tsipras did not take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the transport system.""Competitiveness comes before safety and health,"" says Varidakis, who warns that the safety of other means of transport — such as buses, planes and ships — has also been neglected.Almost every day, there are revelations in Greek media about the catastrophic state of the railway system. The conservative newspaper Kathimerini recently reported on errors made during the modernization of the automated signal and operating system, which have been known since 2018.The modern safety systems, which have long been installed but not in operation on the line on which the collision occurred, are used to identify human error and prevent negative consequences. Kathimerini concluded that if the system had been correctly implemented, there would have been no fatalities. It also noted that successive governments were indifferent to the problem.For many in Greece, the accident is symbolic of mismanagement and a series of wrong decisions made by a political elite that has, at best, been putting sticking plasters on many of the country's day-to-day problems.Bad roads, old buses, electricity grids at breaking point ... most people in Greece grudgingly accept these things, while having no faith that the state will do anything about them. The train crash near Tempi seems to have woken the country from its collective resignation. The death of 57 people cannot simply be airbrushed from the list of political failures.""I don't feel safe in my own country,"" says 20-year-old student Alexia Athanasiou from Larissa. In a video doing the rounds on social media, she says: ""We are all to blame for repeatedly electing the same people who are destroying the country. They are making me hate my own country.""Athanasiou told DW that many of the victims were students: ""They're killing our future,"" she says angrily. ""How can it be that governments have reduced this country to this state?"" Yet despite all this, she doesn't want to lose faith in democracy. She will be voting for the first time in the upcoming election and hopes to be able to change something that way.A date for this year's election has yet to be set. While there was initially talk of April 9, the expectation is now that the election will be held on May 21 or July 2.According to the first opinion polls since the crash, support for Mitsotakis's party is down just under three percentage points, dropping below 30%. SYRIZA, led by Alexis Tsipras, has made no gains and stays at 25%.Political advisor Wolfango Piccoli, who specializes in risk and crisis management, feels that Mitsotakis has lost credibility. ""The government has mismanaged the crisis from the start, pointing the finger towards human error. Then we saw the resignation of the transport minister, but not much more than that. I think they misread public opinion,"" he says.Piccoli believes that the prime minister is now trying to backpedal. ""Now Mitsotakis is trying to make up for these shortcomings, apologizing on the social media, promising investigations, conducted by a committee created by the former Minister of Transport, without consulting anybody, not even the opposition,"" he told DW.Piccoli sees the elections as a major challenge for Mitsotakis: ""For the government, the real challenge is that elections are coming. The concern is that they need to placate this sense of anger, but at the same time, they need to be very careful not to expose themselves too much. They are in a very tight space.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835265,"Hundreds dead as Cyclone Freddy wrecks Malawi, Mozambique","BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — The devastating Tropical Cyclone Freddy which has ripped through southern Africa in a rare second landfall has killed at least 219 people in Malawi and Mozambique since Saturday night, with the death toll expected to rise.Heavy rains that triggered floods and mudslides have killed 199 people in Malawi, authorities said Tuesday. President Lazarus Chakwera declared a “state of disaster” in the country's southern region and the now-ravaged commercial capital, Blantyre. Some 19,000 people in the south of the nation have been displaced, according to Malawi’s disaster management directorate.“Power and communications are down in many affected areas, hindering aid operations,” said Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. Secretary General’s spokesperson at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. The most affected regions remain inaccessible so the full extent of the damage is so far unknown.Reports from Mozambique’s disaster institute on Tuesday confirmed that 20 people have died in the country and 1,900 homes have been destroyed in the coastal Zambezia province. Tens of thousands of people are still holed up in storm shelters and accommodation centers.Freddy will continue to thump central Mozambique and southern Malawi with extreme rainfall before it exits back to the sea late Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.’s meteorological center on the island of Réunion projected.Human rights group Amnesty International has called on the international community to mobilize resources and boost aid and rescue efforts in the two countries. Relief efforts in the nations are strained and were already battling a cholera outbreak when Freddy struck.“It is clear that the official death toll will rise in both Malawi and Mozambique, as will reports of wrecked infrastructure,” said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s east and southern Africa director. “The affected countries must also be compensated for loss and damage caused by the cyclone.""In November last year, nations agreed to compensate countries affected by extreme weather exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Cyclones are wetter, more frequent and more intense as the planet heats up, scientists say.“Mozambique and Malawi are among the countries least responsible for climate change, yet they are facing the full force of storms that are intensifying due to global warming driven mostly by carbon emissions from the world’s richest nations,” Chagutah added.Cyclone Freddy has been causing destruction in southern Africa since late February. It also pummeled the island states of Madagascar and Réunion last month as it traversed across the Indian Ocean.The cyclone has intensified a record seven times and has the highest-ever recorded accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, which is a measurement of how much energy a cyclone has released over time. Freddy recorded more energy over its lifetime than an entire typical U.S. hurricane season.Freddy first developed near Australia in early February and is set to be the longest-ever recorded tropical cyclone. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record set by Hurricane John in 1994 of 31 days.___Alexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835266,Ohio State asks court to hear Title IX issues in abuse suits,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio State University is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to consider questions about the law known as Title IX in a case that affects whether more than 230 men can proceed with lawsuits against the school over decades-old sexual abuse by a team doctor, the late Richard Strauss.The petition filed Tuesday urges the high court to hear the case and review two aspects: When does the clock start ticking on the legal time limit for filing Title IX claims, which in this case are about the university's alleged “deliberate indifference” toward sexual harassment? And does the right to bring such claims apply to people who aren't students or employees there, such as fans attending football games or visitors touring campus?The school argues the divided appeals court that revived the unsettled lawsuits against OSU reached the wrong conclusions on both elements.“Together, these rulings arm virtually anyone who has visited Ohio State over the past 40 years with a potential Title IX claim today,” and that result wasn’t what Congress intended in establishing the law in 1972, the university’s legal team wrote in the petition to the high court. They maintain “the questions presented are purely legal and thus transcend the particular circumstances alleged here.”The abuse survivors and their lawyers see it differently, accusing the university of adding to their trauma with each new round of legal appeals.“And even though it’s on procedural grounds, to the survivors it appears that Ohio State is trying to avoid accountability for allowing them to be sexually abused,"" said Steve Estey, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs seeking to take their lawsuits to trial.The university has repeatedly offered public apologies to those Strauss harmed and has reached over $60 million in settlements with at least 296 survivors. It eventually sought to have the remaining unsettled cases dismissed, arguing that the time limit for the claims — the applicable two-year statute of limitations in Ohio — began during the doctor's tenure and had long passed.Remaining plaintiffs have argued that they filed timely claims and that the clock didn’t start until allegations became public in 2018, because they didn’t have reason before then to believe the university had enabled or covered up the doctor’s behavior.The appeals court's agreement with that, combined with its finding that several plaintiffs could bring such Title IX claims even though they weren't OSU students or employees when the alleged abuse occurred, wrongly expanded the scope of Title IX in ways that are problematic and potentially very costly for all sorts of schools under that law, Ohio State contends. Its petition also says a threat of Title IX lawsuits based on decades-old allegations might deter schools from investigating such claims.It noted that the decision from the Cincinnati-based Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals about when the clock started conflicts with conclusions from federal appeals courts elsewhere, and said that points to the need for the nation's high court to weigh in.“We can all agree that the underlying abuse here was reprehensible, but the Supreme Court has to resolve these fundamental legal issues for everybody going forward, without regard to the underlying allegations or facts here,” said Gregory Garre, an attorney representing OSU.In a separate statement, the university said its request to the court doesn't question the plaintiffs' accounts of abuse or diminish its commitment to supporting survivors.But the request is sure to frustrate plaintiffs who contend Ohio State hasn’t dealt with them fairly. Meanwhile, the unsettled lawsuits remain paused for months more as the plaintiffs' attorneys decide whether to file a response to the petition and then wait to see whether the case will be in the limited number the Supreme Court decides to hear.The men are among hundreds of former student-athletes and other alumni who say they were abused by Strauss during his two decades at the school, and that university officials failed to stop him despite knowing about complaints as far back as the late 1970s, very early in the doctor's two decades there. Many of them allege Strauss abused them during medical exams at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and an off-campus clinic.He died in 2005. No one has publicly defended him.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835268,Polish activist convicted for helping obtain abortion pills,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A Warsaw court on Tuesday convicted a women's rights activist for helping a victim of domestic violence access abortion pills in Poland, and sentenced her to eight months of community service.The case of Justyna Wydrzyńska has been closely watched by human rights activists, who believe it will set a precedent in a country with some of Europe's most restrictive abortion legislation.They feared that the charges and a guilty verdict would create an atmosphere of repression that would intimidate women's rights activists and discourage them from assisting women seeking abortions.A reproductive rights organization, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, said it was “appalled"" that Wydrzyńska will now have a criminal record for helping a woman who was in an abusive relationship.“We are deeply saddened by the decision and outraged by the entire process. Condemning a person for an act of empathy and compassion towards another human being is inconceivable,"" said spokesperson Irene Donadio.Ordo Iuris, an ultra-Catholic legal institute which joined the case on the side of the prosecution as an interested party, welcomed the ruling as “an important step towards real respect for the right to life of unborn children in force in Poland.”“The defendant, as well as the entire environment of abortion activists, have been promoting abortion, including pharmacological abortion, for years, mocking the well-known law in force in Poland,” the organization said in a statement.Prosecutors had charged Wydrzyńska with “helping with an abortion,"" a crime punishable up by to three years in prison, for helping a woman in 2020 to obtain the pills.The woman, identified in Polish media reports only as Anna, already had one child and was prevented by her partner from traveling abroad for an abortion. Her partner reportedly denounced her to the police for obtaining the pills.In her closing statement to the court, Wydrzyńska described how she wanted to help the woman because she too had been in a relationship with an abusive husband and had an abortion at the end of her marriage in order to free herself and her three children from that situation.She said she did not regret helping Anna.“I am innocent,” she said. “This state is guilty and has failed me ... and millions of women in this country.”Wydrzyńska will appeal the case, according to Polish media reports. She's the co-founder of the Abortion Dream Team, an organization that provides women seeking abortions with information and support.Poland, a predominantly Catholic country, forbids abortion in almost all cases, with exceptions only when a woman’s life or health is endangered or if the pregnancy results from rape or incest.For years, abortion was allowed in the case of fetuses with congenital defects. However, the country's constitutional court in 2020 ruled that to be unconstitutional.In practice, Polish women seeking to terminate their pregnancies order abortion pills or travel to Germany, the Czech Republic and other countries where the procedure is allowed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835269,San Francisco board open to reparations with $5M payouts,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Payments of $5 million to every eligible Black adult, the elimination of personal debt and tax burdens, guaranteed annual incomes of at least $97,000 for 250 years and homes in San Francisco for just $1 a family.These were some of the more than 100 recommendations made by a city-appointed reparations committee tasked with the thorny question of how to atone for centuries of slavery and systemic racism. And the San Francisco Board of Supervisors hearing the report for the first time Tuesday voiced enthusiastic support for the ideas listed, with some saying money should not stop the city from doing the right thing.Several supervisors said they were surprised to hear pushback from politically liberal San Franciscans apparently unaware that the legacy of slavery and racist policies continues to keep Black Americans on the bottom rungs of health, education and economic prosperity, and overrepresented in prisons and homeless populations.“Those of my constituents who lost their minds about this proposal, it's not something we’re doing or we would do for other people. It’s something we would do for our future, for everybody's collective future,” said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, whose district includes the heavily LGBTQ Castro neighborhood.The draft reparations plan, released in December, is unmatched nationwide in its specificity and breadth. The committee hasn’t done an analysis of the cost of the proposals, but critics have slammed the plan as financially and politically impossible. An estimate from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, which leans conservative, has said it would cost each non-Black family in the city at least $600,000.Tuesday's unanimous expressions of support for reparations by the board do not mean all the recommendations will ultimately be adopted, as the body can vote to approve, reject or change any or all of them. A final committee report is due in June.Some supervisors have said previously that the city can't afford any major reparations payments right now given its deep deficit amid a tech industry downturn.Tinisch Hollins, vice-chair of the African American Reparations Advisory Committee, alluded to those comments, and several people who lined up to speak reminded the board they would be watching closely what the supervisors do next.“I don’t need to impress upon you the fact that we are setting a national precedent here in San Francisco,” Hollins said. “What we are asking for and what we’re demanding for is a real commitment to what we need to move things forward.”The idea of paying compensation for slavery has gained traction across cities and universities. In 2020, California became the first state to form a reparations task force and is still struggling to put a price tag on what is owed.The idea has not been taken up at the federal level.In San Francisco, Black residents once made up more than 13% of the city’s population, but more than 50 years later, they account for less than 6% of the city’s residents — and 38% of its homeless population. The Fillmore District once thrived with Black-owned night clubs and shops until government redevelopment in the 1960s forced out residents.Fewer than 50,000 Black people still live in the city, and it’s not clear how many would be eligible. Possible criteria include having lived in the city during certain time periods and descending from someone “incarcerated for the failed War on Drugs.”Critics say the payouts make no sense in a state and city that never enslaved Black people. Opponents generally say taxpayers who were never slave owners should not have to pay money to people who were not enslaved.Advocates say that view ignores a wealth of data and historical evidence showing that long after U.S. slavery officially ended in 1865, government policies and practices worked to imprison Black people at higher rates, deny access to home and business loans and restrict where they could work and live.Justin Hansford, a professor at Howard University School of Law, says no municipal reparations plan will have enough money to right the wrongs of slavery, but he appreciates any attempts to “genuinely, legitimately, authentically” make things right. And that includes cash, he said.“If you’re going to try to say you’re sorry, you have to speak in the language that people understand, and money is that language,” he said.John Dennis, chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, does not support reparations although he says he’d support a serious conversation on the topic. He doesn’t consider the board’s discussion of $5 million payments to be one.“This conversation we’re having in San Francisco is completely unserious. They just threw a number up, there’s no analysis,” Dennis said. “It seems ridiculous, and it also seems that this is the one city where it could possibly pass.”The board created the 15-member reparations committee in late 2020, months after California Gov. Gavin Newsom approved a statewide task force amid national turmoil after a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, a Black man.The committee continues to deliberate recommendations, including monetary compensation, and its report is due to the Legislature on July 1. At that point it will be up to lawmakers to draft and pass legislation.The state panel made the controversial decision in March to limit reparations to descendants of Black people who were in the country in the 19th century. Some reparations advocates said that approach does not take into account the harms that Black immigrants suffer.Under San Francisco's draft recommendation, a person would have to be at least 18 years old and have identified as “Black/African American” in public documents for at least 10 years. Eligible people must also meet two of eight other criteria, though the list may change.Those criteria include being born in or migrating to San Francisco between 1940 and 1996 and living in the city for least 13 years; being displaced from the city by urban renewal between 1954 and 1973, or the descendant of someone who was; attending the city's public schools before they were fully desegregated; or being a descendant of an enslaved person.The Chicago suburb of Evanston became the first U.S. city to fund reparations. The city gave money to qualifying people for home repairs, down payments and interest or late penalties due on property. In December, the Boston City Council approved of a reparations study task force.___This story has been updated to correct what critics said about California’s plan to limit reparations to descendants of slaves.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835270,Could scientist Claudia Sheinbaum be Mexico’s next leader?,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico is a year away from electing its next head of state and the potential candidate getting the most attention is an environmental scientist who might become the first female leader of Latin America’s second-largest economy.One poll shows Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum nearly 20 points ahead of her closest rival in their ruling party.A globally recognized scientist, Sheinbaum, 60, shares the leftist ideals of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In an interview with The Associated Press Sheinbaum, like López Obrador, blamed the neoliberal economic policies of past presidents for exacerbating inequities.But the leaders would diverge on their approach.López Obrador has sought to create jobs regardless of their environmental consequences, dedicating resources to propping up Mexico’s state-owned oil company before supporting a few projects by American renewable-energy companies. In contrast, Sheinbaum holds a PhD in engineering, served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won a shared Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, and pledges to commit Mexico to sustainability.She emphasizes her belief in all scientific findings, in fields from the environment to medicine.“I believe in science,” she said. “I believe in technology to have a better life.”López Obrador last year inaugurated a massive new oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco, saying that his government had decided to ignore “the siren calls ... that the oil era was over.”Despite the refinery's inauguration, it has not started operation.At the same time, López Obrador has passed laws putting private gas and renewable energy facilities last in line for power purchasing, behind government-owned plants that often burn dirty fuel oil. He has more recently applauded a new government-run solar facility in northern Mexico and celebrated Tesla’s decision to build a car manufacturing plant near Monterrey, moves seen as feeding his interests in fueling job growth and satisfying U.S. complaints about a lack of free trade.Sheinbaum has said her belief in renewable energy is fundamental.“I think we have to start growing more in renewable energy and to go ahead with the electrification of cars,” Sheinbaum said. “From now to the future, most of the energy has to be related to renewable energy.”Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Sheinbaum took up wearing a protective mask, shut down bars and nightclubs, later reducing their hours, and pushed for more COVID-19 testing. While López Obrador downplayed the threat and spoke of being protected by amulets, Sheinbaum made no direct criticism of the president.Now Sheinbaum is locked in what appears to be a three-way battle for the nomination of their party, Morena, which has an unrivaled political machine. If successful, she would be expected to easily overcome the legacy opposition parties struggling to present a credible alternative. Morena and its allies govern 22 of the 32 states and the state apparatus is already working in the non-official pre-electoral campaign.The other contenders for the Morena party’s nomination are Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard and Interior Secretary Adán Augusto López. Ebrard was seen as the most likely successor at the start of López Obrador’s term in late 2018 but in a survey conducted by pollster Enkoll between Feb. 4-7, Sheinbaum held an 18-point lead over Ebrard among 1,223 people asked who they preferred for the Morena party nominee. The poll had a margin of error of +/-2.83%.Sheinbaum has received relatively high marks for her management of one of the world’s largest cities. Mexico City has more than 9 million residents and the surrounding metro area brings the total near 25 million. The capital has been governed by a leftist since residents began electing their mayors in 1997, and it has the country’s most progressive policies.Sheinbaum faced criticism for her handling of the capital’s sprawling subways. In May 2021, an elevated section collapsed, causing 26 deaths and injuring nearly 100 peopleIn January, she decided to deploy more than 6,000 National Guard troops into the system following the collision of two trains that left one person dead and dozens injured. Metro workers said spare parts and maintenance were needed, not troops, but Sheinbaum suggested that sabotage could be to blame.Sheinbaum had been in the habit of spending weekends making public appearances in other states and was away when that accident occurred. She curtailed her travel after that incident. Asked about the metro’s issues, the mayor pointed to major capital investments made during her term and said additional funding would be coming based on recommendations from a panel of experts.“None of the three (candidates) have the president’s charisma,” said Ivonne Acuña Murillo, a political scientist at Iberoamerican University. “López Obrador has built a closeness with the people over decades, that there isn’t time for them to replicate.”López Obrador spent decades in campaign mode and seeming happiest wading into a crowd.“She has a very different style of governing from AMLO, much more based on evidence,” said Marcela Bravo Araujo, a political scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, using López Obrador’s initials.Still, Sheinbaum echoed López Obrador about recent controversial reforms that will cut resources to Mexico’s electoral authority, which has been lauded for running relatively clean elections since the end of seven decades of single-party domination.Sheinbaum believes Mexico can achieve the same democracy or even a better one without “all of these resources that pay many, many, many people that probably the electoral system doesn’t need.”She frames Mexico’s relationship with the U.S., which at times as been tense under López Obrador on issues such as immigration, drug trafficking and security, in entirely commercial terms. She said she sees great opportunity within the free trade agreement that Mexico has with the United States and Canada, but the challenge is making sure foreign investment “can bring wealth to the Mexican people.”As for her political platform, she says that she wants to continue targeting poverty .“For me, being from the left has to do with that, with guaranteeing the minimum rights to all residents,” Sheinbaum said, rattling off rights to education, health, shelter, decent work and pay. “In that sense it is shrinking the great inequalities, reducing poverty by building up the big rights and at the same time strengthening democracy.”Sheinbaum’s Jewish grandparents emigrated from Lithuania and Bulgaria but she was raised not practicing any religion in overwhelmingly Catholic Mexico.The formal campaign has not officially started, but one topic that has not become an issue is gender. Nine of Mexico's 32 states have female governors. And even though gender-based violence remains a problem nationwide, along with daily sexism, Sheinbaum says that her gender has no negative impact on her aspirations today.“Probably 10 years ago it was a handicap, right now it is something positive,” she said.",2023/03/15,,World

The salary cap-squeezed Buffalo Bills have little money to work with even after GM Brandon Beane restructured the contracts of Josh Allen and Von Miller to free up more than $30 million of cap room. That still leaves the Bills little breathing room to begin filling numerous needs, which will include the likelihood of having to replace long-time defensive fixtures Edmunds and Poyer. The process began Sunday, with linebacker Matt Milano agreeing to sign a two-year contract extension in a move that freed up $6 million against the cap. Edmunds’ expected departure — he already has agreed to a deal with Chicago — leaves a huge hole in the middle of Buffalo’s defense, while Poyer was part of a veteran defensive secondary that included starters Micah Hyde and Tre’Davious White. The Bills could use more experienced depth at receiver after Gabe Davis failed to establish himself at the No. 2 role opposite Stefon Diggs.

The speaker of Hungary's parliament, himself a member of Semjen's ruling coalition, must approve the request for a postponement.Hungary remains the only NATO member country — besides Turkey — that hasn’t yet approved the two Nordic countries’ bids to join the Western military alliance. The delay is the second in two weeks and only the latest of many that have come in succession since July 2022.On March 2, the ratification vote was pushed back by two weeks as Hungary sent a delegation to Sweden and Finland to resolve “political disputes” that had raised doubts among some ruling party lawmakers on whether to support the NATO applications.Yet members of the delegation spoke positively about their meetings with Swedish and Finnish officials, indicating that Hungary's parliament was likely to ratify the bids some time soon but without giving a timeline.The northern European neighbors dropped their long-standing military neutrality and sought NATO membership in May in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

A senior Canadian official ruled out terrorism.Steeve Gagnon — a slim, bearded man wearing glasses and a grey T-shirt — did not speak in court Tuesday. His lawyer, Hugo Caissy, said his client understood the two charges against him and asked the judge to waive the requirement that a bail hearing be held within three days.Prosecutor Simon Blanchette said more charges would undoubtedly follow once all the evidence is gathered.The case returns to court April 5, and Gagnon will remain detained until then.Police earlier said the accused would face murder charges in connection with the deaths, saying the suspect acted deliberately and with premeditation.Quebec provincial police have said their investigation suggests the driver swerved from one side of the road to the other over a considerable distance to hit victims who appeared to be selected at random.Sgt. Claude Doiron told reporters that police believed the crash was intentional but did not suggest a motive.“We’re talking about pedestrians who were walking all along the (road), on both sides in fact, over a certain distance,” he said.Gérald Charest, 65, and Jean Lafrenière, 73, were killed.Last month in Laval, Quebec, police said a city bus driver deliberately smashed into a daycare center, killing two children. Immediately after the bus plowed into the building, the driver stepped out of the bus, ripped his clothes off and started screaming, witnesses said.“I feel terrible because it’s happening for the second time in a month,” Quebec Premier François Legault said.Legault said that “unfortunately it is happening everywhere in the world,” adding that there needs to be more support for mental health services. He also said people need to take action if they see someone around them who appears to be at risk.Three of the injured were in critical condition, police said. The injured include two children — one under 1 year old and another about 3 — who were both seriously hurt but whose lives were not in danger, officials said..A senior government official familiar with the matter said the incident was not terrorism or related to national security. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.The town of Amqui closed schools Tuesday.“We're all trembling thinking about what happened,” Amqui Mayor Sylvie Blanchette said.Several ambulances swarmed to the scene after the ramming took place about 3 p.m.David Morin, a local resident, said he couldn’t get the image of one of the victims out of his head.“He was alive when I arrived, and when I went to see another person, I came back and he was dead,” he said.Morin said residents ran to the aid of the victims in the moments that followed. He recalled sitting next to a woman dressed in pink, and asking her name as others helped the two young children.Regional health authorities in the Lower St-Lawrence region confirmed six of the injured were transported by plane to a Quebec City hospital.In 2021, a man used a pickup to kill four members of an immigrant family in London, Ontario, in what Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said was a hate crime directed at Muslims.In 2018, a man in a van rampaged through pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people.

A case was dropped against a third man for lack of evidence.The show was taken off the air more than a year ago after a sexual misconduct scandal hit the TV ratings juggernaut in one of the most serious #MeToo reckonings to hit the Dutch entertainment world.The show was first aired in the Netherlands before local versions were spun off around the world.Prosecutors said that a 41-year-old man will be prosecuted for sexual offenses with three women in 2014 and 2018 in the Netherlands and another country. One of the cases is linked to The Voice of Holland. A fourth case, also linked to the show, was dropped.A 51-year-old man also will be prosecuted for a sexual offense that allegedly happened in February 2018 “in or around the recording studios where The Voice of Holland was recorded,” prosecutors said in a statement.They did not elaborate on the nature of the charges against the two men.The statement did not identify either man, in line with Dutch privacy rules. Dutch media, including the RTL network that aired the show, identified the 41-year-old as the rapper and Voice coach Ali Bouali, and the 51-year-old as the show's pianist and band leader, Jeroen Rietbergen.Bouali's lawyer, Bart Swier, said last year that the rapper denied any wrongdoing.Rietbergen quit the show and said in a statement last year that he had ""contact of a sexual nature with some women involved in the program and exchanged sexually tinted WhatsApp messages.”Rietbergen went on to say that after initially considering the sexual encounters “as reciprocal and equal,” he later came to understand that the women “may have experienced this very differently.""He added: ""This insight has made me realize that my behavior has been completely wrong.”It was not yet clear when the two would face trial.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835277,Attack lines broaden beyond abortion in Wisconsin court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Republican-backed candidate in Wisconsin's high-stakes race for state Supreme Court accused his liberal opponent Tuesday of slandering him in a barrage of television ads that initially focused on his views on abortion, but have widened to take on his past work for Republicans and other topics.Dan Kelly, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, faces Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County judge, on April 4. The winner will determine majority control of the court, with the fate of abortion access, legislative redistricting, voting rights, rules for elections and other major issues at stake.The winner will also be in place heading into the 2024 presidential election in battleground Wisconsin. The court, currently controlled 4-3 by conservatives, came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s narrow win in 2020.Kelly and his supporters have been outspent by Protasiewicz and her backers nearly 2-to-1 since the Feb. 21 primary.About $13.2 million has been spent on television ads since the primary, according to AdImpact, which tracks TV spending nationwide. Of that, $8.3 million benefitted Protasiewicz compared with $4.9 million for Kelly, the group said.“I won’t go through all the specifics, but the ads that she is paying to be run against me are nothing but a dirty pack of lies,” Kelly said. “They’re simply not true.”Protasiewicz's campaign spokesperson Sam Roecker responded by saying “Dan Kelly’s entire record is a sham” and accused him and his allies of “lying about Janet from day one.”“Wisconsinites can follow the facts in all of our ads and see the truth for themselves,"" Roecker said.Kelly's backers are largely trying to paint Protasiewicz as weak on crime and unethical for speaking so forcefully in support of abortion rights. Kelly said he did not think Protasiewicz could be impartial on the court.Kelly downplayed his work for Republicans, saying he also had clients on the left, but he declined to name them. He also defended prior blog posts where he detailed his conservative views on abortion and other issues, saying his political positions are “completely irrelevant to the work of the court.”Kelly is a former conservative justice who was endorsed by Donald Trump in 2020. Protasiewicz received the endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday.Kelly took questions Tuesday from a panel of reporters at an event hosted by the Milwaukee Press Association, WisPolitics.com and the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. Protasiewicz declined to participate. They meet on March 21 for their one and only debate before the election. That is the same day that early, in-person voting begins in Wisconsin.As of March 8, more than $20 million had been spent or booked for television and radio ads, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks spending only on television and radio ads. The previous high spent on a state supreme court race was $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004.The final tally in Wisconsin will likely go much higher, especially when all other spending on the race is accounted for.Protasiewicz has placed $8 million in orders for ads through the April 4 election. The next highest spender is a group funded by GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein called Fair Courts America. It has spent nearly $4 million on spots for Kelly. The political wing of the conservative state chamber of commerce, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, has also booked $3.4 million in ads in support of Kelly, according to the Brennan Center.In her ads, Protasiewicz initially focused on portraying Kelly as an extremist on abortion given his support from the state’s three largest anti-abortion groups, all of which want the state’s 1849 law banning nearly all abortions to remain in place.Kelly has not said how he would rule on the abortion law should it reach the court, but he did write in a previous blog post that everyone knows the procedure “takes the life of an unborn child.” On Tuesday, Kelly said campaign ads stating that he would vote to uphold the 1849 abortion ban are a lie because he has not said how he would rule.Kelly has accused Protasiewicz of going too far and essentially of committing to voting to overturn the state’s 1849 law banning nearly all abortions, should the lawsuit seeking to overturn the law come before the court as expected. Protasiewicz has not said how she would rule on that or any other specific case.Over the past two weeks, Protasiewicz has broadened her attacks on Kelly beyond abortion. In a new ad launched Tuesday, Protasiewicz focuses on blog posts Kelly made in 2013 saying that Social Security and Medicare are for those who “have chosen to retire without sufficient assets to support themselves.”Kelly has not run any ads yet. But he said Tuesday they were coming soon.",2023/03/15,,World

Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed into law legislation making it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming care for children, a move that could effectively reinstate a blocked ban on such care.Sanders on Monday signed the new law, which won't take effect until this summer. It would allow anyone who received gender-affirming care as a minor to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor for up to 15 years after they turn 18. Under current Arkansas law, medical malpractice claims must be filed within two years of an injury.Legal experts have said the change could close access to gender-affirming care for children by making it nearly impossible for providers to get malpractice insurance.The new law is among a growing number of bills targeting transgender people, who have faced increasingly hostile rhetoric at statehouses. At least 175 bills targeting trans people have been introduced in statehouses so far this year, the most in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign.The bill was signed as a federal judge is considering whether to strike down a 2021 Arkansas law that would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers to anyone under 18 — or referring them to other doctors who can provide that care. No gender-affirming surgery is performed on minors in the state.U.S. District Judge Jay Moody temporarily blocked the law in 2021. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban, and several states have approved similar restrictions.

That's 100 times the average monthly salary in Bosnia, which stands at some 600 euros ($640).The head of a Bosnian Serb journalists' association, Sinisa Vukelic, said during the protest that, if the law were approved, “news reporting will become mission impossible, investigative journalism will cease to exist and ordinary citizens will face the threat of criminal prosecution for their speech, even for what they say in private gatherings.”The protest was held in the northwestern town of Banja Luka.The draft law has prompted condemnation from European Union and U.S. officials, the global anti-corruption group Transparency International, the International Federation of Journalists, which represents more than 600,000 media workers across the world, and other national and global groups.Last week, unidentified perpetrators vandalized vehicles belonging to two prominent Bosnian Serb journalists who had vocally criticized the recriminalization of defamation in Republika Srpska, as Bosnia’s Serb-run part is called.Dodik, however, doubled down accusing the journalists of staging the attack to grab public attention, and promised to soon also introduce to parliament a Russian-style foreign agent registration bill.In response, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo tweeted that the proposed laws would “make it harder for citizens to hold the (Bosnian Serb) government accountable and make it easier for corruption to flourish unchecked.”“We have seen this move before, and we know how it ends …Russian authorities have used their repressive legislation to suppress dissent, eviscerate civil society, and eradicate free media,” the embassy tweet added.Staunchly pro-Russian Dodik has been the most influential Bosnian Serb leader for nearly two decades — despite being sanctioned by the West for advocating the separation of Republika Srpska from the rest of the country and actively blocking the reforms required if Bosnia wants to reach its stated goal of joining the EU.The EU mission to Bosnia, in Sarajevo, tweeted last week that “freedom of expression and of the media are fundamental principles and values” that every EU candidate country, including Bosnia, is expected to uphold. “Journalists must be able to do their important work without fear of intimidation,” the tweet added.Over the years, Dodik weathered countless accusations by national and international rights and media freedom groups of curbing media independence and popularizing rhetoric against Western diplomats and political opponents of all ethnic stripes.Russia has backed Dodik, fueling fears in the West that Moscow might try to create further instability in the volatile Balkan nation to divert some attention from its war in Ukraine.Separatist ambitions among ethnic Serbs sparked Bosnia’s devastating 1992-95 war, which killed more than 100,000 people, displaced millions and shattered the country for years to come. A U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the war created the Serb and Bosniak-Croat entities.They’re linked by shared, state-wide institutions, and all actions at a national level require consensus from all three ethnic groups.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835282,$2.5B in grants for EV chargers aim at underserved US areas,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government on Tuesday announced $2.5 billion in new grants for the construction of electric vehicle charging stations and alternative fueling infrastructure, aiming in part at increasing access in underserved neighborhoods and communities.Known as the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure or CFI program, the grants will be doled out over a five-year period, with an emphasis on both highway chargers but also locations in traditionally underserved and disadvantaged urban, rural and tribal communities.A statement from the Department of Transportation said the grants will be targeted to “fill gaps in the national charging and alternative-fueling network.”Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in the statement that the overarching goal is ""modernizing our infrastructure and creating good jobs in the process.”He hailed the fresh funding as ""another big step forward in creating an EV future that is convenient, affordable, reliable, and accessible to all Americans.”The $2.5 billion in funding is split evenly into two tracks: a Community Program which seeks to strategically distribute chargers in underserved locations in cities and communities; and a Corridor Program, which will focus on highways with the goal of establishing Alternative Fuel Corridors to enable gasoline-free cross-country travel and long-haul trucking.The money builds on a separate $5 billion in federal money dedicated to growing a nationwide network of EV chargers specifically along highways. The Biden administration has been prioritizing construction on highway routes that can allow EV drivers to go long distances, at the expense for now of neighborhoods, shopping centers and apartment dwellings in more urban areas where chargers have been in relatively higher demand.Established by the Bipartisan Instructure Law, which was passed by Congress in November 2021, the grants come under the umbrella of President Joe Biden’s public goal of establishing 500,000 public EV charging stations and reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent by the year 2030.The department did not specify how many chargers it expects to help build off the latest round of funding. Direct-current fast chargers, which can charge a car up to 80% of its battery capacity in 20 to 45 minutes, are quite expensive, costing $40,000 to $100,000, limiting the number that can be built, but they enable drivers to quickly get back on a road such as a highway. Level 2 chargers are cheaper in cost but take a few hours to charge an EV, and are typically placed in neighborhoods and near schools, stores and offices.In addition to electric chargers, the grants will fund the establishment of more hydrogen, propane, or natural gas refueling infrastructure. The EV charger funding will target new charging stations at public buildings, schools and parks as well as publicly accessible parking garages.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the new grants will provide a much-needed push for the growing electric vehicle industry. The rapid expansion of the electric vehicle market has strained the infrastructure in many cities, leading to consumer reluctance — especially for residents who can't conveniently charge at home.“Ensuring that charging stations are more visible and accessible in our communities addresses the concerns many American drivers have when considering making the switch to electric,” Granholm said in a statement.___Associated Press writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835283,"Edey, Jackson-Davis, Wilson headline AP All-America Team","Purdue's Zach Edey and Indiana's Trayce Jackson-Davis have given the Big Ten Conference a third straight year with multiple first-team Associated Press All-America picks, while Kansas had a second straight first-teamer in Jalen Wilson.The 7-foot-4, 305-pound Edey appeared on all 58 ballots as a first-team selection from AP Top 25 voters as the lone unanimous pick in results released Tuesday.The selections of the Boilermakers' Edey and the Hoosiers' Jackson-Davis came a year after the Big Ten had three first-team picks. And it gave the league seven through the last three seasons; no other league has more than three.The Big Ten has had at least one first-teamer for five straight years and eight of the last nine.Houston's Marcus Sasser and Alabama's Brandon Miller joined Edey and Wilson on the first team in representing each of the NCAA Tournament's No. 1 seeds.Edey has commanded the national spotlight all year. The Big Ten player of the year ranks sixth nationally in scoring (22.3), second in rebounding (12.8) and first in double-doubles (26).“Everybody goes: ‘You go to him so much,’” Purdue coach Matt Painter said after the Big Ten Tournament title win against Penn State. ""If they call it by the rules, they’re fouling him on every possession. So why shouldn’t we get it to him and just try to get in that bonus early and steal points?“Obviously he can make tough post-ups and he can get at the rim, and he gets offensive rebounds when you take him away.”Jackson-Davis, a 6-9 fourth-year forward, is Indiana's first first-team selection since Victor Oladipo in 2013. He's averaging 20.8 points and 10.9 rebounds while taking a leap with his passing (4.1 assists, up from 1.9 last year).“I probably have pushed him harder than any player on this team and I know there’s been days that he’s walked out of here thinking that, ‘Hey, is this guy really in my corner, based on how he’s pushing me?’” coach Mike Woodson said. “But at the end of the day, he’s gotten better as a player.""We have benefited from it, you know, with our ballclub, in terms of how we played as a team. And he’s been the driving force behind it.”Wilson, a 6-8 fourth-year forward, was a returning complementary starter from last year's NCAA title run. He thrived in an expanded role, becoming Big 12 player of the year and nearly doubling his scoring average (20.1, up from 11.1) to go with 8.4 rebounds.It marked the fourth time in seven seasons that the Jayhawks had a first-team pick going back to national player of the year Frank Mason III in 2017.“He's an elite competitor,"" Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said after a Big 12 Tournament loss to the Jayhawks. “He gets to the glass. He makes cuts. He makes it hard. He does so many things.”Sasser, a 6-2 senior, was a starter on the Cougars' Final Four team two years ago and is the star of another title threat this year. He's averaging 17.1 points as the program's first first-team selection since Hakeem Olajuwon in 1984 during the “Phi Slama Jama” era.Miller, a 6-9 freshman, was a McDonald's All-American who became an immediate star on the way to being named the Southeastern Conference player of the year. He's averaging 19.6 points and 8.3 rebounds for the tournament's No. 1 overall seed.Miller has been involved in a murder case that has overshadowed the Crimson Tide's successful run, leading to capital murder charges against former Alabama player Darius Miles and another man for the January shooting death of 23-year-old Jamea Harris. A police investigator testified last month that Miles texted Miller to bring him his gun that night, though authorities haven't charged Miller with any crime.SECOND TEAMPac-12 player of the year Jaime Jaquez Jr. of UCLA was the leading vote-getter on the second team that included Kentucky's Oscar Tshiebwe, last season's AP national player of the year.Gonzaga's Drew Timme was a second-team selection for the third straight year, while Arizona's Azuolas Tubelis and Penn State's Jalen Pickett rounded out the second quintet.THIRD TEAMKansas State's surge led to the Wildcats earning third-team selections in Markquis Nowell and Keyontae Johnson, their first AP All-Americans since Jacob Pullen in 2011.Big East player of the year Tyler Kolek of Marquette, Iowa's Kris Murray and North Carolina's Armando Bacot rounded out the third team.HONORABLE MENTIONNational scoring leader Antoine Davis of Detroit Mercy, who averaged 28.2 points and fell three points shy of tying “Pistol” Pete Maravich's all-time career scoring record, was the leading vote-getter among players who didn't make the three All-America teams.Players earned honorable-mention status if they appeared on multiple voters' ballots. This year's list includes Memphis' Kendric Davis, Xavier's Souley Boum and Miami's Isaiah Wong.___AP Sports Writer Mike Marot in Indianapolis contributed to this report.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835285,Southwest is adding deicing trucks after December breakdown,"The CEO of Southwest Airlines pushed back Tuesday against the view that his airline’s December breakdown was caused by a failure to invest enough money in crew-scheduling technology, instead blaming extremely cold weather that forced it to stop flying at some airports.Southwest said it is buying more deicing trucks and lining up additional deicing pads at key airports and buying more engine covers and heaters to avoid a repeat.The airline also said it will increase staffing during extremely cold weather, and it will improve phone systems for customers and employees.A severe winter storm just before Christmas affected all airlines, but Southwest struggled far more than the others to recover. It wound up canceling nearly 17,000 flights in 10 days before resuming a normal schedule. Unions for pilots and flight attendants said technology used to reassign crews to planes bogged down, and workers spent hours on hold when they called headquarters for instructions.Robert Jordan said the entire debacle could be traced to Southwest’s inability to keep flying in extremely cold weather at key airports including Denver and Chicago Midway.“I do not think we have a chronic underinvestment in technology,” he said at a JPMorgan investor conference. He repeated a previous estimate that the Dallas company will spend more than $1.3 billion on information technology this year.Jordan also defended the airline's business model against critics who say its point-to-point route map makes it more vulnerable to flight disruptions that start in one part of the country — caused by bad weather, for example — and then ripple across the network.The frozen conditions in Denver and Chicago started the mess, he said, “and it would have caused the issue no matter what the network structure was.”Southwest said in a filing that it continues to expect to report a loss for the first quarter, with lingering fallout from the December crisis cutting revenue by up to $350 million. That is on top of an $800 million drop in fourth-quarter pretax income that Southwest attributed to the meltdown, which is being investigated by federal officials.Shares of Southwest rose about 1% in midday trading.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835297,Bears agree to deal with Titans DE DeMarcus Walker,"CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears have added help on the defensive line, agreeing to a deal with former Tennessee Titans defensive end DeMarcus Walker.Walker tweeted that he has an agreement in place with Chicago.Former Seattle Seahawks running back Travis Homer agreed to a two-year deal with Chicago worth as much as $4.5 million, agent Spencer Cannold said Tuesday night.The Bears announced a two-year contract extension with fullback Khari Blasingame through the 2025 season and a one-year extension with long snapper Patrick Scales on Tuesday. Offensive lineman Dieter Eiselen — an exclusive rights free agent — signed a one-year deal.Walker is coming off his best year, with a career-high seven sacks in his lone season with the Titans. He played for Denver from 2017 to 2020 and Houston in 2021.The Bears sorely needed help on the defensive line after finishing with a league-worst 20 sacks, their lowest total since the 2003 team had 18. A safety — Jaquan Brisker — led them with four sacks, and no lineman had more than three.Homer has run for 453 yards and one touchdown in four seasons with Seattle. The Seahawks drafted him in the sixth round in 2019.Blasingame played in 16 games and helped block for a ground attack that led the league with a franchise-record 3,014 yards rushing. Scales is entering his eighth season with the Bears, and Eiselen originally signed with Chicago as an undrafted free agent out of Yale in 2020.The Bears also have agreements in place with Buffalo Bills two-time Pro Bowl linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, former Philadelphia Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards and former Tennessee guard Nate Davis, according to people familiar with their situations.The Bears set a franchise record for losses while finishing with a league-worst 3-14 record. But they’ve made some big moves since the end of the season.The Bears agreed Friday to trade the No. 1 overall pick in the draft to Carolina, two people familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. Chicago addressed a big need for a playmaker to help quarterback Justin Fields by acquiring star receiver D.J. Moore from the Panthers along with the No. 9 and No. 61 overall picks in 2023, a first-rounder in 2024 and a second-rounder in 2025.The Bears also hired Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren as team president in January and last month purchased a 326-acre plot of land in suburban Arlington Heights that the organization has been sizing up for a new enclosed stadium.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

Hiring in the U.S. is still strong, but layoffs have hit hard in some sectors.Early last month, Meta posted falling profits and its third consecutive quarter of declining revenue.The company said Tuesday it will reduce the size of its recruiting team and make further cuts in its tech groups in late April, and then its business groups in late May.“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have been part of our success.”The Menlo Park, California, company has invested billions of dollars to realign its focus on the metaverse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835299,AP source: QB Heinicke returning home to sign with Falcons,"Setting up a competition at quarterback, the Atlanta Falcons have agreed to terms with Taylor Heinicke on a two-year contract worth up to $20 million, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press.The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the contract cannot be signed until the official start of free agency on Wednesday.For Heinicke, it's a homecoming. He was born in Lawrenceville and played at Collins Hills High School in suburban Atlanta.Now, after starting 24 games over the last two seasons with the Washington Commanders, he is headed to the Falcons to compete for a starting job with Desmond Ridder.Ridder started the last four games of his rookie season after taking over for Marcus Mariota with the Falcons headed toward their fifth straight losing season.Ridder produced a 2-2 record while completing 63.5% of his passes for 708 yards, with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also rushed for 64 yards while being sacked nine times.While the Falcons have expressed confidence in Ridder's long-term potential, they are flush with money to spend in free agency and desperately needed more experience in the quarterback room.Mariota essentially abandoned the team after losing his starting job, saying he needed to treat a knee issue. He was cut last month, providing the Falcons with an additional $12 million in cap space.Some of that money is going to Heinicke, a fan favorite in Washington after he went undrafted out of college at Old Dominion and bounced around to four NFL teams and the XFL's St. Louis BattleHawks before landing in the nation's capital.Heinicke started the 2020 season on Washington's practice squad before being promoted to the active roster in late December.He wound up making his second career start in the wild-card round of the playoffs after Alex Smith was ruled out with an injury.Heinicke completed 26 of 44 passes for 306 yards, with a touchdown and an interception, and rushed for a TD in a 31–23 loss to eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay.In 2021, Heinicke began the season as a backup, but he took over the top spot again after an injury to Ryan Fitzpatrick.He led the Commanders to a 7-8 record in 15 starts, throwing for 3,419 yards with 20 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. Heinicke also rushed for 313 yards and a score.It was more of the same in 2022. Heinicke began as the backup to Carson Wentz, whose inconsistent play had Washington fans clamoring for a change.Heinicke took over in Week 7 after Wentz was sidelined with a fractured finger. He guided the Commanders to a 5-3-1 record before Wentz returned in the next-to-last game with the team needing a win to stay in playoff contention.An ugly home loss to the Cleveland Browns had the fans clamoring for Heinicke, to no avail.Wentz has since been released after one season with the Commanders.Now, Heinicke is on the move, too.___AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno in Washington contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835300,FIFA expands 2026 World Cup again to create 104-game program,"The expanded World Cup in North America got even more supersized on Tuesday.The governing body of soccer increased the size of the 2026 tournament for the second time — six years after the first — by approving a bigger group stage for the inaugural 48-team event.By retaining groups of four teams instead of moving to three, FIFA has created a 104-game schedule that will last nearly six weeks in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The final is scheduled for July 19.The 16 host cities — 11 in the United States, three in Mexico and two in Canada — now have 24 extra games to stage on top of the 80 they already had for the inaugural 48-team tournament.Adding about 1.5 million more tickets will also further fuel FIFA’s expected record revenue of at least $11 billion through 2026 from a tournament that will rely on using high-revenue NFL stadiums.FIFA said the decision followed a “thorough review that considered sporting integrity, player welfare, team travel, commercial and sporting attractiveness, as well as team and fan experience.”The latest push by FIFA president Gianni Infantino for more games and bigger events in a congested calendar will likely provoke more concern among stakeholders such as domestic leagues and players' union FIFPRO. They have long felt isolated from talks on soccer’s future.The six-week World Cup will start one year after FIFA launches a 32-team Club World Cup, which could also be staged in North America to test tournament logistics. The Champions League in Europe also has a new format with more teams and games in the 2024-25 season.The new World Cup format will have 12 groups of four teams instead of 16 groups of three, the plan chosen in 2017. Both options were to go to a 32-team knockout round.The format guarantees every World Cup team will play a minimum of three times instead of two, adding up to a stacked group stage totaling 72 games before arriving at the knockout rounds. The four semifinalists will play eight matches, one more than last year in Qatar.The entire 2022 World Cup in Qatar amounted to 64 games in the seventh and last edition of the 32-team format. The 1998 World Cup in France was the first with 32 teams.Increasing the World Cup’s lineup was first floated in 2015. It was proposed then as a way to sweeten FIFA’s 200-plus member federations into accepting much-needed governance reforms in the wake of American and Swiss investigations of corruption.After Infantino was elected FIFA president to succeed Sepp Blatter, one of his first big strategic wins was adding 16 teams to the World Cup. Infantino persuaded FIFA colleagues that a 48-team tournament — with Africa and Asia getting more of the extra places than Europe — would fuel interest and drive development in countries that rarely or never qualified to play on the biggest stage.That was despite FIFA’s own research in 2016 suggesting that the highest quality soccer was achieved by the 32-team format.In Qatar, the split-screen drama created by decisive group games played simultaneously helped convince FIFA that four-team groups are better.There was also concern that scheduling groups of three could lead to match-fixing in a final game between two teams who could both advance to the round of 32.FIFA has now found an option it said “mitigates the risk of collusion” and also gifts itself more games to sell.The extra 24 games should drive up the price of sponsor deals and broadcasting deals not yet signed. However, some key broadcast markets are already signed, including in the United States, Brazil and the Middle East.The 2026 World Cup was already set to earn up to $3 billion in ticket and hospitality sales for FIFA, and massively increase the tournament attendance record. That record was set in the United States in 1994 when 3.6 million spectators attended 52 games in a 24-team event.One downside of the 48-team format is the unbalanced nature of the 32 teams that will advance.Eight of the 12 third-place teams will move on, creating uncertainty for some teams placing third in a group not knowing if they will advance until matches are completed days later.FIFA also explained how teams will enter the 2025 Club World Cup, including continental champions in each season from 2021-24. That means Chelsea, Real Madrid, Palmeiras, Flamengo and Seattle Sounders already secured their places.Europe's 12 entries can also be decided by a ranking system based on the same four-year period, with a cap of two teams per country advancing with exemptions for continental champions.FIFA also plans to create another new competition starting annually in 2024 for continental champions. The Champions League winner in Europe will play the winner of playoffs featuring the other continental champions.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

It says Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin violated the law when he entered into the settlement with recall organizers who had challenged New Orleans voter roll numbers.A similar lawsuit challenging Ardoin's authority to agree to the settlement was filed in state court in Baton Rouge, according to a news release.To force a recall election, petitioners are required to obtain valid signatures from 20% of voters deemed qualified — sometimes referred to as “active voters” — under state law. The March 1 settlement came after recall organizers sued election officials saying New Orleans voter rolls still list hundreds of dead people and thousands of voters who should be placed on an “inactive” list because they have likely moved.For purposes of the recall petition, the settlement dropped the total number of qualified voters considered in New Orleans from 249,876 to 224,876 — resulting in the number of valid signatures needed dropping from nearly 50,000 to just below 45,000.It remains unclear whether recall organizers have reached either threshold. Organizers turned petitions over for validating on Feb. 22 but have not said how many signatures they collected. The Orleans Parish voter registrar is working to validate and certify signatures by a March 22 deadline.“The Secretary of State acted without constitutional or legislative authority in reducing the number of qualified voters required to trigger a recall election,” said Marion Floyd, an attorney for Cantrell and the Rev. Willie Calhoun. “Simply put, Ardoin did not have the power to make that change and make it retroactive to the date of submission of the recall petition.""An Ardoin spokesman declined comment Tuesday morning. Recall organizer Eileen Carter said she believes Ardoin had the authority to enter the settlement. But she also said she welcomed the litigation because it will help determine the correct number of active New Orleans voters.The New Orleans lawsuit notes that the state judge who approved the settlement, Civil District Court Judge Jennifer Medley, had signed the recall petition. That fact had not been made public at the time of the settlement. Medley did not disclose it, and it was only revealed after The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate obtained some of the signatures after filing a lawsuit.Cantrell, a Democrat, has repeatedly criticized the recall effort as a Republican-led attack on the administration of a Black, Democratic woman. Carter and Belden Batiste, leaders of the recall effort, are Black Democrats. However, campaign finance reports list a Republican businessman, Rick Farrell, as the major financial backer of the effort.Cantrell is first woman to serve as New Orleans' mayor. She was easily re-elected to a second term in 2021. But that second term has seen numerous problems, including stubborn violent crime, fitful progress on major street projects that have left some city streets a mess, and unreliable garbage collection. Questions also have been raised about her travel expenses and her personal use of a city-owned apartment. And the City Council recently opened an investigation into the use of public money to send a mailer to city residents earlier this year touting Cantrell’s accomplishments.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835303,Biden says Jimmy Carter has asked him to deliver his eulogy,"ATLANTA (AP) — President Joe Biden says he plans to deliver the eulogy at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter, who remains under hospice care at his home in south Georgia.Biden told donors at a California fundraiser Monday evening about his “recent” visit to see the 39th president, whom he has known since he was a young Delaware senator supporting Carter's 1976 presidential campaign.“He asked me to do his eulogy,” Biden said, before stopping himself from saying more. “Excuse me, I shouldn't say that.”Carter, who at 98 is the longest-lived U.S. president, announced Feb. 18 that he would spend his remaining days at home receiving end-of-life care, forgoing further medical intervention after a series of short hospital stays. The Carter Center in Atlanta and the former president's family members have not disclosed details of his condition, though Biden alluded to Carter's 2015 cancer diagnosis and subsequent recovery.“I spent time with Jimmy Carter and it’s finally caught up with him, but they found a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated because they found a breakthrough,” Biden said in Rancho Sante Fe, California.Biden, 80, and first lady Jill Biden visited Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is now 95, at their home in Plains, Georgia, a few months after Biden took office in 2021. Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter's 1976 presidential bid, breaking from the Washington establishment that Carter — then a former one-time Georgia governor — shocked by winning the Democratic nomination.Biden's presidency represents a turnabout, of sorts, for Carter's political standing. He served just one term and lost in a landslide to Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980, prompting top Democrats to keep their distance, at least publicly, for decades after he left the White House.Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did not have close relationships with Carter. And the longshot presidential candidates who sometimes ventured to Plains over the years typically did so privately.But as the Carters' global humanitarian work and advocacy of democracy via The Carter Center garnered new respect, Democratic politicians began publicly circulating back to south Georgia ahead of the 2020 election cycle. And with Biden's election, Carter again found a genuine friend and ally in the Oval Office.Some Carter family members have confirmed that the former president will have a state funeral in Washington, D.C., along with a private funeral and burial in Plains. Former and sitting presidents often speak at the state funerals of their predecessors, sometimes even crossing the political aisle.Clinton spoke at Republican Richard Nixon's funeral in 1994. Carter in 2007 eulogized Republican Gerald Ford, the man he defeated to win the presidency. The erstwhile rivals had become close friends after their presidencies and had agreed that the surviving president would pay tribute at the other's funeral. When George H.W. Bush died in 2018, fellow Republican Donald Trump attended as sitting president but the only former president to speak at Washington National Cathedral was the elder Bush's son, George W. Bush.",2023/03/15,,World

It’s incredible,"" De Bromhead said.“This is what she deserves. She’s such an unbelievable mare. I’m blown away.""Blackmore's first thoughts after the win were for De Bromhead's late son.“We all wish a very special kid could be here today,"" she said. ""He’s watching down on us.”After taking a deep breath, she paid tribute to Honeysuckle, who carried her to victory in the Champion Hurdle in 2021 as she became the first female jockey to win the race.“It is incredible what she has done for me, but it is incredible what she has done for all of us,"" Blackmore said. “You dream of being involved with something like her.”The four-day festival will be capped Friday by the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Britain’s most prestigious jumping race.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

The brief CAS statement did not provide details of how the panel reached that conclusion ahead of the expected publication of a full ruling.“It was a long process, during which I proved that I had no intention to doping,” Verniaiev wrote on Instagram. With the next Summer Games in Paris just over a year away, he signed off his post “Citius. Altius. Fortius.” — the Olympic motto and Latin for “faster, higher, stronger"" — and posted a picture from a training session.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

No away team has ever erased a three-goal loss from the first leg in the Champions League, and only five times the team that lost at home rallied in the second leg. Manchester United was the only one to overcome a two-goal deficit — in 2019 against Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16. Madrid is coming off a win against Espanyol in the Spanish league, while Liverpool lost at relegation-threatened Bournemouth to hurt its chances of moving closer to the top four in the Premier League.NAPOLI vs. EINTRACHT FRANKFURT (2-0)Napoli has been handed a triple boost ahead of the round-of-16 second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt as Kim Min-jae, Alex Meret and Hirving Lozano all returned to training. Kim had a calf problem and came off in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Atalanta on Saturday but should be back to lead the defense. Meret and Lozano missed the match with slight injuries. Napoli has a 2-0 lead from the first leg in Germany and is trying to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in its history. Frankfurt faces a tough task to keep its Champions League hopes alive without the suspended Randal Kolo Muani, after the French forward was sent off in the first leg. Colombian striker Rafael Borré is expected to start in his place.EUROPA CONFERENCE LEAGUEIstanbul Basaksehir or Gent will become the first team to reach the quarterfinals. They are playing the second leg of their round-of-16 matchup, with the teams locked at 1-1 after the first match last week. The rest of the Conference League and Europa League games in the round of 16 take place Thursday.ENGLANDSouthampton can climb out of the Premier League's relegation zone with a home win over Brentford in one of two midweek games. Southampton has improved defensively since Rubén Sellés replaced the fired Nathan Jones as manager last month, keeping three clean sheets in his four league games in charge. Two of the shutouts were at Chelsea and Manchester United. The team is in last place but will climb at least four spots with a win at St. Mary's stadium against ninth-place Brentford. The fight to avoid relegation could be the most intense in years, with the bottom nine teams — up to 12th-place Crystal Palace — separated by five points. Palace, which visits Brighton in the other game, hasn't had a shot on target in its last three league matches. Brighton is in seventh place and could move tied for points with Liverpool in sixth with a win.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835309,EU urges members to deport more migrants ineligible to stay,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Tuesday urged its member countries to deport more people who enter Europe without authorization and who are not eligible to stay, saying that only around one in five would-be migrants who should be sent home actually is.“Last year, we had a return rate of only 21% of those who are not eligible to stay,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. “When we fail to return people, this hampers our system and erodes trust.”Johansson said that 340,000 decisions were handed down in EU member nations last year to deport people, but that only in 60% of cases did European authorities try to contact the migrants’ home countries to get them accepted back in.“To protect the right to apply for asylum we have to show that we are appropriately dealing with those who do not qualify for international protection,” she said. “We need migration, but it has to be in a legal and orderly way.”The arrival of well over one million migrants in 2015 — mostly people fleeing war in Syria or Iraq — sparked one of the EU’s biggest political crises. Member countries bickered over who should take responsibility for the migrants who enter, and whether other members should be obliged to help.The row continues today. Repeated attempts to reform the asylum system have been made, but there's been little progress. Unable to resolve the core dispute, the EU has turned to paying the countries that people leave or transit to prevent them setting out in the first place.Johansson said the EU’s border and coastguard agency “is well equipped” to organize deportation flights, and urged the bloc’s 27 member countries to take advantage of them.“We have a good political agreement with Bangladesh,” the EU’s top migration official noted. She said a Frontex flight would depart for Bangladesh on Wednesday with 68 “returnees” aboard. “This is the way we should work together,” Johansson said.___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835311,Column: Scheffler's rise leads to incomplete grade on Smith,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jordan Spieth can speak with authority on the remarkable run of Scottie Scheffler, except that Spieth never liked that term when he was the subject.Spieth had won seven times in 13 months — two majors, a shot at all four of them, No. 1 in the world and a FedEx Cup title — when he showed up at Kapalua to start 2016 and was asked what he had planned for an encore.“Doesn't an encore mean that the show is then over?” he said.Golf has a couple of hit shows, and for now Scheffler is top billing.His superb play in windy conditions for a five-shot victory in The Players Championship was his sixth title in the last 13 months. Scheffler has been No. 1 longer than anyone during that stretch.But it was only 12 days ago when Jon Rahm, with six victories in the last 13 months, opened with a 65 at Bay Hill and looked as though no one could beat him. Maybe that's still the case. Rahm never made it to the second round at The Players Championship because of a stomach bug.Rory McIlroy, who also has been No. 1 this year, won his 2023 debut in Dubai. He didn't finish worse than fourth in seven straight tournaments, three of them wins.All of them are part of a long list of players who have been on big runs, and as Spieth duly noted about Tiger Woods, “one guy that created a career out of a run and became the best ever.”Missing from the current list is Cameron Smith.He never gave himself the chance.Even now, it's hard to say whether Smith was on a heater or had staying power.He set a record to par at Kapalua to start last year. He won The Players Championship two months later by one-putting eight of his last nine holes. He shot 30 on the back nine at St. Andrews for his first major, one of the great closing rounds in British Open history.And then he chose to walk away from the toughest competition to cash in on Saudi money and join LIV Golf. No one should begrudge the 29-year-old Australian for his decision, though it remains the most peculiar because of his youth and his potential.But for such a short sample size — seven months — there's no telling for how long and how hot that flame would burn.Smith won a 54-hole LIV event last summer in the Chicago suburbs. He celebrated a long-awaited homecoming Down Under by winning the Australian PGA Championship. Otherwise, he hasn't faced world-class competition in seven months.The Players was awkward on a couple of levels, mainly because Smith wasn't around to defend his title. What resurfaced was a video of PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan at last year's trophy presentation.“Cam doesn't live far from here, and every single time he pull his car up the main road, he's going to receive a hero's welcome,” Monahan said that day.Smith no longer has free access to the TPC Sawgrass, or any TPC course, because he's been suspended by the PGA Tour. He was seen playing The Yards, an executive course about a mile away during the opening round. Such were the consequences of his choice.He is financially set for life. He gets back to golf this week with the LIV event north of Tucson, Arizona. He might win. He might win a lot.But what does it mean?So much was made about the new PGA Tour model having eight elite fields with no cuts, because LIV Golf doesn't have a cut. But why the rival circuits are nothing alike is because LIV has only 54 holes with the same 48 players — minus one or two alternates — all year.Scheffler beat 144 players at Sawgrass, the strongest field of the year. Rahm beat 156 players in the California desert and 120 players at Riviera.Smith will get his crack four times a year in the majors. That will be his best chance, and really his only avenue, to stay relevant in the conversation of best players.Until then, the focus will stay with Scheffler, Rahm and McIlroy. Those are the current “Big Three” in golf, and that can change by the end of the year.The show ends at some point, though maybe not for good.McIlroy fell from the top to out of the top 10, and while he's clearly on the rise, he still hasn't won a major in nearly nine years.Jason Day won eight times in 18 starts in 2015 and 2016, without a discernable weakness in his game. He started this year outside the top 100.David Duval is easily overlooked because his peak was crammed into a short window. He won 11 times in 34 tournaments over 18 months in 1997-99 and was among the few who got to No. 1 when Woods was on top of his game.At this moment, the attention is on Scheffler and his knack for beating the best.“I want to win, and I think I get excited when we get to the biggest tournaments and the best players are there,” Scheffler said. “And that’s a lot of fun for me as a player is being able to compete against those guys.”That pleasure used to belong to Smith, too. He'll get his fill of competing against the best. It just might not be often enough to know how good he could have been.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835312,US no longer seeking death for man convicted in Sjodin case,"U.S. prosecutors said Tuesday that they will no longer seek the death penalty for a Minnesota man already on death row but awaiting resentencing for the kidnapping and killing of college student Dru Sjodin in 2003 — a case that led to changes in sex offender registration laws.U.S. Attorney Mac Schneider in North Dakota filed a notice with the court withdrawing his effort to seek the death penalty for Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. — a move he told The Associated Press he had to make after he was “straightforwardly directed by” Attorney General Merrick Garland to do so.Sjodin, a Minnesota woman, was a 22-year-old University of North Dakota student when she was abducted from a Grand Forks, North Dakota, mall parking lot in November 2003. Rodriguez, a sex offender, was arrested the next month. Despite several massive searches, Sjodin’s body wasn’t found until the following April near Crookston, Minnesota.Rodriguez was convicted in 2006 and was awaiting new sentencing after a judge overturned his original death sentence.Eric Montroy, Rodriguez’s public defender, did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment. A phone message left with Sjodin’s mother also was not immediately returned.Schneider said in an interview that he informed Sjodin’s mother, Linda Walker, in person on Monday of the decision and spoke with other relatives by phone. He declined to characterize their reaction, saying they could decide whether to disclose that.Sjodin’s death led to a dramatic shift in the way Minnesota handles sex offenders, with a drastic increase in the number who were committed indefinitely for treatment even after their prison sentences had run their course. Also, the national sex offender public registry, intended to give the public information on the whereabouts of registered sex offenders, was renamed for Sjodin.North Dakota Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who was the U.S. attorney who prosecuted Rodriguez, was critical of the decision not to seek the death penalty.“This result is a grave affront to justice and to the hearts and souls of all who loved and cared for Dru Sjodin,” Wrigley said in a statement.The only possible sentence for Rodriguez now is life in prison without the possibility of parole, Schneider said. He wasn’t sure when formal sentencing would take place.“He’s going to draw his last breath in a federal prison,” Schneider told the AP.The Justice Department has faced criticism from death penalty opponents for pursuing the death penalty despite President Joe’s Biden’s state opposition to capital punishment. In 2021, Garland announced a moratorium on federal executions and a review of execution processes. The Department of Justice won’t issue orders to execute anyone while the moratorium is in place, but it doesn’t stop the agency from pursuing new death sentences.The Biden Justice Department has withdrawn permission to seek the death penalty in more than two dozen cases. However, in most other cases, defendants either hadn't gone to trial or hadn't been sentenced yet.Forty-four inmates are on federal death row, and Justice Department lawyers have generally fought all their efforts to have their death sentences thrown out.Rodriguez's previous death sentence was overturned in September 2021, when then-U.S. District Judge Ralph Erickson ruled that misleading testimony from the coroner, the failure of lawyers to outline the possibility of an insanity defense, and evidence of severe post-traumatic stress disorder had violated Rodriguez’s constitutional rights.The federal death penalty wasn’t a high-profile issue until then-President Donald Trump resumed executions in 2020 after a 17-year hiatus. With 13 inmates put to death in his last months in office, Trump oversaw more federal executions than any president in more than 120 years.The first capital case tried under Biden ended Monday with a split among jurors that means the life of an Islamic extremist who killed eight people in a New York City will be spared. Many were surprised that Biden’s Justice Department continued to pursue the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov — first authorized during Trump’s presidency — given Biden’s opposition to capital punishment.In January, the Justice Department announced it would not seek the death penalty for Patrick Crusius in a 2019 racist attack at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart that left nearly two dozen people dead. Crusius has since pleaded guilty to federal hate crime and weapons charges.___Salter reported from O’Fallon, Missouri. Tarm reported from Chicago.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835313,"No Harvey Weinstein retrial on rape, sex assault charges","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles prosecutors told a judge Tuesday that they will not retry Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of the rape and sexual assault of one woman, on counts involving two others that left jurors deadlocked.Deputy District Attorney Paul Thompson announced the decision to Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench at a hearing in downtown Los Angeles. The judge granted a defense motion to dismiss the charges and said Weinstein would be returned to New York, where he was convicted in a similar case.Weinstein attorney Jacqueline Sparagna said he maintains his innocence of the charges.In December, Los Angeles jury convicted Weinstein, 70, of the rape and sexual assault of an Italian model and actor and he was sentenced to 16 years in prison. That’s in addition to the 23-year sentence he is already serving in New York.Jurors could not reach unanimous verdicts on a rape count and a sexual assault count involving Jennifer Siebel Newsom — a documentary filmmaker and the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom — and a sexual battery count involving model Lauren Young.Young testified at Weinstein's New York trial as a supporting witness, but was not part of the charges there as she was in California. She said at Tuesday's hearing that she was “very disappointed” prosecutors would not be moving forward with a retrial.“For 10 years I have done everything possible to seek justice for what the defendant did to me,” Young said, reading from prepared remarks with her attorney Gloria Allred standing behind her. “I have not achieved the justice that I had hoped to obtain.”Ten of the 12 jurors agreed to convict Weinstein of the sexual battery charge involving Young.Thompson said the difficulty of having hesitant witnesses corroborate Young's story was a factor. He commended Young for testifying “credibly and courageously,” and said “we never wavered in our confidence in her.”“It is a difficult decision,” Thompson said. “We certainly did want to see justice for all the victims.”He added that Weinstein would likely only face an additional year in prison if convicted on the sexual battery count, and that additional stretch was not worth another trial.The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they identify themselves publicly, as the women named here have.Siebel Newsom's attorney Elizabeth Fegan said in a statement after the hearing that they respect the prosecution's decision not to retry the charges related to her.“The First Partner’s primary intention in coming forward was to ensure that Weinstein spends the rest of his life in prison,"" Fegan said. She added that had ""the court not handed down a fitting sentence, my client would have been ready to support the prosecutors if they opted to retry Weinstein, even considering the enormous emotional toll it would inflict on her.”Deputy District Attorney Marlene Martinez read a statement from Siebel Newsom at the hearing.“The defense reopened and exacerbated my trauma,” the statement said. “He tried to ruin my life and the lives of so many other women. He deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.”Sparagna said at the hearing that the encounter with Siebel Newsom was consensual, as his attorneys argued during the trial. Weinstein insisted at his sentencing that he had never met the woman he was convicted of raping. His lawyers also said the incident involving Young never happened.After the hearing, Allred identified another client who Weinstein was charged with raping and sexually assaulting but declined to take part in the trial at the last moment, leading to the counts involving her being dismissed.The woman, Australian actor and model Kate Jaggard, said in a statement that she was willing to undergo cross-examination at the trial but could not appear to testify because of circumstance beyond her control.She said she was “deeply disappointed” Lench would not allow her and other women Weinstein was not convicted of assaulting to give victim impact statements at his sentencing. But she said “the conviction was a win for all sexual assault victims.”Allred is appealing the judge's decision to the California Supreme Court in hopes that such impact statements will be allowed at similar sentencings.Weinstein’s New York conviction is under appeal and his attorneys plan to appeal his California conviction.___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton",2023/03/15,,World

Slovakia has also declared readiness to provide its MiG-29 planes to Kyiv and the two NATO nations have urged others to join in.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Tuesday said that Warsaw could send its MiGs within weeks, but didn't clarify whether there was any coalition ready to follow suit.Ukraine's air force is familiar with MiG-29s and could use the planes right away.Poland has been using the fighter jets since 1989 and has 28 of them. It has been replacing them with U.S.-made F-16s and South Korean FA 50 multi-task jets and is also purchasing U.S. F-35 fighters.Ukraine has been asking the West for fighter jets to beef up its defenses as Russia's war drags on for a second year. There are still no signs that larger nations like the United States and the U.K. will agree to send their warplanes.___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835316,Case dropped against couple after gun pulled on Black family,"Criminal charges have been dropped against a white couple charged in 2020 after one of them was captured on video pulling a handgun on a Black woman and her daughters outside a Michigan restaurant.The trial had been set to start Monday for Eric Wuestenberg and Jillian Wuestenberg, but Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Mary Ellen Brennan dismissed the case after the alleged victims did not show up to provide witness testimony, The Oakland Press reported.The Wuestenbergs were each charged with one count of felonious assault for the July 1, 2020, incident in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant in Orion Township, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.David Williams, Oakland County’s chief assistant prosecutor, noted that the charges were dismissed Monday without prejudice, “meaning that our office can reissue charges in this matter if and when those witnesses become available.” He declined further comment.Takelia Hill, who is Black, told The Detroit News in 2020 that the incident happened after a white woman later identified as Jillian Wuestenberg bumped into Hill’s teenage daughter as they were entering the restaurant and Wuestenberg was leaving with a carry-out order.The Oakland Press reported that the Pontiac woman was visiting the restaurant with two daughters when the incident began. A three-minute cellphone video posted online documents part of the ensuing confrontation in the restaurant's parking lot.Jillian Wuestenberg can be seen outside her vehicle shouting, “Get the (expletive) away! Get away!” while pointing a handgun at the person who’s recording. She eventually gets back into her vehicle, which her husband drives away.The Oakland County Sheriff’s Office said both parties called police on each other and that the Wuestenbergs drove away and waited for deputies to arrive. The couple was arrested shortly afterward.Following his arrest, Eric Wuestenberg lost his job at Oakland University where he was coordinator of veterans support services. His attorney, Dean Greenblatt, said the Wuestenbergs have lived “with clouds over their head for three years.”“Nothing can bring their jobs back, their lives back, their reputations back,” Greenblatt said.Jillian Wuestenberg’s attorney, Terry Johnson, said the dismissal of the charges was long overdue.“On behalf of my client, we’re excited it only took 32 months for the Oakland County Prosecutor to finally drop the charges. My client’s life, unfortunately, will never be the same,” Johnson said.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835330,Romanian court rejects influencer Andrew Tate's bail request,"A Romanian court turned down a request by social media personality Andrew Tate to be granted bail following his arrest in late December.Tate and his brother, Tristan, are the subjects of a criminal investigation into sex trafficking. They were arrested along with two Romanian women. None have yet been formally charged.The 36-year-old British-US citizen requested that the court replace his detention in police custody with a restricted release on bail.The court in Bucharest said such a move was ""inadmissible in principle.""Romanian prosecutors are investigating whether brothers recruited women by seducing them and promising relationships or even marriage, only to then coerce them into producing pornographic content.Before his arrest, Tate built a massive following online of mostly young men by generating hours of misogynistic content.Tate has been living in Romania since 2017.The Tate brothers have seen their detention pending investigation extended three times already, each time for a further 30 days. Their current detention is until March 29, but courts can extend detention for up to 180 days in total.Tate lost an appeal to stop a previous extension in February. The court will respond to a bail request from Tristan on Wednesday.Romanian public broadcaster TVR reported that Tate had pinned his bail request on the claim that he was ill and the conditions of his arrest were putting his life at risk.The self-described misogynist has made other attempts to defend himself from legal consequences.According to wiretaps of his phone calls submitted by prosecutors to the court, Tate tried to get Romanian lawmakers on his side and attempted to intimidate several alleged victims.The onetime kickboxer has said repeatedly that prosecutors have no evidence on him and that his arrest was a ""political"" conspiracy.A court document from January justifying a previous extension of the brothers' detention pointed to ""the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored,"" adding that they could ""leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition.""ab/ar (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835331,Polish court convicts activist over abortion pill assistance,"A Warsaw court on Tuesday convicted women's rights activist Justyna Wydrzynska of helping a victim of domestic violence access abortion pills.Wydrzynska was sentenced to eight months of community service.Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion legislation in Europe. In 2020, Poland's constitutional court struck down a law that permitted abortions in the case of fetuses with congenital defects.Wydrzynska is the is the co-founder of the Abortion Dream Team. The organization provides information for women seeking abortions.Prosecutors charged the activist with ""helping with an abortion,"" a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. While self-administering abortion pills is legal in Poland, providing assistance is not.The activist said she would appeal the verdict.The Warsaw court did not allow some media representatives to attend the proceedings, citing a ""lack of space,"" Polish magazine Polityka reported.Prosecutors cited ""significant social harm"" caused by the termination of ""life in the prenatal period"" in closing comments, according to Polityka.The ultraconservative think tank Ordo Iuris, which joined as a party to the proceedings, had called for Wydrzynska to receive a prison sentence of one year, arguing that she had ""boasted"" of committing the crime.Wydrzynska's defense requested that the organization be excluded from the proceedings, according to Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza.""This state is guilty,"" Wydrzynska said after the ruling, according to Polityka. ""It has failed me,"" she said, and, she added, ""millions of women in this country.""Wydrzynska said she was contacted by a ""woman in a desperate situation"" in 2021. ""She told me that her aggressive husband was trying to stop her from having an abortion,"" Wydrzynska said.""I felt touched by her story because I had had a similar experience. I felt that I needed to help her,"" she added.Defense lawyer Anna Bergiel said the case set a ""precedent."" She argued that the woman who took the abortion pill did so for ""her own good and for the good of her children.""""She knew that another child would make it even more difficult to escape the vicious cycle of domestic violence,"" Bergiel said.Abortion Dream Team activist Kinga Jelinska told Gazeta Wyborcza: ""We have abortions and we're going to keep having them.""sdi/ar (AP, AFP)",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835332,Japan: Many say they will never travel again,"In previous decades, many Japanese with extra cash chose to spend their money on vacations to far-flung destinations. From Honolulu to Venice and London to Australia's Gold Coast, the Japanese were welcomed as big spenders who enjoyed exploring different cultures.But not anymore.A survey conducted last year by global intelligence company Morning Consult showed that over 35% of Japanese people had no intention of taking a holiday again, either at home or abroad. That figure far outweighs the answers given by respondents in the 15 other nations included in the survey, with 15% of South Koreans saying they would never travel again.Some 14% of US residents said they would not be taking a holiday in the future, followed by just 8% of Britons, 6% of Germans, and 4% of Spaniards and Italians offering the same answer.Indications that demand for overseas travel is tumbling in Japan have been backed up by domestic travel giant JTB Corp, which in its 2023 outlook predicted that 8.4 million Japanese people will vacation abroad this year, roughly 40% of the estimated figure in 2019.The study identified key reasons why far fewer people in Japan will be packing their suitcases for overseas destinations this year, with the weak yen the biggest factor for around 22% of respondents. The currency particularly impacts popular dollar destinations such as Hawaii and the Pacific resort islands of Guam and Saipan.Others said they might not be able to take a long amount of time off from work, making a foreign holiday more difficult, while even more said they were still worried about the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic in different countries.Many have also been deterred from a number of destinations due to geopolitical concerns, with much of Central and Eastern Europe, along with Taiwan and mainland China, becoming less popular with travelers.""Taking a holiday has never been really important to me, especially going on a foreign vacation,"" said Tomoko Oono, a housewife from Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, who has only left Japan once in her life when she traveled to Singapore for her honeymoon in 1980.""My husband travels for work and some of my friends go overseas with their families, but it always just seems to be so much trouble,"" Oono told DW. ""There is all the packing and deciding what to take, traveling by plane, using different money and staying in a place where you do not know where anything is. It is very stressful.""""I have lots of other hobbies — I like to cook and do crafts — so the longest I like to be away from home is one night or so,"" she added.Ashley Harvey, a travel marketing analyst who has worked in Japan's travel sector for more than 15 years, told DW that that attitude is common in Japan, where just 23% of the people have a passport, the lowest figure of all the G-7 nations.""Even before the pandemic, Japan only eked out around 20 million outbound travelers a year, which is a pathetic figure for a nation of 126 million,"" he said.""Right now, we are seeing a lot of small factors that are effectively making it harder for Japanese to travel, including stagnant wages making travel more expensive and the yen losing ground against other currencies.""But, at the same time, I have some sympathy for this aversion to foreign holidays because Japan is a great destination in its own right,"" he said. ""There's world-class skiing in Hokkaido and some superb beaches on the islands of Okinawa in the south. There's all the excitement of Tokyo and Osaka, plus the ancient history of Kyoto.""""Japanese people don't need a passport for that,"" he added. ""On the other hand, staying in Japan means they are not broadening their minds or effectively promoting Japanese 'soft power,' and I think that's unfortunate.""In his New Year address to the industry, Hiroyuki Takahashi, chairman of both JTB Corp and the Japan Association of Travel Agents, declared, ""The most important theme for 2023 will be how to achieve a recovery in overseas travel.""""There are external factors, such as the weak yen and rising travel costs, but the fundamental issue is the mindset of customers,"" he said. Key to this, he said, is guaranteeing travelers' safety and health, and also convincing them of the value of overseas travel.Perhaps the brightest spot on the industry's rather bleak outlook is younger generations of travelers, or those who have effectively been unable to go abroad for the last three years but are now itching to travel. The JTB Corp study said: ""Both men and women in their 20s are highly motivated to travel abroad.""Emily Izawa, a 20-year-old university student who lives in Kanagawa Prefecture, booked a flight to London for later this month to see friends in the UK and says she cannot wait to travel again.""It has been more than five years since I was last able to go abroad, and I'm really looking forward to being in another country, speaking in English, going shopping and seeing new things,"" she said. ""I've traveled in Japan over the last few years and that was fun, but going to a different country is really traveling.""Edited by: Leah Carter",2023/03/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835344,Fake sex abuse claims get British woman 8.5 year prison term,"LONDON (AP) — A woman who falsely claimed she was drugged, raped and forced to work as a prostitute was sentenced Tuesday to more than eight years imprisonment in a case that fueled racial tensions in Britain.Eleanor Williams, 22, said on Facebook in May 2020 — in a post shared more than 100,000 times — that she had been beaten, abused and trafficked by south Asian men, stoking months of anger, fear and acts of vandalism in her hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.Williams was convicted by a jury in Preston Crown Court in January of acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice.At the time of the Facebook post, police suspected Williams's wild allegations of violent rapes and sexual trafficking overseas had been fabricated and that she had beaten herself with a hammer to support her claims.Judge Robert Altham said he couldn't explain Williams' motivation, but said the accusations were a “complete fiction” that capitalized on real instances in which men — sometimes of south Asian descent — had exploited teenage girls by grooming them first with gifts, booze and drugs before abusing them.“I'm sure she chose to lie about Asian men because she was modeling her lies on other cases of national prominence,” Altham said. ""She regarded the prospects of being believed as greater if she based them on cases already in the public consciousness.”Three of the accused men told authorities they tried to take their own lives while under suspicion.Williams had claimed that Mohammed Ramzan, a business owner, had groomed her from the age of 12 and took her to Amsterdam where she was forced to have sex for money and sold her at auction.Police later discovered that when Williams was in the Netherlands, Ramzan's bank card was being used back home in Barrow. Her claims that he took her to Blackpool, threatened to kill her and where she was brutally raped by multiple men collapsed when video showed she was there alone and had watched YouTube in her hotel room, Altham said.Ramzan said he received countless death threats from around the world on social media. He was in such despair that he tried to kill himself in front of his family, had his car windows smashed and his once-successful businesses were ruined, Altham said.“I’m not sure how my family and I are going to recover from this,"" Ramzan told reporters outside court. “The mud sticks and I fear it may take some time.”The worst turmoil in three decades roiled Barrow, Altham said, with the town divided between those who believed police were complicit in a coverup of Williams' allegations and others who feared vigilantes. The local newspaper was boycotted — and later folded — after reporting that Williams was under investigation for perverting justice.Defense attorney Louise Blackwell KC said Williams maintains her allegations were true.Williams offered an apology of sorts in a letter to the court saying, “I’m not saying I’m guilty but I know I have done wrong on some of this and I’m sorry.”She said she never instigated any of the unrest in her community, but Altham said it was foreseeable that people of Pakistani heritage would be targeted based on her post.“I’m devastated at the trouble that has been caused in Barrow,"" she said in the letter. ""If I knew what consequences would have come from that status I never would have posted it.”",2023/03/15,,World

(AP) — Azuolas Tubelis' face doesn't betray much emotion.A slight eyebrow raise, a barely noticeable smirk at the corner of the mouth, a quick side eye — that's about all you're going to get from Arizona's big man.The outward stoicism belies a wry sense of humor rarely seen by anyone outside the program or his family.Or does it?“Azuolas makes us laugh and makes us smile, and he does it in a way that if you didn't know him you'd wonder: is he joking?” Arizona associate head coach Jack Murphy said. “And that makes it all the funnier.”Tubelis carries the same countenance onto the basketball court. Still, opponents have no trouble discerning his intentions.The 6-foot-11 junior forward from Lithuania has become a dominant force for No. 8 Arizona, a player who can go around, through or sprint past defenders.Led by Tubelis and 7-footer Oumar Ballo, Arizona won the Pac-12 Tournament last week and earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament’s South Region. The Wildcats open against Princeton on Thursday in Sacramento, California, in their bid to make a second straight deep March run under coach Tommy Lloyd.“Zu doesn't show a lot of emotion, he's not a talkative person, but he's a baller,” Ballo said. “He comes in every single day, does his job. He doesn't need to talk much.”Tubelis arrived in Tucson with his brother Tautvilas as a thin athletic big man with a high skill level and deft touch. He averaged 12.2 points and 7.1 rebounds as a freshman, increasing his scoring average to 13.9 points last season.After Arizona got manhandled by Houston in the Sweet 16 last season, Lloyd implored his players to add toughness.Tubelis took it to heart.Instead of heading back to Lithuania to play for his national team, Tubelis spent most of last summer in Tucson. He worked with Arizona's coaches for eight weeks and spent a couple more working out with his brother, adding strength while learning to play through more contact around the rim.The result: Tubelis averaged 19.8 points and 9.3 rebounds while shooting 57% from the floor this season.“He’s one of those guys who's just a gamer, where he shows up and can perform,” Murphy said. “This year he’s had a much more focused work ethic, taking reps and drills more serious. And you’ve seen the results. He’s playing at a high, high level.”A high rate of speed, too.When Lloyd arrived at Arizona from Gonzaga, he pushed his big men to push themselves down the court as fast as they could. Tubelis heeded that advice, chugging down the floor as soon as Arizona gets the ball back, sometimes even on made baskets.Tubelis' sprint outs put constant pressure on opposing defenses, creating easy baskets in transition and matchup problems since it's usually only guards who can keep up with him. Even if he doesn't get the ball, Tubelis' quickness into the offensive zone forces the defense to overreact, often setting up the Wildcats for open 3-pointers in transition.On the break, Tubelis does things that defy his size.A sturdy 245 pounds, he has soft hands and incredible body control, often contorting midair to not only catch the ball but put it in the basket in one motion on passes that appear to be headed out of bounds.“I don’t know if that’s hand-eye coordination, obviously speed, quickness,” Murphy said. “I don’t know what sense it is, but he’s on that different level.”Just don't expect him to get excited about it, at least outwardly.When Tubelis scored 40 points against Oregon on Feb. 2, most by an Arizona player in 28 years, his postgame reaction was subdued, to say the least.“Shots went in, I scored a lot of points and you have to give credit to my teammates,” Tubelis said, drawing a snicker from teammate Kerr Kriisa.Tubelis' teammates see a different side of him away from the public eye, though it may not be a whole lot different than what everyone else observes.""He gets very excited when we win at Fortnite,"" Kriisa said. “Then you can hear when he's letting it out. But Zu is Zu. Let's not act like he's not giving out emotions. His emotions are different. He's like playing it cool, making some faces, being cool.”And quietly dominating.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835346,Italian government limits parental rights of gay couples,"MILAN (AP) — Gay rights activists on Tuesday denounced as homophobic moves by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s far-right-led government to limit recognition of parental rights to the biological parent only in families with same-sex parents.In a move that is expected to impact hundreds of families, the government has told the city of Milan to stop automatically recording both parents in same-sex couples on city registers. It was the last major city to continue the practice that had been briefly adopted in Rome, Turin, Naples and elsewhere after Italy's high court in 2016 made it easier for gays to adopt a partner’s biological child.The piece of bureaucracy is key to recognizing parental rights for a range of everyday situations like authorizing medical treatment or participation in class outings.The president of Rainbow Families, Alessia Crocini, charged that Rome's move ordering Milan to stop automatically registering both parents in same-sex households exposed the government’s homophobia. The government has issued no official statements on the move.“This government is the maximum expression of homophobia,’’ she said. “Meloni says that for a child to grow up well, they need a mother and father, even if decades of research say otherwise. It is insulting to hundreds of thousands of families with two same-sex parents.""Yuri Guaiana, of the activist group All Out, said the move “throws thousands of families into uncertainty.’’News of the move, which had been communicated to Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala by the state-appointed prefect, came on the same day that a Senate commission blocked an attempt to recognize birth certificates of the children of same sex couples issued by other EU states.Sala pledged to fight for a law conferring rights equally on same-sex parents, but said in the meantime he could not risk putting workers in the city registry office at odds with the government’s decision.Sala’s administration not only transcribed documents from other countries recognizing the rights of gay and lesbian parents, but also conferred the same recognition on same-sex parents of children born in Italy.Other cities had already stopped the practice as administrations changed hands and political winds shifted in Rome. In the absence of such recognition, the non-birth mother or father must go through the adoption process to establish parental rights — which can take years.Former Turin Mayor Chiara Appendino, the first mayor to recognize the rights of both same-sex parents without seeking court approval, said the new ban “is only the last slap against these families.” She joined Sala’s call for a law recognizing their rights.Italy’s Gay Party, formed in 2020 to give political heft to the fight against anti-gay discrimination, estimates that some 150,000 children are impacted by Italy’s failure to recognize the rights of both parents in same-sex marriages. That includes hundreds in the city of Milan.Gay Party spokesman Fabrizio Marrazzo called on Italian mayors to subvert the government’s request and register both same-sex parents in an act of civil disobedience.“When norms are discriminatory, mayors need to have the courage to say so,’’ he said.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835348,Clemson's Bresee continues on NFL path after sister's death,"CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Defensive tackle Bryan Bresee put on a strong face and a good showing for NFL teams at Clemson's pro day on Tuesday.Bresee, surrounded by teammates and family, continued moving forward on his pro football path after t he death of younger sister, Ella, this past September. Bresee missed four games because of 15-year-old Ella's passing and a troubling kidney infection in October that sapped his strength and scared his family about whether his health was at risk.Through it all, Bresee leaned on the game he's played since he was five. “Football was my escape for a lot of things,” he said last month. “Having my teammates, my family, my coaches, a lot of support around me was definitely crucial during that time.”Bresee, the 6-foot-5, 298-pounder, lifted weights, ran short-shuttle and three-cone drills and did defensive line workouts for personnel from all 32 pro teams including Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin, New York Giants defensive coordinator Wink Martindale and GMs from the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars.While Bresee's strength was impressive — he bench pressed 225 pounds 28 times as teammates and Clemson staff shouted encouragement — it was his mental fortitude that stood out to several of his teammates also participating at Clemson's pro day.“He’s just an inspiration to me, an inspiration to all his teammates,” said Clemson defensive end K.J. Henry. “We love seeing him do great.”Bresee stood on his 40-yard dash time of 4.86 seconds run at last month's NFL combine, although his bench press reps were an increase of six from his combine showing.Bresee chose to meet with NFL teams after his workout and not speak to the media.Bresee came to Clemson three seasons ago as the No. 1 college football recruit, a freaky strong athlete who would plug right into the defensive tackle void left by Tigers two-time national championship star Dexter Lawrence.Bresee was named the Atlantic Coast Conference's defensive rookie of the year after the 2020 season in which he had four sacks, 33 tackles and a safety in 10 starts as a freshman.Expectations were understandably high his sophomore season. But it was cut short just four games in with a season-ending knee ligament injury in a loss at North Carolina State.Bresee's rehab and return to the football field this season coincided with the deteriorating health of Ella, who died from an aggressive form of brain cancer.“You are the best sister a brother could ask for and I know for a fact heaven has gained a beautiful angel today, Love you forever and always Ella bear,” Bryan said in a social media post about Ella's death.Clemson's coaches and players had started an “Ella Strong” campaign to support her in her fight. It became one of consolation for Bryan Bresee and his family after Ella's funeral.The support “motivated me to push forward and go on,” he said.A frightening family development was Bresee's own health scare in October when he was diagnosed with a kidney infection and missed more time to recover.Bresee finished 2022 with just 16 tackles, although 5.5 of those were behind the line of scrimmage. These days, Bresee is closer to the promise he showed as a freshman and projected as a potential first-rounder in next month's draft.“We also love seeing him healthy,” Henry, his Clemson linemate, said. “I know a lot of people have wanted to see that version of him for a while.”Another Clemson defensive end, Myles Murphy, is projected as a high first-round pick. Murphy tweaked his hamstring preparing for the combine and is holding a separate workout in April for NFL teams.Murphy came in with Bresee and is confident both will have success at the next level. When Bresee was hurting, Murphy said his Tiger family rushed in to help him grieve and recover.“It was really something we all wanted to do,” Murphy said. “It just felt right to do.”A grateful Bresee said the support was a blessing to him and his family in difficult times. “It motivated me to push on,” he said.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835350,Polish Church defends John Paul sainthood after abuse claims,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The leaders of Poland’s Catholic Church on Tuesday defended the late John Paul II’s sainthood and fast-track canonization process in response to a Polish TV report alleging that he covered up clergy sex abuses while archbishop in Poland.The Polish Church figures also said that a commission of experts in various fields — lawyers, doctors, psychologists and historians — will be formed soon to investigate cases of past abuse of minors by the clergy.A report last week on TVN24, which is owned by the U.S. company Warner Bros. Discovery, named three priests whom John Paul allegedly moved around during the 1970s after they were accused of abusing minors. The report cited communist secret security documents but also included interviews with abuse survivors.Speaking after a two-day meeting of the entire Episcopate, the leaders stressed that — although unusually quick — the process that led to announcing Polish-born John Paul a saint was done with utmost care and honesty and reflected the general esteem he enjoyed as pope.John Paul is revered in the predominantly Roman Catholic country for his role in helping bring down communism and ending Moscow's domination in Poland and the region. The TVN report ignited a heated national debate at a time when the Polish Church has been undergoing a reckoning with its record of clergy sexual abuse.Archbishop Grzegorz Rys said “every page” in the Church archives during the process that began shortly after John Paul's death in 2005 and led to his sainthood in 2014 has been examined. Karol Wojtyla served as archbishop of Krakow from 1964 to 1978, when he became Pope John Paul II.Rys stressed that communist-era documents alleging abuse should be read cautiously, with the knowledge of the times.Referring to a resolution adopted by Poland's lawmakers in defense of the late pontiff and statements made by politicians, Rys insisted that John Paul II should not be used in any political disputes or bargaining.Poland's bishops appealed in a communique for the memory of “one of the greatest” Poles to be respected in the face of “unprecedented attempts at discrediting the person and the legacy of St. John Paul II.”“The canonization process leaves no doubt as to John Paul's II sainthood,” the communique said.John Paul II isn’t the only pope under scrutiny for dealing with predator priests.His immediate successor, Benedict XVI, who had a much stricter stance and defrocked hundreds of abusive priests, was faulted for his handling of four cases while he was Munich archbishop in his native Germany by an independent report commissioned by the diocese.Accusations of having failed to react to cases of abuse by priests in his native Argentina and in Chile, while bishop and then pontiff, have been also addressed to Pope Francis.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835351,Macron launches 500-day countdown to Paris Olympics,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron launched the 500-day countdown to the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics on Tuesday, bringing the public up to date with his government’s hopes for the Games, including the ambitious use of the Seine.Macron addressed hundreds of officials at a “speech of thanks” in the Paris police headquarters, saying that though plans are advancing “nothing should be taken as a guarantee.”""All that remains for us are 500 short days that separate us from the extraordinary events that are the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games, (where) we are going to host the world,” Macron said.In the speech and on Twitter, Macron thanked the 45,000 volunteers mobilizing to make the Games “a success” and again trumpeted the 5,000 new sports grounds that are in the works. Officials are pushing to get infrastructure and sites ready in time, with projects pockmarking many of Paris’ boulevards.Macron also made reference to the ambitious 1.4-billion-euro ($1.5 billion) scheme to clean the polluted waters of Paris’ main river artery.“The Seine and the Marne (rivers) will be made swimmable,” he said.Several events are to be held in the Seine, including the 10-kilometer swimming marathon — in a mirror of the first Paris Olympics in 1900.Macron also hopes to ditch tradition by staging the opening ceremony on water in an ambitious plan that will see craft floating on the Seine by the Eiffel Tower — as millions watch.The Paris Games’ budget is at 4.4 billion euros ($4.7 billion), according to an Elysee official who spoke anonymously in line with the French presidency’s customary practices. Ticket sales are a substantial part of the revenues — at least one third — that Paris organizers need to pay for the Olympics, he said.“The first phase of ticket sales is encouraging,” the Elysee official said. He added that the huge demand for tickets during the first phase of sales earlier this month, when more than 3 million tickets were sold, has made Macron confident that securing the funds for the Paris Games is on track.Macron has not yet weighed in on a Ukrainian-led call for a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes. ___ More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835352,Georgia's Smart insists he has not lost control of program,"ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia coach Kirby Smart insists he has not lost control of a program that has produced back-to-back national championships but has been rocked by offseason arrests and a car crash that claimed the lives of a player and a recruiting staffer.“There’s no lack of control for our program,” Smart said Tuesday before the Bulldogs' first spring practice.“... Our guys do make mistakes. That historically is probably going to happen when you have 18 to 22 year-olds. Our job as coaches is to prevent that from happening and that starts with me and you do it with how you educate your players and how you discipline your players and we’ll continue to do that at a high standard.”Wednesday's pro day on campus for NFL general managers and coaches will feature defensive tackle Jalen Carter, who is regarded as one of the top picks in the NFL draft on April 27. Carter's draft outlook has been potentially clouded by misdemeanor charges of racing and reckless driving in relation to the Jan. 15 crash that killed teammate Devin Willock and a recruiting staffer, 24-year-old Chandler LeCroy.The crash occurred hours after the Bulldogs celebrated their second straight national championship with an Athens parade and ceremony at Sanford Stadium.Georgia players said Tuesday they are still recovering from the losses of Willock and LeCroy.“Like the other day we were looking at film and I saw my boy Dev and it kind of hit me real hard,” said defensive lineman Zion Logue. “So you have to put those things aside and get back to football. It was a tragic event. We all learned from it. It’s just something very unfortunate.”Added wide receiver Ladd McConkey: “It’s a tough situation. It’s hard to even talk about it. Just do what you can and love every day like it’s the last one.”Carter is scheduled for arraignment in municipal court in Athens on April 18. He posted a statement on his Twitter account on March 1 saying he expects to be “fully exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing.”Carter is not the only Georgia player facing charges of racing on public roads.Linebacker Jamon Dumas-Johnson, the team’s second-leading tackler in 2022, was arrested on Feb. 22 on misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing. Dumas-Johnson is scheduled for arraignment on April 17.Meanwhile, quarterback Stetson Bennett was arrested in Dallas on Jan. 29 and charged with public intoxication.Smart said “the expectations we have here for our student-athletes” are important.“Certainly we haven’t met some of those requirements,” Smart said. “We want our student-athletes to meet those and we take those things very seriously. The standards have been created here for a long time. That doesn’t change and we want our players to live up to those.”Smart said when players make mistakes, “we treat them like we do our kids. We discipline them. We try to prevent them. We try to educate them. We try to do all we can to help our student-athletes in a positive way.”Police allege in an arrest warrant that Carter was racing his 2021 Jeep Trackhawk against LeCroy's 2021 Ford Expedition at the time of the crash. Willock was a passenger in the SUV LeCroy was driving.Police determined LeCroy’s Expedition was traveling at about 104 mph (167 kph) shortly before the crash. The arrest warrant says LeCroy’s blood-alcohol concentration was .197 at the time of the crash. The legal limit in Georgia is .08.Smart said he had officers from Athens-Clarke County police and University of Georgia police speak to players last summer about the dangers of street racing. Seeing a teammate and staff member lose their lives may teach far more painful lessons.“We feel like our players are beginning to acknowledge and starting to understand you make mistakes and decisions that are costly and it can cost you your life,” Smart said. “That’s not to be taken lightly and I think our guys understand that and we’ll continue to educate them and we’ll continue to do all we can as a university to make sure they behave and do that in a proper way.”Smart said LeCroy should not have been driving the vehicle that is expected to be used only for work.“It is understood that you cannot take a vehicle when you are not doing your duties and they were not participating in their duties at this time,” Smart said.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835353,Lawmakers fear spill on Keystone system in southern Kansas,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — State lawmakers worried Tuesday that southern Kansas is vulnerable to oil spills from the Keystone pipeline system because earthquakes have become more frequent there, as they questioned an executive for the pipeline's operator about a massive spill in northeastern Kansas in December.Gary Salsman, a vice president for field operations for Canada-based TC Energy, was briefing three Kansas legislative committees about the Dec. 7 rupture on the Keystone pipeline in Washington County, Kansas, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City. It was the largest U.S. onshore spill in nearly nine years, and the company expects to spend $480 million cleaning it up, with those efforts lasting at least into the summer.Salsman told a joint meeting of the Kansas House energy committee and its water committee that safety is TC Energy's top priority and that the company will stay in Washington County until the cleanup is complete. He was also expected to testify before the Senate Utilities Committee.But several lawmakers said they are nervous about the pipeline in the Wichita area, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of the Washington County spill site. The area began experiencing an increase in earthquakes in 2013, after Keystone opened its Kansas pipeline segment, tied to activities associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in oil and natural gas production.“My concern is not this spill so much as what’s lurking, moving forward, especially as you get down south,” said Republican state Rep. Leo Delperdang, of Wichita, the House energy committee chair. “We get earthquakes. What happens with the ground movement?”During the House committees' hearing, Rep. Jerry Stogsdill, a Kansas City-area Democrat, asked Salsman whether the Keystone pipeline needed “exceptional engineering” in southern Kansas.Salsman acknowledged that he's not an expert on the topic, but added: “When we design pipeline, we take all of those factors into consideration and I would think that, that was part of our design criteria.”TC Energy reported last month that a faulty weld at a bend in the pipeline under the Washington County creek caused a crack that then grew over time because of the stress on the bend. The rupture dumped nearly 13,000 barrels of crude oil, each enough to fill a standard household bathtub, into the creek and on the surrounding pastureland.Salsman told legislators that 95% of the crude oil has now been recovered.“We've really contained this site,” he said.The 2,700-mile (4,345-kilometer) Keystone system carries heavy crude oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to the Gulf Coast and to central Illinois.Concerns that spills could pollute waterways spurred opposition to plans by TC Energy to build another crude oil pipeline in the same system, the 1,200-mile (1,900-kilometer) Keystone XL, across Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. President Joe Biden’s cancelation of a permit led the company to pull the plug on the project in 2021.In Kansas, GOP lawmakers praised TC Energy for moving quickly to contain the Washington County spill and described the company as open about its activities. No one was evacuated, and state and U.S. government officials have said water from two rivers downstream were not affected. Salsman said the company has received no complaints from people tied to air quality.Salsman said the company has diverted water from the affected creek to avoid a 4.5-mile (7.2-kilometer) section so that crews can dig out soil contaminated by the crude oil. The company estimates that it has an average of 800 people on site in any given 24-hour period.“Our focus is on — entirely on — the remediation of the site and the safety of those people working on the site,” Salsman said.Democrats were more pointed with their questions. Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's pipeline safety arm showed that the Washington County spill was the largest on the Keystone system since it began operating in 2010 and larger than 22 previous spills combined, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report to Congress in July 2021.The report said: “The severity of spills has worsened in recent years.”Kansas City-area state Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, the top Democrat on the House Water Committee, asked Salsman why spills on the TC Energy pipeline are getting worse. Salsman didn't answer the question directly, saying that the company has done full cleanups and taken corrective action with all of the previous incidents.“We are going to get to the bottom of this,” he said.Vaughn said later that she wasn't satisfied with the answer, and Zack Pistora, a lobbyist in Kansas for the Sierra Club, said people still don't have any reasonable assurances that another oil spill won't happen.“I appreciate the pleasantries,"" he said, ""but there are still some hard questions that didn't get answered.”___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835354,"AP sources: Cowboys keep Wilson, Vander Esch in free agency","The Dallas Cowboys are keeping two of their own in free agency by agreeing to contracts with safety and leading tackler Donovan Wilson and linebacker Leighton Vander Esch.Wilson and the Cowboys agreed to a $24 million, three-year deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement said Tuesday. Another person says Vander Esch is returning for $11 million over two years.The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because terms of the contracts weren't released.Wilson rose from a sixth-round pick out of Texas A&M in 2019 to a starter in his second season. The 28-year-old started all 17 games last season and led NFL safeties with five sacks, tying Bill Bates' 1984 club record for the position.The agreements with Wilson and Vander Esch continue a trend of the Cowboys preferring to keep their own free agents on long-term deals over players from other teams.Defensive end Dorance Armstrong and cornerbacks Anthony Brown and Jourdan Lewis are among the recent draft picks to get second contracts on the Dallas defense.Vander Esch, the club's 2018 first-round pick, returned on a one-year deal last season coming off neck issues and had a good enough season to get a two-year deal this time.Wilson was limited to nine games in 2021 with groin, chest and shoulder injuries as the Cowboys returned to the playoffs following a two-year absence.With Dallas emerging as a playoff contender again last season, Wilson was a key member of a defense that carried the Cowboys to a 4-1 record when quarterback Dak Prescott missed five games early with a broken thumb.The Cowboys tied for third in the NFL with 54 sacks, their most since 2008. Dallas beat Tampa Bay 31-14 in a wild-card game before falling 19-12 to San Francisco in the club's NFL-record seventh consecutive divisional-round loss.Vander Esch, who didn't have the fifth-year option on his rookie contract picked up, had 100 tackles in his fifth season, reaching the century mark for the first time since his rookie year.The former Boise State standout emerged as the signal-caller in defensive coordinator Dan Quinn's scheme, earning praise from Quinn for setting the defense's tone.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835357,Ohio sues Norfolk Southern over toxic train derailment,"Ohio filed a lawsuit against railroad Norfolk Southern to make sure it pays for the cleanup and environmental damage caused by a fiery train derailment on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border last month, the state's attorney general said Tuesday.The federal lawsuit also seeks to force the company to pay for groundwater and soil monitoring in the years ahead and economic losses in the village of East Palestine and surrounding areas, said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.“The fallout from this highly preventable accident is going to reverberate throughout Ohio for many years to come,"" Yost said.No one was hurt in the Feb. 3 derailment, but half of the roughly 5,000 residents of East Palestine had to evacuate for days when responders intentionally burned toxic chemicals in some of the derailed cars to prevent an uncontrolled explosion, leaving residents with lingering health concerns. Government officials say tests over the past month haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw apologized before Congress last week for the impact the derailment has had on the area, but he didn't make specific commitments to pay for long-term health and economic harm.The railroad has promised more than $20 million so far to help the Ohio community recover while also announcing several voluntary safety upgrades.Norfolk Southern said Tuesday in a response to the lawsuit that it was listening to concerns from the community and planning to take additional steps to deal with some of those.The railroad is working on creating a long-term medical compensation fund, a way to provide protection for home sellers if their property loses value because of the derailment, and improving drinking water protections, it said in a statement.The lawsuit also asks for the railroad to reimburse first responders and state agencies for the costs of dealing with the disaster.How much money the state is seeking isn't known yet because the response is ongoing, but Yost made it clear the cost will be enormous. “This was an epic disaster. The cleanup is going to be expense, ” he said.Ohio officials met with Norfolk Southern representatives on Monday and talked about several possible ways to help the people in East Palestine, including enhancing the village's water treatment operations, Yost said.The state attorney general said he was pleased that the railroad has indicated it wants to do the right thing and that the lawsuit will make sure it keeps its promise.Many in East Palestine remain outraged at the railroad and worried about what will become of the village.Those fears include concerns about their long-term health, their house values and the economic future for local businesses.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835358,Stoudamire overcome by emotion as he takes over at Ga Tech,"ATLANTA (AP) — Damon Stoudamire managed to get one word out — “Wow!” — before he was overcome with emotion.The longtime NBA guard is thrilled to be back in the college game, heading a men's basketball program that he thinks can once again be a national powerhouse.Then again, Stoudamire is not the first coach at Georgia Tech to express such optimism.Stoudamire was formally introduced as the Yellow Jackets' coach on Tuesday, capping a whirlwind search that took only three days after Josh Pastner was fired following another losing season.“This has been a long journey for me,” Stoudamire said, choking back tears. “I'm excited beyond belief to be here.”Stoudamire's only previous head coaching experience came at Pacific, a West Coast Conference school where he posted a 71-77 record over a five-year tenure. He never reached the postseason but was selected as the league's coach of the year in 2020.Stoudamire has been a Boston Celtics assistant since 2021, working with a team that reached last year's NBA Finals and is among the top championship contenders this season.He couldn't pass up the chance to coach at Georgia Tech, even though the Yellow Jackets haven't been much of a factor on the national scene for nearly two decades.Stoudamire vowed to change the trajectory.“This is a tradition-rich program, and one that aspires to get back to winning championships,” he said. “We're going to galvanize the community, the student body, and just get this thing going in the right direction.”Pastner said many of the same things when he arrived in 2016, calling Georgia Tech a sleeping giant even as he faced a massive rebuilding job.He talked confidently of luring top talent to the Atlantic Coast Conference school in midtown Atlanta, saying the urban setting would be a huge appeal — especially with many of the nation's top prospects coming out of Georgia Tech's own backyard.Seven years later, Pastner was out of a job, having managed only a single NCAA Tournament appearance — a one-and-done in 2021 after a surprising run to the ACC championship — while drawing scant interest from five-star recruits.Pastner's predecessor, Brian Gregory, lasted only five forgettable seasons before he was dumped. Even Paul Hewitt, who guided the Yellow Jackets to the national championship game in 2004, oversaw a program in decline.Georgia Tech managed only two winning seasons and two NCAA appearances over Hewitt's final six seasons, leading to his firing in 2011.In total, the Yellow Jackets have managed only three NCAA appearances and one victory in the Big Dance in the past 18 seasons. Even more stunning, they've had just two winning records in the ACC over that span, both posted by Pastner.It's a far cry from the powerhouse program built by Bobby Cremins in the 1980s and '90s.Stoudamire said he was very familiar with that team growing up. He ripped off the names of Cremins' top players, including Mark Price, Bruce Dalrymple, Duane Ferrell, Tom Hammond, Dennis Scott, Kenny Anderson, Brian Oliver, James Forrest and Malcolm Mackey.Flanked by Georgia Tech President Angel Cabrera and athletic director J Batt, Stoudamire said confidently, “With the shared vision we have, I don't think there's nothing we can't do.”The new coach was short on specifics. He vaguely talked about being a program that will rely heavily on analytics, plans to beef up recruiting in both Georgia and around the nation, and can be a much bigger player on the NIL market with all the opportunities available in metro Atlanta.Stoudamire stressed that he's not looking to recreate the program Cremins built, but did say he might take from the former coach's playbook. Those teams were long known for having some of the nation's top point guards, from Price to Anderson to Stephon Marbury.“I do feel that guards win championships,” said the 49-year-old Stoudamire, a guard who starred at Arizona and went on to a 13-year career in the NBA. “Good guards will win you many games.”For Georgia Tech, the hiring of Stoudamire capped a six-month period of enormous change for an athletic program that has struggled in its two biggest sports.Early last season, football coach Geoff Collins and athletic director Todd Stansbury were both fired. Batt replaced Stansbury and wound up keeping interim football coach Brent Key as the ultimate replacement.Then, shortly after Pastner's team completed a 15-18 season, including a 6-12 mark in the ACC, Batt decided to make another major coaching change.“At the end of the day, the people we surround ourselves with is the most important part of our work,” Batt said. “I have extreme confidence in both of these hires we've made in my short time here, and I feel really great about our future.”Stoudamire was asked if there was any hesitation to leave the Celtics, especially with the playoffs and another championship run right around the corner.“When Boston wins the championship,” he said confidently, ""I'll still get my ring. We've already talked about that. I'll get my ring.""Then he plans on winning a few more at Georgia Tech.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835360,"Another atmospheric river pounds California, 27K to evacuate","WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) — The latest powerful atmospheric river to drench California put nearly 27,000 people under evacuation orders Tuesday due to flooding and landslide risks. On the central coast, workers hauled truckloads of rocks to plug a broken river levee amid steady rain and wind.Damaging winds with gusts topping 70 mph (113 kph) blew out windows, and there were numerous reports of falling trees. Power outages hit more than 330,000 utility customers in northern and central areas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.Crews raced to stabilize the Pajaro River's ruptured levee Tuesday, placing rocks and boulders to finish filling the gap that opened late Friday, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Workers will then raise that portion's elevation to match the rest of the levee over the next few weeks to make it impermeable, officials said.Tuesday's storm initially spread light to moderate rain over the state's north and center. But the National Weather Service said the storm was moving faster than expected and that most of the precipitation would shift southward.“Even a small amount of rain could potentially have larger impacts,” Shaunna Murray of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency said Tuesday during a news conference.Powerful winds damaged windows in a San Francisco high-rise, causing glass to rain down and forcing evacuations from the building in the financial district. No injuries were immediately reported. A gust of 74 mph (119 kph) was recorded at the city's airport, the weather service said.So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers — long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean — as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions. On the East Coast, the start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a runway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages Tuesday.Along the Southern California coast, evacuation orders began at 8 a.m. in Santa Barbara County for several areas burned by wildfires in recent years, creating increased risk of flash floods and debris flows.The storm caused emergency declarations for 40 counties.In addition to evacuation orders, more than 71,600 people were under evacuation warnings and 546 people were in shelters by Tuesday morning, said Brian Ferguson, spokesperson for the California Office of Emergency Services. Updated figures were not immediately available.More flooding was expected on the central coast, where the Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's atmospheric river. Authorities had not received reports of any deaths or missing persons related to the storm as of Monday.The levee breach grew to at least 400 feet (120 meters) since the failure late Friday, officials said. A roughly 20-foot (6.10-meter) gap remained Tuesday afternoon.Pajaro, an unincorporated community known for its strawberry crops, was largely flooded. More than 8,500 people were told to evacuate, and nearly 250 people have been rescued by first responders since Friday.Some residents of the largely Latino farmworker community stayed. One shelter was already full by midday Tuesday, and officials were forced to open two more to accommodate the evacuees.“We live seven houses away from the river and the water level was six feet high, seven probably,” said evacuee Andres Garcia. “So we probably lost everything.”A second 100-foot (30-meter) breach in the levee opened closer to the Pacific coast, providing a “relief valve” for floodwaters to recede near the mouth of the river, officials said at a news conference Monday.Built in the late 1940s to provide flood protection, the levee was a known risk for decades and had several breaches in the 1990s. Emergency repairs to a section of the berm were undertaken in January. A $400 million rebuild is set to begin in the next few years.“We had so many years of drought and they could’ve fixed the levee way back and they didn’t,"" said Garcia, the Pajaro evacuee. ""This is the second time it happened. Back in 1995, same thing. We lost everything.”The river separates Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Highway 1, a main link between the two counties, was closed along with several other roads.___Antczak reported from Los Angeles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835361,Ekeler receives permission from Chargers to seek trade,"Los Angeles Chargers running back Austin Ekeler could be on his way out.Ekeler’s agent, Cameron Weiss, said on Tuesday that the team has given Ekeler permission to seek a trade after both sides could not agree on a contract extension.Ekeler, who has scored an NFL-high 38 touchdowns over the past two seasons, is entering the final season of a four-year, $24.5 million extension. He is scheduled to earn $6.25 million in the 2023 season.He led the league with 18 scrimmage touchdowns last season and became the fifth running back in league history with at least 100 receptions. His 107 catches were tied for second most by a running back in a season.Ekeler also rushed for 915 yards, including a pair of 100-yard games.Ekeler emerged as the Chargers lead back in 2019 after Melvin Gordon held out until four weeks into the regular season because of a contract dispute.Ekeler has spent his entire six-year career with the Chargers after signing as an undrafted free agent in 2017.If Ekeler is traded, the Chargers must find a new lead back via free agency or the draft. Joshua Kelley and Isaiah Spiller backed up Ekeler last year but have struggled.The move also comes as coach Brandon Staley is trying to emphasize the running game more after hiring Kellen Moore as his offensive coordinator.The Chargers had the third-worst rushing attack in the league last season and the second-biggest discrepancy between passing and running plays (65% pass to 35% run).___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl nd https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835374,Spanish police recover empty drug submarine off north coast,"Spain's Civil Guard on Tuesday refloated a submarine suspected of transporting cocaine from Colombia to Spain, just off the coast of the northwestern region of Galicia.The vessel was found to be empty during a preliminary inspection with authorities suggesting that the crew had already made off with its contents.A similar submarine was discovered in 2019, filled with over 3 tons of Colombian cocaine, after it was abandoned in a muddy estuary, also in Galicia.Police shared videos on social media, first of the operation to refloat the vessel and then its transportation into the port of Xufre.The vessel was estimated to be between 15 and 22 meters (49 and 72 feet) long and was made out of fiberglass.It was apparently abandoned after its propellor got stuck in the mud in the Ria de Arousa estuary, in the zone of Vilagarcia de Arousa in the province of Pontevedra.Attempts to salvage the vessel included injecting pressurized air into it.Its bow had been discovered first on Monday morning after fishing boat crews notice a small oil spill.Police have not made any arrests and the whereabouts of the submarine's crew remain unknown.The 2019 submarine discovery resulted in the arrest of two crew members from Ecuador.The underwater vessels are difficult to track and are only used once. Galicia is a popular entry point for Colombian cocaine entering into Europe.In 2021, Spanish police seized another semisubmersible that was in the process of being built in Malaga, on Spain's southern Costa del Sol. The homemade vessel would have been able to carry up to two metric tons.Other similar submarines have been discovered in South America. They are rarely able to fully submerge.ab/ar (Reuters, dpa, AP)",2023/03/14,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835375,'The Voice of Holland' ex-stars to face sex offense charges,"Two singing coaches on ""The Voice of Holland"" will face sex crimes charges, prosecutors said Tuesday.The popular Dutch TV talent show, which inspired global editions, was taken off the air last year in January.Dutch broadcaster RTL, which aired the popular TV show, said the allegations that came to light early January 2022 were not previously known to them.RTL found out about the accusations of sexual misconduct after a local news broadcaster contacted RTL.The local broadcaster had spoken to women on the show about ""sexually transgressive behavior"" and abuse of power in relation to the show.RTL said the allegations were ""very serious and shocking"" and suspended the show. The scandal was one of the most serious #MeToo reckonings to hit the Dutch entertainment world.Prosecutors said that a 41-year-old man will be prosecuted for sexual offenses with three women in 2014 and 2018 in the Netherlands and another country.One of the cases is linked to ""The Voice of Holland,"" and a fourth case, also linked to the show, was dropped.A 51-year-old man will also be prosecuted for a sexual offense that allegedly took place in February 2018 ""in or around the recording studios where 'The Voice of Holland' was recorded,"" prosecutors said in a statement.They did not reveal the nature of the charges against the two men.A case was dropped against a third man because of lack of evidence.The statement did not identify either man, in line with Dutch privacy rules.Dutch media, including the RTL network, identified the 41-year-old as the rapper and Voice coach Ali Bouali. Bouali's lawyer, Bart Swier, said last year that the rapper denied any wrongdoing.RTL identified the 51-year-old as the show's pianist and band leader, Jeroen Rietbergen.Rietbergen quit the program following reports last year and admitted to ""relationships of a sexual nature"" with women involved in the program.rm/ar (AP, AFP)",2023/03/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835379,Judge: Netflix's 'Making a Murderer' didn't defame detective,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A retired Wisconsin detective has lost a defamation lawsuit against streaming giant Netflix over his portrayal in the 2015 documentary series “Making a Murderer.”On Friday U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig ruled in favor of Netflix and “Making a Murderer” filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, concluding that none of them acted with any malice toward now-retired Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Detective Andrew Colborn.Netflix aired “Making a Murderer” series in 2015. The 10-part series follows the story of Steven Avery, who spent nearly 22 years in prison for sexual assault before DNA tests exonerated him. He was released in 2003 but was convicted four years later along with his nephew, Brendan Dassey, in the 2005 murder and rape of photographer Teresa Halbach. Avery and Dassey were ultimately both sentenced to life in prison.The documentary raised questions about whether Manitowoc County officials framed them. Colborn, who participated in the Avery investigation, filed a lawsuit in April 2019 alleging that the documentary defamed him by misquoting his testimony — and editing snippets of his testimony, and reactions of others in court to make him appear nervous and uncertain.Ludwig found that the edits retain the gist of his testimony, and that Colborn failed to show that the streaming service or the filmmakers acted with malice toward him, a key element to defamation. It's defined as when someone makes a defamatory statement even though he or she knows it's false, or shows reckless disregard for its veracity.Colburn's attorney, listed in online court records as George Burnett, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835381,North Carolina GOP again seeking to limit racial teachings,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A previously vetoed proposal advancing in the North Carolina House would restrict how teachers can discuss certain racial topics in the classroom amid a national GOP crusade against ideas they associate with “ critical race theory.""The bill, which passed Tuesday in the House Education Committee, would ban public schools from compelling students to adopt a list of beliefs, including that students should feel guilty because of their race or sex and that they bear responsibility for past actions committed by members of the same race or sex.Schools would also be required to notify the state's Department of Public Instruction and post details online before they can host a diversity training session or a speaker who has previously promoted any of the beliefs restricted by the bill.Bill sponsor Rep. John Torbett, a Gaston County Republican who chairs the education committee, said it will prevent discriminatory concepts from being taught as fact, now and in the future. He highlighted a provision that would prohibit educators from asserting that one race or sex is inherently superior.“Who knows what group will rise to a prominent position to try to come and indoctrinate our children?” Torbett said. “This bill protects whatever group that is from soiling the minds of our kids with thoughts that don’t collectively bring us together.”Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the proposal in 2021 after warning that it would push “calculated, conspiracy-laden politics into public education.” Republicans resurrected it this year after gaining enough ground in the midterm elections to land within one seat of a veto-proof supermajority.Their latest action is part of a national Republican effort to quell classroom instruction on topics they associate with critical race theory, a complex academic and legal framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which perpetuate inequalities.While the bill does not explicitly mention the framework, it does prohibit schools from teaching that the United States was created for the purpose of oppressing members of another race or sex. It also rejects the notion that the government is “inherently racist.”While many K-12 public schools teach about the effects of slavery and racism throughout U.S. history, there is little to no evidence that critical race theory, as it's defined, is being taught. Republicans in recent years have co-opted the phrase as a catchall for racial topics they find unpalatable, using it as a political tool to limit lessons about systemic inequality, white privilege and racial justice efforts.First-term Rep. Ken Fontenot, a Wilson County Republican, commended the bill for outlawing critical race theory, which he claimed enforces a “one-way racism that is white-to-Black” and asserts that “Caucasians are somehow privileged” compared to other ethnic groups.“I think it’s just plain that we’re sifting out lopsided, uneducable, uncritical, not scholarly theories that are causing more harm than good,” he said.Since 2021, 44 states have introduced legislation or taken other actions to restrict how teachers can discuss racism and sexism in the classroom, according to an Education Week analysis. Eighteen states have imposed these regulations, and 10 are currently considering proposals.Rep. Marcia Morey, a Durham County Democrat, raised concerns that the bill would place additional pressure on teachers who might not understand what they can and cannot discuss with students.The proposal allows some leeway for impartial discussions on “controversial aspects of history,"" including historical oppression of a particular group based on race. Restrictions would not apply to textbooks and some historical documents.Morey encouraged lawmakers to remember past discussions about a bipartisan Holocaust education bill passed by the legislature in 2021 for a reminder about why it's important to learn about the greatest atrocities in history.“Much of our history is race related, and teaching and learning about lynching and slavery and the effects of Jim Crow laws will make students uncomfortable,"" she said. ""But a sound, basic education is a full discussion of facts of racism in American history.”___Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835382,Wisconsin man charged in Gov. Whitmer plot to change plea,"A Wisconsin man who drove past the vacation home of Michigan’s governor during a scheme to kidnap her in 2020 is returning to court to change his not-guilty plea, records show.Brian Higgins is scheduled for a hearing Wednesday in Antrim County court in Bellaire, Michigan.Higgins, 54, of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, is one of five men charged in northern Michigan with providing material support for an act of terrorism. It wasn’t immediately known if he has been offered a deal with a lesser charge.Higgins' attorney declined to comment Tuesday. The attorney general's office acknowledged only that a hearing was scheduled.A plea of guilty or no contest would be a big victory for state prosecutors. Three men in a separate but related trial were found guilty in Jackson County in October and are serving long prison terms.The main Whitmer kidnapping conspiracy was charged in federal court in Grand Rapids. The U.S. Justice Department got convictions against four men there, including leaders Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox, though two men were acquitted.Higgins trained with members of the conspiracy at a “kill house” in a remote hunting area, according to evidence. On that same weekend, in September 2020, he drove with others to scout Whitmer's vacation home in Elk Rapids. She wasn't there at the time.Despite some confusion over the address, ""Higgins drove by the governor’s residence and recorded it on the dashcam of his vehicle,"" prosecutors said in a court filing.“Higgins noted that he had seen some apartments nearby the governor’s residence and suggested that they could rent some of them as a safehouse of sorts,” prosecutors said.Informants and undercover FBI agents were inside the group, recording conversations and gathering evidence. The plot was broken up in fall 2020, and Whitmer was not physically harmed.___Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritez",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835383,"Mexico to use traditional medicine, more Cuban doctors","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Health authorities in Mexico said Tuesday they will use more traditional medicine and more Cuban doctors in the country’s woefully under-equipped public hospital system.Zoe Robledo, the head of Mexico’s largest public hospital network, said at a news conference that the system will hire 753 practitioners of traditional massage and herbal treatments.The Social Security Institute will also employ “curanderos,” who are non-licensed healers who use bundles of herbs, smoke, alcohol and eggs to “draw” sickness out of the bodies of their patients.“Thanks to traditional medicine, humans have managed to overcome threats to their physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing,” Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer said at the news conference.The hospitals and clinics will also employ midwifes and people who practice a traditional form of chiropractic medicine.Apparently, they won't necessarily be licensed professionals. Instead, they will “base their treatment on ancestral knowledge,” according to a statement by the office of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.The system also will seek to double the approximately 600 Cuban doctors who have been offered jobs in Mexico.While many Mexican hospitals lack specialized doctors — especially in rural or violence-plagued areas — the country's health care system has even starker deficits of medicines, hospitals and equipment.Patients' relatives often have to go and search for medications, surgical supplies and donated blood in order to get the care their loved ones need.That is largely the result of decades of under-investment in the health care system.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835384,Why FIFA changed the format for the 2026 World Cup,"The World Cup group stage format for 2026 was changed to 12 groups of four teams from 16 groups of three teams by FIFA’s Council on Tuesday, increasing the total to 104 matches from 64 in the 2022 tournament in Qatar.NEW FORMATTo win a World Cup, a nation will have to play eight games, up from the seven in place since 1974.The top two teams in each group and the top eight third-place teams will advance to a new round of 32 that starts the knockout phase. Advancement for third-place teams was eliminated for 1998, when the tournament expanded from 24 teams to 32.MORE GAMESThe change means there will be 104 matches, double the 52 at the 1994 World Cup in the U.S., up from the 64 at each tournament from 1998 through 2022 and an increase from the 80 under the original 2026 format. That means more content for television broadcasters and more tickets to sell, increasing revenue for FIFA.WHY CHANGE?The original format for the 2026 tournament in the U.S., Mexico and Canada was adopted by the Council in January 2017 when the World Cup was expanded from 32 nations to 48 starting in 2026. That format would have meant two teams playing on the final day of the group with one team off, which could lead to corruption. The current schedule of having all teams in a group kick off simultaneously on the final day was adopted after the Disgrace of Gijón at the 1982 World Cup in Spain when West Germany and Austria knew that a one- or two-goal win by the Germans would advance both nations at the expense of Algeria, which played a day earlier. Horst Hrubesch scored in the 10th minute and neither team threatened after that as West Germany won 1-0.LENGTHFIFA announced the final will be on July 19. The site has not yet been announced, with East Rutherford, New Jersey; Arlington, Texas; and Inglewood, California, the three leading contenders.No length has been specified for the tournament, which is likely to be between 38 and 42 days. That is up from 29 for last year’s tournament in Qatar and 32 for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The 1994 tournament was held from June 17 to July 17.IMPACT ON PLAYERS AND CLUBSFIFA announced the mandatory release date for players to be made available to national teams by their clubs will be May 25, a day after leagues must play their final pre-World Cup matches. However, continental finals such as the Champions League may take place through May 30, subject to FIFA approval. The release date is followed by a rest period — which means training allowed but national team friendlies prohibited. FIFA said the 56 days of rest, release and tournament remain identical to the 2010, 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835385,Editorial Roundup: United States,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:March 13The Washington Post on bank bailoutsOver the weekend, the United States suffered the second- and third-largest bank failures in the country’s history. This wasn’t supposed to happen. A slew of protections were put in place after the financial crisis 15 years ago to prevent a repeat of big banks collapsing and nearly taking down the whole banking system with them.But, once again, the federal government had to step in on Sunday evening with what amounted to a bailout of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — along with a bazooka of aid to prevent more banks from collapsing on Monday. It’s welcome news that the dramatic action appears to have prevented other regional banks from toppling, too, though no one should be pleased about the situation. Bankers were once again taking unwise risks, and regulators were once again too lax.There’s more to learn about all the mistakes that led to this moment, but it’s already obvious midsize financial institutions need additional scrutiny. What is now apparent is that the list of “too big to fail” banks is far longer than most assumed. Congress and regulators have to face this new reality and rapidly adjust. Silicon Valley Bank was the nation’s 16th largest with about $200 billion in assets, and Signature Bank was the 30th largest with about $110 billion in assets.These banks put profit over prudence. Silicon Valley Bank courted start-ups and venture capital money. Signature Bank wanted to be a player in crypto and real estate. Both had a heavy reliance on high-risk clients with many deposits well over $250,000, which is supposed to be the upper limit for insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On top of that, Silicon Valley Bank heavily bought assets that sank in value as the Federal Reserve hiked rates to fight inflation. When depositors attempted to rapidly withdrawal $42 billion on Thursday, the bank had no option but to sell those assets at a deep loss. The institution was poorly managed, but this kind of stunning loss of confidence would be difficult for even one that was better run to handle.Its executives were fired, and shareholders were wiped out, but the FDIC, the Fed and the Biden administration calculated they had no choice but to make all of Silicon Valley Bank’s depositors whole. Among them were companies such as Roku and Roblox, which might have had to struggle to pay workers if they had lost their uninsured funds.Then there was fear that panic might spread into a classic bank run if people and businesses suddenly withdrew money en masse from other midsize financial institutions. The risks to the broader economy and banking system turned out to be hefty. Meanwhile, tech luminaries — much like the banking heads in 2008 — were quick to call for government intervention. When the crisis came, some of the most vocal proponents of free markets in Silicon Valley were willing to set aside their libertarian principles to plead for help.Taxpayers were not on the hook for this bailout. Regulators used money from fees that banks pay to the FDIC. But a dicey precedent was set over the weekend that all deposits — of any size — would be treated as though they were insured. Banks won’t like it, but this new environment will likely require higher fees so the pot of emergency funding at the FDIC remains large enough going forward. If it is not, taxpayers could indeed have to step in directly as that fund is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.As the panic subsidies, there will inevitably be more scrutiny of bank regulators, especially the Fed. Over the weekend, the Fed once again created a massive emergency lending program for the financial system virtually out of thin air. Yes, the quick actions were a key reason other banks that were under intense pressure, such as First Republic Bank, were able to stabilize. But members of Congress have to ask: Why is the Fed so often having to rescue the financial system? Surely, there are better ways to prevent these problems from happening in the first place.It’s unclear exactly where the pitfalls were precisely, but the fact that small and midsize banks face light scrutiny needs to be addressed. The Dodd-Frank financial oversight law enacted enhanced supervision and annual stress tests for banks with $50 billion or more in assets. In 2018, Congress — with bipartisan support — voted to lift that threshold to $250 billion in assets, a move the Editorial Board said was a mistake. As he signed the bill into law, President Donald Trump praised it as “a big deal for our country.” Silicon Valley Bank chief executive Greg Becker was among the loudest voices calling for the rollback of regulations on banks like his. He said his institution didn’t pose a systemic risk. That turned out to be false.It is always easier to dissect the problems in hindsight. Consider that Moody’s Investors Service still gave Silicon Valley Bank an “A” rating until shortly before its demise. The Fed’s intense campaign to raise interest rates in the past year was also a major stressor, and many on Wall Street warned it was only a matter of time before something cracked.But the key takeaway is this should have been prevented. No one welcomes the idea of this as a “bailout nation,” as the phrase went during the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. What we should have learned already is that the ideal way to prevent that from happening is to put the watchdogs on patrol and don’t take away their teeth.ONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/13/silicon-valley-bank-bailout-response/___March 11The New York Times on China-U.S. relationsAmerica’s increasingly confrontational posture toward China is a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy that warrants greater scrutiny and debate.For most of the past half-century, the United States sought to reshape China through economic and diplomatic engagement — or, in the case of the Trump administration, through economic and diplomatic disengagement. The Biden administration, by contrast, has shelved the idea that China can be changed in favor of the hope that it can be checked.The White House has moved to limit economic ties with China, to limit China’s access to technology with military applications, to pull back from international institutions where the United States has long sought to engage China and to strengthen ties with China’s neighbors. In recent months, the United States has restricted semiconductor exports to China, and this week it moved ahead with plans to help Australia obtain nuclear submarines. The administration also is seeking to impose new restrictions on American investments in certain Chinese companies. In treating China as a growing threat to American interests, it is acting with broad support, including from leading Republicans, much of the military and foreign policy establishments, and a growing portion of the business community.Secretary of State Antony Blinken provided the clearest articulation of the administration’s China policy in a speech last May at George Washington University. Dismissing engagement as a policy failure, Mr. Blinken said the United States had tried with little success to persuade or compel China to abide by American rules or the rules of international institutions. He described China as increasingly determined to impose its priorities on other nations. “China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it,” he said. “Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.”It is true that engagement with China has yielded less than its proponents hoped and prophesied. China’s embrace of capitalism has not proved to be a first step toward the liberalization of its society or political system. Indeed, China’s brand of state-sponsored capitalism has damaged the health of liberal democracy elsewhere. The United States rightly continues to press China’s leadership on issues where serious differences remain, including its repression of Uyghur Muslims and its disregard for intellectual property rights.China also is demonstrating a greater willingness to engage in worrying provocations, mounting military displays in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, and sailing a balloon over the United States. U.S. officials say China is considering military aid for Russia, a move that would deliberately escalate tensions with the United States in an arena where China has little to gain.Yet the relationship between the United States and China, for all its problems, continues to deliver substantial economic benefits to the residents of both countries and to the rest of the world. Moreover, because the two nations are tied together by millions of normal and peaceful interactions every day, there is a substantial incentive to maintain those ties and a basis for working together on shared problems like climate change.Americans’ interests are best served by emphasizing competition with China while minimizing confrontation. Glib invocations of the Cold War are misguided. It doesn’t take more than a glance to appreciate that this relationship is very different. Rather than try to trip the competition, America should focus on figuring out how to run faster, for example through increased investments in education and basic scientific research.Chinese actions and rhetoric also need to be kept in perspective. By the standards of superpowers, China remains a homebody. Its foreign engagements, especially outside its immediate surroundings, remain primarily economic. China has been playing a much more active role in international affairs in recent years — a new agreement facilitated by China to re-establish relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia is the latest example — but China continues to show strikingly little interest in persuading other nations to adopt its social and political values.There are also signs that China’s leaders are not united in supporting a more confrontational posture. It behooves the United States to reassure those who may be open to reassurance. America and China are struggling with many of the same challenges: how to ensure what President Xi Jinping has termed “common prosperity” in an age of income inequality; how to rein in the worst excesses of capitalism without losing its vital creative forces; how to care for an aging population and young people who want more out of life than work; how to slow the pace of climate change and to manage its disruptive impacts, including mass migration.The core of America’s China strategy, building stronger relationships with our allies, is sound policy. Over time, the United States ought to seek a greater alignment between its economic interests and other national goals. The president’s budget proposal, released on Thursday, repeats some of the language from Mr. Blinken’s speech last year and proposes several billion dollars of foreign aid and investments to buttress U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region. “We’re trying to make sure that we can outcompete them when it comes to hearts and minds around the globe,” said Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.But the United States should not pull back from forums where it has long engaged China.For example, the World Trade Organization operates a court of appeals that was created to adjudicate trade disputes. The court, however, has not operated in over two years, since the most recently appointed judges completed their terms. New judges cannot be installed without the support of the United States, and the Biden administration has declined to provide that support. The United States has also pulled back from committees at the W.T.O. that write the rules of trade, according to Henry Gao, a professor at Singapore Management University and an expert on the organization. When Mr. Xi proposed in November 2021 to use the W.T.O. as a forum for establishing rules about state-owned enterprises, a key American goal, the United States didn’t show much interest, Mr. Gao said in an interview.That is a mistake. The construction of a rules-based international order, in which America played the leading role, was one of the most important achievements of the 20th century. It cannot be preserved if the United States does not continue to participate in those institutions.The Biden administration’s continuation of Trump-era restrictions on trade with China, and its imposition of a host of new restrictions, is also a dubious strategy. Limiting competition is likely to yield some short-term benefits, but American economic growth in recent decades has been driven primarily by increased productivity in sectors that are exposed to global trade. Competition has been both painful and beneficial. The value of the major investments the federal government is making in infrastructure, research and technical education is significantly reduced by measures that limit the size of the market for American goods or that shelter American businesses from healthy foreign competition.The confrontational turn also makes it harder for the United States and China to cooperate on addressing climate change and on other issues where national interests could plausibly align.Much of the shift in China policy has been justified as necessary for national defense. National security considerations can provide a legitimate rationale for limiting some types of trade with China. But it can also provide a legitimizing vocabulary for protectionist measures that are not in the interest of Americans. In the long term, the best guarantee of American security has always been American prosperity and engagement with the rest of the world.That’s true for China, too.ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/opinion/china-us-relationship.html___March 9The Wall Street Journal on Biden's record defense budgetThe White House is touting President Biden’s U.S. military budget for fiscal 2024 as a record, and Mr. Biden is betting busy Americans won’t look past the headlines. The truth is that he’s asking for a real defense cut, even as the U.S. is waking up late to a world of new threats.The Pentagon’s budget request may seem large at $842 billion. But the figure is only a 3.2% increase over last year, and with inflation at 6% it means a decline in buying power. Compare the 3.2% growth with the double-digit increases for domestic accounts: 19% for the Environmental Protection Agency; 13.6% for both the Education and Energy Departments; 11.5% for Health and Human Services.For all the talk about a bloated Pentagon, defense in 2022 was only about 13% of the federal budget. It’s about 3% of GDP, down from 5% to 6% during the Cold War, even though America’s challenges today are arguably more numerous and acute.China is building a world-class military to drive America out of the Pacific. Russia is committed to grinding down Ukraine and then moving its military to the Polish border; Iran may soon have a nuclear bomb; North Korea is lobbing missiles toward Japan. Hypersonics and missiles threaten the U.S. homeland.The Pentagon isn’t releasing the finer points of the budget until Monday, but a hefty portion of any increase will be absorbed by a 5.2% pay increase for troops and civilians, needed in part to offset Mr. Biden’s inflationary policies. The White House includes bromides about America’s “long-term commitment to the Indo-Pacific” and highlights $9.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative.But Pacific deterrence depends on a U.S. Navy large enough to discourage bad behavior, and the goal of a 355-ship service remains a fantasy. The document promises “executable and responsible” investments in the fleet, which is a euphemism for cutting ships without adequate replacements.The budget commits to “ongoing nuclear modernization,” but recapitalizing all three parts of the triad is a generational challenge that is straining budgets. The document nods at expanding “the production capacity of the industrial base to ensure the Army can meet strategic demands for critical munitions,” and Congress last year authorized multiyear contracts that should help. But the U.S. still isn’t procuring its best precision weapons in sufficient quantities to last more than a few weeks in a fight for Taiwan.Mr. Biden’s largest failure is promising his budget will keep “America safe,” instead of leveling with the public about the threats and what will be required to meet them. The reality is that U.S. military power is “slowly sinking,” as a Navy admiral put it last year, and Congress will have to start plugging the hole.ONLINE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-budget-defense-pentagon-china-russia-ukraine-ae4f9adf___March 9The Los Angeles Times on the GOP and Trump's candidacyIn a sane world, Donald J. Trump, defeated for reelection, twice impeached and caught up in multiple investigations, would slink into retirement from politics. That the former president is seeking reelection — and “retribution” — is a reflection not only of his narcissism and the deluded devotion of his followers but also of the failure of prominent Republicans to ostracize him.Exhibit A is the seesawing of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. During the post-Jan. 6 debate over Trump’s impeachment — which he opposed — McCarthy rightly said Trump “bears responsibility” for the attack on Congress as it set about certifying Joe Biden’s victory. McCarthy also described the attack as “undemocratic, unAmerican, and criminal.” Earlier, in a conversation with colleagues, he said he would recommend that Trump resign, though he accused the New York Times of “false and wrong” reporting when it disclosed that fact. (The reporters later released a recording of the conversation.)But despite McCarthy’s criticism of Trump, the Bakersfield Republican soon was making a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, where, in what Trump’s political action committee described as a “cordial” conversation, he and Trump discussed the campaign to regain control of the House. More recently, McCarthy provided Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson with 41,000 hours of Jan. 6 security video that Carlson used to present the Jan. 6 insurrection as a mostly peaceful event. The overwhelming majority of participants, Carlson said, “were not insurrectionists. They were sightseers.”Predictably, Trump thanked Carlson and McCarthy, and called for the release of those who have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to charges from the attack. (In the past, he has suggested that if reelected he might pardon some Jan. 6 defendants.) Whatever Carlson thinks of Trump in private, his whitewashing of that day’s events plays into Trump’s attempt to rewrite a traumatic moment in American history to his political advantage.To their credit, some Republicans in Congress treated Carlson’s presentation with the scorn it deserved. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell associated himself with a statement by Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger complaining that Carlson’s presentation “conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video.”Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) was pithier in his comment: “I was here. I saw what happened. I saw the violence. And you know, I thought it was an insurrection at that time. I still think it was an insurrection today.” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) called the Carlson version of Jan. 6 “bullshit.”Yet it’s not enough for prominent Republicans to criticize a TV program that minimized what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Everyone with a leadership role in the party should also work in the coming months to ensure that the president who propagated false claims about a rigged election — and exhorted his followers to show up in Washington on Jan. 6 for a “wild” protest — never returns to the White House.A recognition of what really happened on Jan. 6 necessarily involves a harsh judgment on the man whose falsehoods inspired the insurrection. As former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the vice chair of the House Jan. 6 committee, aptly put it: “No man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.”Republicans naturally worry about alienating Trump supporters. Cheney lost her leadership position, and then her seat in Congress, after she voted to impeach Trump and continued to criticize him. But as the 2024 campaign approaches, it may be not only responsible but also smart for Republicans to acknowledge that Trump is a fatally flawed candidate. Despite what his supporters may believe, Trump lost the 2020 election, lied about it to millions and tried to subvert the constitutional electoral process. What kind of future would the party have if it continued to accept him as its standard-bearer?ONLINE: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-09/the-gop-should-not-treat-trump-like-a-normal-presidential-candidate___March 11The Guardian on China-U.S. relationsLooking back, it is hard to believe that in the Obama era there were serious discussions about whether a “G2” could emerge – with the U.S. and China coming together, never easily but earnestly, and in good faith, to tackle the world’s great problems.The costs of mutual hostility are now greater and clearer than they were back then: the risk of global economic recession, a failure to tackle the climate crisis, and even of military conflict in the future. Yet far from strengthening, bilateral relations have nosedived. The relationship between China and the U.S. is not only at its lowest point for years, but appears to be trapped in a downward spiral. For now Beijing, in particular, seems to be giving up on fixing it. Its support for Moscow has contributed to the deterioration, but is also driven by its belief that the partnership helps to buttress it against U.S. hostility. How and when the war in Ukraine ends could prove critical for U.S.-China relations.In recent months, Beijing had appeared to step back from the abrasive “wolf warrior” diplomacy that helped to set alarm bells ringing not only in the west but more widely. But this week, Xi Jinping made a rare explicit criticism of Washington, remarking that “western countries, led by the U.S., are implementing all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us”. Qin Gang, the foreign minister, warned that “the U.S. side’s so-called competition is all-out containment and suppression, a zero-sum game of life and death”.Mr. Xi’s message was probably directed in large part at his domestic audience. Nationalism, always useful to the party, has become more so as economic growth has faltered. His remarks also reflect China’s conviction that the U.S. is driven as much by jealousy of its economic hegemony as by any principled concerns. But in Washington it was, inevitably, seen as upping the ante.The newly formed House select committee on the strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist party says it wants to raise public concern — surely not lacking in a country where growing hawkishness towards China is evident across the political spectrum. Though Beijing’s own actions are largely to blame for that shift, the change has bolstered its aggrieved conviction that it won’t gain much from attempting engagement.Rightful concern in the U.S. — on issues ranging from China’s increasingly forceful foreign policy to industrial espionage, and from the treatment of Uyghurs to the future of Taiwan — is mixed at times with nationalism and even racism. That China is closing the economic, industrial and technological gap with the U.S. is unnerving Washington, but the real issues are surely how it has done so and how it plans to use its capabilities.And while one committee member said it does not want to encourage xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment, not everyone criticizing China is scrupulous in discriminating between government and people or making sure others do so. A bill in the Texas senate would make it illegal for Chinese citizens to buy any property, including homes. The pandemic has already led to growing anti-Asian hate. Shrill, unfocused alarmism also makes it harder to concentrate on the issues that really matter and how to handle them. Under Mr. Xi, it is increasingly hard to read China’s leadership accurately, and harder still to sway it. The U.S. could at least determine its own priorities and values more clearly.ONLINE: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-china-us-relations-can-the-downwards-spiral-be-halted",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835386,Abortion pill access case: Judge wants 'less advertisement',"AMARILLO, Texas (AP) — A federal judge overseeing a high-stakes case that could threaten access to medication abortion across the nation asked lawyers for the “courtesy” of not publicizing upcoming arguments, according to a court record released Tuesday that reveals new details of a move experts say is outside the norm for the U.S. judicial system.U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk — who was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is known for conservative views — told attorneys during a status conference by telephone on Friday that because the case has prompted death threats and protests, “less advertisement of this hearing is better,” according to a transcript of the meeting.“And because of limited security resources and staffing, I will ask that the parties avoid further publicizing the date of the hearing,” Kacsmaryk said, according to the transcript. “This is not a gag order but just a request for courtesy given the death threats and harassing phone calls and voicemails that this division has received.”Kacsmaryk did not specify who made threats.“We want a fluid hearing with all parties being heard. I think less advertisement of this hearing is better,” the judge said in asking lawyers not to tweet about the hearing so that the court could avoid “any unnecessary circus-like atmosphere of what should be more of an appellate-style proceeding.”The judge said he planned to issue an order setting the hearing late on Tuesday, one day before the hearing in Amarillo, a Texas Panhandle community that has few direct flights and is more than four hours drive from the nearest major city. Kacsmaryk ultimately issued the order Monday, after The Washington Post reported on his attempt to keep the hearing under wraps.Protests are now planned in Amarillo Wednesday, with the Women's March advocacy group urging people to rally outside the federal courthouse wearing judge and kangaroo costumes to decry Kacsmaryk.Terry Maroney, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School who studies federal judges, said they often have security concerns in high-profile cases, but Kacsmaryk's handling of such worries was unusual.“I have not heard of anybody doing this,” Maroney said of Kacsmaryk seeking to delay public notice of the hearing. “It does strike me as unusual and not proper.”Maroney said that while Kacsmaryk noted his request to avoid publicity was not an order, most lawyers would nonetheless be inclined to obey when a judge frames a request as a matter of safety. “It functionally operates as a gag order,” she said.University of Oklahoma law professor Joseph Thai called it “deeply concerning” for a federal judge to try to keep the public in the dark.“The fact that the Trump-appointed judge is deciding a highly political question, potentially denying millions of women across the country a safe and effective abortion pill, makes it all the more critical to ensure public notice and access to the hearing at which their rights will—or will not—be heard,"" Thai said. “Nothing less than the legitimacy of the judicial branch is at stake.”The closely watched lawsuit is challenging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's more than 20-year approval of the drug mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortions which account for more than half of the abortions in the U.S.The suit was filed by a group that helped challenge Roe v. Wade, which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down last year, stripping away women’s constitutional protections for abortion.Impacts of a ruling against the FDA could take years to play out. It could affect states regardless of whether abortion is legal there.Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said that if Kacsmaryk had issued a gag order the lawyers could have appealed it but there was no avenue for judicial review of his requesting their silence ""as a courtesy.” “It gives rise to the appearance that he’s trying to keep the hearing, somehow, secret,"" said Hellman. ""It just looks bad.”___Bleiberg reported from Dallas.___Follow AP's full coverage of abortion: https://apnews.com/hub/abortion",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835390,Chevron hasn't complied with new California gas pricing law,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Chevron has not complied with a new California law requiring it to disclose how much money it is making from selling gasoline in the state, setting up a showdown with state regulators over data that Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration requested in order to impose the nation's first penalty on excessive oil profits.The law requires oil companies to report their monthly “gross refining margin,"" meaning the difference between how much refineries paid for crude oil and how much the company sold it for as gasoline.State lawmakers and regulators believe that the data will give them a clearer picture of what has driven sharp increases in California's gas prices, which are consistently the highest in the nation. The average price for a gallon of gas in California on Tuesday was $4.90, which is $1.44 higher than the national average, according to AAA.California's average price-per-gallon for gasoline hit an all-time high last summer of $6.44 per gallon. That prompted Newsom and state lawmakers to send cash rebates to most drivers and enact a new law requiring oil companies to disclose more data about their prices. Newsom followed that up with a bill in the state Legislature this year to penalize oil companies for making excessive profits, a proposal that is closely tied to the data that Chevron has not reported.Representatives for Chevron did not respond to a request for comment.The deadline for oil companies to report pricing data for January was March 2. Of the big five oil companies that provide 97% of the state's gasoline, four of them met that deadline: Marathon, PBF Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero, according to the California Energy Commission, which is collecting the data.Chevron only submitted a “small fraction of the data required,” according to the commission, and objected to reporting anything else. The California-based company accounts for about 30% of all gasoline sold in the state, giving it the largest share of the market. The commission has now given Chevron until the end of Tuesday to comply or to face fines of up to $2,000 per day.In a letter to the California Energy Commission, Chevron attorney Melissa Sladden asked the commission to delay enforcing the law in favor of a lengthy rule-making process to clarify which data must be reported. Sladden said the data required by the law “paints a false picture of actual refinery profit margins by significantly undercounting refinery costs.""“Getting this term right is doubly important as it is currently being contemplated by legislators as a measure on which to impose a tax on refiners,” Sladden wrote. “Legislating or regulating based on inaccurate data could result in unintended consequences, such as decreased investment in gasoline production and higher long-term prices at the pump.”The dispute reflects a larger conflict between the oil industry and Newsom, who is just beginning his second term and is seen as a possible presidential candidate one day. Newsom has pushed aggressive climate policies, including banning drilling new oil wells within homes, schools and community sites.But the oil industry is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the state, donating lots of money to state lawmakers' political campaigns. The industry is backing a referendum to overturn the ban on drilling oil wells near sensitive sites. And Newsom's proposal to penalize oil companies for making too much money has made little progress so far in the state Legislature, with several Democrats voicing concerns about it during a public hearing last month.Chevron not complying with the new pricing law could anger some lawmakers enough that it might influence their votes, said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that is pushing for a penalty on oil profits.“This is just a big (refiner) giving the finger basically to the state,” Court said. “I don't think that’s going to bode well when the legislation hits.”State Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Santa Monica who authored the law requiring oil companies to disclose more data, said he still has some questions about Newsom's proposal for a penalty on excessive oil company profits. But he said it was “disappointing” that Chevron had not complied with the law he wrote.“The fact that all of the other industry players were able to do it and they weren’t, I just don’t know what’s going on with them,” Allen said. “We’re going to hold them accountable.”The energy commission has already denied a request from the Western State's Petroleum Association, an oil industry lobbying group, to delay enforcing the law requiring more data on pricing. The association is set to ask the commission to reconsider its ruling on Tuesday.Sophie Ellinghouse, the association’s vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary, wrote in a letter to the commission that the request for profit numbers will generate “burdensome, inaccurate, and inconsistent” information.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835391,Canelo Álvarez sets ring return to face John Ryder in Mexico,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Canelo Álvarez will return to the ring May 6 in his native Guadalajara, Mexico, to defend his four super middleweight title belts against Britain's John Ryder.Promoter Matchroom Boxing announced Álvarez's next fight Tuesday. The bout will be at Akron Stadium, the home of Mexican soccer club Chivas.Álvarez (58-2-2, 39 KOs) is fighting for the first time since he won the final bout in his famed trilogy with Gennady Golovkin by unanimous decision last September. Álvarez also will be fighting one year after his one-sided upset loss to Dmitry Bivol in a light heavyweight bout.The 32-year-old Álvarez is returning on Cinco de Mayo weekend to fight in Mexico for the first time in 11 1/2 years.Álvarez, who lives in San Diego for most of the year, has staged his last 22 bouts in the U.S. He hasn't fought in Mexico since beating Kermit Cintron in Mexico City in November 2011, and he hasn't fought in his hometown since June 2011.Álvarez had surgery on his left hand late last year, but he has recovered quickly enough to take on his next challenge. He collected all four 168-pound world title belts during an impressive four-fight run through the division starting in late 2020 and ending with a stoppage of Caleb Plant in November 2021.“I feel really happy to be coming back in May, because following my surgery, I was unsure of when I’d be coming back,” Álvarez said in a statement. “Returning to the ring and coming back to fight in Jalisco, where I’m from, makes me especially happy.""The 34-year-old Ryder (32-5-0, 18 KOs) will be a significant underdog, but he has earned interim versions of two super middleweight world title belts during his current four-fight unbeaten run.Ryder fought twice in 2022 and earned arguably the two biggest victories of his career, winning a split decision over former middleweight champion Danny Jacobs before stopping previously unbeaten Zach Parker last November.___AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835392,Review: U2 documentary marred by an oddball American,"David Letterman joins Bono and The Edge in a new streaming documentary about U2 and one obvious question soon jumps out: What exactly is David Letterman doing here?The droll, bushy-bearded American comedian is an odd choice to be master of ceremonies for this Disney+ project, unbalancing everything, even the title, “Bono & The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, with Dave Letterman.”Director Morgan Neville does a fabulous job using new interviews — including brilliant insights by musician Glen Hansard and producer Jimmy Iovine — and melding them with old performances as he explores the band's origins, song creations, highs and lows. But he's torn about whether this is a travel show or a music documentary and neither work well.The film's spine is a concert by Bono and The Edge at the Ambassador Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, where they unveil some of the ways they've stripped down and reworked their catalogue for the new acoustic-led album “Songs of Surrender,” including such songs as “Vertigo” “Bad” and “One.”But Letterman not only distracts, he gets in the way. We watch him wander around Dublin shopping with his clueless, oddball sense of humor, as if the show was about him. “I’m interested in a wheel of cheese. I’ve never purchased a wheel of cheese,” he says.There's even a weird sequence in which Bono is reduced to drawing a map of Ireland for his guest and unpacking the complex history of Irish-English animus. “Who do I dislike in this?” asks Letterman. The answer is Letterman.The documentary does a masterful job of giving context to U2's rise, the social, religious and cultural changes taking place in the late 1970s and ’80s in Dublin, or as Bono says “as Ireland moves from black and white into color.”There are insights — some small, like that drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s nickname growing up was “The Jam Jar,” and some big, as when Bono reveals tensions within the band regarding his activism — and moments to celebrate, like the band's important Super Bowl halftime show after 9/11.But then there’s Letterman popping up again — visiting polar swimmers or stopping by the recording studio, offering no real insight. Bono and The Edge even write him a goodbye song. Letterman is empty-handed.Watching the documentary you start to realize how crucial The Edge is, and even get to listen to him sing a few songs and tell the story of how he came up with “Sunday Bloody Sunday” while delivering the riff on a guitar. Bono brings up how key his bandmate is, in a sweet way, live in concert.“The thing I don’t like about Edge is that he doesn’t need me. He could be doing all of this — writing, singing, performing, playing, producing — on his own. But he doesn’t,” Bono says.“Because it’s not as much fun,” The Edge replies.The only thing that ruins this special chemistry is the film's third wheel — the American with the wheel of cheese.“Bono & The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, with Dave Letterman,” a Disney+ release streaming Friday, is rated TV-14. Running time: 124 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. ___ Online: https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/movie/bono-and-the-edge-a-sort-of-homecoming-with-dave-letterman ___ Follow Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835393,Nebraska lawmaker 3 weeks into filibuster over trans bill,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — It was a mundane, unanimously supported bill on liquor taxation that saw state Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh take to the mic on the Nebraska Legislature floor last week. She offered her support, then spent the next three days discussing everything but the bill, including her favorite Girl Scout cookies, Omaha's best doughnuts and the plot of the animated movie “Madagascar.”She also spent that time railing against an unrelated bill that would outlaw gender-affirming therapies for those 18 and younger. It was the advancement of that bill out of committee that led Cavanaugh to promise three weeks ago to filibuster every bill that comes before the Legislature this year — even the ones she supports.“If this Legislature collectively decides that legislating hate against children is our priority, then I am going to make it painful — painful for everyone,” the Omaha married mother of three said. “I will burn the session to the ground over this bill.”True to her word, Cavanaugh has slowed the business of passing laws to a crawl by introducing amendment after amendment to every bill that makes it to the state Senate floor and taking up all eight debate hours allowed by the rules — even during the week she was suffering from strep throat. Wednesday marks the halfway point of this year’s 90-day session, and not a single bill will have passed thanks to Cavanaugh’s relentless filibustering.Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said a delay like this has happened only a couple of times in the past 10 years.“But what is really uncommon is the lack of bills that have advanced,” Metzler said. “Usually, we’re a lot further along the line than we’re seeing now.”In fact, only 26 bills have advanced from the first of three rounds of debate required to pass a bill in Nebraska. There would normally be two to three times that number by mid-March, Metzler said. In the last three weeks since Cavanaugh began her bill blockade, only three bills have advanced.The Nebraska bill and another that would ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don't align with the gender listed on their birth certificates are among roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year. Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in some Republican-led states, including South Dakota and Utah, and Republican governors in Tennessee and Mississippi are expected to sign similar bans into law. And Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges.Cavanaugh's effort has drawn the gratitude of the LGBTQ community, said Abbi Swatsworth, executive director of LGBTQ advocacy group OutNebraska. The organization has been encouraging members and others to inundate state lawmakers with calls and emails to support Cavanaugh's effort and oppose bills targeting transgender people.“We really see it as a heroic effort,” Swatsworth said of the filibuster. “It is extremely meaningful when an ally does more than pay lip service to allyship. She really is leading this charge.”Both Cavanaugh and the conservative Omaha lawmaker who introduced the trans bill, state Sen. Kathleen Kauth, said they're seeking to protect children. Cavanaugh cited a 2021 survey by the Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention efforts among LGBTQ youth, that found that 58% of transgender and nonbinary youth in Nebraska seriously considered suicide in the previous year, and more than 1 in 5 reported that they had attempted it.“This is a bill that attacks trans children,” Cavanaugh said. “It is legislating hate. It is legislating meanness. The children of Nebraska deserve to have somebody stand up and fight for them.”Kauth said she's trying to protect children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments that they might later regret as adults. She has characterized treatments such as hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery as medically unproven and potentially dangerous in the long term — although the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association all support gender-affirming care for youths.Cavanaugh and other lawmakers who support her filibuster effort “don't want to acknowledge the support I have for this bill,"" Kauth said.“We should be allowed to debate this,"" she said. “What this is doing is taking the ball and going home.”Nebraska's unique single-chamber Legislature is officially nonpartisan, but it is dominated by members who are registered Republicans. Although bills can win approval with a simple majority in the 49-seat body, it takes 33 votes to overcome a filibuster. The Legislature is currently made up of 32 registered Republicans and 17 registered Democrats, but the slim margin means that the defection of a single Democrat could allow Republicans to pass whatever laws they want.Democrats have had some success in using filibusters, which burn valuable time from the session, delay votes on other issues and force lawmakers to work longer days. Last year, conservative lawmakers were unable to overcome Democratic filibusters to pass an abortion ban or a law that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns without a permit.Cavanaugh said she has taken a page from the playbook of Ernie Chambers — a left-leaning former legislator from Omaha who was the longest-serving lawmaker in state history. He mastered the use of the filibuster to try to tank bills he opposed and force support for bills he backed.“But I'm not aware of anyone carrying out a filibuster to this extent,” Cavanaugh said. “I know it's frustrating. It's frustrating for me. But there is a way to put an end to — just put a stop to this hateful bill.”Chambers praised Cavanaugh's “perseverance, gumption and stamina to fight as hard as she can using the rules"" to stand up for the marginalized, adding, “I would be right there fighting with her if I were still there.”Speaker John Arch has taken steps to try to speed the process, such as sometimes scheduling the Legislature to work through lunch to tick off another hour on the debate clock. And he noted that the Legislature will soon be moving to all-day debate once committee hearings on bills come to an end later this month.But even with frustration growing over the hobbled process, the Republican speaker defended Cavanaugh's use of the filibuster.“The rules allow her to do this, and those rules are there to protect the voice of the minority,” Arch said. “We may find that we're passing fewer bills, but the bills we do pass will be bigger bills we care about.”Chambers said this is a sign that Cavanaugh's efforts are working. Typically, the speaker will step in and seek to postpone the bill causing the delay to allow more pressing legislation such as tax cuts or budget items to move forward.“I think you're going to start to see some of that happen,” Chambers said. “I think if (Cavanaugh) has the physical stamina, she can do it. I don't think she shoots blanks.”",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835394,Former Kentucky lawmaker makes plea on gender-affirming care,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — For years, Jerry Miller was a fixture at legislative hearings in Kentucky, but this time was different: the Republican ex-lawmaker opened up about how his young grandchild could be hurt by a bill to ban access to gender-affirming medical care for those under 18.“This bill condemns vulnerable children to an even more difficult life than they’ve already been born into,” Miller told a Senate committee on Tuesday. ""Please don’t let a parent’s right to protect their children be collateral damage in the culture wars.”Despite his emotional pleas, the transgender-related bill was approved by the GOP-led committee, sending it to the full Senate. Some Republican members, however, raised concerns about portions of the measure, which could temporarily slow its path through the chamber. The House recently approved its version of the measure.The measure grew in scope before emerging from the Senate committee. The panel tacked on elements of other trans-related proposals introduced this year. One key addition would forbid Kentucky schools from discussing gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation.Another addition would allow teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by their preferred pronouns. It also would require that parents be given notice and an opportunity to review materials before content relating to sexuality is taught at their children's school.Nationally, state lawmakers are approving extensive measures against LGBTQ individuals this year, from bills targeting trans athletes and drag performers to ones limiting gender-affirming care. In Mississippi, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed a bill to ban gender-affirming hormones or surgery in the state for anyone younger than 18. The Republican governors of South Dakota and Utah have signed bans on gender-affirming care this year.Miller, who retired from the Kentucky House after deciding not to seek reelection last year, returned to the statehouse Tuesday to speak out against the Kentucky measure — House Bill 470 — because he said it would affect his 7-year-old grandchild.He focused on the sections that would ban access to gender-transition medical care for those under 18. It would apply specifically to hormone and surgical treatments. The measure would designate gender-transition care for those under 18 as unethical and unprofessional conduct by health care providers. Their licenses to practice would be revoked for providing such treatment if the measure becomes law.Miller criticized the prohibitions as an intrusion into parental rights.“Where is Kentucky’s compelling government interest in not letting a parent protect their own children’s safety and happiness?” Miller said.He said his grandchild, from a young age, focused on “dolls, not balls” and started dressing like a girl.“I hoped he would grow out of it, but that has not happened,"" Miller said. ""Do I wish he were a ‘normal boy’? Absolutely yes. I still screw up the pronoun thing, but regardless of anything, I’m going to love my grandchild and fight for what I think is best for (her).”Supporters say the intent is to protect children from medical decisions that would be irreversible.“I don’t think this bill could be strong enough,"" said Republican Sen. Lindsey Tichenor. ""We’re talking about irreparable, permanent changes to a child. Their brains are not developed ... They have no idea what the consequences could be until they get to that age, and at that point you cannot undo what is being done.”",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835395,AP sources: Raiders set to trade Darren Waller to Giants,"HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Tight end Darren Waller is being traded to the New York Giants, who will send the Las Vegas Raiders a 2023 third-round draft pick, two people familiar with the deal said Tuesday.They spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity because the trade has not been announced. One person said the Giants will send the Raiders their No. 100 overall selection, which was acquired from the Kansas City Chiefs in the deal for wide receiver Kadarius Toney.Waller, who made the Pro Bowl in 2020 gives Giants quarterback Daniel Jones a major playmaker and an upgrade at tight end. Last year's starter, Daniel Bellinger, caught 30 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns.Waller twice has surpassed 1,000 receiving yards, in 2019 and 2020, before injuries cut into his production the past two seasons. In 2022, Waller caught 28 passes for 388 yards and three TDs, missing eight games because of a hamstring injury.The trade for Waller, 30, is an effort to boost the Giants' offensive talent around Jones, who last season passed for 3,205 yards and 15 touchdowns with five interceptions. Jones agreed to a four-year, $160 million extension this offseason. New York didn't have any receivers top 60 catches of 800 yards.For the Raiders, their acquisition of wide receiver Jakobi Meyers on Tuesday helped make Waller expendable. Meyers agreed to a three-year, $33 million deal, a person familiar with the contract told The AP, giving Las Vegas a player who averaged 70 catches and 800 yards receiving over the past three seasons.Now the Raiders' offense includes quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, running back Josh Jacobs and receivers Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow and Meyers. The Raiders agreed to a deal with Garoppolo on Monday and placed the franchise tag on Jacobs on March 6.More changes could be coming. Trading Waller allows the Raiders to free up about $11 million in salary cap space. They have $26.4 million in cap space, according to overthecap.com.Waller was traded just 10 days after marrying Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum.NOTE: The Giants have re-signed running back Matt Breida. He was the backup to Saquon Barkley. Breida had 54 carries for 220 yards and a touchdown last season.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi and AP Sports Writer Tom Canavan contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835397,City of Wichita settles fatal SWAT shooting for $5 million,"The city of Wichita on Tuesday approved a $5 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by the family of a man who was shot and killed by a police officer during a hoax call in 2017.The settlement will go to the two children of 28-year-old Andrew Finch, who was shot by officer Justin Rapp as he stepped out of his house on Dec. 28, 2017, to see why it was surrounded by police.Finch, who was unarmed, was shot by Rapp within 10 seconds of opening his door. Rapp has said that he thought Finch had a gun.Finch's death drew national attention to “swatting,” a form of retaliation in which someone reports a false emergency to get authorities, particularly a SWAT team, to respond to an address.“While this settlement will not bring back our beloved Andy, it helps bring some closure as our family moves forward, especially Andy’s two young children,” Lisa and Dominica Finch, Finch’s mother and sister, respectively, said in a statement.Investigators later determined the call was the result of a feud between two online gamers over a video game, Shane Gaskill of Wichita and Ohio gamer Casey Viner.Authorities said Viner recruited Tyler R. Barriss to “swat” Gaskill. Barriss, a Los Angeles man who was known online for “swatting,” called police from Los Angeles to falsely report a shooting and kidnapping at the Wichita address.But the address they used was old, leading police to Finch, who was not involved in the dispute or playing the video game.Barriss is serving 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts in April 2019. Viner was sentenced to 15 months in September 2019 after pleading guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Shane Gaskill was sentenced in September 2022 to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud,Rapp was not charged and was later promoted from officer to detective. The city was dropped from the lawsuit but was responsible for Rapp's legal costs.The city will pay $2 million from its self-insurance fund and $1.5 million from the city council’s reserve fund, with AIG insurance paying the remainder of the settlement.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835398,"Five years after Rio councilwoman slain, questions and hope","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Relatives and supporters gathered Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to mark five years since the assassination of Black, bisexual city councilwoman Marielle Franco amid hope that investigations into her death will accelerate under Brazil’s new leftist president.“It has been five years of pain, suffering, hope and questions without answers. Half a decade is a long time,” Marinete da Silva, the slain councilwoman's mother, told reporters after the inauguration of an 11-meter (36-foot) cutout of her daughter at the Rio Art Museum downtown.Known universally by her first name, Marielle is depicted wearing a flowered dress, and the figure represents her towering legacy, da Silva said.Marielle won election in 2016 to the city council, where she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs, particularly in favelas like the one where she was born and raised. The rising political star and her driver were killed on the evening of March 14, 2018, while returning from an event to empower young Black women.Since then, she has become a martyr and symbol of left-wing resistance. Her silhouette can be found printed on T-shirts and painted on walls nationwide, and even abroad.Two former police officers, accused of carrying out the double murder, are in jail awaiting trial. But central questions about the case remain: Who ordered Marielle’s killing, and what were their motives?Marielle’s father, Antônio Francisco da Silva Neto, said former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro didn’t make a concerted effort to solve the case. He believes justice finally may be served since Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva became president in January.“We wouldn’t have any hope if President Lula hadn’t been elected,” he told reporters.Lula has strived to honor Marielle’s memory and to expedite investigations. On International Women’s Day, on March 8, he sent a bill to Congress to transform March 14 into a day named for Marielle and focused on combating gender- and race-based political violence.On Tuesday, Lula and his Cabinet ministers stood for a minute of silence. Marielle’s sister Anielle Franco, who is Lula’s minister of racial equality, wiped away tears.“It’s very important for us as a family ... to have a government that is concerned about the case and it has, ever more, shown itself willing to collaborate, so we can discover who ordered my sister’s killing,” Anielle Franco said.At Lula’s request, Justice Minister Flávio Dino has instructed the Federal Police to open an investigation running parallel to the one conducted by Rio’s state authorities. The case has passed through the hands of several state public prosecutors and several lead detectives.Mônica Benício, Marielle’s widow who has since been elected to Rio’s city council herself, said Lula’s defeat of Bolsonaro in last October’s election has changed everything.“The previous government never showed respect for Marielle’s memory nor any commitment to shine light on the case,” Benício told reporters in front of the Rio Art Museum.Speaking to reporters in Rio yesterday, Dino said he has held meetings with state authorities to share information and that the Federal Police investigation is advancing. Later the same day, he visited the Mare favela where Marielle grew up.On Tuesday, Amnesty International also opened an exhibition across the square from the massive cutout of Marielle. It consists of three panels, the first of which asks passersby to leave a note with something that happened to them in the last five years, and the other two panels cataloging events that occurred during that time.“The idea is to show that in five years a lot has happened in everyone’s lives – people got married, changed jobs. But there hasn’t been justice,” Jurema Werneck, director of Amnesty International in Brazil, told The Associated Press. “Many different authorities have been involved, but they make promises they don’t keep.”After the inaugurations of the cutout and panels, Marielle’s family and a handful of supporters made their way to a modest church nearby for a Mass held in her memory and attended by about 100 people. Draped across the carpet on the front steps leading to the altar was a yellow cloth bearing her silhouette.Some of the attendees held sunflowers in their hands, and many wore shirts with Marielle’s image or slogans such as “Fight like Marielle Franco” and “Who ordered the death of Marielle?”“Alongside Marielle’s family, and everyone not only in Rio de Janeiro, but in the world, we will receive the answers we need so that all this can be concluded, with the peace of mind that injustice will never prevail,” Father Luciano Basílio told the crowd.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835399,Judge OKs release of Baltimore church sex abuse report,"BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Tuesday granted the Maryland Attorney General’s Office permission to publicly release a redacted version of an investigative report detailing sex abuse allegations against more than 150 Roman Catholic priests and examining the Archdiocese of Baltimore’s response.Officials declined to provide a timeline for when the release would take place.Completed last year by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, the report has remained under seal because it contains information obtained from church officials via grand jury subpoenas, proceedings that are confidential in Maryland. But lawyers for the state asked the court for permission to release their findings, and Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Robert Taylor ruled last month that a redacted version should be made public.The next step was for Taylor to review a list of proposed redactions, which he approved Tuesday. Once the attorney general has made those redactions, his office can release the report.According to earlier court filings, the nearly 500-page document identifies 158 priests accused of abusing more than 600 victims over the past 80 years. The attorney general’s investigation was launched in 2019.In his previous ruling, Taylor said releasing the report is in the interest of justice, partly because the “only form of justice that may now be available is a public reckoning.” He gave the attorney general a March 13 deadline to submit a list of proposed redactions.“The need for disclosure outweighs the need for secrecy,” Taylor wrote.He also said Maryland legislators should be able to consider the report’s contents during the ongoing state legislative session, which ends April 10.Lawmakers are currently considering whether to end the state’s statute of limitations for when civil lawsuits can be filed against institutions related to child sexual abuse. Currently, victims of child sex abuse in Maryland can’t sue after they turn 38. Other proposals to do away with the age limit have failed to become law in recent years, but the issue has received renewed attention this session.The judge told prosecutors to entirely redact the names and titles of 37 people from the report before releasing it. The court will then contact those individuals, allow them to review certain sections of the report and finally, consider whether to remove the redactions and release a more complete version in the future. Taylor also told the attorney general to rephrase some pieces of the report to avoid identifying 60 other people.Another 91 individuals have since died, so their names need not be redacted, Taylor ruled, as well as those identified through a means other than grand jury proceedings. Many accused priests named in the report have been previously publicly identified by the Baltimore Archdiocese.In a statement Tuesday, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said his office was pleased with the judge’s ruling.“We will work to complete the court-ordered redactions and release the report as expeditiously as possible,” he said.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835400,Hurricanes' Andrei Svechnikov out for season with torn ACL,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Hurricanes forward Andrei Svechnikov is out for the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs because of a torn ligament in his right knee, a significant blow for a Stanley Cup contender.The team announced Svechnikov would undergo reconstruction surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament Thursday at Raleigh Orthopaedic. He was injured Saturday night in a loss to Vegas.The Hurricanes already said Svechnikov would be out indefinitely with the knee injury but had been hoping for a better diagnosis.“No easy way to say it,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour told reporters earlier Tuesday before the team announced Svechnikov’s status. “Hate it for him more than anything. He’s worked so hard to get to this point of the year, when it’s fun.“And he’s not going to be able to be a part of it here going forward. So it’s tough.”In a statement, team president and general manager Don Waddell said the team is confident the No. 2 overall draft pick from 2018 would make a complete recovery.Losing Svechnikov is a crushing blow to Carolina in a loaded Eastern Conference, with the Hurricanes spending much of the year second only to Boston in the overall league standings.The 22-year-old top-line forward is tied for second on the team with 55 points and third with 23 goals. He has been a critical piece of Carolina’s four consecutive playoff berths, starting with a run to the Eastern Conference finals in Svechnikov’s rookie year.Carolina's playoff run has included division titles in each of the past two seasons, though a lack of scoring depth has been a factor in earlier-than-expected postseason exits the past two seasons.They addressed that in the offseason by acquiring winger Max Pacioretty in July, but Pacioretty tore his right Achilles tendon over the summer then did it again a few games into his debut with Carolina in January. They avoided major changes to their lineup at the trade deadline earlier this month.The Hurricanes had won 16 of 19 before being outscored 7-0 in their past two games. And entering Tuesday's home game against Winnipeg, their once-comfortable lead atop the Metropolitan Division has been reduced to a tie in standings points (94) with the New Jersey Devils, who are only in second place because they've played one more game.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835401,AP source: 49ers agree to 4-year deal with C Jake Brendel,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers agreed to a contract extension Tuesday with starting center Jake Brendel before he could hit the open market.A person familiar with the deal said on condition of anonymity that Brendel will sign a four-year contract with the Niners instead of becoming an unrestricted free agent on Wednesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the deal.NFL Network first reported the agreement and said it had a maximum value of $20 million and includes $8 million in guarantees.After spending most of his first six seasons in the NFL as a backup, Brendel took over as the starter in San Francisco and helped stabilize the interior of the offensive line.He started all 17 games in the regular season and three more in the playoffs. He allowed just one sack and 14 pressures, ranking tied for fourth best in pass blocking efficiency, according to Pro Football Focus.Brendel originally entered the NFL with Dallas as an undrafted free agent out of UCLA in 2016. He spent his first four years bouncing around from Dallas, Miami, Denver and Baltimore, playing 21 games with three starts for the Dolphins in 2018.Brendel signed with the Niners in 2020 and opted out of that season because of COVID-19. He returned as a backup in 2021 before taking over as starter last season.The deal with Brendel means San Francisco will have four starters returning on the offensive line with All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams and guards Aaron Banks and Spencer Burford.The only hole is at right tackle where Mike McGlinchey needs to be replaced. Colton McKivitz signed a two-year contract last week to remain with the Niners and could be in the mix there.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

It will also bring out the best in all of us — in effect, a combination of genius, creativity, experience, and means.”Morocco committed to taking part in the 2030 contest more than four years ago, immediately after losing the vote for the 2026 tournament. It was in talks with the Iberian nations for a while but had never been officially included in the bid.Spain and Portugal were joined last October in their longstanding European candidacy by Ukraine, which is not likely to remain in the bid.The Spanish soccer federation did not immediately confirm Morocco in the bid, saying the federations from the three nations would meet Wednesday in Rwanda before announcing any possible changes.Morocco, which finished in a stunning fourth place at the World Cup in Qatar, hosted FIFA's Club World Cup in February.The 2030 World Cup hosts are expected to be picked in September next year. The co-hosting bids from South America and Europe have been the expected favorites, with speculation about a Saudi-led and unprecedented three-continent project.The inaugural 1930 World Cup host, Uruguay, is part of a centenary bid with Argentina, Chile and Paraguay.The United States, Canada and Mexico are hosting the 2026 tournament.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835403,"AP source: Vikings convert Cousins bonus, clear $16M off cap","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings cleared the necessary space from their salary cap the day before the start of free agency, with a big boost from a contract restructure for quarterback Kirk Cousins.This time, the Vikings held off on another commitment.The Vikings reached an agreement with Cousins on Tuesday to change bonus language in his existing contract that saved them $16 million in cap charges for 2023, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiation. The person confirmed the deal to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not announce it.The Vikings also reached agreements to bring back center Garrett Bradbury, long snapper Andrew DePaola, kicker Greg Joseph and backup quarterback Nick Mullens, before they were due to hit the open market as unrestricted free agents at the beginning of the new league year on Wednesday.Cousins will enter his sixth season with the Vikings, who have yet to signal their interest in keeping him beyond that. Owner and president Mark Wilf did not directly answer a question this week during an NFL Network interview about what the future holds for Cousins in Minnesota.“Kirk's an outstanding quarterback. He's done a great job for us this past season. I think with Kevin O'Connell, he took our offense to the next level. So we're looking for great things in ‘23, and Kirk’s going to be our leader on the offense,” Wilf said.Recently at the NFL combine, general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said Cousins meets that threshold of being a quality and proven starting quarterback.“How long does he meet that threshold? Those are things we’ve got to answer. Is there a chance to add somebody maybe with different skill sets? Those are all questions we’ve got to answer,” Adofo-Mensah said.The Vikings also added two more voidable years to Cousins' deal as part of the bonus conversion to spread out the money as much as they could. He'll still make $30 million in 2023, including a $10 million base salary, but his cap charge will now be $20.25 million. That includes prorations from two different bonuses.So while Cousins now has four automatically voidable years after this on his deal, those are merely accounting mechanisms. He remains on an expiring contract, set to hit the market in 2024, unless the two sides strike an extension sometime in the coming year.The Vikings gained cap relief in 2020 and 2022 with extensions for Cousins, who first signed with the Vikings in 2018 as a free agent on a fully guaranteed $84 million deal.Cousins had a $20 million roster bonus due next week, but this conversion and the accompanying addition of two more void years allowed the Vikings to spread that money evenly on their cap at $4 million annually over five years. The extension Cousins got a year ago came with a $25 million signing bonus and two void years to spread that money evenly at $6.25 million from 2022-25.The Vikings dived into the open market on Monday by reaching agreements with tight end Josh Oliver and defensive end Marcus Davenport.Bradbury's return on a three-year, $15.75 million deal, according to NFL Network, will retain the entire starting offensive line. The Vikings last year declined the fifth-year option on Bradbury's contract and will now have him coming off his most effective season at a more cap-friendly price.The return of DePaola and Joseph — a deal announced by his agent, Brett Tessler — will keep the team's kicking game specialist trio intact for once after several years of turnover. DePaola was an All-Pro last season. Rookie punter Ryan Wright also had a solid debut.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835404,Injuries change dynamic heading into women's March Madness,"Athletes and coaches aren't the only ones putting in extra time this week to help their teams get ready for the NCAA Tournament.Doctors and trainers are playing a big role, with injuries leaving question marks on several top teams. A look at which programs could have their championship dreams impacted by missing or returning players this March:NOTRE DAMEThe Fighting Irish (25-5) won the ACC regular-season title but lost star Olivia Miles to a right knee injury in their Feb. 26 win over Louisville. Miles, who was averaging 14.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists, missed both of her team's games in the ACC Tournament and her return is uncertain.The No. 3-seeded Notre Dame, which faces Southern Utah (23-9) in the opening round, already had lost fifth-year guard Dara Mabrey to a torn ACL and tibial plateau fracture in her right knee during a Jan. 22 win over Virginia.Notre Dame's tournament hopes may well depend on when Miles can return and how effective she can be once she does.""She’s gonna be with the doctors a little bit more this week, but she is progressing,"" coach Niele Ivey told reporters on Sunday.UCONNUConn’s prospects to earn a 15th straight trip to the Final Four suffered a major blow before the season began when national player of the year Paige Bueckers and incoming freshman Ice Brady both went down with season-ending knee injuries.The No. 2-seeded Huskies (29-5) then lost leading scorer Azzi Fudd for 22 games with two separate knee injuries and guard Caroline Ducharme for 13 games with a concussion. Only two Huskies, Lou Lopez Senechal and Aaliyah Edwards, have played every game this season.Fudd, who was averaging just under 18 points before being hurt, and Ducharme, a 3-point threat, both returned to help the Huskies cruise through the Big East Tournament, though neither was in top form: Fudd averaged just 8.3 points over the three games and Ducharme scored a total of four points.UConn, which faces Vermont (25-6) on Saturday, hopes that like last year, when Bueckers returned from a knee injury just before the postseason, the return of Ducharme and Fudd can help propel the Huskies back into title contention.IOWA STATEThe Cyclones (22-9) won the Big 12 Tournament despite being without injured post player Stephanie Soares. The 6-foot-6 forward tore the ACL in her left knee during a Jan. 8 loss to Oklahoma.Soares, twice the NAIA player of the year before transferring from Master’s University, had been averaging 14.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game through 13 games.Coach Bill Fennelly is hoping the NCAA will give Soares an extra year for Iowa State.In the meantime, the fifth-seeded Cyclones will have to rely on one of the nation's top players, Ashley Joens, to help them make it to Texas for the Final Four. Joens, a 3,000-point scorer for her career, had 28 points and 10 rebounds in Iowa State's win over Texas for the league title.The Cyclones play Toledo (28-4) in the opening round.TEXASThe Big 12 regular-season champion Longhorns (25-9) are another team looking to bounce back from a slew of injuries.Players who were part of the Texas rotation missed a total of 45 regular-season games. The biggest loss came when 6-foot-1 forward Aaliyah Moore went down with an ACL tear on Dec. 13. The sophomore had started every game before the injury, averaging 11.2 points and 4.8 rebounds.Sonya Morris (quad) and Ndjakalenga Mwenentanda (ankle) also are banged up, but coach Vic Shafer expects to have both of them back when the No. 4 seed takes on East Carolina (23-9) in the opening round.Forward Taylor Jones is back from a lower-body injury that kept the Oregon State transfer out for nine games late in the season. She also missed 21 games with a shoulder injury last year for the Beavers.NORTH CAROLINA STATENorth Carolina State (20-11) is a No. 7 seed after losing to Notre Dame in the ACC Tournament.The Wolfpack were missing guard Diamond Johnson, who has been bothered by a right ankle injury that also cost her seven regular-season games. Johnson, who leads the Wolfpack in scoring (12.3 points) and assists (3.5 per game), hasn't played since Feb. 16.She was held out to give her ankle more time to heal and could be back for the opening-round game against Ivy League champion Princeton (23-5).INDIANAThe top-seeded Hoosiers may have to play at least their first weekend of the tournament without reserve forward Kiandra Browne, who suffered a hip injury in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals. Browne had to leave the floor in a wheelchair.The Hoosiers ended up losing in the semifinals to Ohio State, blowing a 24-point halftime lead.The 6-foot-2 forward has not been a big part of Indiana’s success this year. A thumb injury limited her to just 10 minutes in seven games this year after appearing in 30 a year ago.Coach Teri Moren told reporters on Sunday that Browne’s injury is to the hip muscles and may take a “couple of weeks” to heal.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835405,14-year sentence for ex-cop who molested teen rape victim,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A former New Orleans police officer was sentenced Tuesday to 14 years in federal prison for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who was already a rape victim.Federal prosecutors said Rodney Vicknair was a police officer in 2020 when he escorted a then-14-year-old victim to a hospital for a rape examination after she was assaulted by another man. Prosecutors said Vicknair offered to become the girl’s friend and mentor and often showed up at her house unannounced.But in time, according to court documents, he began making comments to her that were sexual in nature, eventually persuading her to send him sexually explicit pictures of herself that he kept on his phone. And on Sept. 23, 2020, when the girl was 15, he showed up at her house and told her to get into his truck. When she was in the passenger seat, Vicknair locked the door, leaned over her and “intentionally touched her genitals under her clothing,"" according to a Justice Department news release and court records.Initially arrested on state charges that included sexual battery, Vicknair pleaded guilty in federal court to deprivation of rights under color of law.U.S. District Judge Lance Africk rejected an initial plea agreement carrying a 7-year sentence. On Tuesday, he sentenced Vicknair to 14 years, according to court records.“We are grateful to this young survivor for coming forward, even though she thought no one would believe her,” Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a news release.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835420,Mitchell feeling pressure of Masters as he tries to get in,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Sometimes the Masters can generate enormous pressure for a player who still doesn't have a spot in the field. That's what Keith Mitchell is feeling.He came into The Players Championship at No. 47 in the world, knowing Augusta National will take the top 50 in two weeks after the Match Play. He felt he was playing well, with a tie for fourth at Pebble Beach and a fifth-place finish at Riviera.And then he made bogey from the middle of the fairway on the par-5 ninth at the TPC Sawgrass that he thought would cause him to miss the cut. Instead, Luke List made double bogey, which allowed Mitchell two more rounds.He had a 68-70 weekend and tied for 35th. He stayed at No. 47 and couldn't help but wonder what could have been.“I three-putted the last hole and made two bogeys from the middle of the fairway with a wedge,” Mitchell said. “Those are the things that make you finish 30th or 40th instead of continuing to climb the leaderboard. Just silly mistakes.""From a probable missed cut to a tie for 35th, he said he was “decently satisfied.” What he needs is a little more freedom, which can be hard to find when the Masters means that much.“Being 47th in the world, trying to get into Augusta, I put a lot of extra pressure on myself and I think it showed,"" he said Sunday. “I didn't play like I thought I was playing. The three-putt on the last hole could be a deal-breaker. But we still have Austin to play well.”Mitchell has played five of the last six weeks and is taking a break. The final event to stay in the top 50 is the Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas, next week. The ranking points will be strong. Then again, everyone around him will be there. Getting out of group stage likely would be crucial.Mitchell has been in this spot before. He went into the FedEx Cup playoffs last season at No. 37, knowing the top 30 who advance to the Tour Championship get into the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and, except in rare circumstances, the PGA Championship.He finished just outside the top 30 in both playoff events and finished his season at No. 39 in the FedEx Cup.“I know we’re always trying to play our best, but this one felt like a little more pressure,"" he said. ""Whether that came from the extra thought of trying to make the Masters? Could be.”THE ELITE TOURThe PGA Tour set a new landscape that provides the richest tournaments (eight of them with no cuts) for the top 50 in the FedEx Cup. That starts with being among the top 70 who reach the postseason. And while nine elevated events remain, it might not be long before some players start to feel the pressure.U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who played only once in the fall because of his European tour schedule, has missed three cuts in his last five starts and is No. 92.Cameron Young is at No. 79 while Will Zalatoris, who is returning from a back injury that knocked him out of the BMW Championship last year, is at No. 85. Zalatoris only has one top 10 since his return this year.Jordan Spieth has top 10s in Phoenix and Bay Hill, tied for 19th in The Players Championship and needed that just to move to No. 65. He is one spot ahead of Justin Thomas, who played once in the fall (he got married) and has finished inside the top 20 only once this year.All of them have four majors and plenty of tournaments ahead of them. But there is only a little more than four months left in the season.LIV AND THE OWGRLIV Golf returns to competition this week still without acceptance into the Official World Golf Ranking system, and the numbers keep falling. If it ever does get ranking points for its 54-hole events with a 48-man league, the climb back keeps getting taller.The latest example is Brooks Koepka, a four-time major champion who fell outside the top 100 in the world for the first time since October 2013. Since joining LIV, Koepka has played in three OWGR events — he missed the cut at the British Open and an Asian Tour stop in Oman, and he tied for 46th in the Saudi International.Going into this week's Arizona tournament, LIV Golf has one player from the top 25 (Cameron Smith at No. 5), six in the top 50 and 17 from the top 100. Six of those players are at No. 75 and lower.Paul Casey is No. 94 and certain to be out of the top 100 before long. That's relevant because the PGA Championship in May has a category for players from the previous Ryder Cup team provided they remain in the top 100 in the world.LPGA DEADLINEThe LPGA Tour resumes next week in Arizona, and then it has one tournament in Los Angeles before the deadline to qualify for the International Crown.Jennifer Kupcho and Yuka Saso are among those on both sides of the bubble.The event is among the best new formats in golf over the last 10 years — eight countries of four players competing with a combination of fourballs and foursomes and singles. It will be played May 4-7 at Harding Park.The eight countries were confirmed after last season — the United States, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, England, China, Sweden and Australia. The four players are determined by the world ranking through the LA Open on April 2.Lilia Vu winning the Honda LPGA Thailand moved her into position. She now is No. 11 in the world for the third spot on the U.S. team, three spots ahead of Danielle Kang. Kupcho, who won her first major last year, is at No. 18 and has work to do.Saso won the U.S. Women's Open two years ago playing for the Philippines and now competes for Japan. She is No. 33 in the world and has the fourth spot, just ahead of Mao Saigo, who is at No. 34. Saigo plays the Japan LPGA, is in the field this week and there are two more events after the cutoff.Australia will come down to Sarah Kemp (170) and Grace Kim (179), while the final three spots for Thailand are among five players from No. 68 to No. 91.DIVOTSFive players earned $1 million or more at The Players Championship with its $25 million purse, up from three players a year ago at $20 million. ...

(AP) — Two days into free agency and all the focus for the Seattle Seahawks has been on the defensive line.Seattle brought back a familiar face on Tuesday agreeing to a two-year deal with defensive tackle Jarran Reed, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because deals can’t be announced until the new league year begins on Wednesday. The deal is worth up to $10.8 million. NFL Network first reported the agreement.Reed, 30, is reuniting with the team he spent the first five seasons with after being drafted in the second round in 2016 by the Seahawks. Reed was released by Seattle after the 2020 season and spent 2021 with Kansas City and last season in Green Bay. Reed had a career-high 52 tackles with the Packers starting 14 of 17 games last season.Reed’s best overall season came in 2018 when he had 50 tackles and 10½ sacks for the Seahawks.Reed is the second deal for Seattle on the defensive line after reaching agreement with Dre’Mont Jones on a three-year deal that is worth up to $51 million on Monday.Seattle also did some housekeeping on the defensive line by releasing veterans Shelby Harris and Quinton Jefferson earlier Tuesday, clearing more than $13 million in salary cap space before the start of the new league year.An overhaul of Seattle's defensive front was expected this offseason and the moves to date show that is likely to be the case. The deals with Jones and Reed can't be announced until the new league year begins on Wednesday, but look to be upgrades at defensive tackle for Seattle.Harris and Jefferson both played well for Seattle last year but their combined salaries made them obvious candidates to be released. Harris was part of Seattle’s return in the trade that sent Russell Wilson to Denver last offseason.Harris, 31, started 15 games, had 44 tackles and two sacks, and had the chance to participate in the playoffs for the first time in his career. The release of Harris saves Seattle $8.9 million against the cap.Jefferson, 29, played nearly 50% of the defensive snaps in his second stint with Seattle despite not being a starter. Jefferson finished the season with 29 tackles and 5½ sacks. His released saved nearly $4.5 million in salary cap space.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

German federal prosecutors confirmed that a boat was searched in January but have not confirmed the reported findings.Putin rejected the notion as “sheer nonsense.”""Such an explosion, so powerful and at such depth, could only be conducted by experts backed by the entire potential of a state that has relevant technologies,” he said in televised remarks.The Russian leader insisted that the U.S. had a motive to stage the explosion, saying it wanted to halt supplies of cheap Russian natural gas to Germany and to provide it with more expensive liquefied natural gas.The Kremlin last week described the claims about Ukrainian involvement in the explosions as part of a cover-up by the West.Putin on Tuesday poured scorn on European leaders for keeping quiet about the incident, charging that their attitude reflected what he described as Europe's subservient position in relation to the U.S.“The Europeans have lost a gene of independence, sovereignty and national interest,” Putin said with a smirk. “The more they hit them on their noses or the top of their heads the lower they bend and the broader they smile.”September's explosions that hit the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines rendered them inoperable and caused significant leaks of gas that was idle in the pipelines. No one claimed responsibility.U.S. officials initially suggested that Russia may have been to blame. Russia blamed the U.S. and Britain. Investigations by European nations, including Denmark, through whose waters the pipeline travels, and Germany have yet to yield conclusive results.Putin voiced regret that Russia has been denied access to the materials of the probe. He added that the Russian Gazprom natural gas giant has sent a vessel to check the seabed near the explosion and spotted what appeared to be an antenna near a junction between the pipes about 30 kilometers (about 16 nautical miles) away from the explosion site.Putin alleged that the purported antenna could have been put on the seabed to trigger another explosive device that didn't detonate for some reason that remains unclear, adding that Russia expects Danish authorities to form a joint team to thoroughly check the area.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835423,NASA Webb telescope captures star on cusp of death,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The Webb Space Telescope has captured the rare and fleeting phase of a star on the cusp of death.NASA released the picture Tuesday at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.The observation was among the first made by Webb following its launch in late 2021. Its infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge, hot star 15,000 light-years away. A light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles.Shimmering in purple like a cherry blossom, the cast-off material once comprised the star's outer layer. The Hubble Space Telescope snapped a shot of the same transitioning star a few decades ago, but it appeared more like a fireball without the delicate details.Such a transformation occurs only with some stars and normally is the last step before they explode, going supernova, according to scientists.“We’ve never seen it like that before. It’s really exciting,” said Macarena Garcia Marin, a European Space Agency scientist who is part of the project.This star in the constellation Sagitta, officially known as WR 124, is 30 times as massive as our sun and already has shed enough material to account for 10 suns, according to NASA.___This story was first published on March 14, 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835428,US Rep. Santos files paperwork for possible reelection bid,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Rep. George Santos filed paperwork Tuesday indicating his intent to run for reelection, even as he faces calls to resign amid ongoing criminal and ethics investigations into lies he told while running for office.The filing with the Federal Election Commission does not necessarily mean that Santos will run for a second term, but it allows his campaign committees to continue raising money, some of which could be used to pay future legal bills. Money he raises could also be used to repay more than $700,000 that he claimed to have loaned his campaign.The New York Republican has admitted to lying about having Jewish ancestry, a Wall Street background, college degrees and a history as a star volleyball player. But serious questions about his finances have also surfaced — including the source of what he claimed was a quickly amassed fortune despite recent financial problems, including evictions and owing thousands of dollars in back rent.Santos, 34, has referred to the fabrications as harmless embellishments of his resume.Pressure on him to resign surfaced almost immediately after the New York Times uncovered inconsistencies in his public record. Fellow New York Republicans have demanded that he resign, saying he had betrayed voters and his own party with his lies.Santos has also been dogged by lingering legal questions.In 2017, he was charged with criminal theft in Pennsylvania in connection with bad checks apparently used to buy puppies from dog breeders, according to a lawyer who said she helped the Republican with the case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835429,Mets' Quintana out until at least July with rib injury,"Left-hander José Quintana won’t make his New York Mets debut until at least July because of a stress fracture in his rib.The Mets are relieved that the prognosis wasn’t even more severe.Mets general manager Billy Eppler told reporters Tuesday a scan revealed a lesion on the impacted rib. Quintana went to New York to visit an orthopedic tumor specialist for a biopsy and additional scans that revealed the lesion was benign.“This was bigger than baseball,” Eppler said. “José’s got our support and anything he needs. I’m just really thankful we’re at least here as opposed to one of the other potential outcomes.”Eppler said Quintana will have an operation Friday in New York that involves a bone graft. Eppler said recovery from the surgery will keep Quintana out until at least July 1 but didn’t offer any specifics beyond that.“A lot will depend on if José, how soon he can do physical activity, how much down time does he need after this procedure,” Eppler said. “Does he need to take a week, or 10 days or two weeks before he can run. Because it’s a fairly involved surgery. Whenever you’re doing a bone graft, it’s going to hurt. That’s why it’s hard to set a specific timetable.”The 34-year-old Quintana signed a $26 million, two-year contract with the Mets in December after going 6-7 with a 2.93 ERA in 32 starts with Pittsburgh and St. Louis last season. He is 89-87 with a 3.75 ERA.Candidates to fill Quintana’s rotation spot include left-hander David Peterson and right-hander Tylor Megill. Peterson, 27, went 7-5 with a 3.83 ERA last season in 28 appearances, including 19 starts. Megill, also 27, was 4-2 with a 5.13 ERA in 15 games, including nine starts.Peterson has struck out nine in eight shutout innings this spring training. Megill has worked 8 1/3 innings and has a 1.08 ERA with six strikeouts.“Obviously it sucks to see one of your teammates go down with that, and I hope he gets back as quick as he can and healthy for the most part,” Peterson told reporters after he threw four hitless innings Tuesday. “But I think that has been kind of the thing all along. The front office and the coaching staff have wanted to have starting pitching depth. They made it a priority. So I guess this is kind of where it comes in handy, to have guys to choose from.”NATS' CAVALLI LEAVES GAME EARLYWashington Nationals right-hander Cade Cavalli left his Tuesday start after 2 2/3 innings. Nationals manager Dave Martinez told reporters afterward that Cavalli felt something behind his throwing elbow.Cavalli is expected to have an MRI on Wednesday.The Nationals selected Cavalli out of Oklahoma with the 22nd overall pick in the 2020 draft. The 24-year-old is regarded as one of the Nationals' top prospects.BRAVES OPTION ANDERSON, ELDERThe Atlanta Braves optioned right-handers Ian Anderson and Bryce Elder to Triple-A Gwinnett. Both players had been competing for the fifth spot in the Braves’ starting rotation.Anderson, 24, had a promising start to his career but went 10-6 with a 5.00 ERA in 22 starts last season and was sent to the minors in early August.Anderson went 3-2 with a 1.95 ERA in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and followed that up by going 9-5 with a 3.58 ERA while making 24 starts in 2021. He had a 4-0 record with a 1.26 ERA in eight postseason starts from 2020-21.He was the winning pitcher in the Braves’ 2-0 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 3 of the 2021 World Series and had a no-hitter going when he was removed after five innings.METS RETURN GREENE TO YANKEESThe Mets returned right-handed pitcher Zach Greene to the New York Yankees three months after taking him in the winter meeting draft of unprotected players.The Yankees assigned him to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.Greene, 26, went 9-0 with a 3.42 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 68 1/3 innings for Scranton last season.TIGERS CLAIM PACHECOThe Detroit Tigers claimed right-hander Freddy Pacheco off waivers from the Cardinals.Pacheco, who turns 25 on April 17, went 3-7 with a 3.05 ERA and 84 strikeouts in 62 innings at Double-A and Triple-A last season.St. Louis scratched infielder Paul DeJong from their lineup Tuesday due to lower back tightness.ORIOLES SEND HOLLIDAY TO MINOR-LEAGUE CAMPThe Baltimore Orioles reassigned shortstop Jackson Holliday, the No. 1 pick in the 2022 draft, to their minor-league camp.Holliday, 19, has shown plenty of promise this spring.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835431,Orioles ask New York's top court to toss out payment to Nats,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The long-running fight between the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals over television rights fees reached New York's highest court Tuesday when a lawyer for the Orioles argued a $296.8 million award for 2012-16 made by a panel of baseball executives should be thrown out and the case reheard by a different forum.Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer for the Nationals, told the six judges of the New York Court of Appeals they should affirm the decision, as New York Supreme Court Justice Joel M. Cohen did in 2019 and an appellate panel did the following year. Shaffer predicted additional litigation between the teams in a dispute that could hold up a potential sale of the Nationals, which said last April they were exploring the marketplace.“Potential disputes that your honor is alluding to are ones that will be litigated, as this case has been litigated, until kingdom come by my friends for the other side,"" Shaffer said. “So I think that is a recipe for just having this litigation continue and continue in a never-ending fashion as opposed to having one chapter of this at long last more than a decade later conclude.""MASN, which is controlled by the Orioles, paid the Nationals for 2012-16 what Baltimore proposed: $197.5 million. Washington argued it should be paid $475 million.An arbitration panel of baseball executives — Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly, Tampa Bay Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon — heard the case in 2012 and ruled in 2014 that the Nationals were owed $298.1 million.The Orioles appealed, and that decision was thrown out in 2015 by New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence K. Marks, who ruled that a law firm representing the Nationals was conflicted because it had worked for clubs of executives on the panel. The appellate division sent the case back to baseball to be heard by a reconstituted Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee.A second panel of baseball executives — Milwaukee Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio, Seattle Mariners President Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro — ordered the slightly lower payment of $296.8 million. The Orioles argue that the process remained tainted and should be decided by a different forum.“At some point, the commissioner of Major League Baseball reached the conclusion that the Orioles should lose this case,” Carter G. Phillips, a lawyer for the Orioles, told the court. “By the end of the proceeding, the first proceeding, which was an evidently partial proceeding, his view was the Orioles should lose. And he has said that over and over and over again. So that partiality continues on to this day, and this court should not blink at it.”Justices seemed unsure what power the court had to order the dispute to an arbitration forum other than the RSDC specified in the agreement between the Baltimore and Washington teams that allowed the Montreal Expos to move and become the Nationals for the 2005 season. Some questioned whether the agreement set up what amounted more to an appraisal process than an arbitration.“This is not a problem of a single arbitrator. This is a problem of MLB and of the entire institution,"" Phillips said. ""First and second of all, there was no question what the second arbitration award was going to look like. It’s within .02% of the first award. You can reverse engineer from the number.""___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

I got big footsteps to follow,” Ryan Redington wrote in his race biography. He previously won the Junior Iditarod in 1999 and 2000. His father, Raymie, is a 10-time Iditarod finisher.Redington, who is Inupiat, becomes the sixth Alaska Native musher to win the world’s most famous sled dog race. After crossing the finish in Nome around 12:15 p.m., he said it has been a goal of his since he was “a very small child to win the Iditarod, and I can’t believe it. It finally happened.“It took a lot work, took a lot of patience. And we failed quite a few times, you know? But we kept our head up high and stuck with the dream,"" he said.Redington won the Iditarod in his 16th try. He scratched from seven of those races, but his performance this decade has been the best of his career. He finished ninth last year, seventh in 2021 and eighth in 2020 — his only other top 10 finishes before this year’s race.The nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race started March 5 in Willow for 33 mushers, who traveled over two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and on the Bering Sea ice. Since then, three mushers have scratched. A fan-friendly ceremonial start was held in Anchorage the day before.It was the smallest field ever to start a race, one short of the first race run.Among those who scratched was defending champion Brent Sass, who was leading when he withdrew Saturday over concerns for his health. because of periodontal issues.He was doing OK and resting in the community of Unalakleet, he posted on Instagram Sunday. The Iditarod was caring for his dogs, he said.Sass said he had been sick the entire race with a bad cold. Then on Friday “some cracked teeth started giving me issues and over a 12-hour period turned into nearly unbearable pain,"" he said. ""My body basically shutdown and for two runs I just hung on. Ultimately I couldn’t care for the dogs.“He said the colder temperatures, dipping to minus 30 F (minus 34 C), were making his dog team stronger, but it made him weaker.For the first part of the race, mushers dealt with high temperatures, causing some to alter their strategies.Redington will earn about $50,000 for winning. The exact amount won’t be calculated until the total number of finishers are known to split the prize purse.The two mushers who were chasing him to Nome are also Alaska Natives, Pete Kaiser, who is Yup’ik and won the 2019 Iditarod, and Richie Diehl, who is Dena’ina Athabascan. Redington won the race in 8 days, 21 hours, 12 minutes and 58 seconds. Kaiser finished second, more than an hour behind Redington. Diehl was third, finishing about an hour behind Kaiser.Redington splits his time between Alaska and Wisconsin. He trains his dogs in Brule, Wisconsin, in the fall and winter. He races in Alaska and Minnesota beginning in December. In the summers, he has a sled dog tour for tourists in the ski community of Girdwood, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Anchorage.In January 2022, Redington was training in northern Wisconsin when a snowmobile driver veered into his dog team, injuring two dogs, before speeding off.One of the dogs, Wildfire, suffered a broken rear tibia, fibula and femur but recovered after multiple surgeries and started this year’s race. However, Redington dropped him at the checkpoint in Skwentna a day after the official start.“His heart was there, but he was just a little sore,” Redington told the Iditarod Insider webpage.___Associated Press journalist Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska, contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835433,Oats steers Alabama to March Madness in a turbulent season,"Nate Oats is steering Alabama through the best and most scrutinized season in Crimson Tide history.The former high school coach and math teacher seems to have found the right equation for success on the court, twice cutting down nets to celebrate titles and leading the Crimson Tide to the No. 1 overall NCAA Tournament seed.Oats’ biggest challenges and most-questioned decisions have come off the court, where critics have piled on even as the wins piled up.There’s no coaching handbook on how to handle one of your players getting charged with capital murder in midseason while two others were involved, including one of college basketball’s biggest stars in AP All-America freshman Brandon Miller.Oats is not second-guessing his decision to keep playing Miller and Jaden Bradley.“The fact never changed that we were going by what the police told us, that they were cooperating witnesses,” the 48-year-old Oats told The Associated Press in an interview this week “So based on everything we know — and we’re not investigators, we’re going on what the professional investigators have told us — Brandon and Jaden never broke any laws. They never violated any school policies. They’re fully cooperating witnesses and have been truthful from the minute they met with the police that day. So I’m not sure what they would have been suspended for.”It’s a decision that has drawn criticism while the Tide marched to Southeastern Conference regular season and tournament titles and the program’s first No. 1 seed. It's become a major story line even as Oats has taken the Tide to unprecedented heights.Miller went to pick up Darius Miles, who had left his gun in the back seat of the Tide forward’s vehicle and sent a text asking him to bring him the weapon early on Jan. 15. Another man, Michael Davis, is accused of firing the shot that killed 23-year-old mother Jamea Harris.Miller, whose vehicle was struck with bullets, received the text while en route and never touched the gun or knew that it was going to be used for criminal activity, his attorney said.Oats said he has made it “crystal clear” to his team that the only victims were Harris and her family.“That’s it. That’s where our prayers need to be. This is sad, awful,” Oats, who described himself as “torn up,” said he told the players.He said he has been stung by criticism and apologized multiple times for a comment saying Miller was in the “wrong spot at the right time” shortly after police testimony tied Miller and Bradley to the scene. And again for not halting Miller's pre-game patdown ritual with a teammate.“Of course it bothers me,” he said. “I’m human, and nobody likes to hear this stuff said about me knowing that it’s not who I am.”Oats has climbed the ranks, from leading Romulus High School in suburban Detroit to its first state title in 27 years to a successful run at Buffalo to the top of the college basketball world. All in the span of a decade. Oats received a new six-year, $30 million contract in February.He has turned Alabama into a basketball powerhouse alongside Nick Saban's juggernaut football program, which has won six national titles since 2009. Never has the Tide had a team that appeared better equipped for hoops glory.Miller is a projected top five NBA draft pick. Fellow freshmen Noah Clowney and Bradley have complemented players like veteran guard Jahvon Quinerly, center Charles Bediako and transfer Mark Sears.Oats, a hoops junkie who got a paper route in the fifth grade so he could eventually buy a TV to watch college games, has built the championship-caliber roster and a team that's fun to watch with its tempo, athleticism and barrage of 3-pointers.Former players say there's far more to their old coach.To Valdez Green, he's the guy who took him in for two year after Green's mother was jailed four years after his father was shot to death. To Filmore Bouldes, Oats is the man who helped put him on a path to the ministry while in college. Both played for Oats at Romulus High.Green calls Oats “a great man,” coach, father and husband.“I believe if it wasn’t for Oats, I wouldn’t be here,” said Green, who has three daughters and an infant son. “I wouldn’t be here able to take care of my kids or doing what I’m doing every day.”He still keeps in regular contact with Oats and visited Tuscaloosa last season. “He’s going to have your back. Just don’t lie to him,” Green said.Bouldes said Oats brought him to chaperone a Christian youth camp before his junior year of college, helping strengthen his own faith.“That man changed my life,” said Bouldes, now an associate pastor at C3 NYC. “I wouldn’t have gotten a scholarship. I wouldn’t have learned discipline, work ethic.”He said it's been emotional for him and his family to see so much criticism of the man he saw as a dedicated advocate “for the betterment of young Black men who may not have had chances to go to college, get a scholarship.”Bouldes recalls getting benched by Oats and scoffs at critics who think the Tide coach would make decisions on Miller and Bradley based on wins alone.“It’s utterly ridiculous,” Bouldes said. ""Obviously every coach wants to win and I can see how the optics make it seem like that. But what people have to understand is that the decision he made is a decision not to make him look better, but he’s actually championing Brandon. He wants to advocate for someone who he thinks is innocent. And that’s what he’s always done. He’s always done that for us.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket  and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/15,,World

Giberson waved other rioters into the tunnel before joining a second round of “heave ho” pushing against police, the agent said.Giberson tried in vain to start a chant of “Drag them out!” and then cheered on rioters using weapons and pepper spray against police in the tunnel, according to the FBI. Giberson remained in that area for roughly an hour on Jan. 6, 2021, the affidavit says.Giberson was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, on charges including a felony count of civil disorder, according to a court filing. He faces four other counts including engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds.A federal magistrate judge ordered Giberson's release from custody after his initial court appearance in Washington on Tuesday.Charles Burnham, an attorney for Giberson, declined to comment on the charges.University spokesman Michael Hotchkiss said in an email Tuesday that Giberson is currently enrolled at Princeton as an undergraduate.“We don’t have anything to add beyond that,” Hotchkiss wrote.Giberson was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and a Trump flag around his neck when he joined the mob's assault on police officers in a tunnel on the Capitol's Lower West Terrance, the affidavit says.The FBI posted images of Giberson on social media to seek the public's help in identifying him. Online sleuths also posted mages of Giberson online using the “#DragThemOut” hashtag moniker.Investigators matched photos of Giberson from the Capitol to several images found on Instagram and Princeton University's website, the FBI agent said. The FBI interviewed Giberson at the Princeton Police Department in the presence of an attorney before his arrest.Approximately 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot, which disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden's electoral victory.The FBI agent's affidavit doesn't say whether Giberson attended the “Stop the Steal” rally where then-President Donald Trump addressed a crowd of supporters on Jan. 6.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835438,Vegas terrorism suspect sentenced for sexually abusing girl,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Las Vegas man with ties to a far-right extremist group advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government has been sentenced to federal prison for sexually abusing a young girl.Stephen Thomas Parshall, 38, was ordered to serve 33 years in a federal prison Monday, court records show. U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey in Las Vegas also sentenced Parshall to lifetime supervision upon his release.The yearslong sexual abuse, which prosecutors say began when the victim was younger than 10, was uncovered in 2020 while police and federal agents were investigating Parshall and two other men in connection with an alleged terrorism plot targeting protests in Las Vegas against racism and police violence.Parshall pleaded guilty in October 2022 — one day before a federal jury trial in the abuse case was set to begin — to two counts of sexually exploiting a child, one count of coercion and enticement and one count of receiving and distributing child pornography.“He has had a change of heart, and he wishes to plead guilty this afternoon to the charges,” Parshall's attorney, Robert Draskovich, said at the hearing, according to court transcripts. Parshall was not offered a plea deal.Authorities say Parshall was first arrested by Las Vegas police in May 2020 with Andrew Lynam Jr. and William Loomis while the men filled glass bottles with gasoline in a plan to firebomb a protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.The FBI, police and prosecutors say the trio with military experience belonged to the loose anti-government “boogaloo” movement that supports overthrowing the U.S. government. Parshall and Loomis were formerly enlisted in the Navy and the Air Force, respectively, while Lynam was an Army reservist at the time of their arrests.According to a federal criminal complaint, investigators confiscated Parshall's cellphones as part of their investigation and found images of him sexually abusing a young girl on one of the devices.On another cellphone, investigators found sexually explicit images that a teenage girl had sent to Parshall at his request.Prosecutors also accused Parshall of using various social media websites and apps to “trade” child pornography. The criminal complaint states that Parshall's usernames for his accounts included “nopictoobad” and “pervysage.”Parshall and Lynam are currently scheduled to stand trial November in the federal terrorism case. Both have pleaded not guilty.Loomis, now 42, was sentenced in January to four to 20 years in a Nevada prison after reaching a deal with prosecutors and pleading guilty last October to providing material support for the commission of an act of terrorism, a felony.___Associated Press writer Ken Ritter in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835439,"With GOP majority, North Carolina court revisits voting maps","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A newly formed and now Republican-majority North Carolina Supreme Court listened on Tuesday to arguments that could determine the extent to which state legislators can create electoral districts that could help lock in their political power.The new 5-2 GOP majority allowed a rare “rehearing” of the case last month. The redistricting litigation was ruled on just three months ago, when Democrats held a 4-3 seat advantage. That edition of the court threw out out a state Senate map the legislature drew and upheld congressional boundaries drawn by trial judges.That ruling stemmed from a landmark February 2022 decision declaring the state constitution barred partisan gerrymandering — especially when lines fail to give voters the ability to elect favored candidates commensurate with their level of voting power statewide. The Democratic-majority court pointed to evidence that showed maps approved by the General Assembly in fall 2021 made it nearly impossible for Democrats to win majorities in the legislature or in the congressional delegation, even though the state is marked by closely divided statewide elections.The Republicans on the court at the time disagreed, saying the constitution doesn't address partisan considerations in redistricting, so such decisions are left solely to lawmakers. Since then, the court’s majority flipped to the GOP after two associate justice election victories in November. Republican legislative leaders asked for the rehearing, which the new court granted.The arguments marked the first of two days of rehearings for the justices. The same Republican majority also ordered a hearing for Wednesday on another 4-3 decision in December that upheld a trial court decision striking down a 2018 voter photo identification law.These rehearing decisions have angered Democrats and their allies, who sued in both cases and claim they were based solely on the partisan makeup of the court. About 300 people attended a Tuesday morning rally Capitol Square across from the Supreme Court building before Tuesday’s arguments lamenting the rehearings and vowing to keep fighting for voters and marginalized groups.“The law cannot swing back and forth with every election,” said Rebecca Harper, a Cary real estate agent and the lead plaintiff in the redistricting litigation who attended the rally. “I’m very very sad that we are back here fighting this same fight again because of what this court and this legislature are pushing for.”There’s no timeline when the Supreme Court will rule.A favorable decision for the GOP legislative leaders could give them an easier time to draw legislative and congressional maps for 2024 and beyond with more favorable partisan tilts. While Republicans current hold majorities in the General Assembly, the congressional delegation is split 7-7 after two more Democratic seat victories in November.Harper is also involved in a related case at the U.S. Supreme Court, where oral arguments were held in December. Legislative Republicans asked the U.S. justices to declare that the state Supreme Court improperly tossed out the congressional districts the General Assembly drew. That’s based upon a theory that critics say could give state lawmakers expansive powers over how federal elections are conducted. The federal case could become moot if the state Supreme Court reinstates congressional lines the legislature drew.Phil Strach, a lawyer for the GOP lawmakers, told the court on Tuesday that the 2022 decisions show that state courts lack the ability to calculate and determine what are considered politically fair maps.“Some things, your honor, are beyond the power of this court,"" Strach told Associate Justice Anita Earls, a registered Democrat. “Part of the reason this court does not have the power to address that issue is because it does not have the tools to answer the question.”Earls cited evidence by a trial court last year from mathematicians that found the 2021 maps the General Assembly approved were more carefully crafted for Republican advantage than 99.9% — and in some cases 99.9999% — of all possible alternatives.“And so you’re asking us to say that in spite of those facts, the North Carolina Constitution offers no protection to voters?” Earls asked. Strach said later that some actions are beyond other political branches to address, and that “sometimes it’s got to be left up to the people.”""Except how can it be left up to the people"" when maps don't reflect the voting strength of the public, Earls responded.Attorneys for the voters and advocacy groups that initially sued over the maps said in legal briefs that the facts in the cases haven't changed — only the combination of justices have— and so the redistricting decisions should be left intact.The Supreme Court didn't give specifics for why they agreed to rehearings. But they can be granted based on arguments that the justices “overlooked or misapprehended” facts or laws.“Now the legislative defendants play a cynical game, hoping that this newly constituted court will reverse course and abdicate its fundamental duty of judicial review,” said Lali Madduri, an attorney speaking Tuesday in court for Common Cause, the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and citizens like Harper.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835440,"Business Highlights: Fed's missed red flags, Meta layoffs","___Fed criticized for missing red flags before bank collapseWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is facing stinging criticism for missing what observers say were clear signs that Silicon Valley Bank was at high risk of collapsing into what became the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The Fed was the primary federal supervisor of the bank, based in Santa Clara, California, though the bank was also overseen by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Critics point to many red flags that had surrounded Silicon Valley Bank, including its rapid growth since the pandemic, its unusually high level of uninsured deposits and its over-investment in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which tumbled in value as interest rates rose.___Silicon Valley Bank’s demise disrupts the disruptors in techSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse has rattled the technology industry that had been the bank’s backbone. It’s left shell-shocked entrepreneurs thankful for the government reprieve that saved their money, while they mourn the loss of a place that served as a chummy club of innovation. Tech startups are feeling relief for the deposit guarantees that will allow them to continue to pay their workers and other bills. But startup CEOs and the venture capitalists who back them worry that it may be more difficult to finance risky ideas in the future without the presence of an institution that had been a reliable partner for the past 40 years.___Class action suit filed against Silicon Valley Bank parentSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A class action lawsuit is being filed against the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, its CEO and its chief financial officer, saying that company didn’t disclose the risks that future interest rate increases would have on its business. The lawsuit is looking for unspecified damages to be awarded to those who invested in SVB Financial Group between June 16, 2021 and March 10, 2023. The lawsuit says some quarterly and annual financial reports from SVB didn’t fully account for warnings from the Federal Reserve about interest rate hikes.___A 2nd wave of layoffs at Meta; 10,000 jobs are cutSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Facebook parent Meta will slash another 10,000 jobs and will not fill 5,000 open positions as the social media pioneer cuts costs. The company said Tuesday it will reduce the size of its recruiting team and then make further cuts in its tech groups in late April, and then its business groups in late May. The Menlo Park, California, company has been investing billions of dollars to realign its focus on the metaverse. In February it posted lower fourth-quarter profit and revenue, hurt by a downturn in the online advertising market and competition from rivals such as TikTok.___US inflation eases but stays high, putting Fed in tough spotWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer price increases eased slightly from January to February but still pointed to an elevated inflation rate that is posing a challenge for the Federal Reserve at a delicate moment for the financial system. The government said Tuesday that prices increased 0.4% last month, just below January’s 0.5% rise. Yet excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 0.5% in February, slightly above January’s 0.4% gain. The Fed pays particular attention to the core measure as a gauge of underlying inflation pressures.___Wall Street climbs as some beaten-down bank stocks recoverNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed higher on Wall Street as some of the most breathtaking moves from a manic Monday reversed course. The S&P 500 rose 1.7% Tuesday after a report showed inflation is still high, though no more than expected. The Nasdaq composite rose 2.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.1%. Several bank stocks bounced back, recovering some of their plunges from a day earlier caused by worries that customers could yank out their cash in the wake of two bank failures. Treasury yields rose sharply, trimming some of their historic drops from the previous day.—-Is my money safe? What you need to know about bank failuresNEW YORK (AP) — The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which catered mostly to the tech industry, may have you worried about your money. They were the second- and third-biggest bank failures in U.S. history. There’s no need to worry if your money is in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and you have less than $250,000 there. If the bank fails, you’ll get your money back. If you have over $250,000 in one bank, that amount is considered uninsured and experts recommend that you move the remainder of your money to a different financial institution.___SEC’s climate reporting draft rule draws huge public commentWASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys and industry experts say a closely watched rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require public companies to say much more to shareholders about how their operations affect the climate has generated more public comment than many recent regulations from the nation’s top financial regulator. The SEC is expected to issue a final rule in the spring. The draft rule it put out last summer has drawn thousands of comments. The rule would make the U.S. the latest government to regulate what companies must report on their greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and above a certain level, the cost of climate change on their business.___California court rules for Uber, Lyft in ride-hailing caseSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A California appeals court has ruled companies like Uber and Lyft do not have to treat their drivers as employees. The ruling means app-based ride hailing and delivery companies do not have to provide certain worker protections and benefits. The state Legislature passed a law in 2019 requiring these companies to treat their drivers as employees. Companies like Uber and Lyft spent $200 million in 2020 on a campaign to convince voters to exempt them from that law. Voters agreed. In 2021 a state judge ruled the companies were not exempt from the law. Monday, a state appeals court overturned that decision.___The S&P 500 gained 64.80 points, or 1.7%, to 3,920.56.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835443,Woman who pretended to be sick Marine gets nearly 6 years,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A former social worker at a Rhode Island veterans' hospital who used stolen patient information to brazenly pass herself off as a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer and fraudulently collect nearly $300,000 in benefits, charitable contributions, and donations was sentenced Tuesday to nearly six years in prison.A U.S. District Court in Providence also ordered Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 32, to pay full restitution.Cavanaugh attended public events in uniform where she spoke about the struggles veterans face, bought a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star to wear, and was even named commander of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post. Then, in early 2022 she was exposed when a charity she applied to for funds became suspicious and started checking her background.“Sarah Cavanaugh’s conduct in the course of her scheme is nothing short of appalling,” U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. “By brazenly laying claim to the honor, service, and sacrifice of real veterans, this defendant preyed on the charity and decency of others for her own shameless financial gain.""Cavanaugh's defense attorney, Kensley Barrett, had sought a two-year sentence citing her lack of a criminal history, low risk of reoffending, and the “significant price” she has already paid through public disgrace, loss of her professional license, the breakup of her marriage, and even online death threats.Cavanaugh, who pleaded guilty in August to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, apologized in court.There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military. She did, however, work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence.It was through the job that she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name that said she had been honorably discharged and had cancer, prosecutors said when she was charged last March.When Cavanaugh said that she could not afford the insurance deductibles for her cancer treatment, the same veteran whose identity she had stolen and who is identified in court papers only by his initials, agreed to pay them for her — nearly $600 per month — an act that “plumbed the depths of moral depravity,"" prosecutors said.Cavanaugh said she served in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2009 until 2016, rose to the rank of corporal, and was being treated for lung cancer as a result of exposure to burn pits and from inhaling particulate matter from a bomb explosion, according to authorities.She accepted more than $225,000 from the Wounded Warrior Project alone to help pay for yoga classes, gym membership, groceries and physical therapy, among other things, according to prosecutors.She took her fraud to such extremes, authorities said, that she told people at her gym that injuries to her fingers left her unable to tie her shoes, so someone else had to get down on their knees to tie her laces whenever she wanted to work out.In one victim impact statement submitted to the court, a real veteran she met said she took a spot in a therapeutic veterans art program that could have gone to a veteran. The veteran told the court that a friend who applied for the program, known as CreatiVets, was not accepted and later took his own life. Cavanaugh received $15,000 from the program, according to court documents.She received about $18,500 in financial assistance from Code of Support in Virginia for bills and about $4,700 from a fundraising website, prosecutors said.An investigation was started after the Providence nonprofit the HunterSeven Foundation, which helps sick veterans, contacted the Providence VA because they were suspicious of Cavanaugh when she requested assistance from them.Cavanaugh, who was also ordered to pay full restitution, is remorseful, her attorney wrote in court documents. She suffered from “severe trauma during her formative years in high school,"" and through her job developed a connection with the veterans she cared for.“Today’s sentencing sends a strong message to those who would represent themselves as something they’re not in order to profit from the kindness and respect shown to our nation’s deserving veterans,” said Christopher Algieri, head of the VA's Office of Inspector General’s Northeast Field Office.",2023/03/15,,World

As the doors were closing, she stepped out, but the dog stayed on the train. The train took off, and Adams was dragged and pulled onto the tracks and killed on Sept. 13, 2021. The dog was not injured, BART officials said.Adams appeared to be waving at someone moments before the train started moving, they said. A witness told KGO-TV that he saw the woman being dragged and a man who was hysterical on the platform who told him the woman killed was his girlfriend.The National Transportation Safety Board said the train conductor followed BART’s procedures that required him to look for passengers before departing a station but did not see Adams, who was more than 600 feet (180 meters) away from him, or the dog leash trapped between the doors.The NTSB said dim lighting at the station “likely made it difficult for the train operator to reliably monitor and evaluate passengers exiting and entering the rear of the train.”BART has since completed lighting and painting improvements at the Powell Street Station and other nearby stations to improve visibility for its train conductors, the agency said.Toxicology tests on the train conductor didn't identify any illicit substances, it said.Adams tested positive for methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl in an autopsy conducted by San Francisco authorities, the agency said.“It is likely that the passenger was experiencing at least some impairing effects of substance use at the time of the accident,” the NTSB said, adding that investigators found no clear evidence that impairment played a role in the accident.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835447,What's known and not about US drone-Russian jet encounter,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When a Russian fighter jet collided with a large U.S. surveillance drone over the Black Sea, it was a rare but serious incident that triggered a U.S. diplomatic protest and raised concerns about the possibility Russia could recover sensitive technology.U.S. and Russian officials had conflicting accounts of the collision Tuesday between the MQ-9 Reaper drone and the Russian Su-27 fighter jet; each side blamed the other. A Pentagon spokesman raised the possibility that the Defense Department could eventually declassify and release video it has of the collision.Russian authorities said Wednesday that they will try to recover the fragments of the drone. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN that the Reaper crashed into very deep water and he was not sure whether a recovery was possible.A look at what's known and what's uncertain about the incident.WHAT THE US SAYS HAPPENEDThe Pentagon and U.S. European Command said that two Russian Su-27 aircraft dumped fuel on the MQ-9, which was conducting a routine surveillance mission over the Black Sea in international airspace. They said the Russian jets flew around and in front of the drone several times for 30 to 40 minutes, and then one of the Russian aircraft ""struck the propeller of the MQ-9, causing U.S. forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters.”Air Force Gen. James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Africa, said that the Russian jet’s actions “nearly caused both aircraft to crash.” Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the collision likely also damaged the Russian fighter jet, but the Su-27 was able to land. He would not say where it landed.The Pentagon said the drone was “well clear” of any Ukrainian territory, but did not provide details. A U.S. defense official said it was operating west of Crimea over the Black Sea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide mission details.It's not clear if the collision was an accident or intentional, but both sides agree the Russian aircraft were trying to intercept the drone.WHAT RUSSIA SAYS HAPPENEDThe Russian Defense Ministry said the U.S. drone was flying near the Russian border and intruded in an area that was declared off limits by Russian authorities. It said that the Russian military scrambled fighters to intercept the U.S. drone. It claimed that “as a result of sharp maneuver, the U.S. drone went into uncontrollable flight with a loss of altitude and collided with water surface.”Russia has declared broad areas near Crimea off limits to flights. Ever since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and long before Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Moscow has charged that U.S. surveillance planes were flying too close to its borders while ignoring the notices issued by Russia.Nations routinely operate in international airspace and waters, and no country can claim limits on territory outside of its own border.The ministry said the Russian aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone but didn’t use their weapons and “didn’t come into contact” with it.WHAT IS AN MQ-9 REAPER?The MQ-9 Reaper is a large unmanned Air Force aircraft that is remotely operated by a two-person team. It includes a ground control station and satellite equipment and has a 66-foot (20-meter) wingspan. The team includes a rated pilot who is responsible for flying the aircraft and an enlisted aircrew member who is charged with operating the sensors and guiding weapons.Used routinely during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for surveillance and airstrikes, the Reaper can be either armed or unarmed. It can carry up to eight laser-guided missiles, including Hellfire missiles and other sophisticated munitions, and can loiter over targets for about 24 hours. It is about 36 feet long, 12 feet high, and weighs about 4,900 pounds (11 meters long, 4 meters high, and 2,200 kilograms). It can fly at an altitude of up to 50,000 feet (15 kilometers) and has a range of about 1,400 nautical miles (2,500 kilometers).The Reaper, which first began operating in 2007, replaced the Air Force’s smaller Predator drones. Each Reaper costs about $32 million.DIPLOMATIC DUST-UPThe collision triggered a diplomatic protest.The U.S. State Department summoned Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov to a meeting Tuesday with Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for Europe.“We are engaging directly with the Russians, again at senior levels, to convey our strong objections to this unsafe, unprofessional intercept, which caused the downing of the unmanned U.S. aircraft,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.Kirby said the U.S. will be “expressing our concerns over this unsafe and unprofessional intercept.”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had not talked to his Russian counterpart regarding the incident, Ryder said.HAS IT HAPPENED BEFORE?This is not the first time Russian aircraft have flown so close to U.S. aircraft in the Black Sea that it's prompted the Pentagon to publicly condemn the incident for putting the crews at risk. In 2020, Russian jets crossed in front of a B-52 bomber that was flying over the Black Sea, and flew as close as 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the bomber’s nose, causing turbulence.Russian jets have also buzzed U.S. warships during exercises in the Black Sea. In 2021, Russian warplanes buzzed the USS Donald Cook, a Navy destroyer, which had been taking part in a major exercise. Until Russia’s invasion last year of Ukraine, U.S. warships more frequently deployed to the Black Sea in response to Russia’s 2014 attack on Crimea.For the most part, however, military intercepts — either in the air or at sea — are routine and have happened a number of times with Russian aircraft in the Pacific, particularly in the north. Just last month, U.S. fighter jets intercepted two Russian TU-95 bombers in international airspace off Alaska’s coast, and “escorted them” for 12 minutes, according to the Pentagon.And Russian aircraft have done similar missions, and also buzzed U.S. Navy ships in the Pacific. In most of the cases, the intercepts are deemed safe and professional.It's not clear if the Russian pilots were willing to get closer to the Reaper or dump fuel on it because they knew it was unmanned — and therefore there was no risk to an American pilot or crew. The deliberate downing of a manned aircraft — injuring or killing crew members — could be considered an act of war.___AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835448,WADA eyes verdict in 2023 for Valieva Olympic doping case,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — A verdict in the Olympic case of teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva could come this year, the World Anti-Doping Agency said Tuesday detailing “distrust” of how it was first handled in Russia.Valieva’s positive test for a banned heart medication in December 2021 was revealed at the Beijing Olympics several weeks later after her standout skate at age 15 helped the Russians take gold in the team event.WADA and the International Skating Union have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against a Russian anti-doping tribunal ruling that she was not at fault.The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA also appealed to CAS though proposed that a reprimand was enough for Valieva, letting her remain an Olympic champion. WADA seeks a four-year ban and Olympic disqualification, which would give the team gold medal to the United States.“I’m pretty optimistic we’re going to have a decision before the end of the year,” WADA director general Olivier Niggli said of the case that dominated the second week in Beijing. Valieva was allowed to skate in the women's event but a dramatic, error-filled routine left her in fourth placeNiggli acknowledged it was now a “complex case with three parties” making appeals.“It depends on the kind of requests are put to the court,” Niggli said at a news conference during WADA’s annual media day in the Olympic home city Lausanne. “We are ready to proceed as quickly as possible.”CAS has not suggested a timetable for a verdict or even a hearing after a panel of three judges is selected.The Russian ruling clearing Valieva of wrongdoing, and disqualifying her just from the Russian championships where her sample was taken, emerged only in January after WADA pushed for CAS to take over the initial case.WADA president Witold Banka used his keynote speech Tuesday to note that “unnecessary delays” had fed a distrust of Russia's anti-doping system.Banak also drew attention to Valieva’s coach Eteri Tutberidze getting an award in January from Russian President Vladimir Putin.“It’s not a good example of how to protect athletes and children,” the WADA leader said.The WADA code of rules calls for mandatory investigations of a coach and entourage when a minor tests positive for doping.That should be done in Russia and also is complicated, Niggli said, because “you need to have people who are ready to talk to you.” ___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835449,Cowboys get CB Gilmore in trade with Colts on big day for D,"The Dallas Cowboys acquired cornerback Stephon Gilmore from the Indianapolis Colts for a fifth-round draft pick Tuesday.The addition of the five-time Pro Bowler came on the same day Dallas brought back safety Donovan Wilson and linebacker Leighton Vander Esch as the Cowboys try to further bolster a defense that carried the club at times during a second consecutive playoff season in 2022.The Cowboys will give the Colts a compensatory fifth-round pick in this year's draft.It will be the third team in three seasons for Gilmore, the 2019 AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year when he was with New England.The 32-year-old Gilmore played 16 games for the Colts last season, finishing with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups as a four-year Pro Bowl run ended.The second of Gilmore's two All-Pro seasons was with the Patriots in 2019, when he led the NFL with 20 pass breakups and had six interceptions.The trade pairs Gilmore with 2021 NFL interceptions leader Trevon Diggs, who had 11 of his 17 career picks that season. Diggs dropped off to three interceptions last year.The addition of Gilmore could mean the end of Anthony Brown's career in Dallas. Brown's seventh season with the Cowboys ended in Week 13 when he tore an Achilles tendon against the Colts.DaRon Bland, a 2022 fifth-round pick who had a strong rookie season, is back along with Jourdan Lewis, who was limited to six games last season because of a broken foot.Gilmore was with four teams in his first 11 seasons, beginning with Buffalo as the 10th overall pick in 2012. He has 29 interceptions in 148 games and won a Super Bowl with the 2018 Patriots.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

(AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers have agreed on a $33 million, three-year deal, a person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press.The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal can’t be announced until Wednesday, said it includes $21 million in guaranteed money.Meyers made the Patriots’ roster as an undrafted free agent in 2019 out of North Carolina State and quickly found a home, displaying an acumen for catching the ball in traffic primarily out of the slot. Meyers spent his first four seasons with New England. He has averaged 70 catches and 800 yards receiving over the past three seasons.A free agent for the first time in his career, it helped make him a prime option for receiver-needy teams.Meyers reunites with Raiders coach Josh McDaniels, who was previously New England’s offensive coordinator.Meyers joins wide receivers Davante Adams and Hunter Renfrow to give new quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo another formidable option.Despite acknowledging in January after the Patriots’ season ended that he’d been playing hurt all season, Meyers still led all receivers with 67 receptions and had a team-high six receiving touchdowns.Meyers was involved in one of the worst gaffes in NFL history when he attempted an unnecessary lateral across the field to quarterback Mac Jones on the final play of a tie game that was headed to overtime last season. Chandler Jones snatched the ball in the air and raced for a touchdown to give the Raiders a win over the Patriots.Linebacker Robert Spillane will sign a two-year, $9 million contract with the Raiders, a person familiar with the deal told the AP. The contract includes $4 million in guaranteed money.Spillane spent the past four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He started five games and played in 16 last season, making 79 tackles, with four for losses.The Raiders also will sign wide receiver Phillip Dorsett, a person with knowledge of the deal told The AP. Like with Meyers, Dorsett has history with McDaniels, having played for the Patriots in 2017-19. He caught 20 passes for 257 yards and a TD last season with the Houston Texans.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi and AP Sports Writer Mark Anderson contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835463,"ComEd, Madigan focus of federal bribery trial in Illinois","CHICAGO (AP) — Jury selection began Tuesday at a federal trial in Chicago that could offer an inside look at pay-to-play politics in Illinois that prosecutors say involved the state's largest electric utility and one of its most powerful politicians at the time.The four defendants are accused of arranging contracts, jobs and money for associates of then-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, who for decades was one of the most powerful legislators in the U.S. Prosecutors say the goal was to curry favor with Madigan to ensure proposed bills favorable to ComEd actually became law.Opening statements are expected sometime this week.While Madigan, 80, will feature in much of the testimony and evidence, he won't be in court. He has been indicted, but he isn't a defendant at the current trial in U.S. District Court. He isn't expected to testify either. His own trial is scheduled for next year.The defendants at the current trial are onetime Madigan confidant Michael McClain, former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, former ComEd lobbyist John Hooker, and former ComEd consultant Jay Doherty. All have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts that include bribery conspiracy.Defense attorneys have said they will aim to demonstrate that their clients were engaged in run-of-the-mill lobbying and that they never crossed lines into illegality.Judge Harry Leinenweber asked some prospective jurors about feelings they had for Madigan and lobbyists in general, the Chicago Tribune reported. Some were excused after saying that sitting in on the trial for the up to eight weeks it could last would pose major hardships.Key evidence for the government is expected to include secret recordings of Madigan and other key figures. Leinenweber ruled Tuesday that media would have access to recordings once they are played to jurors.He rejected an argument from McClain’s lawyer, Patrick Cotter, that jurors could end up hearing what ""the media considers to be the greatest hits” of the recordings outside court and thereby influence jurors' verdicts, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.Madigan was indicted in 2022 on charges that included racketeering and bribery. He's denied wrongdoing. A year earlier, he resigned from the Legislature as the longest-serving state House speaker in modern U.S. history amid speculation that he was a federal target.The indictment accused Madigan, among other things, of reaping the benefits of private legal work illegally steered to his law firm.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835464,Ex-rep: Legislative plans in Mississippi are 'Jim Crow 2.0',"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Efforts by the majority-white Mississippi Legislature to create courts with appointed rather than elected judges and to expand patrols by state police inside the majority-Black capital city of Jackson amount to “Jim Crow 2.0,” a Democratic former state lawmaker said Tuesday.Ex-Rep. Kathy Sykes of Jackson also said people in other parts of the U.S. should pay attention to what's happening in Mississippi because ideas in one state can spread to others. Sykes, who supports abortion rights, mentioned the U.S. Supreme Court using a Mississippi case last year to upend abortion access nationwide.“We’re the state that took away a woman’s right to choose for her and her doctor to make decisions on her body,” Sykes said. ""So if we don’t get involved around this country and around this world, we’re going to have takeovers all over the United States where there is majority-minority representation.""The Mississippi House and Senate this year have passed different versions of bills dealing with police and courts in Jackson, which has the highest percentage of Black residents of any major U.S. city. Negotiators from the two chambers are expected to work on final versions of the bills in the next two weeks.One of the bills is sponsored by Republican Rep. Trey Lamar of Senatobia, a small town more than 170 miles (275 kilometers) north of Jackson. He said he's trying to make Jackson safer and reduce a backlog in the judicial system.“There is nothing racial about the bill on its face, and there is no intent for the effect to be racial,"" Lamar, who is white, told The Associated Press last month.During a news conference Tuesday outside the state Capitol building, Wendell Paris of the Minority People's Council said the proposal to have appointed judges violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also said it's unfair for legislators from other parts of Mississippi to mandate what will happen in Jackson when they are not considering the same proposals for their own communities.“You can’t take away the power of some of the members of the community and say that you represent a democracy, which you do not. You represent a false democracy,"" Paris said. “And we’re saying that Mississippi is one place that we cannot tolerate any going back. Mississippi has a sordid past.”Carol Blackmon, senior state organizing manager for the Black Voters Matter Fund, said the legislative efforts to control Jackson are “ruthlessly racist.”“It’s a land and power grab by white state officials of a majority-Black-controlled institution, tax revenues and political power,” she said.Blackmon said Jackson residents are smart enough to elect their own judges and to make decisions about policing. She also said if Mississippi lawmakers are interested in curbing crime, they should provide money to the Jackson Police Department.The state-run Capitol Police department currently patrols near state government buildings in and around downtown. The House has voted to expand Capitol Police coverage into more affluent parts of the city, including some predominantly white neighborhoods. The Senate has voted to let Capitol Police patrol all of Jackson, along with city police.Arkela Lewis, the mother of a 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death by Mississippi Capitol Police last year, recently told state lawmakers that the thought of expanding the territory of the state-run law enforcement agency “terrifies” her.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835465,Medicaid agreement in North Carolina closes in on passage,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The details of a deal reached by North Carolina legislative Republicans to expand Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults received overwhelming initial approval from the state Senate on Tuesday.The 43-2 vote on formal legislation comes less than two weeks after House and Senate leaders unveiled an agreement that could cover 600,000 people who make too much to qualify for conventional Medicaid but not enough to obtain highly subsidized private insurance.North Carolina, currently with 2.9 million enrollees in traditional Medicaid coverage, is one of 11 states that haven’t yet adopted expansion.“We have been talking about this for a long time,” said Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Forsyth County Republican. She shepherded the bill on the Senate floor Tuesday after opposing the expansion idea for many years.Republicans in charge of the legislature were skeptical over the past decade about expansion, made available through the 2010 Affordable Care Act. But the tide changed over the past year as lawmakers became more comfortable with the idea. They also were tempted with the receipt of an additional $1.8 billion over two years from Congress if North Carolina signed on now. Many state officials want to earmark a great deal of that money for mental health services statewide.An agreement reached after weeks of negotiations earlier this month also included provisions that eased or eliminated certain “certificate of need” laws that require health regulators to sign off on plans for medical entities to build locations or purchase equipment. The Senate demanded such changes as a way to increase the supply of services for the larger covered population.The measure must pass the Senate a second time, probably on Wednesday, before it goes to the House for likely final action by the General Assembly. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a longtime expansion advocate, would be asked to sign the bill into law.While expressing support for the legislature’s agreement, Cooper is unhappy with language in the bill that delays enactment of expansion until a separate state budget bill is enacted into law. That’s likely to happen in June or July.Republicans also now express confidence that the state's share of medical expenses for the expansion recipients will remain at 10% The state's hospitals will cover that share through assessments they will pay.“For a long time, we worried about the financial impact that Medicaid expansion would have on North Carolina. We weren’t sure. But the federal government has continued to make it better and better for us,” Krawiec said.Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson of Guilford County pushed for expansion in years when Republican were cool to the idea. She said that while “there are some pieces that that I may not agree with, but I support getting this done.”“It's a little late,” Robinson said, “but we'll take it.”Robinson and others who spoke said expansion would benefit the working poor, many of whom work for small businesses but whose owners can't afford to provide insurance.Hospitals, particularly in rural areas, also will benefit from other bill language that directs the state to enter a federal program by which hospitals would receive additional Medicaid reimbursement funds. The state would seek at least $3.2 billion in hospital reimbursements during the next fiscal year thanks to the program, and that's before expansion enrollees are considered, according to the legislature's fiscal staff.The measure also would beef up efforts to help expansion recipients land employment that will allow them to leave Medicaid coverage. It directs Cooper's administration to attempt to negotiate with federal regulators to add a work requirement as a condition of participation in the expansion program to be called NC Health Works.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835466,Inter reaches Champions League QF after 0-0 draw at Porto,"PORTO, Portugal (AP) — Heroic defending and the woodwork helped Inter Milan reach the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time in more than a decade.Inter managed a 0-0 draw at Porto on Tuesday to progress 1-0 on aggregate and join city rival AC Milan in the final eight. Napoli could become the third Italian team in the quarterfinals when it plays Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday.All the drama was saved for the fifth minute of stoppage time as a goalline clearance, the post and the crossbar prevented Porto from snatching the goal that would have taken the match to extra time.“In soccer, luck matters relatively,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. “I think that over the both legs we deserved to get to the quarterfinals, we didn’t concede a goal in the 180 minutes against a team that’s used to playing these sort of matches.“We shouldn’t forget that last year we reached the round of 16 for the first time after more than 10 years, this year the quarterfinals … Now we will play with a lot of confidence.”There were few other concrete chances at the Estádio Do Dragão as Inter did enough to ensure it advanced to the final eight for the first time since going out at that stage as the defending champion in 2011.Several Porto players dropped to the ground in tears at the final whistle.“I think it’s normal to cry after you’re eliminated like this, it’s normal because my players play with passion,” Porto coach Sérgio Conceição said. “They should be proud of how they played these matches, I think we were superior to Inter.“I’m feeling a mixture of great pride and great frustration. I’m frustrated, sad … I have the same feelings as the fans here at the stadium and at home.”There are no further restrictions on teams from the same country facing each other so the two Milan sides could be pitted against each other when the draw is made on Friday — just like they were in the semifinals in 2003, when eventual champion Milan emerged victorious.Romelu Lukaku had scored the all-important goal at San Siro but he started on the bench Tuesday as Inter coach Simone Inzaghi opted for Edin Džeko alongside Lautaro Martínez up front.And Džeko had the best of the few Inter chances in the 22nd minute but his effort was saved by Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa.Porto could have already been in front by then as Inter goalkeeper André Onana got the slightest of touches to push Mateus Uribe’s swerving shot round the post in the third minute and also reacted well to smother a scuffed Stephen Eustáquio effort.The Inter defense dealt well with the Porto pressure but almost got caught out on the counter midway through the second half but Matteo Darmian — who was suffering from a cramp and on a yellow card — rushed back to make a perfectly timed, last-ditch tackle.Porto poured forward in the seven minutes of stoppage time and had three incredible chances in the space of a minute. Iván Marcano's shot was cleared off the line by Inter defender Denzel Dumfries, before Onana pushed Mehdi Taremi's header onto his post and, moments later, a Marko Grujić header came off the crossbar.Porto defender Pepe was sent off two minutes later following a second yellow card.Manchester City also advanced to the quarterfinals as it routed Leipzig 7-0 in the night's other match, with Erling Haaland scoring a record-equaling five goals in a Champions League match.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835467,Michigan Senate votes to repeal 2012 law restricting unions,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Hundreds of union supporters filled the halls of the Michigan Capitol on Tuesday as Senate Democrats voted along party lines in support of repealing the decade-old “right-to-work” law in a state long considered a pillar of organized labor.Democrats have listed the repeal as one of their top legislative goals this session. The law, enacted in 2012 when Republicans fully controlled Michigan government, prohibits public and private unions from requiring that nonunion employees pay union dues even if the union bargains on their behalf.Senators approved the repeal on a 20-17 vote, sending it back to the House, which passed its own version last week but must approve the final language. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said she'll sign it. The Senate also followed the House's actions last week in voting to restore the state’s prevailing wage law, which requires contractors hired for state projects to pay union-level wages.“It’s a new day here in Lansing,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said. “And today we are taking action to empower workers by restoring the rights that they always relied on.”Union supporters, many of whom had waited nearly nine hours for the Senate to vote, cheered loudly from the gallery and outside the Senate chamber as Democrats voted to approve the repeal. A repeal in Michigan would deliver a much needed victory in the region for unions after Wisconsin and Indiana passed their own “right-to-work” laws over the past decade.A bill seeking to reimburse some union members the cost of their dues has also been cosponsored by 33 House Democrats, further signifying the direction of the party after they took full control of the state government this year.Supporters and opponents of the “right-to-work” law clashed during a Tuesday morning Senate Labor committee meeting where the legislation was first considered. Union supporters said workers' wages and rights have suffered over the past decade while business advocates said the law has made the state competitive once again.“Being a right-to-work law state makes us more competitive nationally, and especially with our neighboring states who also have these laws,” said Wendy Block of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce.State Sen. Thomas Albert, the lone Republican on the committee, said during the meeting that the repeal would allow “forced union membership.""Spending appropriations were attached to both bills, a move that Republicans say is to ensure they are “referendum-proof.” The Michigan Constitution states that bills with appropriations attached to them are not subject to a public referendum in which voters could reject the law.Whitmer promised in her 2019 State of the State speech to “veto bills designed to cut out the public’s right of referendum.” Her office has said that while she didn’t ask for the appropriation to be added, “the governor is going to sign a bill that puts Michigan’s working families first.”Opponents could still protect the policy by putting a constitutional amendment on the ballot, which would require close to 450,000 voter signatures. A ballot measure barring “right-to-work” laws was defeated by nearly 14 percentage points in 2012.Michigan had the nation’s seventh-highest percentage of unionized workers when the “right-to-work” law was enacted in 2012, but that dropped to 11th in 2022. Over the past decade, union membership in Michigan has fallen by 2.6 percentage points as overall U.S. union membership has been falling steadily for decades, reaching an all-time low last year of 10.1%.In total, 27 states have “right-to-work” laws in place. Republicans in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin all passed legislation over the past decade curbing union rights, sparking massive protests.Thousands of union supporters descended on Michigan's Capitol to protest in 2012 when the Republican controlled Statehouse pushed the “right-to-work” legislation through without hearings.The year before, neighboring Wisconsin under Republican Gov. Scott Walker proposed all-but ending collective bargaining for most public workers. It sent off weeks of protests that grew to as large as 100,000 people and led Democratic state senators to leave the state in a failed attempt to stop the bill’s passage.Four years later, after he had said he wouldn’t go after union rights of private sector workers, Walker signed a right-to-work law for Wisconsin.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835469,Georgia city sued over 2021 death in police interview room,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — The family of a 60-year-old man who killed himself when left alone in a police station interview room filed suit Tuesday against the city of Savannah and its police department.Attorneys for the family say that officers questioning William Zachery Harvey two years ago in connection with an aggravated assault ignored him when Harvey threatened to take his own life rather than go to jail.Officers who left Harvey unattended during a break in their interview April 3, 2021, returned to find him dead. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation and concluded that Harvey had hanged himself with his own shoelaces.“Mr. Harvey should have never been alone in the interview room,” Harold Spence, one of the attorneys for Harvey's family, told a news conference Tuesday. He said police “ignored their own policies” by not turning on a video camera in the room and having an officer monitor it.The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court seeks to recover the cost of Harvey's funeral and burial expenses, as well as monetary damages for ""personal injuries, pain and suffering, and wrongful death.""Two months after Harvey's death, Savannah police fired five officers. Two of them lost their jobs for policy violations related to Harvey’s interview and death. Three others were fired in connection with a text message shared among Savannah officers that mocked Harvey’s death.Roy Minter, Savannah's police chief at the time of Harvey's death, left the department last year when President Joe Biden nominated him to become U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Georgia. Minter's confirmation is still pending in the U.S. Senate.Nick Zoller, spokesman for Savannah's city government said officials and the police department don't comment on pending litigation.Attorneys for Harvey's family said he was taking medication for depression and anxiety at the time of his fatal police interview. They said he not only threatened to kill himself in front of officers, but also began banging his head against a table.“Mr. Harvey was ignored, deliberately disregarded and mistreated,” Spence said.The attorneys said Savannah police not only should have prevented Harvey's death, but also have failed to make changes that would prevent people in custody from harming themselves in the future.“To hear how my child died from neglect, it tears me apart,” Harvey's mother, Shirley Harvey Francis, told reporters Tuesday.Speaking through tears, she said: “When my child died, they may as well have put me in a hole too.”",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835471,Kentucky prison supervisor convicted of covering up assaults,"LONDON, Ky. (AP) — A former supervisor at a federal prison in Kentucky has been convicted of writing false reports to cover up assaults on two inmates by corrections officers.Kevin Pearce, a former federal Bureau of Prisons lieutenant, was convicted on two counts of obstruction Monday after a six-day trial. Pearce, 38, was a former supervisor at the U.S. Penitentiary Big Sandy in eastern Kentucky. He could spend up to 20 years in prison, and his sentencing is scheduled for July 5.Pearce was supervising two corrections officers when they assaulted an inmate in 2021 by pepper spraying the inmate and kicking him in the head, according to evidence presented at trial. The two guards, Samuel Patrick and Clinton Pauley, testified at the trial that they attacked the inmate for walking too slowly to his cell, according to a release by the U.S. Department of Justice. Both said the inmate was not a threat, but Pearce wrote a report that said the inmate was violent and omitted that the inmate was kicked while laying on the ground, according to the Justice Department.A month later the the two guards committed another assault, this time on an inmate who had asked Pearce for protection from other inmates, according to evidence at the trial. The two guards “repeatedly struck him in the head and body,” and Pearce later wrote a false report that claimed the inmate went back to his cell without incident.Patrick and Pauley were indicted in May on charges of violating victims' constitutional rights as members of law enforcement. They both testified at Pearce's trial and both men reached plea agreements with prosecutors in February. They are scheduled to be sentenced in June.“While serving their sentence, inmates are entitled to equal protections under the law,” said Jodi Cohen, special agent in charge of the FBI's Louisville field office. “When a few correctional officers choose to violate those protections, either by physical abuse or by orchestrating a cover-up, the integrity of all officers is questioned.”",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835472,Mandatory paid time off: 'a strain' for Illinois business,"CHICAGO (AP) — Doug Knight's family has owned Springfield amusement park Knight's Action Park since 1930, himself for 43 of those years.The pandemic was a bear — Knight fought to keep his doors open, and when they closed for COVID-19, he pushed to reopen as soon as possible. Inflation, too, has been an obstacle. From inflatable inner tubes to chlorine for the pools, prices have risen for “everything we buy,"" and now a new Illinois law represents “another bump on the road” for business owners, he says.On Monday, Illinois became one of three U.S. states to mandate paid time off “for any reason,” up to 40 hours per year for full-time employees. Small business owners in Illinois say they know the importance of taking care of their workers, but some view the paid leave requirement as a government-imposed burden.“When you hit the big bump and go off the cliff, what does that do for ya?” Knight said.The legislation takes effect on Jan. 1, 2024. Employees will accrue one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked up to 40 hours total, and can start using the time once they've worked for 90 days.Knight and his brother, a co-owner, mainly employ seasonal employees not covered by the measure, but they will have to provide paid leave for 10 year-round workers. The veteran business owner said he isn’t worried and will juggle whatever comes next, though consumers will ultimately pay the difference.But proponents argue the policy supports both business owners and workers, and that guaranteeing paid leave will foster a healthier, more productive workforce.“When folks have the kind of paid time off they need, they’re able to stay home when they’re sick,” said Molly Weston Williamson, who tracks paid leave policy at the research and advocacy group Center for American Progress.For business owners concerned that the law will cause added strain amid difficult economic conditions, Williamson pointed out that Chicago and Cook County have had similar ordinances in place since 2017, and fears of devastating economic consequences never panned out.In fact, “our economy can’t afford not to provide these benefits,” Williamson said. “We can’t afford to pay for folks who are losing their job. We can’t afford to pay for folks who are getting sicker because they’re not getting the care they need. We can’t afford the impacts on our health care system.""Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, a Peoria Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said at Monday's bill signing that the law in particular will help low-wage workers, who are those less likely to have paid time off and who are disproportionately Black, Latino, and women.“Thanks to this measure, workers have the peace of mind that they can take care of themselves today without worrying about the consequences tomorrow,” Gordon-Booth said.Christell Frausto, a co-owner of TequilaRia Wine and Spirits in Peoria, said she sees paid leave as “an investment"" and hopes other business owners will too.Frausto, 38, said she already accommodates employees needing flexibility for emergencies, illness or personal events. She opened the boutique-style store focused on specialty products including women-owned brands and organic, gluten-free or low-calorie options two years ago.The pandemic was a clear sign that prioritizing workers is a necessary strategy for business owners, said Frausto, who hopes the lead-up to the law taking effect will give them time to budget and prepare.“They’re part of my team,” she said of her employees. “My interest is to take care of them just as much as my customers. I have to make sure they have a balance in life and work.”For Sandy and Dave Schoenborn, a couple who own the Lincoln Theatre in Belleville, Illinois, the state mandate is a major concern. “I'm pretty worried,” Sandy Schoeborn said. “Unless business gets better, it's gonna be a strain.”Paid leave is something employees should earn, not be entitled to, she said. “I can’t say no. If if I have a big event coming up and everybody decides to take off, I’m in a world of hurt.”Knight, the Springfield amusement park owner, said he does his best to take care of his employees. “If they have a reason, they can take off a day"" without pay, he said.“Car broke down, mom's sick, gotta take the dog to the vet... they're all important to the staff. But you can't close your business because everybody wants to take off cause there's a concert,” he said.The pandemic, inflation, utility prices — “it just all seems to be piling up,"" and mandatory paid leave is now another hurdle for business owners.“It just drives the cost up, drives the prices up, and the consumer pays the bill,” Knight said. ____Savage is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835473,Lawyers want Roger Goodell role cut in NFL race bias claims,"NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for NFL Coach Brian Flores and two other Black coaches asked a judge Tuesday to reconsider her decision letting some of a federal lawsuit's racial discrimination claims against the league and its teams possibly go before Commissioner Roger Goodell in arbitration proceedings rather than before a jury.In a Manhattan court filing, the lawyers said Judge Valerie E. Caproni should take another look at her March 1 ruling allowing most claims in a lawsuit by Flores to go before a jury but forcing claims by two other coaches into arbitration.They said the decision threatens the fairness of arbitration proceedings nationwide by upsetting “an extensive and well-developed body of case law requiring that arbitration be a reasonable replacement for a judicial forum.”The lawyers wrote that letting Goodell preside over claims by the coaches gives other employers a green light to insert “completely biased arbitrators” into arbitration agreements.They said they now fear that U.S. employers in other professions will seek to appoint their own chief executives or other “clearly biased” individuals as arbitrators. They said it also encourages employers to do away with neutral arbitral selection processes and other aspects of arbitration designed to ensure fairness.Lawyers for the NFL and Goodell did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Flores, the new defense coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, sued the NFL and three teams last year, saying the league was “rife with racism,” particularly in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches. Two other coaches, Steve Wilks and Ray Horton, later joined the lawsuit.In letting most claims by Flores go before a jury rather than to arbitration, Caproni said the case had shined “an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League” teams.“Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,” she wrote.But she also ruled that Goodell’s likely role as the arbitrator did not invalidate the arbitration agreements signed by Wilks and Horton, although she added that his role created a risk of bias, and that it was “worrisome” that an NFL statement on the day Flores sued said the lawsuit was without merit.Caproni noted that if Goodell is the arbitrator, she will retain authority to review his decisions.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835474,Gallego slams Sinema over 2018 bank deregulation vote,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego slammed independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona on Tuesday for backing a bank deregulation bill he says contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, highlighting Sinema's Wall Street ties as he campaigns for her seat.The contrast over the 2018 legislation feeds Gallego's push to portray Sinema as a friend of powerful interests, a central theme of the Senate campaign he launched in January.“It’s not like we received different information. We got the same pitches as all the members of Congress,” Gallego told reporters outside Silicon Valley Bank's offices in Tempe. “But when push came to shove, and the vote came to the floor, I voted to protect Arizona and she voted to protect Wall Street.”A spokesperson for Sinema, Hannah Hurley, said the senator is not focused on the election and declined to respond to Gallego’s comments.Sinema on Sunday applauded the Biden administration’s announcement that people who deposited money at the bank would have prompt access to it.“The federal government must now ensure those responsible are held accountable, while maintaining stability for all Americans who rely on our banking system,” she said in a statement.How much the regulatory rollback contributed to the Silicon Valley Bank failure is a matter of debate. The Federal Reserve announced Monday it will review its supervision of the bank to understand how it might have better managed its regulation. The Federal Reserve has faced stringent criticism for missing signs the bank was at risk.Silicon Valley Bank doesn’t have branches in Arizona but has hundreds of employees working from a lakefront office in a Phoenix suburb.Gallego said he supports the Biden administration's intervention to protect bank customers, adding, “This could have really spiraled out of control.” He said the banking system needs new safeguards for the modern world, where fears can spread quickly through social media and people can respond instantly by moving their money electronically.A Gallego spokesperson said he will co-sponsor legislation to repeal the 2018 rollback, which was introduced Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif.Sinema left the Democratic Party last year after frequently bucking the party and the White House. She has not said whether she will run for reelection in a three-way contest against a Democrat and Republican in one of the most closely watched 2024 Senate races.Sinema was one of 50 Democrats who voted for the 2018 legislation rolling back provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation measure, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis that spawned the Great Recession. Gallego voted against it.The rollback, which was pushed by President Donald Trump with bipartisan support, exempted banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets from requirements for regulators to routinely “stress test” them to see how they would fare in tough economic times. At the time, regional banking executives said they needed relief from burdensome oversight to better compete with the industry's biggest players.Silicon Valley’s CEO, Greg Becker, had lobbied Congress in support of the legislation.Donors tied to commercial banks have contributed $370,000 to Sinema’s House and Senate campaigns over the past five years, one of her top 20 contributors, according to OpenSecrets, a research group that tracks campaign spending.",2023/03/15,,World

(AP) — Antonina “Ann” Uccello, the first woman to be elected a mayor in Connecticut when she won an upset victory as a Republican in Hartford in 1967, has died. She was 100.Uccello, who went on to serve in the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations, died of natural causes Sunday night at a hospital in Hartford, said Jacqueline Gustafson, who is married to Uccello's nephew, David Gustafson.“She just had remarkable intellect, resiliency and determination,” Jacqueline Gustafson, of West Hartford, said in a phone interview Tuesday. “She was someone I greatly admired. ... Ann was always someone I could talk to.”Tributes from state political leaders poured in Tuesday afternoon as word of Uccello's passing began circulating.“Ann Uccello was a trailblazer who was born and raised in Hartford and dedicated her career in public service to the city she loved,” Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement. ""She had a remarkable spirit and energy, and she leaves a lasting legacy on Connecticut’s capitol city.”Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, also a Democrat, said Uccello shattered glass ceilings in the Connecticut political arena, then served as one of the highest-ranking women in the Nixon administration — as consumer affairs director in the Department of Transportation. She continued to work at the Transportation Department under Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.“I admired her ground breaking work as Mayor of Hartford,” Bysiewicz said in a statement. “She leaves a legacy that has and will continue to inspire generations of women to pursue careers in politics and public service.”Uccello, who has a street named after her in Hartford, served on the city council from 1963 to 1967 after working as a high school history teacher and in management positions at the G. Fox department store. In a heavily Democratic city, she defeated incumbent Mayor George Kinsella in the 1967 election and was re-elected two years later.As mayor, she was best known for comforting city residents and helping to prevent riots after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, according to Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame, where she was inducted in 1999. She also worked to protect children from lead poisoning and helped create low- and moderate-income housing, according to the Hall of Fame.Uccello also ran for the 1st Congressional District in the Hartford area in 1970, but lost a close race to Democrat William Cotter before taking the Department of Transportation job.Uccello was one of five daughters of immigrants from Sicily, Italy. After graduating from high school and then a private Roman Catholic college, she did graduate work at Trinity College in Hartford and the University of Connecticut Law School.She was a devout Christian and never married, Jacqueline Gustafson said.Gustafson said she once asked Uccello why she never married and Uccello responded, “I never met a man who deserved that much happiness.”Gustafson said Uccello's funeral is expected to be held next week and she will be buried at the historic Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, the final resting place of many notable Hartford residents and natives including actress Katharine Hepburn.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835483,Virginia deputies charged in man's death at mental hospital,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Seven Virginia sheriff's office employees have been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of a 28-year-old man at a state mental hospital last week, a local prosecutor said Tuesday.Henrico County Sheriff's Office personnel took the victim, Irvo Otieno, to Central State Hospital on March 6 to admit him as a patient, according to the prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth’s Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill. Otieno, who was physically restrained, died during the intake process, Baskervill said in a statement.“Mr. Otieno’s family was notified by my office this morning of these charges and I will continue to work with and for his family in relation to pursuing this case to its fullest extent,” Baskervill said.Baskervill's statement did not state a cause of death but said Otieno's body had been taken to a medical examiner's office for an autopsy.Otieno's family has previously raised concerns about his treatment, with his mother telling the Richmond Times-Dispatch for a story published Saturday that “something went wrong"" while he was in the government's custody.“The family is grief stricken after learning of the brutal nature of Ivor’s death and his inhumane treatment in the hours preceding his death. The public, and experienced mental health professionals alike, will be appalled when the facts of this case are fully disclosed,"" Mark Krudys, an attorney for the family, said in a statement, spelling Otieno's first name as he said the family refers to him.Otieno, whose family is from Kenya, was a deeply loved and well-regarded young man, an aspiring musician who had been a well-known high school athlete in the area, Krudys said.Henrico County Police have previously said in a news release that officers responding to a report of a possible burglary March 3 identified Otieno as a potential suspect. Based on their interaction with and observations of Otieno, officers put him under an emergency custody order. He was taken to a hospital for evaluation, the news release issued Friday said.At the hospital, Otieno “became physically assaultive toward officers, who arrested him” and took him to a local jail, which is managed by the Henrico Sheriff's Office, where he was served with several charges.Baskervill's statement said Henrico sheriff's office employees took him to Central State Hospital, located south of Richmond, just before 4 p.m. on March 6 to be admitted. Around 7:30 p.m., state police were called to investigate his death.State police investigators were told Otieno had “become combative during the admission process,” Baskervill's statement said.Virginia State Police spokesperson Corinne Geller confirmed Tuesday that the agency's investigation into the matter remains ongoing. She said state police have obtained hospital security footage as part of their criminal investigative file. There are no immediate plans to release it, she said.The seven Henrico County Sheriff’s Office employees turned themselves in Tuesday morning and were taken to a regional jail, where they are being held without bond, Baskervill said. Her statement did not specify their rank.Court records do not list defense attorneys for any of the seven defendants: Randy Joseph Boyer, 57, of Henrico; Dwayne Alan Bramble, 37, of Sandston; Jermaine Lavar Branch, 45, of Henrico; Bradley Thomas Disse, 43, of Henrico; Tabitha Renee Levere, 50, of Henrico; Brandon Edwards Rodgers, 48, of Henrico; and Kaiyell Dajour Sanders, 30, of North Chesterfield. The records show hearings scheduled in their cases Wednesday morning dealing with the appointment of counsel.Henrico County Sheriff Alisa Gregory said in a statement that her office was cooperating fully with state police and conducting its own internal review of the incident. She said seven deputies “who were transferring custody of Mr. Otieno” had been placed on administrative leave.“As Henrico County sheriff and on behalf of our entire office, I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Irvo Otieno,"" Gregory said.The body of Otieno was taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond for examination and an autopsy, Baskevill’s statement said. An administrator at that office referred questions from the AP to Geller, who said she couldn't release any information.___ Associated Press reporter Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835484,Arkansas lawmakers OK anti-abortion monument at Capitol,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A monument marking the number of abortions performed in Arkansas before Roe v. Wade was struck down would be built near the state Capitol under a bill lawmakers sent to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Tuesday.The majority-Republican House approved by a 60-19 vote a proposal allowing the creation of a “monument to the unborn” on the Capitol grounds. The bill, which the Senate approved earlier this month, requires the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement of the monument.It also requires the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission to oversee the selection of the artist and the design of the monument with input from anti-abortion groups.Republican Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill’s House sponsor, said the legislation would allow the state to raise private money for a memorial to “remember those children we were not able to protect and we will not be able to forget.”A law Arkansas approved in 2019 banning nearly all abortions took effect last year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1973 Roe decision. Arkansas' ban only allows abortions to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency.Tennessee lawmakers in 2018 approved legislation allowing a similar privately funded monument on its Capitol grounds. The monument has not yet been installed.The Arkansas monument proposal drew objections from some anti-abortion Republicans who said it would be counterproductive, and that efforts should instead focus on other needs such as helping pregnant women and foster children.Republican Rep. Steve Unger, one of two Republicans who voted against the measure, said the monument “has the look and feel of spiking the football” following last year's ruling.“Public memorials to our nation's wars where we face an external threat are right and proper,” Unger said. “A memorial to an ongoing culture war where we seem to be shooting at each other is not.”Republican Rep. Jeremiah Moore, who also voted against the measure, said the monument would amount to a “poke in the eye to all those who do not share our beliefs.""“This monument will do nothing for the pro-life cause as we move forward together,” Moore said. “It will only be used as a weapon to rally against pro-life values through fundraising and stirring up anger and vitriol.”Ten Republicans and one Democrat voted “present” on the bill, which has the same effect as voting against it.The legislation doesn't specify where the monument would go on the Capitol grounds, which includes several other monuments, including one honoring the nine Black students who desegregated Little Rock Central High School. The Capitol grounds also include a Ten Commandments monument that was installed in 2018.Democrats have criticized the proposal, saying it's politicizing the Capitol grounds rather than focusing on monuments that unite people.“This is injecting a contentious political issue to the grounds of the state Capitol, and it’s doing so in a way that I would have to imagine is going to be painful for a lot of women who have gotten abortions in the last 50 years,” Democratic Sen. Clarke Tucker told the Senate when it took up the proposal earlier this month.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835485,Fed criticized for missing red flags before bank collapse,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is facing stinging criticism for missing what observers say were clear signs that Silicon Valley Bank was at high risk of collapsing into the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.Critics point to many red flags surrounding the bank, including its rapid growth since the pandemic, its unusually high level of uninsured deposits and its many investments in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which tumbled in value as interest rates rose.“It’s inexplicable how the Federal Reserve supervisors could not see this clear threat to the safety and soundness of banks and to financial stability,” said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group.Wall Street traders and industry analysts “have been publicly screaming about these very issues for many, many months going back to last fall,"" Kelleher added.The Fed was the primary federal supervisor of the bank based in Santa Clara, California, that failed last week. The bank was also overseen by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.Now the consequences of the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, along with New York-based Signature Bank, which failed over the weekend, are complicating the Fed's upcoming decisions about how high to raise its benchmark interest rate in the fight against chronically high inflation.Many economists say the central bank would likely have raised rates by an aggressive half-point next week at its meeting, which would amount to a step up in its inflation fight, after the Fed implemented a quarter-point hike in February. Its rate currently stands at about 4.6%, the highest level in 15 years.Last week, many economists suggested that Fed policymakers would raise their projection for future rates next week to 5.6%. Now it's suddenly unclear how many additional rate increases the Fed will forecast.With the collapse of the two large banks fueling anxiety about other regional banks, the Fed may focus more on boosting confidence in the financial system than on its long-term drive to tame inflation.The latest government report on inflation, released Tuesday, shows that price increases remain far higher than the Fed prefers, putting Chair Jerome Powell in a tougher spot. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs and are seen as a better gauge of longer-run inflation, jumped 0.5% from January to February — the most since September. That is far higher than is consistent with the Fed's 2% annual target.“Absent the fallout from the bank failure, it may have been a close call, but I think it would have tipped them towards a half-point (rate hike) at this meeting,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.On Monday, Powell announced that the Fed would review its supervision of Silicon Valley to understand how it might have better managed its regulation of the bank. The review will be conducted by Michael Barr, the Fed vice chair who oversees bank oversight, and will be publicly released May 1.A Federal Reserve spokesperson declined to comment further.Elizabeth Smith, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, said, “We are actively investigating the situation and conducting a thorough review to ensure the Department is doing everything we can to protect Californians.”By all accounts, Silicon Valley was an unusual bank. Its management took excessive risks by buying billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds when interest rates were low. As the Fed continually raised interest rates to fight inflation, leading to higher rates on Treasurys, the value of Silicon Valley Bank's bonds steadily lost value.Most banks would have sought to make other investments to offset that risk. The Fed could have also forced the bank to raise additional capital.The bank had grown rapidly. Its assets quadrupled in five years to $209 billion, making it the 16th-largest bank in the country. And roughly 94% of its deposits were uninsured because they exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 insurance cap.That percentage was the second highest among banks with more than $50 billion in assets, according to ratings agency S&P. Signature had the fourth-highest percentage of uninsured deposits.Such an unusually high proportion made Silicon Valley Bank highly susceptible to the risk that depositors would quickly withdraw their money at the first sign of trouble — a classic bank run — which is exactly what happened.“I’m at a loss for words to understand how this business model was deemed acceptable by their regulators,"" said Aaron Klein, a former congressional aide, now at the Brookings Institution, who worked on the Dodd-Frank banking regulation law that was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.The bank failures will likely color an upcoming Fed review of rules that set out how much money large banks must hold in reserve. Barr said last year that he wanted to conduct a “holistic” review of those requirements, raising concerns in the banking industry that the review would lead to rules forcing banks to hold more reserves, which would limit their ability to lend.Many critics also point to a 2018 law as softening bank regulations in ways that contributed to Silicon Valley's failure. Pushed by the Trump administration with bipartisan support in Congress, the law exempted banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets — Silicon Valley's size — from requirements that included regular examinations of how they would fare in tough economic times, known as “stress tests.”Silicon Valley’s CEO, Greg Becker, had lobbied Congress in support of the rollback in regulations, and he served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco until the day of the collapse.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, asked him him about his lobbying in a letter released Tuesday.“These rules were designed to safeguard our banking system and economy from the negligence of bank executives like yourself — and their rollback, along with atrocious risk management policies at your bank, have been implicated as chief causes of its failure,” Warren's letter said.The 2018 law also provided the Fed with more discretion in its bank oversight. The central bank subsequently voted to further reduce regulation for banks the size of Silicon Valley.In October 2019, the Fed voted to effectively reduce the capital those banks had to hold in reserve.Kelleher said the Fed still could have pushed Silicon Valley Bank to take steps to protect itself.“Nothing in that law prevented in any way the Federal Reserve supervisors from doing their job,” Kelleher said.___AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835486,Pratt said he stayed in Cincy because he wants to win,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt said he wanted to stay in Cincinnati because he sees the Bengals continuing to win with Joe Burrow as quarterback.“I want to win, they want to win, so I want to be back,"" said Pratt, who signed a three-year contract on Tuesday.The deal is worth $21 million, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Monday.“We’re close. It was a fact. I want to win,” said Pratt, who has been a key member of the Bengals defense for the past two seasons. ”I’m big on loyalty. They gave me an opportunity when I got in the league, so why would I try to leave for a team that wasn’t as successful for more money?""The four-year veteran was an integral part of a defense that helped propel the Bengals to a second straight division title and deep playoff run.A third-round draft pick in 2019, Pratt set career highs in tackles (99), tackles for loss (six), passes defended (10) and interceptions (two). He has started each of his past 37 regular-season games played, going back to 2020.The Bengals already lost their two starting safeties to free agency with Jessie Bates getting a four-year deal from the Atlanta Falcons and Vonn Bell headed to the Panthers.Bates played the 2022 season with the franchise tag after failing to reach a long-term deal with the Bengals last summer.The Bengals are expected to be conservative in free agency as they negotiate a long-term pact with Burrow, who became eligible for a contract extension at the end of the season.“If Joe Burrow is going to be around for a lot of years, then I need to be around to win,” Pratt said.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835487,AP source: Colts planning to release Matt Ryan in cap move,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts acquired Matt Ryan last March thinking he would help them make a postseason run, maybe even win a Super Bowl.Now the two sides are now splitting up — and Ryan's long career could be over.Indy plans to release the quarterback officially Wednesday, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. The person requested anonymity because the decision has not been announced publicly.By releasing the 37-year-old Ryan, the Colts will save about $17.2 million in salary cap space next season. Indy also saved an additional nearly $8 million by trading veteran cornerback Stephon Gilmore to Dallas for a fifth-round pick, though they'll use some of that by signing former Los Angeles Rams kicker Matt Gay.Gay confirmed the deal in two Twitter posts — one thanking the Rams and their fans, the other announcing his excitement for joining Indy.But the Ryan move came as no surprise.Indy holds the No. 4 overall pick in next month's NFL draft and most analysts expect it to select one of four quarterbacks — 2021 Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young, two-time Big Ten offensive player of the year C.J. Stroud, strong-armed Will Levis or Anthony Richardson.“We get caught up in arm strength, but guys that are accurate and who makes plays when the game is on the line,” general manager Chris Ballard said two weeks ago, explaining what he values in quarterbacks. “You look around the league and I think you can track this back to 7-on-7 back in high schools, 20, 25 years ago — you’re getting a lot more athletes playing the position.”Some even believe Indy may trade up for one of the top three though the reported deal between Chicago and quarterback-needy Carolina for the top overall pick could complicate Indy's plans. Houston, also a quarterback-needy team, picks second while Arizona is at No. 3 but already has Kyler Murray signed to a long-term deal.The likelihood of adding a young, franchise quarterback to provide stability for a team that has used a different opening day starter for six straight seasons made Ryan and his $35.2 cap hit expendable.What's next for the league's 2016 MVP also remains unclear.In January, Ryan said he wasn't ready to would retire and that he could still play at a high level.His film and stats revealed a different story.Ryan struggled in his only season with the Colts, playing for two head coaches, two offensive coordinators and two play-callers while working behind an offensive line that allowed the NFL's second-highest sacks total (60). Injuries also slowed 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor and having just one consistent receiving option — Michael Pittman Jr. — didn't help.The result: Ryan finished with the league's second-most giveaways (18) despite playing five fewer games than Josh Allen (19), was sacked 40 times and benched twice in his only season in Indy.With Ryan set to turn 38 just six days after new Colts coach Shane Steichen celebrates his 38th birthday in May and coming off the worst season of his career made it almost impossible to keep the four-time Pro Bowler especially without taking a huge pay cut.“I still love playing and I think obviously, not committed to anything, here, wherever, I have to see how it shakes out,” Ryan said in January. “But I still love playing and still feel like honestly, I still feel like there’s a lot of good football in my body. We’ll see what happens.”Ryan played his first 14 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, where he became the franchise's career leader in all of the major passing categories after being selected No. 3 overall out of Boston College. He won the NFL's 2008 Offensive Rookie of the Award and his high school in Philadelphia was featured on ABC's hit comedy “The Goldbergs.”Ryan ranks fifth all time in completions (5,551), seventh in yards passing (62,792) and ninth in touchdown passes (381).The Colts might not be finished making moves.They must still decide what to do with 34-year-old backup Nick Foles, the Super Bowl 52 MVP who made two starts before an injury ended his season. Foles joined Indy in part because he wanted to reunite with coach Frank Reich, who was fired in October and has since been hired by Carolina, and is under contract for $3.6 million next season when he could serve as a mentor to whomever the Colts draft.Releasing him would save an additional $2.5 million and would likely put Indy in the market for a low-priced backup or a bridge starter until a rookie is ready to play.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

It was Alcaraz’s 101st ATP Tour victory.“I would say I returned well, I hit great shots,” Alcaraz said. ""I finished the match with confidence in my shots, to come into the next round with more confidence.”Draper was affected by an abdominal injury that first surfaced in his win against Andy Murray a day earlier. The injury affected the Brit's serve, which dropped well below 100 mph, and his movement. A trainer visited him between sets and Draper won just one point in the first two games of the second set before quitting.Top-ranked Iga Swiatek moved on with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Emma Raducanu.Coco Gauff rallied from a break down in the third set to beat Swedish qualifier Rebecca Peterson, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 and reach the quarterfinals.Down 2-4, Gauff fought her way back and saved three break points while serving at 4-all before closing out the match in the next game.Four years ago, Peterson routed a then-14-year-old Gauff at a Challenger tournament in Michigan.“She whooped me really bad,” Gauff said on court.

It was definitely a crazy match.”Medvedev took a medical timeout to have his ankle taped in the second set before going on to notch his 17th consecutive match win and improve to 22-2 this year.“This one was definitely the toughest one of all,” he said on court.Zverev added to the drama by saving a match point and breaking for 5-5 in the final set.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835490,"Gilmore, Waller on the move; Bradberry stays with Eagles","Stephon Gilmore is on the move again, Darren Waller is getting traded from the Raiders less than two weeks after marrying Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum and James Bradberry is staying in Philadelphia.Those were among the biggest moves on the eve of free agency Tuesday, the second day in which teams were allowed to negotiate with unrestricted free agents.The deals can’t be announced until the start of the league year on Wednesday and therefore were confirmed to The Associated Press by people speaking on condition of anonymity.In other notable decisions, the Indianapolis Colts will release longtime NFL quarterback Matt Ryan in a cost-cutting move Wednesday and the Carolina Panthers, who own the top pick in the NFL draft next month and are targeting a quarterback, found their stop-gap QB when they agreed to a two-year, $10 million contract with unrestricted free agent Andy Dalton.While no teams spent as the Denver Broncos did on Day 1, when they committed a whopping $219.25 million in salaries to a half dozen players, there was plenty of action leading up to the official start of the league year, which arrives at 4 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.The Broncos' new Walton-Penner ownership group, by far the richest in the league, continued its spending spree Tuesday by agreeing to a two-year, $7.5 million deal with former Bengals running back Samaje Perine.Denver's starter last season, Javonte Williams, is still recovering from a knee injury he sustained in 2022 and could miss half of the upcoming season.That deal followed Monday's agreements to acquire tackle Mike McGlinchey (five years, $87.5 million), guard Ben Powers (four years, $52 million), end Zach Allen (three years, $45.75 million), QB Jarrett Stidham, (two years, $10 million), TE Chris Manhertz (two years, $6 million) and ILB Alex Singleton (three years, $18 million).The Las Vegas Raiders were busy again Tuesday, agreeing to a three-year, $33 million deal with former Patriots wide receiver Jakobi Meyers, who reunites with Raiders coach Josh McDaniels, his former offensive coordinator in New England.Meyers, who has averaged 70 catches and 800 receiving yards over the past three seasons, was involved in one of the worst gaffes in NFL history when he attempted an unnecessary lateral across the field to quarterback Mac Jones on the final play of a tie game that was headed to overtime in December. Chandler Jones snatched the ball in the air and raced for a touchdown to give the Raiders a win over the Patriots.The Raiders' acquisition of Meyers helped make Waller expendable. They agreed to send Waller to the New York Giants for a 2023 third-round draft pick.Waller, who made the Pro Bowl in 2020, gives Giants quarterback Daniel Jones a major playmaker and an upgrade at tight end. Last year’s starter, Daniel Bellinger, caught 30 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns.Waller twice has surpassed 1,000 receiving yards, in 2019 and 2020, before injuries cut into his production the past two seasons. In 2022, Waller caught 28 passes for 388 yards and three TDs, missing eight games because of a pulled hamstring.The trade for Waller, 30, is an effort to boost the Giants’ offensive talent around Jones, who agreed to a four-year, $160 million extension this offseason.Now the Raiders’ offense includes quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, running back Josh Jacobs and receivers Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow and Meyers. The Raiders agreed to a deal with Garoppolo on Monday and placed the franchise tag on Jacobs last week.The trade of Waller frees up about $11 million in salary cap space for the Raiders.In the NFC, the Dallas Cowboys acquired cornerback Stephon Gilmore from the Indianapolis Colts for a fifth-round draft pick. The addition of the five-time Pro Bowler came on the same day Dallas re-signed safety Donovan Wilson as the Cowboys try to further bolster a defense that carried the club at times during a second consecutive playoff season in 2022.The Cowboys will give up a compensatory fifth-round pick in this year’s draft. It will be the third team in three seasons for Gilmore, the 2019 AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year when he was with New England.The 32-year-old Gilmore played 16 games for the Colts last season, finishing with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups as a four-year Pro Bowl run ended.The trade pairs Gilmore with 2021 NFL interceptions leader Trevon Diggs, who had 11 of his 17 career picks that season. Diggs dropped off to three interceptions last year.The Cowboys also continued a trend of preferring their own free agents when they agreed to contracts to keep leading tackler Wilson (three years, $24 million) and linebacker Leighton Vander Esch (two years, $11 million) in Dallas.The NFC champion Eagles agreed to a three-year, $38 million contract to keep Bradberry, a second-team All-Pro cornerback, in Philadelphia.Bradberry joined the Eagles last year after he was released by the Giants and played a key role in the secondary for the NFL’s top-ranked pass defense. He helped the Eagles reach the Super Bowl but his holding penalty on Kansas City’s JuJu Smith-Schuster late in the fourth quarter set up the go-ahead field goal in Philadelphia’s 38-35 loss.___AP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Schuyler Dixon and Josh Dubow and AP Sports Writers Kyle Hightower, Steve Reed and Mike Marot contributed.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835510,Bill restricting electric car stores now law in Mississippi,"JACKSON, Miss (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves signed a bill Tuesday restricting electric car manufacturers from selling vehicles in person unless they open franchised dealerships.Defying calls from some fellow Republicans in the Legislature to veto the measure, Reeves enacted into law House Bill 401, introduced by Republican Rep. Trey Lamar of Senatobia. The law will force electric car companies such as Tesla and Rivian to sell vehicles through franchises rather than company-owned stores, which is how they currently operate.“Almost 200 small businesses in communities across our state are seeking assurances that big manufacturers can’t just destroy their businesses. That’s fair!” Reeves, a Republican, said in a statement posted to social media. “I also recognize that innovation in this industry is inevitable. And with innovation comes new companies with new business models. I am committed to find long-term solutions—in an ever changing market.”The bill does not restrict the sale of electric cars, as people can buy them online. But if they want to buy an electric car in person, they would have to drive to the state’s only Tesla store in Brandon, which will be allowed to remain open under the new law. Tesla or any other electric car company could not open a new brick-and-mortar location to sell cars unless they enter a franchise agreement.Before the bill passed in a bipartisan 39-13 vote on March 3, it sparked an intraparty debate among GOP lawmakers. Opponents said it would interfere with the automobile market and stop electric carmakers from bringing new technology and jobs to the state. Proponents said the law would ensure all car manufacturers, regardless of their business model, play by the same rules.Republican Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Republican from Pascagoula, had hoped Reeves would veto the legislation. Lawmakers were aiming to attract Tesla to Mississippi's Gulf Coast, an area Wiggins called the state’s economic driver.""In today's world, if you don't innovate, you lose out. We as a state cannot afford to lose out,"" Wiggins told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “My vote against the bill was a vote for capitalism, competition and innovation rather than for a policy of protectionism.”___Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835511,"Haaland hits 5, Pep reveals Julia Roberts disappointment","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — On a night when Erling Haaland set new standards in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola was preoccupied with Hollywood star Julia Roberts.Never mind a record equalling five goals in one match – or the Manchester City striker becoming the fastest and youngest player to score 30 in European club soccer’s elite competition. Guardiola had other things on his mind after the 7-0 rout of Leipzig on Tuesday as City advanced to the quarterfinals with an 8-1 aggregate win.Oscar winner Roberts, the City manager explained, is one of his three idols, along with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.But on a visit to the U.K. she chose to watch Manchester United, rather than Guardiola’s City team, which has won four Premier League titles in five years.“She came in the period where we were better than United, in these four or five years,” he said. “And she went to visit Man United. She didn’t come to see us. That’s why this is… even if I win the Champions League (it) will not be compared for the fact that Julia Roberts came to Manchester and didn’t come to see us.”Guardiola’s comments provided a digression from Haaland’s goal scoring feats on a night when he looked like the man to finally end City’s search for a first Champions League title.So much for the suggestions the Norway striker is something of a problem for Pep Guardiola.He is a goal machine who produced a statement performance to fire City into the quarterfinals.“I’m blurry in my head. I remember shooting but not thinking,” Haaland said after he matched Lionel Messi and Luiz Adriano by scoring five in a single Champions League game.Haaland needed only 25 games to score 30 goals, surpassing the record held by former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who reached that benchmark in 34.At 22 years, 236 days old, Haaland is also the youngest player to score 30 Champions League goals — beating Kylian Mbappé, who had broken Messi's record.That is exalted company to keep and was the perfect response to suggestions Haaland may have had a negative effect on a City team that trails first-place Arsenal by five points in the Premier League.“The problem is every time he doesn’t score two or three goals we will be criticized for the rest of his career,” Guardiola said.Haaland has now scored 39 goals this season in all competitions. Yet the English champions’ over-reliance on him has led to criticism that they have become more predictable since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund last summer.But his record in Europe could prove a game-changer in City’s pursuit of the biggest prize in club soccer.Despite dominating the Premier League since being taken over by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family in 2008, the club has endured a succession of disappointments in the Champions League — reaching the final just once, losing to Chelsea in 2021.Guardiola is still waiting to win the competition for the first time since lifting it twice with Barcelona — in 2009 and 2011.The Catalan coach has also never won it without Messi, who was the talisman of his brilliant Barcelona team.In Haaland, who scored his five goals in a 35-minute spell either side of halftime, he may have finally found an inspirational figure to emulate the Argentine maestro.“Incredible guy, huge talent. Power, mentality, he’s a serial winner,” Guardiola said before sounding a note of caution when recounting previous exits from the competition.“We scored four goals here against Real Madrid, six against Monaco, four against Tottenham. A lot of the time we were out because we conceded a lot.”Haaland wanted to be given the chance to score a double hat trick, which would have set a new goals record in a single Champions League game.“My super strength is scoring goals,"" he said.Guardiola said he did not know that the record was there to be taken.For all the personal benchmarks reached by Haaland, of most importance to City is a place in the final eight.Haaland opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 22nd minute when Benjamin Henrichs was adjudged to have handled in the box after a video review.He had his second and his 30th in the Champions League when heading in a rebound in the 24th after Kevin de Bruyne hit the bar.His hat trick goal came in the the second minute of first-half stoppage time when bundling the ball over line after Ruben Dias hit the post with a header.Ilkay Gundogan made it 4-0 just four minutes into the second half and Haaland scored two more in the 54th and 57th.De Bruyne rounded off the scoring to make it 7-0 on the night with a curling shot into the top corner in time added on.Guardiola has repeatedly claimed he does not feel added pressure to win the Champions League, but it will remain a blot on his City reign if he cannot deliver the title before walking away from the club.Haaland could change all of that — and perhaps even tempt Roberts to a City game on her next trip to the U.K.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835513,Remains of 160 people found in Bay Area cremation warehouse,"HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) — San Francisco Bay Area officials were working Tuesday to identify the families of 160 people whose remains were found in a warehouse used by a cremation business whose license was suspended.Six bodies and the ash remains of 154 other people were found earlier this month at a warehouse in Hayward after the California Cemetery and Funeral Bureau received several complaints from customers saying Oceanview Cremations had stopped responding to them, Alameda County Sheriff Lt. Tya Modeste said.Oceanview Cremations had a corporate license that was suspended in 2018 and an individual license under the same name that was suspended last year and was not supposed to be operating or keeping remains in a warehouse, Modeste said.“Many of the families say that they paid to have their loved one's ashes dispersed at sea, and obviously that didn’t happen,"" she said.Other families complained Oceanview Cremations, which is based in Hayward, a city 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco, did not return their messages when seeking to pick up their loved one's remains.“One family said they called over 100 times and they never got a call back,” Modeste said.Modeste said the remains date back to 2013 and that Oceanview Cremations received them from families in 15 Northern California counties but that the business did a poor job keeping records and that no contracts were found.She said the business owner, Robert Smith, was not cooperating with officials. A telephone number listed for the company was disconnected, and Smith couldn't be reached for comment.The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau has identified five of the bodies and has a tentative identification of the other one, Modeste said. The ash remains have tags with names and the county where the person died, but no other information or contact information for next of kin, she said.Officials now have to check different databases to find out their relatives. So far, 11 families of the deceased have been contacted, she said.Anyone who used Oceanview Cremations between 2013 and 2022 to arrange their loved one’s cremation and who may have questions about what happened to those remains should contact Alameda County officials.",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835514,Protesters back Senegal's opposition leader ahead of trial,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Senegal's capital Tuesday in a peaceful show of support for the country's opposition leader who's facing trial later this week.It was the first of several days of scheduled demonstrations backing Ousmane Sonko. The 46-year-old politician will go to court Thursday, after being charged in a civil lawsuit against him by Senegal’s tourism minister for alleged defamation and public insults.The case stems from accusations Sonko made against the minister during a news conference late last year. He had claimed the tourism minister allegedly stole $47 million from a government agency.Protesters gathered in Dakar's suburbs, shouting and chanting.“We are here to support our leader, Ousmane Sonko. We will do everything to ensure that he is not imprisoned. He is not guilty of anything,” said Moustapha Diedhiou.Sonko’s supporters see the charges against him as the latest attempt to cut short his political career, including his likely presidential candidacy in 2024. Sonko finished third in Senegal’s 2019 presidential election and has called on President Macky Sall to declare publicly that he won’t seek a third term.The ruling party says Sall should be allowed to run after a constitutional change in 2016 —made while Sall was president — which changed presidential terms to five years.Along with the defamation trial, Sonko also faces rape charges based on accusations from a female employee who said she was assaulted at a massage salon. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and would be barred from running for president. No date is set for the this trial.Government spokesman Abdou Karim Fofana maintained, in comments to The Associated Press, that Sonko is politicizing a legal problem between two citizens and that the government will ensure order at any cost.In 2021, days of deadly protests erupted after Sonko was arrested for disturbing public order while on his way to the courthouse for a scheduled appearance in the rape case. At least 13 people died during the worst violence to rock Senegal in years.With elections less than a year away, Sonko's supporters say they won't back down. “(The government's) objective is to prevent the candidacy of our leader in the next presidential election,” said Mamadou Fall. ""We will not accept it,” he said.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835521,Japan's big firms set to offer biggest pay rises in decades,"Big Japanese firms are set to offer the largest pay rises in a quarter century this year driven by inflation at 41-year high, in a sign that cash-rich firms may be warming to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's calls to boost consumption through higher wages.As annual labour talks dubbed ""shunto"", Japanese for ""spring offensive"", wrap up at many blue-chips on Wednesday, positive signs are emerging Japan Inc may be ready to boost wages to a level that can at least offset high living costs amid surging import inflation.Major firms are expected to raise wages by 2.85%, according to a survey of 33 economists taken by Japan Economic Research Center (JERC), far above last year's 2.2% and the fastest gain since 1997 when Japan slid into 15 years of deflation.Given that consumer inflation, at 4.1%, outpace wage hikes, pay rises of 3% or more need to continue in the coming years to sustain price stability at 2%, said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.""Average wage hikes that are consistent with the central bank's 2% price target are 3% which can be met this year albeit temporarily,"" Yamada said.Takahide Kiuchi, a former Bank of Japan board member who is now executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, said base pay rises hold the key in determining how wages may affect prices.The JERC survey showed that excluding seniority-based pay, base compensation that boosts fixed labour costs accounts for just 1.08%.""We need to focus on base pay. It will likely be a little above 1%, still way lower than price increase,"" Kiuchi said.Kishida's government will likely hold a joint three-party meeting with labour and management for the first time in eight years on Wednesday to ensure structural wage hikes.FOLLOW THE PACE-SETTERThere are already some encouraging signs.Workers from Japan's largest group of trade unions last week struck early agreements for hefty wage hikes. Other unions from Toyota, the world's No. 1 automaker, and Honda, have also secured their biggest pay rises in decades.What's unique about shunto in Japan is that every March, more than 300 major firms capitalised at 1 billion yen or more and with 1,000 or more workers, negotiate with their union following wages pace-setters such as Toyota Motor Corp.Company unionists have historically tended to settle for relatively meagre pay hikes around 2% in recent years, as unions are inclined to cooperate with management in keeping job security rather than aggressively demanding pay rises.It remains unclear, however, whether the wave of wage hikes could spread to small firms, which employ seven out of 10 workers but struggle to pass on costs to their bigger clients at the end of supply chains.Some analysts are also sceptical that unions will be as aggressive in demanding higher pay in coming years if inflation eases, as it is expected to from the middle of the year.Real wages fell in January at the fastest pace since May 2014 when the sales tax was raised to 8% from 5%.Japan's wages have grown just about 5% over the last 30 years, far below an average 35% gain among member countries during the same period, OECD data shows.(Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Sam Holmes)",2023/03/15,226,World

Yui reiterated that Taiwan and Honduras have been friends for more than 80 years. Over the years, Taiwan has promoted many cooperation projects with the Honduran government to benefit the people of the two countries, he said. 
""Taiwan is a sincere and reliable ally of Honduras,"" he said.
""The government and people of Taiwan have always assisted in Honduras' development and construction within the scope of their capabilities and have lent a helping hand when it was most needed,"" Yui added, which is in contrast to the ""flashy promises"" made by the Chinese dictatorship.
Beijing intends to wrest control of Taiwan's diplomatic relations and reduce Taiwan's international space, the vice minister said. He reminded Honduras to carefully consider its decision and not to ""fall into China's trap"" by damaging the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Honduras President Xiomara Castro announced on Tuesday (March 14) that she will establish diplomatic relations with China.

            Castro revealed in a tweet that she had instructed Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Reina to oversee the process of forming official ties with Beijing. She justified her decision as being “a sign of my determination to fulfill the government plan and expand borders.”

            Castro had pledged to recognize Beijing during her presidential campaign but seemingly backtracked once she took office.

            Chinese Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Xie Feng (謝峰) met with Reina in January when the two both attended Brazilian President Lula da Silva’s inauguration. The two ministers reportedly discussed potential cooperation on the Patuca II hydropower project in Honduras.











            However, Reina later stressed that the conversation with Xie ""was a purely commercial issue, we maintain the relationship with Taiwan.”

            Honduras' sudden decision will leave Taiwan with only 13 remaining diplomatic allies. Over the past decade, Taiwan has slowly lost multiple Central American allies to China, including Costa Rica in 2007, Panama in 2017, Dominican Republic and El Salvador in 2018, and Nicaragua in 2021.

            Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said it has ""expressed serious concerns"" to the Honduran government, per a MOFA press release. Taiwan has made it clear many times to Honduras that it is a sincere and reliable cooperative partner, MOFA said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835529,"US says Russian jet caused spy drone crash over Black Sea, Moscow denies collision","The U.S. military said a Russian fighter plane clipped the propeller of one its spy drones and made it crash into the Black Sea on Tuesday in the first such direct encounter between the two world powers since Russia invaded Ukraine over a year ago.The Russian defence ministry offered a different account and Moscow's ambassador to Washington said his country ""views this incident as a provocation"" involving a U.S. MQ-9 drone and Russian Su-27 fighter jet.The United States, which has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, has not become directly engaged in the war but it does conduct regular surveillance flights in the region.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday night that military commanders were unanimously in favour of defending the eastern frontline, including the ruined city of Bakhmut, which has been under siege by Russia for months.""The main focus was on ... Bakhmut,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. ""There was a clear position of the entire command: Strengthen this sector and destroy the occupiers to the maximum.""Zelenskiy dismissed three regional governors, including Luhansk in the east, Odesa on the Black Sea in the south and Khnelnitskiy region in the west, but no reason was given in the announcement by the government's parliamentary representative.On the diplomatic and economic fronts, talks continued to extend a deal to allow grain shipments from Ukraine's Black Sea ports that is due to expire this week, the United Nations and Turkey said. The Kyiv government rejected a Russian push for a 60-day renewal, half the term of the previous renewal.DRONE CRASHTwo Russian Su-27 jets carried out what the U.S. military described as a reckless intercept of the American spy drone while flying in international air space. It said the Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on the MQ-9 - possibly trying to blind or damage it - and flew in front of it in unsafe manoeuvres.After around 30 to 40 minutes, at 7:03 a.m. (0603 GMT), one of the jets then collided with the drone, causing it to crash, the U.S. military said.Russia has not recovered the drone and the jet was likely damaged, the Pentagon said.""In fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash,"" U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, who oversees the U.S. Air Force in the region, said in a statement.Russia's defence ministry denied that its aircraft had come into contact with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which it said had crashed after ""sharp manoeuvring"". It said the drone had been detected near the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.""The Russian fighters did not use their onboard weapons, did not come into contact with the UAV and returned safely to their home airfield,"" the defence ministry said.The accounts of the incident in the Black Sea, which is bordered by Russia and Ukraine among other countries, could not be independently verified.""This is a very sensitive stage in this conflict because it really is the first direct contact that the public knows about between the West and Russia,"" said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SUMMONEDRussia's Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov was summoned by the U.S. State Department to discuss what happened over the Black Sea, said spokesperson Ned Price.Antonov said his meeting was ""constructive"" and the issue of possible ""consequences"" for Moscow was not raised, RIA state news agency reported.""As for us, we do not want any confrontation between the United States and Russia. We are in favour of building pragmatic relations for the benefit of the Russian and American peoples,"" Antonov was quoted as saying.Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed Moscow's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as a defensive one against what he sees as a hostile West bent on expanding into territories historically ruled by Russia.Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is waging an unprovoked war of conquest that has destroyed Ukrainian cities, killed thousands of people and forced millions more to flee their homes.(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; writing by Grant McCool; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2023/03/15,185,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835540,Bally Sports owner files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,"Diamond Sports Group, the largest owner of regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. The move came after it missed a $140 million interest payment last month.Diamond owns 19 networks under the Bally Sports banner. Those networks have the rights to 42 professional teams — 14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL.The company said in a release Tuesday night that it expects to continue to operate during the bankruptcy process and that coverage of games should not be affected.Diamond Sports also said it is negotiating a restructuring agreement with debt holders that will eliminate most of its debt. Under an agreement with creditors, it would become a separate company from Sinclair Broadcast Group.“DSG will continue broadcasting games and connecting fans across the country with the sports and teams they love,"" Diamond Sports CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. ""We look forward to working constructively with our team and league partners and all DSG stakeholders throughout this process and beyond.”Diamond said in a financial filing last fall it had debt of $8.67 billion. The bankruptcy filing was made in the Southern District of Texas.Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s film and television assets to be approved.Diamond has nearly $1 billion in rights payments, mostly to baseball teams, due in the first quarter this year. The company is current on payments to hockey and basketball teams, but it might withhold payments from some baseball teams where it is trying to renegotiate a better deal.Major League Baseball has set up a local media department in case it has to take over broadcasts for teams. Games would air locally via MLB Network or streamed on MLB.TV in case that happened.“Diamond Sports Group’s bankruptcy declaration today is an unfortunate development that we have been expecting. Despite Diamond’s economic situation, there is every expectation that they will continue televising all games they are committed to during the bankruptcy process,"" MLB said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""Over the long term, we will reimagine our distribution model to address the changing media climate and ultimately reach an even larger number of fans.”Diamond Sports isn't the only company experiencing financial woes with its regional sports networks. Warner Bros. Discovery, which has an ownership stake in three of the AT&T SportsNet networks, has given the Colorado Rockies, Houston Astros and Pittsburgh Pirates until March 31 to reclaim their broadcast rights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835545,"Cavs defeat sloppy Hornets again without Mitchell, Allen","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Evan Mobley had 26 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers scored 35 points off Charlotte turnovers to beat the Hornets for the second time in three days, 120-104 on Tuesday night.Cedi Osman scored 24 points off the bench and Caris LeVert added 22 points and seven assists for the Cavaliers, who played without All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell (sprained finger) and center Jarrett Allen (eye contusion).Darius Garland chipped in 19 points for the Cavaliers, who entered the game in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, 3 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia 76ers. The Cavs have won five of their last six games.“We're ready for that playoff basketball mindset,” said Cavaliers forward Lamar Stevens, who got the start at the 4 spot and finished with 11 points. “We are ready for whatever is up next. I think we are really connected and focusing on the details to get us to where we want to go and to make a big run later in the playoffs. So we need big games like this.”Kelly Oubre Jr. had 28 points and Terry Rozier added 22 points and 10 assists for the Hornets, who have lost three straight and fell to 11-27 at home.The Hornets never looked in sync offensively. Charlotte turned the ball over 22 times in all — many of those self-inflicted — while Cleveland had just nine turnovers leading to six points for the Hornets.“There’s a reason why they’re the best defensive team in the NBA — they create a lot of turnovers, they’re physical, they have size,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “When you get behind, it’s hard to come back. We had 10 more (turnovers) in the second half. You’re just not going to win” playing that way.”The Cavaliers needed to erase a 16-point second-half deficit on Sunday to beat the Hornets 114-108, getting 28 points from Garland.They didn't need a comeback Tuesday.The Cavaliers jumped out to a 63-48 lead at halftime after scoring 25 points on 15 Charlotte turnovers, while only turning the ball over once themselves. The Cavs stretched the lead to 22 late in the third quarter, and at one point had outscored the Hornets 31-0 off turnovers.“Understanding the value of every possession, that’s one of the things that we’ve been talking to the guys about is as the games become bigger, more critical, every possession matters,"" Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Being able to get a shot on goal matters. When you have guys who can create, who can score, it’s important to put it up on the rim, at least give yourself a chance.”Charlotte never challenged in the second half and Clifford subbed out his starters with four minutes to play and his team down by 19.ALLEN IS DAY TO DAYAllen missed his second straight game with a right eye contusion he sustained in Friday night's loss to Miami, and the Cavaliers are taking things ""day to day"" with their 6-foot-11 center, Bickerstaff said.“With Jarrett it is just a matter of how quickly it recovers,” Bickerstaff said. “With eyes it's difficult to put a timetable on it.”The 2022 NBA All-Star is in the midst of another strong season averaging 14.4 points, 9.8 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.2 blocks per game while shooting 64.9% from the field.Mitchell is expected to play Wednesday night versus Philadelphia as his absence was more about injury maintenance.TIP INSCavaliers: Signed guard Sam Merrill to a multi-year contract on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835546,Wizards snap 3-game skid with 117-97 rout of Pistons,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bradley Beal scored 36 points, and the Washington Wizards snapped their three-game losing streak with a 117-97 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night.Playing without Kyle Kuzma, the Wizards still raced out to a 22-point advantage in the first quarter, and although they've had issues holding those types of leads this season, the last-place Pistons represented little threat. Killian Hayes led Detroit with 20 points.Washington (32-37) moved percentage points ahead of Chicago (31-36) for the final play-in spot in the Eastern Conference.“It's up to us. We could kind of control our own destiny,” Beal said. “I know it starts with me, so I just make sure I'm locked in, make sure I'm ready to go and make sure guys are ready to go too and understand that every game is important, every possession is important.”The Pistons snapped an 11-game skid by beating Indiana on Monday, but they allowed the Wizards to shoot 68% in the first quarter — including 14 of 16 inside the arc — a night later.An 8-0 run put Washington up 16-7, and later in the quarter the Wizards went on a 20-2 tear to make it 38-16.“I think the biggest thing is defensively, we were engaged, locked in,” Beal said. “I just make sure I try to set the tone on either end of the floor and get guys shots, get us going as best we can.”Kuzma missed the game because of right knee soreness.Beal went 13 of 15 from the field and finished one point shy of his season high. He also had seven assists and six rebounds.“Just being aggressive,” Beal said. “I always credit my teammates for moving, setting screens and just being active. The ball was moving around. We were just playing for each other.”Kristaps Porzingis scored 18 points for Washington and Corey Kispert added 16.This game was a lot less tense for the Wizards than their previous matchup with Detroit. They won that one on the road last week, 119-117 on Daniel Gafford's buzzer beater.CHIPPING INRookie Johnny Davis, a lottery pick for the Wizards who had appeared in only 14 games for them, scored 11 points in 18:32, easily surpassing his career highs in points and minutes.“I haven't seen him play live as much as I'd like,” Wizards coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “There's only one way to see him: play him. ... He looked great. It's a confidence boost for him. I think it's a confidence boost for his teammates.”TIP-INSPistons: Detroit was without Jaden Ivey (health and safety protocols), Bojan Bogdanovic (left Achilles tendon), Cade Cunningham (left tibia), Isaiah Stewart (left shoulder), Isaiah Livers (right hip) Marvin Bagley III (right ankle), Hamidou Diallo (right ankle) and Alec Burks (left foot). ... Rodney McGruder scored 16 points and went 4 of 9 from long distance. In his last five games, he’s 15 of 27 from 3-point range.Wizards: Washington went 37 of 53 from 2-point range for the game.UP NEXTPistons: Host Denver on Thursday night.Wizards: At Cleveland on Friday night.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

Ross Williams added 13 points, Tennyson scored 12 and De’Lazarus Keys pulled down 10 rebounds.Harris scored 23 points before fouling out for No. 16 seed Southeast Missouri State, the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament champion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835552,"Jesperi Kotkaniemi scores twice, Hurricanes beat Jets 5-3","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Jesperi Kotkaniemi had two goals and an assist, Jack Drury scored his first goal of the season and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Winnipeg Jets 5-3 on Tuesday night.Jaccob Slavin and Brady Skjei, also scored for the Hurricanes, who’ve endured sudden offensive woes and the loss of a star player during the past week. Kotkaniemi’s second goal of the game was an empty-netter with four seconds left.“That’s the whole key to everything — how you respond,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “That’s life.”Frederik Andersen made 21 saves just hours after the Hurricanes announced that All-Star forward Andrei Svechnikov will have surgery for a torn knee ligament and miss the rest of the season.“The news about Svech is really tough,” Skjei said. “You don’t replace a guy like that. You have to step up now and do a little bit more. Not change their game, but give a little extra.”Svechnikov was in the forefront of the Hurricanes’ minds.“I feel awful for Svech,” Drury said. “He’s such a hard worker. He’s just such a great guy. It’s tough for him. I think, as a team, everyone knows we have to step up and can’t let it bring us down.”Dylan DeMelo, Nikolaj Ehlers and Nino Niederreiter scored for the Jets, whose two-game winning streak ended. David Rittich made 20 saves.About five minutes after the Jets closed within a goal, Drury put the Hurricanes back up by two with 10:26 remaining in his first game back from the American Hockey League.Drury hadn’t scored an NHL goal since Dec. 18, 2021.“He contributed,” Brind’Amour said. “He finished. That’s what we need.”Niederreiter, a former Hurricane, scored his 22nd goal with 4:22 to play to make it 4-3. It was his fourth goal in eight games since arriving in a trade from Nashville.“I think he has been a great addition,” Winnipeg coach Rick Bowness said. “He fits in here and clearly he can play with anybody.”Slavin’s sixth goal of the season came at 4:37 of the first period, ending the Hurricanes’ stretch of more than 182 minutes without goal that included shutout losses to Vegas and New Jersey.The Jets were encouraged by their performance.“We held a high shot-volume team to what, 24, 25 shots on net,” Bowness said.SURGERY SCHEDULEDSvechnikov, the team’s lone All-Star this season, was injured Saturday night against Vegas, and went to New Jersey for a game the next day. He was scratched from that game as the severity of the injury became more apparent. He’ll have reconstructive surgery Thursday on his right anterior cruciate ligament.A 22-year-old top-line forward, he’s tied for second the team with 55 points and third with 23 goals. He has been a key part of Carolina’s four consecutive playoff berths.“It’s devastating because everyone loves the guy so much,” Brind’Amour said. “It’s a tough one. … I know how we’re going to respond. We’re going to play our hardest.”When shown on the overhead scoreboard sitting in the press box during the second period, Svechnikov received a standing ovation.NOTES: Jets D Josh Morrissey, the team’s second-leading points producer with 67, missed his second game in a row with lower-body injury. … Hurricanes LW Jordan Martinook left briefly after a hit from Winnipeg D Dylan Samberg on the sequence that led to the Jets’ first goal.UP NEXTJets: Host Boston on Thursday night.Hurricanes: At Toronto on Friday night.___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835553,AP source: Saints' Thomas agrees to new 1-year contract,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas has agreed to a new one-year, incentive-laden contract worth between $10 million and $15 million for the 2023 season, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.The person spoke on condition of anonymity on Tuesday because the new agreement has not been announced.Thomas already was under contract, but the Saints would have been virtually certain to release him into free agency by the end of this week if the two-time All-Pro had not agreed to scrap his previous deal. ESPN first reported the new contract.Thomas set an NFL record for catches in a season with 149 in 2019, when he also had 1,725 yards and nine touchdowns receiving.Since then, however, he has played in just 10 games, missing all of 2021 with an ankle injury and playing in just three games last season before a toe injury ended his 2022 campaign.In early January, the Saints restructured a five-year, $96.3 million contract that Thomas signed in 2019 in order to gain short-term salary cap flexibility. That change included a $32 million roster bonus that was due to become guaranteed on Friday.In effect, that deal gave Thomas the option to pursue free agency if he was unhappy with the direction of the Saints' offense. But New Orleans' recent signing of former Raiders quarterback Derek Carr appeared to sweeten Thomas on the notion of staying put.Carr said he spoke with Thomas leading up to his decision to sign with New Orleans and expressed an eagerness to work with the former All-Pro receiver this offseason“You talk to Mike Thomas and you feel like you two could go out there and face the world,” Carr said.“When he started recruiting and talking to me, he wasn’t even trying to recruit me, he was just like, ‘When are we getting to work, we’re wasting time, time is ticking,’” Carr continued. ""Our relationship has grown through the process, and I’m looking forward to hopefully making that relationship grow even stronger.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/15,,World

Travis Sanheim got on the board in the second period and Felix Sandstrom made 28 saves for the Flyers.Barbashev scored his 14th goal of the season on an empty-netter that sealed the win.The Golden Knights have won four straight and finished 4-1 on a trip that boosted their road record to a stout 21-7-5 this season as they play for first place in the Western Conference.“A trip like this, especially when you get to the end, you've got to find a way to win,” defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said.They at least found a way to hold on.The Flyers opened a seven-game homestand and are well out of the playoff race.“I didn’t mind a lot of the game,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “The effort is there. We’ve just got to keep on going,”They played their first game at Wells Fargo Center since they fired general manager Chuck Fletcher on Friday and promoted long-time fan favorite Danny Briere to the interim role. The move that fans had clamored for did little to spark ticket sales — there were scores of empty seats inside the arena. Briere was in Florida for the NHL general managers meetings.The losses are getting easier to accept for Flyers fans now that Briere has acknowledged the franchise needs a multiyear process to become contenders again. Each defeat this season only pumps their odds for a better pick in the draft lottery.“We're done. We're not making the playoffs,” Tortorella said. “But our guys continue to play hard.”The Flyers rallied in the third when another loss seemed inevitable. Instead, they showed some rare grit when Seeler and Frost scored almost two minutes apart in a tough — but too late — rally that got a rise out of the stragglers.“They're a team that's trying to forge an identity,” Cassidy said. “They're going through some, obviously, internal stuff. I don't know how it affects the players.”PERFECT STARTQuick stopped 27 shots, improving to 4-0 since he was acquired from Columbus and tied John Vanbiesbrouck for second on the career wins list among American goalies with 374.COOTS, THERE HE ISFlyers C Sean Couturier took part in the team's morning skate as he tries to return this season from two back surgeries since he last played a game in December 2021. He had signed a $62 million, eight-year extension in August 2021 that keeps him under contract through the 2029-2030 season at a salary cap hit of $7.75 million.The 30-year-old Couturier said it was his goal to play some games this season.“If I wait until next year, it's going to be almost two years since I've played an NHL game, which is not ideal,"" he said. “I'm not getting any younger, either. Just feeling good about yourself, you’re back being a hockey player and not just rehabbing.”The eighth pick in the 2011 draft, Couturier has 460 points in 721 regular-season games and 22 more in the Stanley Cup playoffs, while often playing through injury. Couturier has gone from trying to win a Stanley Cup in Philly to now muddling through the rebuilding process.“It's kind of something we have to do,” the popular player nicknamed Coots said. “I'll do my best to be around and lead the right way.”UP NEXTGolden Knights: Host Calgary on Thursday.Flyers: Play the second game of a seven-game homestand Friday against Buffalo.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835555,How Washington came to rescue US banks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters started furiously working the phones to find out what was going on with the failed lender — and what would happen to its panicked depositors.Waters, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee, had her doubts that another bank would step up as a savior and buy the defunct institution.“Banks don’t just wake up and say: ‘Oh, there’s a problem with another significant bank and they’ve collapsed. Let’s just take it over,’’’ she said.So began a frenetic weekend of nonstop briefings with regulators, lawmakers, administration officials and President Joe Biden himself about how to handle the demise of the nation's 16th-biggest bank and a go-to financial institution for tech entrepreneurs. At the core of the problem was tens of billions of dollars — including money companies needed to meet payrolls — sitting in Silicon Valley Bank accounts that were not protected by federal deposit insurance that only goes up to $250,000.Something needed to be done, federal officials agreed, before Asian stock markets opened Sunday evening and other banks faced the potential for waves of panicked withdrawals Monday morning.“We were racing against the clock,” said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council.Waters was right to be skeptical about a sale being closed on the fly. The bank’s size — $210 billion in assets — and complexity made it difficult to quickly wrap up a deal.Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials told Republican senators Monday that they received offers for the bank over the weekend but didn’t have time to close; they said they could put Silicon Valley Bank up for auction again, according to a person familiar with the conversation who requested anonymity to discuss a private call.But another plan was coming together. On Sunday, Waters was on the phone with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who briefed her on how it would work. The Fed was creating a new emergency program that allowed it to lend directly to banks so they could cover withdrawals without having to sell off assets to raise cash. The idea was to reassure depositors and prevent bank runs at other institutions.By Sunday night, the Treasury Department, the Fed and the FDIC said the federal government would protect all deposits — even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit.“It’s miraculous, really,’’ Waters said, calling it ""an example of what working together and what government can do with the right people in charge.’’The praise was not unanimous.In the call Monday with officials from the FDIC and the Treasury Department, Republican senators expressed concern that millionaire Silicon Valley depositors were being rescued — and the cost might be passed onto community banks in their home states in the form of higher assessments for federal deposit insurance, according to the person familiar with the discussion.The trouble started last Wednesday when Silicon Valley Bank said it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its finances after suffering big losses on its bond portfolio, which had plunged in value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. On Thursday, depositors rushed to pull their money out. An old-fashioned bank run was underway.At a House Ways and Means committee hearing on Friday morning, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency was “monitoring very carefully” developments related to the bank. “When banks experience financial losses, it is and should be a matter of concern,” she told lawmakers.Biden was briefed about the situation on Friday morning, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Then he celebrated an unexpectedly strong February jobs report, met with the leader of the European Union and jetted off to Wilmington, Delaware, to mark his grandson’s 17th birthday.His weekend would soon be consumed with phone and video calls focused on preventing a nationwide banking crisis. Regulators were so concerned, they didn't even wait until the close of business on Friday — the usual practice — to shut the bank down; they closed the doors during working hours.It was the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history and trickier than most: An astonishing 94% of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits — including large cash holdings by tech startups — were uninsured by the FDIC.As administration officials and regulators worked through the weekend, Biden expressed concern about small businesses and their employees who relied on accounts that were now in jeopardy, the White House official said.There were also fears, the official said, that if Silicon Valley Bank depositors lost money, others would lose faith in the banking system and rush to withdraw money on Monday, causing a cascading crisis.Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss’ phone had started lighting up even before the weekend. Silicon Valley Bank had eight branches and offices in his home state, and word of its failure was traveling fast on social media.“The panic within Massachusetts industry and nonprofit sectors became acute within a matter of hours,’’ Auchincloss said. “My phone started just exploding.’’Silicon Valley Bank wouldn't be the only bank to collapse. By Sunday evening, federal officials announced that New York-based Signature Bank, a major lender to New York landlords, had also failed and was being seized.The government's plan to cover deposits over $250,000 ended up applying to Signature's customers as well.In a statement Sunday, Biden said, ""The American people and American businesses can have confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them.''On Monday, Powell announced that the Fed would review its supervision of Silicon Valley Bank to understand what went wrong. The review will be conducted by Michael Barr, the Fed vice chair who oversees bank oversight, and be released May 1.Now Biden and lawmakers are calling for legislative changes to tighten financial rules on regional banks, perhaps restoring parts of the Dodd-Frank law that tightened bank regulation after the 2008-2009 financial crisis but were rolled back five years ago.Waters said it might be time to raise deposit insurance thresholds. ""We can't just say this is an emergency and forget about it,'' she said.___AP writers Fatima Hussein, Seung Min Kim and Christopher Rugaber in Washington and Ken Sweet in New York contributed to this report.",2023/03/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835556,Lightning beat Devils 4-1 to open 2-game set in New Jersey,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Brandon Hagel had a goal and two assists, Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves and Tampa Bay scored the last four goals in a 4-1 victory over New Jersey on Tuesday night.Anthony Cirelli, Alex Killorn and Nikita Kucherov also scored for Tampa Bay in the opener of a two-game set. The teams will meet again in New Jersey on Thursday night, and face off Sunday night in Florida.“They’re one of the top teams in the league,"" Hagel said. “They’ve been having an incredible season. They’re a playoff team so it’s a good test for us and for us to be able to do this. Hopefully, we can get some momentum off this.”Damon Severson opened the scoring for the Devils at 5:55 of the first period. Ryan Graves’ apparent goal midway through the first was wiped out because of goalie interference after a coach’s challenge.“We didn’t start bad, that’s for sure,” New Jersey defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler said. “We just need to be consistent over 60 minutes.”Cirelli tied it on a backhander while Tampa Bay was short-handed with 3:43 left in the first.“It goes from down 2-0 to their head on a power play to now we’re 1-1 and it was a huge spark for us and we were able to get the second one to get the lead and that was big for us,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “But that was a big part of the game, the challenge and the shorty.""Hagel gave Tampa Bay the lead midway through the second with his 24th goal of the season. Alex Killorn added his 21st goal, and Nikita Kucherov scored his 27th right before the second-period horn sounded.“There were some big moments of the game and I looked up and I think he had the puck in the blue line with five seconds left but … Kucherov can finish in those areas,” Cooper said. “But probably the one that popped the balloon was definitely that fourth one.”Tampa Bay scored its three goals in the second on just seven shots.Vitek Vanecek made 26 saves for New Jersey.“I look at his last game and I look at how well he played. He wasn’t the guy that was turning pucks over. He wasn’t the guy to give up the short-handed goal,” Ruff said. “You can always go to the goaltender. If he didn’t make some of the saves he made last game, I might be standing, explaining the same thing to you again.”NOTES: Forward Curtis Lazar made his Devils debut after he was acquired at trade deadline from the Vancouver Canucks. He replaced Nathan Bastion (upper-body injury). … Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos (leg injury) remains day-to-day.___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports(backslash)",2023/03/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835557,New Mexico Legislature rejects ban in immigration detention,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico legislators rejected a proposal Tuesday to prohibit state and local government agencies from contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants as they seek asylum in the U.S.The bill failed on a 17-21 vote of the state Senate. It also would have phased out local government participation in three-way agreements with private detention facilities and federal authorities.The bill held implications for three privately operated detention facilities in New Mexico — and would have effectively ended migrant detention in early 2025 at the privately operated Otero County Processing Center at Chaparral in southern New Mexico on the outskirts of El Paso, Texas.Legislatures in Colorado and New York are considering similar bills that would restrict local government contracts with federal immigration authorities or with private contractors through intergovernmental service agreements.Proponents of the New Mexico bill highlighted reports of prison-like discipline, poor sanitation and suicide attempts at immigrant detention facilities, urging lawmakers to take action on humanitarian grounds.“We’re talking here about those immigrants who’ve come into the country in accordance with our laws and applied for asylum,” said Democratic Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino of Albuquerque, cosponsor of the bill. “We found that many of them ... are being detained under conditions that are far from adequate.”During debate, Republican senators downplayed the severity of living conditions at the Otero County migrant detention center run by Utah-based Management & Training Corporation and said that terminating the government contract there would deliver a serious financial blow to the community.Republican state Sen. Ron Griggs, whose district includes the Otero County Processing Center, said Otero County borrowed money to build the migrant processing and detention center in 2007, hoping to eventually pay off bonds and create an enduring source of revenue to support public services.He called the bill a “direct attack on facilities in some of our poorer rural areas.”The Otero County Processing Center typically holds about 600 male and female migrants.Five Democratic senators joined with Republicans to defeat the bill. Four other Democratic senators were excused or absent from the vote.Griggs also argued that a local detention ban in New Mexico wouldn't necessarily improve conditions for migrants who wind up at detention centers in other states awaiting asylum proceedings.Jazmin Irazoqui-Ruiz, senior attorney with New Mexico Immigration Law Center, disputed that and said migrants might be released out of cost considerations to live temporarily with relatives or other sponsors, or find themselves transferred to states such as Colorado that take a different approach by underwriting legal representation for indigent immigrants.In recent years, California, Illinois and New Jersey have enacted legislation aimed at reining in migrant detention centers within their territory.",2023/03/15,,World

Anunoby had 24 and the Toronto Raptors used a franchise-record, 49-point first quarter to beat Denver 125-110 on Tuesday, handing the slumping Nuggets their season-high fourth straight loss.Nikola Jokic scored 28 points, Michael Porter Jr. added 23 and Aaron Gordon had 18 for the Western Conference-leading Nuggets, who are winless since a March 6 home victory over the Raptors.“Right now we’re just in chill mode, and you can’t be in chill mode with 13 games to go in the season,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “We’ve got to try to find a way to get our swagger back.”Denver opponents have scored 100 or more points in five straight games, and 120 or more in each of the past three.“Maybe we’ve gotten a little soft with success,” Malone said. “We’ve been on cruise control for so long, No. 1 in the West since like December 15. I just told our players we’ve gotten away from who we are.”Malone said several Denver veterans spoke up after the game, urging the team to play better. Asked whether he thought the Nuggets needed to hear those words, Jokic was clear, saying: “Yes.”VanVleet shot 13 for 22 and made a season-high eight of his 12 attempts from distance as Toronto extended its home winning streak to five.VanVleet had seven assists, three steals and just two turnovers in nearly 38 minutes.“Freddie called an incredible game tonight,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “He really had us incredibly organized. He found a bunch of little wrinkles.”Jakob Poeltl had 12 points and 11 rebounds, Pascal Siakam scored 12 points and Gary Trent Jr. had 11 for the Raptors, who never trailed.Denver guard Jamal Murray shot 5 for 18 and scored 14 points and Bruce Brown added 12, but the Nuggets lost the opener of a season-high, five-game road trip.The Raptors shot 20 for 28 in the first to lead 49-30 after one.“We just dug too much of a big hole and couldn’t climb the mountain from there,” Murray said.Toronto was up 88-64, its biggest lead of the game, after Siakam’s basket with 8:16 left in the third. Denver used a 28-10 run to cut the gap to 98-92, but the Nuggets couldn’t keep it up in the fourth.“When you expend so much energy getting back in the game you have nothing left to finish,” Malone said.TIP-INSNuggets: Jokic had eight rebounds and seven assists. … Murray led Denver with nine assists. … Shot 1 for 6 from 3-point range in both the first and second quarters. Denver finished 6 for 25 from long range. … Made 14 turnovers, leading to 25 points.Raptors: Shot 20 for 28 in the first. … Toronto’s previous record for points in a quarter was 48, set in the first quarter at New Jersey on Jan. 11, 1997. … The Raptors returned from a five-game road trip to begin a stretch that sees them play seven of eight at home. Toronto is 21-13 at home this season.5HOMECOMINGAfter sitting out the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss to Brooklyn because of soreness in his left knee, Murray returned to the lineup to play his first game north of the border since December 2018, and had some 40 to 50 family and friends on hand to watch him.“It’s always nice being home, seeing everybody, seeing people I haven’t seen for years,” Murray said. “It always brings you back to earth.”Murray is from Kitchener, Ontario, about 65 miles west of Toronto. He missed the last part of the 2020-21 season and all of last season after surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee. Still, Malone said before the game that “there was no way (Murray) wasn’t playing.” Murray received a warm ovation when the starters were introduced.DUNK OF THE DAYAnunoby wowed the crowd with a one-handed putback slam on Trent’s missed shot in the second.UP NEXT Nuggets: At Detroit on Thursday night.

Nineteen shots, they shot the puck, they got inside, they did a lot of real good things. Real happy with the first period. After that it was OK. It was much better than the previous game, put it that way.”Patrick Kane had a goal and an assist, Jacob Trouba and Jimmy Vesey also scored and Vincent Trocheck had two assists for the Rangers, who are 3-0-1 in their last four games and 5-2-1 in their past eight. Igor Shesterkin made 28 saves to help New York win the opener of a five-game homestand, its longest of the season.“We are finding ways to win,"" Kane said. ""Tonight was a step in the right direction. We have a lot of depth here. ... It’s nice to see us stay in it and Shesterkin definitely made some unbelievable saves.”Matt Irwin had a goal and an assist, and Nicolas Aube-Kubel and Nic Dowd also scored for a Capitals team minus star left wing Alex Ovechkin (lower-body injury). Darcy Kuemper finished with 31 saves as Washington lost for the third time in four games.“Our first period wasn’t good enough,"" coach Peter Laviolette said. ""They were quicker, they beat us to pucks and spaces. ... They came out with that pace and we were second in a lot of areas.”Trailing 4-2, the Capitals were on a power play early in the third period when Shesterkin snatched a high shot from Washington's Dylan Strome to preserve New York's two-goal lead. Just six seconds after another Capitals power play expired, Dowd knocked in the rebound of his own shot in front to pull Washington within one with 8:12 left.Vesey scored an empty-netter to restore the Rangers' two-goal lead with 2:11 remaining.Zibanejad got the Rangers on the scoreboard first as he converted a give-and-go with Vladimir Tarasenko and fired his return pass past Kuemper from between the circles at 4:09 of the first period.Aube-Kubel tied it with 5:31 left in the first as he scored from the right circle for his fourth of the season.Zibanejad put the Rangers right back ahead 16 seconds later with his second of the night and team-leading 34th. Shesterkin made a long pass to Panarin, who brought the puck up the left side, skated around defenseman Alexander Alexeyev, cut toward the net and passed to Zibanejad, who was driving toward the front and put a backhand past Kuemper.Shesterkin was credited with an assist, his first of the season.“He can shoot it, there's no doubt,” Gallant said of Shesterkin's pass. “Sometimes it works real good like it did there on that goal. He's been real good for us lately obviously, and tonight he was real good again.”Kane pushed the Rangers' lead to 3-1 with 1:14 left in the first as fired a shot through traffic on a power play for his 19th of the season and third in six games since coming to New York from Chicago before the trade deadline. It was Kane's first goal at Madison Square Garden since the trade in just his second home game.“It’s pretty special at MSG. It’s entertainment, it’s a show,” he said.Trouba made it a three-goal lead as he fired a shot past Kuemper at 4:09 of the second.Irwin pulled the Capitals to 4-2 with 7:52 left in the middle period as he scored from the left circle.NO OVECHKIN, NO WINWashington has lost all six games it has played without Ovechkin this season, including four games last month following the death of his father, and nine straight dating to last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835595,Special prosecutor steps down in case against Alec Baldwin,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A special prosecutor who doubles as a state legislator is stepping down from her role in the manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin in the death of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.Baldwin’s legal team in February sought to disqualify special prosecutor and Republican state Rep. Andrea Reeb based on constitutional provisions that safeguard the separation of powers between distinct branches of government.Reeb said in a statement Tuesday that she “will not allow questions about my serving as a legislator and prosecutor to cloud the real issue at hand.”“It has become clear that the best way I can ensure justice is served in this case is to step down so that the prosecution can focus on the evidence and the facts,” Reeb said.District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies filed a notification in state district court and declined further comment.Baldwin and weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 18 months in prison and fines.Hutchins died shortly after being wounded Oct. 21, 2021, during rehearsals for the Western film “Rust” at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.A preliminary hearing is scheduled in May to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to proceed to a trial.Prosecutors say assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on set, has signed an agreement to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon.In her role as legislator, Reeb has sponsored several criminal justice initiatives, including enhanced punishments for firearms violations.The Republican from Clovis steered clear of voting on public spending to prosecute Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed.She was excused from a House floor vote in February on a proposed state budget that includes $360,000 for special prosecution expenses in the fatal film-set shooting.",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835599,China obstructs new subsea cable to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A British newspaper on Tuesday (March 14) cited several sources as saying China is obstructing the laying and maintenance of submarine internet cables in the South China Sea by delaying approvals and other means, delaying a cable connecting Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan for more than a year.According to Financial Times, China is attempting to interfere with and control the transnational telecommunications infrastructure in the South China Sea. The scope of Beijing's attempts to control undersea networks covers nearly the entire South China Sea.The report pointed out China has been delaying the review process, tightening conditions for obtaining various permits, and even extending the scope of its control beyond China's internationally recognized territorial waters. Industry insiders say this forces companies to avoid the South China Sea, which incurs additional costs.Two corporate managers told the newspaper that a cable under construction, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable 2 (SJC2), has been delayed for more than a year because of Chinese opposition and lags in obtaining permits for seabed exploration. When completed, SJC2 will connect Japan with South Korea, China, Taiwan (Fangshan Township and Tamsui District), Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand.According to the report, SJC2 is owned by a consortium whose members include China Mobile, Chunghwa Telecom, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. For months, China has held off on approving seabed exploration in Chinese territorial waters around Hong Kong, citing concerns including possible espionage by contractors, said a person directly involved in the project, who asked not to be named.Bryan Clark, a former U.S. Navy official and a senior fellow at Washington-based Hudson Institute, said one of the reasons China is trying to tighten control of underwater activities in the area is to prevent American surveillance systems from being included in the subsea cable installation. He added that Beijing also ""wants to know exactly where civilian undersea infrastructure is installed for its own mapping purposes.""The report said various disputes surrounding submarine cables have escalated rapidly since 2020, when the U.S. began to prevent China from participating in international consortium projects. The U.S. has also rejected plans to lay cables connecting the U.S. with China and Hong Kong.The article noted that according to international law, if the scope of a subsea project falls within the territorial waters of a country's coast, the country or company that lays and maintains the cable must obtain permission from the coastal state. Although the construction in the ""exclusive economic zone"" EEZ extending 12 to 200 miles from the territory of the coastal state usually does not require a permit, China has recently begun demanding companies apply for permits in its EEZ, apparently contravening international maritime law.A person familiar with the matter told CNA on Tuesday that the SJC2 submarine cable invested in by Chunghwa Telecom has been delayed for more than a year and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The source said in the future, new undersea cables will circumvent the South China Sea.There is speculation that Chunghwa Telecom's two Taiwan-Matsu submarine cables were deliberately cut in early February by the Chinese ships, with industry insiders pointing to two factors that raise suspicions. The two submarine cables between Taiwan and Matsu were cut within just six days of each other and the damage occurred close to Matsu.",2023/03/15,6550,Politics

They played their tails off and they brought it to us. This one stings. This one hurts because it’s one that we let get away from us. But you have to be able to move on to the next game and know what you can improve on and tighten up our defense.”Sochan returned from a one-game absence, but the Spurs were without Keldon Johnson, Malaki Branham, Tre Jones, Rome Langford.In a battle between two of the league’s top rookies, Sochan had the upper hand over Banchero, thanks to the best outside shooting performance in the franchise’s 50-year history.“If you make 22 3s, you are going to have a pretty damn good night,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “That’s just the way the rules are. We don’t do it very often, but we did it tonight. And it was fun to watch. More importantly, we had 39 assists, which is really fantastic. All in all, it was a good night for the boys.”San Antonio made 57% of its shots from the field and going 22 for 41 from 3-point range.“We were just late on a lot of our rotations,” Banchero said. “I think they did a great job moving the ball, not being stagnant.

The first led to a one-handed dunk by Sochan that gave the Spurs a 62-54 lead with 2:38 remaining in the first half. They teamed up for another alley-oop dunk 36 seconds later.TIP-INSMagic: Banchero was averaging 24 points in his previous five games. … Orlando’s last victory in San Antonio was 117-110 on Nov. 4, 2018. … F Franz Wagner made his 68th start this season after being listed as questionable with a sprained right ankle.

Additional tests will be conducted Wednesday.“Poor guy. He was just learning how to play,” Popovich said.Bassey remained on his back for about 45 seconds after blocking Jalen Suggs’ attempted layup to the close of the first quarter.

""But everyone was locked in. Everyone was ready to make a contribution.”Beasley finished with 24 points for the Lakers, who shot 18 of 39 from 3-point range — including 15 of 27 before halftime, which set a franchise record for 3s made in a half.“I felt confident tonight,"" Beasley said. ""I told myself keep doing what I’m doing and don’t worry about the pressure of making shots.”D'Angelo Russell added 17 points to help Los Angeles (34-35) move one game ahead of New Orleans (33-36) in the standings as both clubs try remain in contention for a spot in the postseason. The Lakers also won the season series 3-1, giving them the tiebreaker should these two teams — which entered the day in a four-way tie for 10th in the West — finish with equal records.“It was very important for us, just for standing purposes, tiebreaker purposes and then getting back in the win column,” said Davis, who was the No. 1 overall draft choice by New Orleans in 2012.""I just wanted to come out ultra aggressive tonight, knowing how important this game was,"" Davis added. “Everybody did. We were playing the right way, playing great defensively and sharing the ball offensively, playing together and we were clicking on all cylinders.”Brandon Ingram returned to New Orleans' lineup after missing two games with a right ankle injury, but his 22 points were not nearly enough.“We let their shot-making just demoralize us,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""Our sense of urgency was lacking, but it just came down to they made shots early. We missed a ton of them.""When we don’t start with a sense of urgency, play fast or play with force, it demoralizes our spirit,"" Green added. ""We have to, some way or somehow, figure that part out.”Herbert Jones and Trey Murphy III each scored 20 for the Pelicans, who trailed 75-40 at halftime and trimmed their deficit to 13 when Ingram's pull-up jumper made it 107-94.Jones then intercepted Davis' pass and tried to initiate a fast break that could have gotten New Orleans as close as 11 points with five minutes still to play, but Russell tipped Jones' pass and Jones was called for a foul when he grabbed Russell to stop him from getting the ball.That exchange began a 7-2 Lakers mini-run that built the lead back to 18.The Lakers scored the game's first 14 points, starting with eight straight by Davis on a layup as he was fouled, a 3 and a step-back jumper. Beasley and Russell each followed with a 3, and Los Angeles' lead never got below 10 after that.Austin Reaves scored 14 points and Rui Hachimura added 12 for the Lakers.TIP-INSLakers: Davis has 16 30-point games this season. ... Shot 48.8% (40 of 82) overall. ... Outrebounded New Orleans 52-41. ... Went 25 of 28 from the foul line. ... Ham said Davis will be rested for the Lakers' next game at Houston in keeping with doctors' orders regarding his right foot injury. “It’s tough; the position we’re in, you want to go out and play,” Davis said “But at the end of the day, with an injury like that, you don’t want it to go to the other side. So you want to stay on top of it. I’m going to be there coaching the guys up, trying to make sure we do whatever we can to get the win.”Pelicans: CJ McCollum scored 13 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 10. ...

They also placed tenders on kicker Cameron Dicker and tackle Foster Sarell, who were exclusive rights free agents.Pipkins was drafted in the third round out of Division II Sioux Falls in 2019 and finally came into his own last year. The 6-foot-6, 307-pound lineman started 15 games, including the playoffs, at right tackle last season as the Chargers made the postseason for the first time since 2018.By re-signing Pipkins, the Chargers could elect to clear more cap room by releasing left guard Matt Feiler and moving Jamaree Salyer to that spot. Salyer was projected to be a guard when he was drafted in the sixth round last year, but started 15 games at left tackle after Rashawn Slater suffered a season-ending biceps injury in a Week 3 game against Jacksonville.Pipkins is the second member of the 2019 draft class that Chargers general manager Tom Telesco has retained. They reached an agreement with backup quarterback Easton Stick on Monday, but that deal has not been officially announced.Coming into this offseason, Telesco only re-signed two of his non-first round picks in six draft classes to second contracts.Kendricks posted about joining the Chargers on his Instagram account Monday. He spent eight seasons with the Vikings before being released on March 6.The 31-year old linebacker has started 113 regular-season and six playoff games. He was 14th in the league this past season with 137 total tackles, including 87 solo.Los Angeles also gave running back Austin Ekeler permission to explore a trade after the two sides were unable to reach agreement on an extension.

To that point, Oklahoma City had made only 2 of 10 from 3-point range.“The underrated thing about a game like that is when you’re down 16 … (and) a team is playing with that juice, and the game’s not quite going your way, not getting knocked out in that period is the key to winning a game like tonight,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “We didn’t go down 25 and we easily could have. We just kind of hung in there long enough for the game to turn.”It turned in good part due to Dort, who finished 6 of 11 from 3-point range. In the third quarter, the Thunder went 8 of 15 from behind the arc while outscoring Brooklyn 38-20.“I had it going,” Dort said. “I’m working so hard on my shot. I’ve always got to stay confident and always try to take a good one. Tonight, the ball just found me.”The Nets missed all seven of their 3-point attempts during the quarter and trailed 90-82 entering the fourth. They came no closer than five points the rest of the way and at the end, Oklahoma City pushed its lead to as many as 15 points.“We didn’t finish the (first) half the right way and that led to the third quarter,” Brooklyn coach Jacque Vaughn said. “We talked about, every single possession for this team matters. Every 50-50 ball matters. You’ve got to get dirty. You’ve got to get on the floor. You’ve got to get that possession. … We didn’t do that often enough and we paid for it tonight.”Giddey finished off his fourth triple-double of the season with a basket with 6:46 left. Jalen Williams added 23 points and 10 rebounds.Spencer Dinwiddie had 16 points and 11 assists, while Nic Claxton had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Brooklyn.TIP-INSNets: Ben Simmons missed an 11th straight game with soreness in his left knee and back. Vaughn said there’s been “zero” discussion about shutting down Simmons for the season ... Seven of Dinwiddie’s assists came in the first quarter.Thunder: Oklahoma City hadn’t beaten Brooklyn at home since March 3, 2019, having lost the previous two meetings inside the Paycom Center … Lindy Waters III started the second half in the place of rookie Jaylin Williams … Oklahoma City shot no free throws during its big third quarter, while Brooklyn shot 20, making 14.FREE THROWS Brooklyn attempted 34 free throws to 23 for Oklahoma City, but Vaughn thought the Nets — and specifically Dinwiddie, who went 6 of 6 from the line — should have shot more.“I thought that he was aggressive at getting to the rim tonight,” Vaughn said. “I’m surprised that he only had six free-throw attempts, with the amount of times that he drove to the rim tonight. That piece there, we’re going to ask him to continue to do. I thought he made the right plays.

It is key for the stability of the defense of the entire front line,"" he said during the meeting with Zelenskyy.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Wednesday, March 15:Journalists working for the French news agency AFP said they saw white phosphorus munitions fired from Russian positions on an uninhabited area near Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine.They said the projectiles caused explosions that released burning balls of white phosphorus and set fire to vegetation.The reporters couldn't say with certainty what was being targeted but said a green truck with a white cross, a symbol of Ukraine's army, was parked nearby.There were also civilian homes a couple of hundred meters away.Using phosphorus weapons against civilians is prohibited, but they can be deployed against military targets under a 1980 convention signed in Geneva.Ukraine has blamed Russia of using these weapons on several occasions. However, the Russian army has denied this categorically.More needs to be done to stop Russia's access to money to fund its war, British investor and prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, Bill Browder, told DW.""We need to completely and absolutely stop the flow of money to Russia, and that means stop the purchase of oil and gas,"" Browder said.Browder said there should be an embargo on Russia and measures should be taken against countries that are not cooperating.""We should say that if you do business with Russia, we're not going to do business with you.""Browder said that countries like Turkey, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, which were not ""superpower economies,"" needed to toe the line.""Russia needs to lose and to be seen to lose,"" Browder told DW.""If that were to happen, then we have a situation where we can move on to a peaceful future in Europe.""Angela Stent, an expert on Russia and author of a prize-winning book on President Vladimir Putin, told DW the Russian leader had used the war ""to consolidate his power.""Even though a million people have left Russia, the majority that have stayed likely ""either support the war or they're kind of indifferent to it.""""So far, he's succeeded in convincing them, apparently, that, in fact, the West is trying to break up Russia and this is a fight for their existence,"" Stent said.On whether Putin's game plan was waiting to tire the West, Stent said: ""He's playing a long game.""""His previous experience has informed him that the West doesn't hold together forever, that democracies get distracted. They have elections. They have to turn to other things.""The United States said one of its military surveillance drones crashed into the Black Sea after being intercepted by Russian fighter jets. The Pentagon said that one of the Russian Su-27 jets struck the drone's propeller, making it inoperable. Russia views the drone incident as a provocation.Eva Högl, commissioner for Germany's armed forces, said Berlin was working too slowly to build up its armed forces . Högl, whose role is to ensure parliamentary control of the armed forces, was making her report in light of the ""turning point"" announced last year by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

He took a stretch pass from Justin Barron and beat Casey DeSmith to the glove side. Montreal rebounded from an 8-4 home loss against Colorado on Monday and snapped a seven-game losing streak.Montreal, which won its first game in March, has lost eight of its last 10 games overall.“I feel like we’ve played some really good hockey, as of late, but we just haven’t gotten rewarded for it,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “It wasn’t perfect, but I think the group needed that kind of result.”Josh Anderson scored an empty-net goal while the Penguins pressed for the tie. Mike Hoffman scored his 11th while Denis Gurianov, Jesse Ylonen and Joel Edmundson also scored for the Canadiens.Sam Montembeault made 39 saves.“Montembeault was probably the difference,” St. Louis said. “He played real well for us.”Jake Guentzel scored twice and Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang also scored for the Penguins, who play significant back-to-back division games at the New York Rangers on Thursday and Saturday. Pittsburgh, which currently holds a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference, has points in eight of its last 10 games.“Obviously, we missed an opportunity,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “We have a lot of them moving forward that we have to get ready for.”Tristan Jarry started, but allowed four goals on seven shots. It was the fourth time in five games Jarry allowed four goals and the second time he was pulled. DeSmith stopped 13 shots in relief.Pittsburgh played the final 16 minutes with four defensemen. Jeff Petry didn’t take a shift in the third period and Jan Rutta left with a lower-body injury after he was hit with a shot.Montreal had the first five shots of the third period and the only goal until Anderson’s empty netter with 35 seconds to go.“I thought we worked hard throughout the course of the game, but we didn’t work smart,” Sullivan said. “As a result, some of the looks they got, though they didn’t get many, were high quality.”Pittsburgh scored twice in the first five minutes for an early 2-0 lead. But the Canadiens jumped ahead with three goals in the next 6:10 and another before the end of the first during a wild six-goal period.Guentzel scored his 28th goal of the season and recorded his 400th NHL point just 21 seconds into the game. Guentzel, with five goals in his last five games, is the fastest player from the 2013 NHL Draft class to 400 points.Malkin scored a power-play goal on a one-timer from the point at 4:49, making it a 2-0 game. Pittsburgh has a power-play goal in 11 of its last 13 home games.But the Canadiens scored the final four goals of the period.Hoffman scored 32 seconds after Malkin’s goal and Ylonen tied it with a wrist shot from the point at 7:13 of the period.Gurianov scored his third goal in as many games seconds after a penalty expired. Edmundson scored with 11 seconds left in the period on a slap shot from the point.Pittsburgh outshot Montreal, 17-4, in the second period and evened the score thanks to goals by Letang and Guentzel. But it wasn’t enough, as Richard scored early in the third and the Canadiens held on for their first win of the month.“It was a tough feeling when (Pittsburgh) scored two goals early,” Richard said. “It was basically the same start we had (Monday), so the group was kind of down a little bit, but the goal right after was huge just to get our legs going again.”UP NEXTCanadiens: Visit Florida on Thursday.Penguins: Play the first of consecutive games at the New York Rangers on Thursday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835650,"Yoon: Seoul-Tokyo ties key to address N Korea, supply chains","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president wants to quickly overcome decades of lingering hostility left over from Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula and forge a united front on North Korea’s nuclear threats and other regional security and economic challenges facing the neighbors.“We cannot afford to waste time while leaving strained Korea-Japan relations unattended,” President Yoon Suk Yeol said in written response to questions by several foreign media outlets including The Associated Press. “I believe we must end the vicious cycle of mutual hostility and work together to seek our two countries’ common interests.”Yoon’s comments were provided Wednesday, a day before he travels to Tokyo for a closely watched summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The focus of attention is what steps, if any, Kishida would take in response to Yoon’s recent plans to use South Korean funds to compensate some of the colonial-era Korean forced laborers without requiring Japanese contributions.Yoon’s push has triggered criticism from some victims and his political rivals, who have called for direct compensation from Japanese companies that employed the forced laborers. But Yoon has defended his decision, saying greater ties with Japan are essential to tackle a slew of foreign policy and economic challenges.“There is an increasing need for Korea and Japan to cooperate in this time of a poly-crisis with North Korean nuclear and missile threats escalating and global supply chains being disrupted,” Yoon said. “I am confident that the Japanese government will join us in opening a new chapter of Korea-Japan relations which will go down to history.”Addressing Yoon’s comments, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said later Wednesday that Tokyo seeks to strengthen “strategic cooperation” with South Korea as well as trilaterally with the United States. He said he hopes that there will be “open-hearted exchanges” between the leaders of the two countries.South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies and vibrant democracies, are closely linked to each other economically and culturally. But their ties plunged to one of their lowest points in decades after South Korea’s Supreme Court in 2018 ordered two Japanese companies — Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries — to compensate some of their former Korean employees for forced labor during the 1910-45 colonial rule.Japan has insisted all compensation issues were already settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties and was accompanied by $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul. The history disputes spilled over to other issues, with Tokyo placing export controls and South Korea threatening to terminate a military intelligence-sharing pact.The feuding undermined a U.S. push to reinforce its alliances in Asia to better cope with North Korean nuclear threats and China's rise.Since taking office last May, Yoon, a conservative, has been focusing on repairing ties with Japan, boosting the military alliance with the United States and building a stronger Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security cooperation. Yoon says those steps were needed to deter North Korea, whose nuclear-capable missiles put both South Korea and Japan within striking distance.Tensions with North Korea have further intensified in recent days, with the North test-firing a spate of missiles in protest of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.“When the Republic of Korea, the United States and Japan solidify our deterrence cooperation against North Korea in addition to the efforts for the ROK-U.S. extended deterrence, the possibility of North Korea’s misjudgment will decrease,"" Yoon said, invoking South Korea’s formal name.After Yoon’s government announced it would use money raised domestically to compensate the former forced laborers who won damages in the 2018 rulings, U.S. President Joe Biden hailed the plan as a major step toward enhancing the partnership between two of Washington’s closest allies.While experts say that North Korea’s aggressive weapons tests are aimed at forcing the United States to accept it as a nuclear power and relaxing international sanctions, Yoon said that will not happen.“Since the complete denuclearization of North Korea is the clear and unchanging goal of the international community, the Republic of Korea will never acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear state under any circumstances,” Yoon said.Yoon called on North Korea to halt its “reckless” nuclear program and take steps to address the suffering of its people. He said South Korea is willing to provide humanitarian assistance to North Korea, citing a government assessment that "" food shortages there have grown worse with some regions seeing people dying of hunger recently.”Yoon expressed optimism that the thawing of diplomatic relations with Japan would also expand economic cooperation between the two countries, which he said would be crucial to address industrial supply chain vulnerabilities and other global challenges.“If Korea-Japan relations are normalized, I expect to see acceleration of strategic cooperation, such as technological partnerships, joint research & development and the expansion of mutual investments in various fields, such as semiconductors, space and bio-health including materials, parts and equipment,"" he said.Yoon said expanded cooperation between South Korea and Japan — both semiconductor powerhouses — will contribute “greatly” in improving the resilience in global supply chains, which have been rattled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 and could be reshaped by an intensifying U.S.-China rivalry.He said that strengthening bilateral cooperation will also help the countries advance their economic relations with China in a stable manner. For both South Korea and Japan, China is their biggest trade partner but its increasing assertiveness poses economic and foreign policy challenges.“While maintaining communication, Korea, Japan and China will work together in areas of common interest in the economic field, including supply chain stabilization, and on our responses to health and climate crises,"" Yoon said.A government-affiliated foundation in South Korea will likely handle reparations to forced labor victims with money contributed by steel giant POSCO and other local companies that benefited from the 1965 accord. POSCO said Wednesday that it decided to newly contribute 4 billion won ($3 million) to the foundation in addition to the 6 billion won ($4.6 million) that it has previously contributed to the foundation.South Korean officials say they don’t expect Nippon Steel or Mitsubishi to immediately contribute to the South Korean funds for the forced labor victims. They say they expect the Japanese companies to participate in a possible separate fund aimed at facilitating cultural exchanges and other cooperation between the two countries.___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/15,,World

Obviously, we have great defensemen, great goaltending and a lot of good forwards.”Nashville trails Winnipeg by four points in the rush for the Western Conference’s second wild-card berth, with Nashville having played three fewer games.Alex Chiasson scored and Ville Husso made 14 saves for Detroit. The Red Wings have lost two of three.“We just felt like we got a world-class goalie performance against us,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said.Sherwood opened the scoring at with 9:02 left in the second period. Colton Sissons won a battle in the left corner and sent to the puck to Philip Tomasino, who then drove toward the Detroit net. Just outside the crease, he slipped a nifty backhand pass through the legs of Red Wings defenseman Moritz Seider to Sherwood skating through the slot, where he snapped a quick shot past Husso. Sherwood has scored in consecutive games.“We’re just putting our heads down and working,” Sherwood said. “We’re finding different ways every night, and that’s the most important thing.”Novak doubled Nashville’s lead at 2:22 of the third when he deflected Cal Foote’s shot from the right point by Husso. Novak has goals in three straight games, netting four over that span.“Tommy is feeling it, which is good,” Predators coach John Hynes said. “I think he deserves the opportunity he’s getting. He’s been very consistent with his game. He’s playing with a ton of speed. I think he’s got a lot of swagger with the puck right now.”Chiasson spoiled Saros’ shutout bid with 2:44 remaining with Husso pulled for an extra attacker and the Red Wings on a power play.UP NEXTRed Wings: Host Colorado on Saturday.Predators: Host Chicago on Thursday night.___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835660,Warnock's campaign chief sees lessons from Dems in Georgia,"ATLANTA (AP) — When Quentin Fulks went back home to Ellaville, Georgia, last year, people kept telling him how proud they were to watch a native son lead Sen. Raphael Warnock’s reelection bid. Then came the caveat: They still weren’t going to vote for his boss.“I didn't take it personally,” Fulks recalled with a laugh.If anything, growing up Black in a majority white county where Donald Trump won 79% of the vote helped Fulks understand what Democrats had to do to win in a historically conservative state.As a campaign manager, that meant framing Warnock as the deal-making, results-driven incumbent and building an operation that went beyond the Democratic strongholds of Atlanta and other cities to connect with Republican-leaning voters throughout the state — even before Republicans nominated Herschel Walker and gambled on his complicated personal history.“In a tough environment, we chose to communicate with those voters,” Fulks told The Associated Press. “And it set us apart, quite frankly, from the Democratic slate and even from President Biden.”The approach worked — Warnock, Georgia's first Black senator, won reelection by nearly 3 percentage points in a state that Biden carried by a quarter percentage point about two years earlier. The victory helped Democrats win an outright majority in the Senate and established the 33-year-old Fulks as a rising star in the party.Now he's being considered for a top post in Biden's 2024 campaign, which the president is expected to launch in the coming weeks.Fulks, who has also worked for Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and is now on a politics fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School, deflected questions about a possible Biden gig. But allies tout him as more than ready for a national campaign.Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff and former campaign manager who hired Fulks as her 2018 deputy, described him as a “soft-spoken” but skilled operative who understands Democrats’ uneasy coalitions, which span from progressive activists and labor unions to establishment billionaires like Pritzker.“He’s a Black man from rural Georgia who’s also helped run J.B.’s politics in a place like Chicago,” she said. “At this point, there are no uncomfortable spaces for Quentin.”Fulks said he's learned to be unapologetic and thick-skinned about forging narrow majorities.“You don’t compromise what it means to be a Democrat, but there’s a way you do it,” he said.He pointed to Warnock’s support for abortion rights without emphasizing the issue himself, except to call attention to Walkers’ statements of support for an outright national ban. Warnock, in turn, avoided questions about any restrictions Democrats might consider.“When you have an opponent like Walker, there are plenty of people who’d look at all his liabilities and go as far left as possible,” Fulks said. “We never did that.”Warnock, who doubles as senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, didn’t know Fulks before interviewing and hiring him. But, Warnock told the AP, his campaign manager proved to be a “serious” and “brilliant” person who had no problem challenging those around him, including the senator.“There’s no point in having people around you who are afraid to tell you the truth,” Warnock said.Fulks decided in high school he wanted to work in politics. He had no obvious path but saw a model from nearby Plains: former President Jimmy Carter. Encouragement from a high school teacher who is Carter’s niece helped, too.“I have always told students that Uncle Jimmy was just like them at one point,” Kim Fuller said.After graduating from Georgia Southwestern State University, Fulks looked beyond Georgia, which was then dominated by Republicans at all levels. “I didn’t necessarily see what Georgia would become,” Fulks confessed, adding that campaign aides often must leave their home states anyway to prove their mettle.He landed an internship in Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer’s Capitol Hill leadership office and earned a master’s degree focused on campaigns. He met Caprara at Emily’s List, which backs Democratic female candidates. They continued together at Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC.Fulks points to those early years in Washington as inspiration for his recent decision to join the Institute for Ethical Campaigning, a fledgling nonprofit whose efforts include a paid internship program that places high school and college students with campaign and advocacy organizations.The goal, Fulks said, is to give aspiring campaign leaders — Democrats or Republicans — the opportunities he got from people like Hoyer and Caprara.After Pritzker's 2018 win, Fulks took over the new governor's outside political operation. Fulks led the campaign in favor of a state tax referendum to allow graduated rates on income — meaning increases on wealthier individuals and households. The measure flopped on the November 2020 ballot.Economic uncertainty amid the pandemic didn’t help, Fulks said. More important, he recalled, was opponents spending aggressively early to convince middle-income voters their taxes would rise despite the aim at wealthier individuals.“I own all my losses,” Fulks said.That lesson in framing a campaign from the outset remained top of mind as Warnock’s team built a sprawling digital, fundraising and field operation early in the 2022 cycle.Brad Kennedy, Warnock’s national finance director, said Fulks understood a modern campaign’s required parts — fundraising, digital, media relations, field organizing, policy research — and had the confidence to empower his lieutenants.“He set the priorities and let us do our jobs,” Kennedy said, while “making sure we operated as a team.”Fulks required that senior staff move to Georgia and work in-person. He also held weekly meetings with the full headquarters staff, standing before 60 or so employees explaining strategy and taking questions.“I’ve never seen that level of openness and accountability” from a manager, Kennedy said, adding that it yielded a group that trusted Fulks, Warnock and each other.Teamwork across divisions may sound routine, Kennedy said, but it can be elusive in the high-pressure, large-ego world of major campaigns. “We set fundraising records because of it, and we won a competitive race because of it,” Kennedy said, noting that Warnock’s nearly $185 million haul was more than any U.S. Senate campaign in history.Fulks filled another key role: candidate whisperer.That meant corralling Warnock into “call time” with larger donors, explaining the schedule and keeping the senator focused on balancing his left flank with the middle. It also meant tough conversations with the “pastor in the Senate,” who was sometimes wary about how directly to attack Walker, another Black man and a first-time candidate with a history of mental health struggles and accusations of violent threats against women.“He would tell me, ‘I need you to run this campaign in a way that I can go back into my pulpit every Sunday and look my congregation in the eyes,’” Fulks recalled. “Ultimately, I think he showed he’s very competitive and understands the nature of politics.”Fulks rounded out the role by playing Walker’s stand-in during fall debate preparations, a job that involved confronting Warnock on his own liabilities.Certainly, Fulks said, Walker’s weaknesses ultimately helped Warnock. But Fulks cautioned against discounting Warnock's victory and, by extension, his own work that he believes offers Democrats a road map for how to widen their reach in upcoming elections.“Some of these moderates are going to be looking for a place to go,” Fulks said. “These aren’t extreme individuals. We can’t just look at someone and say, ‘Oh, you’re a Republican, so we can’t talk to you.’ We have a record we can sell them.”",2023/03/15,,World

We have delivered a resilient performance against a backdrop of Covid-19-related disruption and broader macroeconomic volatility. The results reflect the advantage of our diversified business model across the Asia region, highlighted by a balanced contribution to APE sales and new business profit from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan and from South-east Asia, including Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.   ""The removal of the bulk of Covid-19-related restrictions across the region and the progressive opening up of the Chinese Mainland economy has meant that 2023 has started well with encouraging progress in year-on-year sales, with Group-wide APE sales for the two months ended February 2023 up 15 per cent9 over the prior year. In Hong Kong we have seen a gradual increase in cross-border traffic from the Chinese Mainland as travel restrictions are eased. Demand for savings products across the Hong Kong business is driving the increase in APE sales in the first two months of 2023.   ""I'm honoured to have joined Prudential at such an exciting time with a tremendous opportunity for long term growth ahead of us. As we celebrate our 175th anniversary and 100 years of operations in Asia, the brand is as strong as ever, with leading market positions in many of our key markets. Our progress over recent years is a testament to our people, reflecting their talent and their commitment to serving our customers.""

This change will impact the timing of profit recognition and initial shareholders' equity, but will not affect the Group's regulatory capital generation or management, operating free surplus generation, business strategy, EEV basis results or dividend policy.   In summary, we expect an increase in the opening shareholder equity on 1 January 2022 of between $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion, reflecting the positive cumulative impact of net timing differences. The adjusted IFRS shareholders' equity11 is also expected to be more closely aligned with the Group's audited EEV shareholders' equity.   Looking ahead, the Group estimates a decrease in the adjusted IFRS 17 operating profit for 2022 of between $650 million and $850 million compared with IFRS 4. This is largely due to timing differences that led to the increase in shareholders' equity and the removal of one off gains recognised in IFRS 4 that will be smoothed into profit in IFRS 17. More details on the impact of IFRS 17 adoption will be provided in June 2023.   Notes  1 Further information on actual and constant exchange rate bases is set out in note A1 of the IFRS financial statement. All results are presented in US dollars.  2 APE sales is a measure of new business activity that comprises the aggregate of annualised regular premiums and one-tenth of single premiums on new business written during the year for all insurance products, including premiums for contracts designated as investment contracts under IFRS 4. It is not representative of premium income recorded in the IFRS financial statements. See note II of the Additional unaudited financial information for further explanation.  3 New business profit, on a post-tax basis, on business sold in the period, calculated in accordance with EEV Principles. See the basis of preparation to the EEV basis results for further explanation.  4 'Adjusted operating profit' refers to adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from continuing operations and is stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions and other corporate transactions. This alternative performance measure is reconciled to IFRS profit for the period of $1,007 million (2021: $2,214 million) in note B1.1 of the IFRS financial results.  5 EEV operating profit is based on longer-term investment returns and is stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions and other corporate transactions, and excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the mark-to-market value movement on core borrowings.  6 Estimated GWS capital position reflects eligible group capital resources in excess of the group prescribed capital requirements (GPCR) attributable to the shareholder business, before allowing for the 2022 second cash interim dividend and the redemption of $0.4 billion of senior debt in January 2023. Further detail on the estimated GWS capital position, including the basis of preparation, is included in note I(i) of the additional unaudited financial information.  7 31 December 2021 comparative amounts include the effect of the adoption of HK RBC, C-ROSS Phase II and the redemption of $1,725 million of subordinated debt completed in January 2022.  8 Operating free surplus generated from insurance and asset management operations before restructuring costs. Definition and further information is set out in 'Movement in Group free surplus' of the EEV basis results.  9 On a constant exchange rate basis.  10 From continuing operations. Comparative figures exclude the results of the Group's discontinued US operations (Jackson).  11 Defined as IFRS 17 shareholders' equity plus tax adjusted contractual service margin and risk adjustment.   -----   We expect to announce our Full Year 2022 Results to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and to the UK financial Media at  12.00pm HKT – 4.00am UKT – 12.00am ET on Wednesday 15 March 2023.
