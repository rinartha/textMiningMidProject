https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830713,5 categories of people can take Taiwan sick leave if COVID positive,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Thursday (March 9) announced that it will end quarantine and reporting requirements for mild COVID cases, it also listed five categories of people who can take sick leave if they test positive for the virus.At a press conference, the CECC announced that starting on March 20, mild COVID cases will be exempt from quarantine and reporting requirements and will instead follow a ""0+n"" formula for their self-health monitoring period. Under the ""0+n"" scheme, people with mild symptoms are to avoid unnecessary trips outside and engage in up to 10 days of self-health monitoring.CECC spokesperson Phillip Lo (羅一鈞) explained that soldiers, civil servants, educators, students, and laborers who test positive for COVID but have mild symptoms will be allowed to take up to six days of sick leave without any negative impact on their work or attendance record. However, people who have moderate to severe COVID symptoms should undergo isolation and treatment.The public's most common concern is whether they can ask for leave if they test positive for COVID, according to Lo. The CECC finally agreed to allow workers with a positive COVID test to take sick leave.Soldiers will be allowed to take sick leave without incurring disciplinary measures. In addition, civil servants and teachers will be able to take sick leave on ""Day 0"" of testing positive and up to five more days without an impact on their annual number of sick days or performance appraisal.Students can also take sick leave on ""Day 0"" plus five more days, and it will not be included in their absence records. Furthermore, parents can take leave to care for children who are of school age.Lastly, laborers can take sick leave starting on Day 0 plus five more days, and it will not impact their bonus for full attendance.The Ministry of Education (MOE) stated teachers and students who test positive but are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are advised to undergo self-health monitoring. The MOE also suggested that COVID-positive individuals should stay at home from Day 0 and up to an additional five days, unless testing negative earlier.",2023/03/09,2362,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830730,Array Go Has Launched: ArrayFi’s Answer to AI in Blockchain,"VICTORIA, MAHE, SEYCHELLES -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 -  Array Go, the fully automated algorithmic intelligence, has launched and geared up for the next stage of digital evolution. It is poised to become the talking point for many avid investors during the next bullish market and long after.   Daniel Kahneman and Prof. Amos Tversky proposed a well-known behavioral economic theory, which states that individuals have different risk attitudes and psychological tolerances based on different reference points. The  Array protocol is designed based on this theory.   If Web2 industries feel AI's power, imagine how Web3 pioneers are doing.   Array Go is an AI-powered algorithm with all the benefits of the bounding curve, such as stability and risk mitigation. It is a full AI that is  not under the control of any human or institution. Array Go drives itself based on 100% market action. In order to ensure the value of the token remains stable and predictable for investors and traders indefinitely, a traditional bonding curve is implemented manually to a smart contract that governs the issuance and trading of $ARA.   Array Go can:    Learn from the historical market data.   Observe the up-to-date market behaviors.   Predict the future market trends.    The key function of Array Go is to reduce the risks associated with this technology. As market trends rise, the AI system will feed more $ARA to the market (minting) in order to balance supply and demand - or remove $ARA (burn) based on the same principle. This reduces the risk of greater price fluctuations.   About $ARA and $USDR. The gold standard operates on a 4:1 relationship, allowing $ARA holders to mint $USDR tokens on the chain themselves. Users can also stake $ARA to obtain $USDR tokens, which serve as the only circulation medium for the DEGA(Decentralized Gaming Alliance) application platform.   Array is focused on building a software of the future, a bridge to a refined platform with endless potential. Array believes that wealth creation should be smooth, serene and endless. Array wants to simplify the investment and reward process to allow users to be more creative and help with their journey of reaching their investing potential.   Twitter: @JimArray  Hashtag: #Array

In 2022, the Group vigorously developed and recorded stable revenue growth in the aerospace, medical, energy, and diversified industrial end markets. The Group's revenue for the year amounted to HK$4,354.7 million, representing an increase of 15.3% compared with last year. Profit attributable to shareholders of the Company was HK$582.0 million, an increase of 52.0% over 2021. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of the Company amounted to HK$649.1 million, a year-on-year increase of 53.7%, and adjusted basic earnings per share were 34.5 HK cents. In lieu of the distribution of the final dividend, the Group resolved to declare a second 2022 interim dividend of 8.0 HK cents per share. Together with the first 2022 interim dividend of 8.0 HK cents per share already paid, the dividend for the year amounted to 16.0 HK cents per share, representing an increase of 58.4% when compared with 10.1 HK cents per share last year.   During the year, revenue from the aerospace, medical, and energy end markets increased significantly by 53.6% to HK$515.8 million. The increase was mainly attributable to the recovery of the aerospace market following the lifting of quarantine restrictions for international visitors entering certain countries in Europe, the US, and Asia, as well as the Group's efforts to jointly develop a large number of new SKUs with its customers in the aerospace end market over the past two years, which helped customers solve supply chain shortages. As a result, revenue from the aerospace business increased 52.8% year-on-year to HK$290.9 million. The medical end market benefited from increased demand for different medical equipment, driving its sales revenue up 32.1% to HK$152.4 million. Higher global energy prices and the Group's acquisition of Foshan Ameriforge in August 2022 drove significant sales growth in the energy end market, with sales revenue climbing 141.7% year-on-year to HK$72.5 million.   The Group's diversified industrial end markets also performed well, with revenue up 24.5% year-on-year to HK$2,139.4 million. In particular, increased investment in infrastructure projects and other economic stimulus policies introduced by the US government supported the demand for high horsepower engines, with revenue from this segment rising 38.1% year-on-year to HK$463.1 million. New product development and increased market share drove sales in the recreational boats and vehicles end market up 31.2% to HK$248.2 million. Revenue from the agricultural equipment end market increased by 29.1% to HK$353.3 million, while the commercial vehicle end market also benefited from growing demand in the US and Europe, driving its sales revenue up by 18.7% during the year.   Amid the complex and volatile business environment in 2022, lmpro's visionary ""Global Footprint"", ""Diversified End­ Markets"" and ""Twin Growth Engine"" strategies enabled it to combat geographical risks and effectively hedge against cycles and volatility in different end markets, resulting in considerable growth in business results during the year. The investment casting plant, the third plant at the Mexico SLP campus, officially commenced operation in November 2022. Together with the precision machining plant and sand casting plant, which began operation in 2021, the campus is increasingly crucial to the Group's global production capacity. Construction and installation of machinery and equipment are also underway at the remaining aerospace component and surface treatment plants, which are expected to begin trial production and obtain aerospace system certification in 2023. In addition to optimizing its production footprint in Asia, Europe and the US, the Group also actively implemented its ""Region for Region Manufacturing"" and ""Dual Source Production"" strategies, which can effectively reduce potential supply chain and tariff risks faced by its customers due to geopolitics and continue to help the Group expand its market share in North America.   The gradual reopening of borders around the world last year and the significant relaxation of travel restrictions in the PRC in early 2023 point to a full recovery of the international aerospace market. The Group expects sales in the aerospace end market to continue to experience strong growth between 2023 and 2024. Amid the pandemic, the Group has been actively planning forward-looking deployment in the aerospace sector. It established the ""Aerotek Business Unit"" and completed the acquisition of Foshan Ameriforge Manufacturing Technology Co., Ltd which focuses on high-precision, high-complexity critical components for end markets such as commercial aircraft. These have allowed the Group to realize synergies with its existing businesses in areas such as sales network and supply chain management while consolidating its strengths in the aerospace end market.   The Group is also committed to deploying a diversified range of industrial end markets. Factors such as soaring global energy prices and increased infrastructure investment by the US government have supported strong growth in the high horsepower engine, agricultural equipment and construction equipment end markets. During the year, the Group acquired the hydraulic orbital motor business of Danfoss Jiangsu to further expand its hydraulic component and system business. In addition, with the increasingly stringent requirements for emission reduction in commercial vehicles in various countries and the future development of hydrogen energy commercial vehicles, the Group will be presented with ample market opportunities. Therefore, the Group will continue to concentrate its resources on the development of the commercial vehicle end market in order to reduce the impact of passenger vehicle electrification.   Looking ahead, despite the fading impact of COVID-19, the overall global economic environment, particularly in Europe and the US, will continue to face considerable downward pressure. Uncertainties such as high inflation and geopolitics will continue to affect macroeconomic growth, and the ongoing tight supply chains will continue to put considerable pressure on the Group. However, through the implementation of its ""Global Footprint"" and ""Diversified End Markets"" strategies, the Group has been able to effectively mitigate the impact of related risks. Coupled with the Mexico SLP campus, which has further strengthened the Group's global production footprint, the Group remains cautiously optimistic about its business prospects. As of February 28, 2023, the Group's total undelivered orders on hand for the next 12 months amounted to HK$3,980 million, an increase of 6.2% year-on-year. As the new acquisitions of the Group in 2022 are mainly from domestic customers, which have a different order cycle than overseas customers, which is, generally shorter, the management is still confident that the sales growth will be maintained in 2023.   Mr. Lu Ruibo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Impro, said, ""Looking ahead, the Group will continue to capitalise on its unique strengths of ""Global Footprint"" and ""Diversified End-markets"" by leveraging its global manufacturing and sales network in Asia, Europe and the United States, and will actively expand into aerospace area and diversified industrials end-market and respond to the cycles and volatility of the global market with unique and superior resilience. Meanwhile, the Group will continue to expand its production capacity and implement the strategy of ""Twin Growth Engine"", as well as seek for suitable acquisition targets. The Group will continue to enhance its research and development capabilities and keep focusing on high-precision, high-complexity and mission critical components and hydraulic systems, in order to provide customers with high-quality, unique and globalized products and services, thereby continuously strengthening the Group's leading position in the industry and securing sustainable value growth for our shareholders.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830771,The Growing Popularity of Peptides: Benefits and Applications,"In the pharmaceutical industry, drugs are typically divided into two main categories: small molecules and large molecules, also known as biologics. However, a third category of drugs called peptides exists, which falls somewhere in between, providing benefits that overlap with both categories.Small molecules and BiologicsSmall molecule drugs are the most commonly used form of treatment as they are simple, easy to synthesize in a laboratory, and often taken orally, such as painkillers. However, due to their chemical composition, their effects are short-lived, lasting only a few hours at most.In contrast, large molecules, or biologics, are more complex, typically being proteins produced from living cells and requiring injection into the bloodstream. Examples of biologics include antibodies, vaccines, and gene therapies. Biologics are effective against serious conditions and have fewer side effects, as they share similarities with the body’s own molecules and bind specifically to their target(s).PeptidesPeptides form a unique class of pharmaceuticals that bridge the gap between small molecules and biologics. Like small molecules, peptides are often synthesized in a laboratory and can produce their intended effects quickly. However, like biologics, peptides are often based on endogenous compounds and are formed by amino acids, making them well-tolerated by patients.Although biologics and peptides are composed of the same building blocks, amino acids, they differ in size. A protein chain of over 40 amino acids is categorized as a biologic, such as an antibody, while a chain of fewer than 40 amino acids is called a peptide, as defined by the FDA. Despite this difference in size, peptides and biologics share a highly specific mode of action that can produce long-lasting effects.Some amino acids are naturally occurring building blocks of peptides and proteins, and some peptides occur naturally in the body. However, peptides can also be produced synthetically due to their small size, unlike biologics, which are extracted from living cells. Because of their wide range of applications, peptides are used to treat many diseases, from cancer to diabetes. Therefore, peptide therapeutics are on the rise.Pharmaceutical companies consider therapeutic peptide development highly attractive due to the high probability of success in clinical trials compared to small molecules. Peptide-based drug candidates are more likely to be approved and reach patients than small-molecule drug candidates.Benefits of PeptidesPeptides have various functions in the body, including hormone regulation, immune system support, and tissue repair. They are involved in numerous physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, and cell signaling. The following are some of the benefits of peptides:Muscle growth and recovery: Peptides stimulate the production of growth hormone, which is crucial for muscle growth and repair. Growth hormone is also essential for fat loss, increased energy levels, and improved sleep quality. Peptides have become increasingly popular among athletes and bodybuilders due to their ability to enhance athletic performance and build muscle mass.Anti-aging properties: Peptides can stimulate collagen production, which is essential for maintaining healthy and youthful-looking skin. Peptides can also reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and improve skin texture and tone. Peptides have become a popular ingredient in anti-aging skincare products and treatments.Health condition treatment: Some peptides have been shown to have antimicrobial properties and can be used to fight infections. Others have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and can be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Peptides are also being studied for their potential in cancer treatment.Gut health: Peptides are essential for digestion and can improve gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Some peptides can also strengthen the gut lining and reduce inflammation, which can improve digestive health and prevent various gut disorders. Peptides are increasingly being used in gut health supplements and treatments.Applications of PeptidesPeptides are being used in various fields, including medicine, cosmetics, and agriculture. The following are some of the applications of peptides:Medicine: Peptides have various medical applications, including as drugs for treating diseases and disorders. For example, insulin is a peptide hormone used to treat diabetes. Peptides are also being studied for their potential in cancer treatment.Cosmetics: Peptides are increasingly being used in cosmetics and skin care products due to their anti-aging properties. Peptides are also used in hair care products.Agriculture: Peptides are being used in agriculture to enhance crop growth and yield. Peptides can also improve plant resilience to stress and disease.Research: Peptides are used extensively in scientific research to study various physiological processes and develop new drugs and treatments.ConclusionPeptides are becoming increasingly popular in the health and wellness industry due to their various benefits and applications. Peptides have shown promise in enhancing athletic performance, improving skin health, treating various health conditions, and promoting gut health. Peptides have numerous applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, and scientific research. It is important to use peptides responsibly and in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking peptides, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830810,World Cup 2022 player workload survey shows alarming signs,"France defender Raphael Varane caught many by surprise last month when he announced his retirement from the national team at the age of just 29.""I gave everything, physically and mentally,"" Varane said in an interview with Canal+. ""But the very highest level is like a washing machine, you play all the time and you never stop. We have overloaded schedules and play non-stop. Right now, I feel like I'm suffocating and that [Varane] the player is gobbling up [Varane] the man.”A new survey shows Varane is not the only player struggling to cope with physical and mental fatigue. After the 2022 World Cup, the French squad, which included Varane, had played the most minutes of any nation in international club competitions. At the time of announcing his retirement, Varane had played 2,136 minutes in the current campaign.Following the tournament in Qatar, the global union for professional football players, FIFPRO, conducted a survey to find out more about the players' workload during the 2022 World Cup. The samples collected from 64 players ensured feedback from every World Cup group, every stage of the tournament, including both finalists, and a broad range of age profiles.The World Cup in Qatar marked a significant departure from tradition, as it was the first edition of the tournament played during the winter. In an already highly condensed match calendar, this led to many players arriving in Qatar just days before their first match. One player quoted in the survey said that ""it seemed bizarre, that players had to return so quickly — it was practically suicide. They could have gotten injured, but luckily, they didn't.""According to the survey, 86% of the players felt they needed at least 14 days of preparation time before a tournament and 61% were in favor of a minimum of 14-28 days recovery time following its conclusion. Varane, for example, played in a league match for Manchester United nine days after playing 112 minutes in the World Cup final.Due to the timing, the 2022 World Cup had a compressed schedule, with 64 matches played in just 29 days. Even with 32 participating nations, the tournament became the shortest since the 1978 tournament, which only featured 16 teams.""What we know for a fact is that fatigue creates injuries and poor performance,"" Dr. David Burgess told reporters at a media event unveiling the report. ""We are not only talking physical exhaustion, but the mental part as well. We have seen often that mental fatigue not only causes a performance drop on the field, but also leads to general poor lifestyle choices.""Burgess is FIFPRO's senior advisor on player workload, health and performance. He is also the high-performance manager of Australian Rules Football club Adelaide Crows, and has previously worked with Arsenal, Liverpool and the Australian national team.""We saw the impact prior to the World Cup of a number of players with minor issues missing an entire tournament, because of the poor lead-up,"" Burgess said.Karim Benzema and Christopher Nkunku are two examples from the French team, who missed the entire World Cup because of injuries suffered in the lead-up to the tournament.""Some players played matches by January 1st after the World Cup, and that's playing matches, not arriving back at the club. It's a significant issue.""Another problem was the extraordinarily long injury time that was implemented at the 2022 World Cup. As a result of that new policy, the average time-added-on at torunament matches was around 11.6 minutes, which is an increase of almost 60% compared to the World Cup in Russia four years earlier and double what was considered to be the norm in previous decades.While the increase in playing time may seem small in the bigger picture, Burgess said it could have a significant impact on the players' workload, rest, recovery and conditioning.""Because of the extended injury time, players had to run on average almost one kilometer (0.6 of a mile) more at the 2022 Qatar World Cup compared to previous tournaments,"" he said. ""If you put that on top of some of the high-pressure stress situations that the players are already asked to go through, you can see why we are concerned with those numbers.""Fifty-three percent of the surveyed players said they liked the extension of stoppage time in Qatar, but they also stressed that if this practice were to be adopted generally in football, this would need to be taken into account in the planning of fixtures.Presumably, though, this would require a reduction of matches, and what governing body or league would voluntarily reduce the number of its games  – and in turn its revenue? Would players be willing to take a pay cut to play fewer games?FIFPRO's general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said that FIFA had expressed a desire to find a compromise regarding the match calendar, but there hasn't been a clear proposal yet on what that could look like.""We expect FIFA to prioritize the player's health,"" Baer-Hoffmann said. ""We have made an agreement with them, which stipulates that they would negotiate the calendar with us in good faith. What's happening at the moment is a 'cannibalization' of the schedule, with different governing bodies eating up the calendar. There are no safeguards put into place for the players and it's very worrying.""53% of the surveyed players reported having suffered an injury or felt more likely to suffer an injury due to the congested calendar, while 44% said they had experienced extreme or increased physical fatigue compared to how they usually feel by January.Raphael Varane is certainly not the only player to voice concern, but his comments act as a reminder of the potential personal cost of football's packed calendar.""FIFA knows exactly what we think is necessary, we have told them for years. We have discussions with them, but they're not at the level where at this point we feel like there is a proposition on the table that we could sign off on,"" Baer-Hoffmann said.So what if FIFA doesn't take FIFPRO's suggestions on board and continues with the status quo?""Then we will consider our own steps."" What they will look like? ""Time will tell.""Edited by: James Thorogood",2023/03/09,,

Attacks have targeted both civilians, including the Shiite minority, and Taliban security forces.Muzmal's death makes him among the highest-ranking Taliban officials to have been slain since the Taliban returned to power.Government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a tweet that the governor was ""martyred by the enemies of Islam."" No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.Asif Waziri, a local police spokesman, told the French AFP news agency that the explosion happened on the second floor of the governor's office in the provincial capital Mazar-e-Sharif.""It was a suicide attack. We don't have information as to how the suicide bomber reached the office of the governor,"" Waziri said, adding that two people were also wounded.Extra security was deployed to the governorate building.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830815,Indonesia: Two soccer officials jailed over stadium disaster,"An Indonesian court on Thursday found two soccer match officials guilty of negligence in connection with one of the worst stadium stampedes in history. One was sentenced to a year in prison, and the other received a prison sentence of 18 months.The stampede on October 1, 2022, left 135 people dead, with over 40 children among the victims. More than 300 people had to be taken to nearby hospitals.It occurred during a derby match in Malang, East Java, between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya.Abdul Haris, a match official, was convicted ""due to his negligence causing people to die,"" the judge stated in the Surabaya court and imposed a sentence of one and a half years in prison.Suko Sutrisno, a security official, was given a one-year jail term after he was found guilty of negligence.""The defendant did not anticipate the chaos because there has never been an emergency situation before. The defendant also did not understand his job as a security official well,"" the judge said.Both men have seven days to appeal the verdict.The former director of the company in charge of running Indonesia's premier league has been named a suspect and is presently under police investigation.Three police officers have also been charged with negligence and will stand trial.The tragedy was sparked by police firing tear gas into the stands, a crowd control measure prohibited by FIFA, soccer's world governing body. Fans attempted to rush out of the 42,000-capacity stadium after home side Arema FC lost to Persebaya Surabaya.A fact-finding team tasked by the government with investigating the disaster found that the ""excessive"" and ""indiscriminate"" use of tear gas was the top cause of death in the tragedy.Malaysia's national police have removed several police chiefs from their positions following the tragedy, with nine police officers also having been suspended for professional ethics violations.Weeks after the deadly tragedy, Indonesian President Joko Widodo declared that the Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, where the fatal stampede occurred, would be torn down and rebuilt according to FIFA standards, with proper facilities that can ensure the safety of both players and supporters.ss/sms (AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830816,"Michelle Yeoh: Smashing age, gender and diversity barriers","Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh is, for want of a better phrase, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once.""The 60-year-old, female, Asian actor has been making headlines for playing Evelyn Wang in the same-titled hit film by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as ""the Daniels""), for which she's become the first Asian winner of a SAG award and second Asian winner of a Golden Globe for best actress. Her snubbing at the BAFTAs in February drew widespread ire, with many fans saying she was ""robbed"" of the award.Now, she is the first Asian-identifying actor to receive an Oscarnomination for best actress. The ceremony will be held on March 12.Her winning streak has also made her a role model to people of color, Asians and women, especially those of a ""certain age.""In ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" Yeoh plays a harried immigrant wife and mother facing an Inland Revenue Service (IRS) audit of the family laundromat.Things change when she discovers that there are multiple versions of the universe — and herself — and they're all facing a threat that only her current avatar can stop. Thus she finds herself surfing parallel realities and picking up skills honed by different versions of herself.Besides showcasing Yeoh's credentials gleaned from almost 40 years of acting, the film's success reflects her own tenacity in an industry that has often written stereotypical tropes for non-white actors.Michelle Yeoh never aimed to become an actor. Born and raised in Malaysia, she wanted to become a ballerina and was enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dance in London, until a back injury ended her ambitions.Then in 1983 her mother, Janet, entered her in the Miss Malaysia/World pageant without her prior knowledge. She went on to win the contest. This soon led to appearances in Hong Kong commercials. Her first one was for Guy Laroche watches, with none other than the world-famous martial arts actor, Jackie Chan.Film offers followed and she rose to prominence in the 1980s starring in a series of Hong Kong action and martial arts films where she performed her own stunts, such as ""Yes, Madam!"" (1985), ""Police Story 3: Supercop"" (1992) and ""Holy Weapon"" (1993).In an era pre-dating the promotion of ""diversity and representation,"" she had originally worked under the stage name Michelle Khan — instead of her maiden name, Yeoh. This alias was chosen by film production house D&B Films based on the belief that ""Khan"" would resonate better with international and western audiences. She later reverted to her own name.She briefly retired from acting in 1987 after marrying Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon, who incidentally co-founded D&B Films, but resumed her career after they separated in 1992.She got her Hollywood break in 1997 when she was cast opposite Pierce Brosnan's James Bondin ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" as the first ethnic Chinese Bond girl. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked her as the seventh best Bond girl, calling the ""savvy Chinese agent,"" one of the few ""wom[e]n of color to match wits with 007"" and ""the first one you could take seriously.""Yet despite breaking the mold of a typical Bond girl, Yeoh didn't work for two years as Hollywood kept offering her roles of ""fragile Asian women.""In a 2018 interview with GQ, she recalled: ""When I first came to do movies here, I remember very specifically someone said, 'If we cast an African-American lead, there's no way we can cast you, because we can't have two minorities.'""In an interview with TIME that nominated her as its ""Icon of The Year 2022,"" she elaborated that Asian actors have long been given stereotypical or inconsequential roles, and rarely top billing. ""It shouldn't be about my race, but it has been a battle,"" she said. ""At least let me try.""Then came Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in 2000, where her martial arts background came to the fore.She also played the regal Mameha in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" (2005) and was a dead ringer for Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in ""The Lady"" (2011).More recent hits include ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018) and roles in the ""Marvel,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Transformers"" and ""The Witcher"" series.But top billing eluded her until her role as Evelyn in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once.""In a CNN interview on February 6, Yeoh revealed that the role was in fact intended for Jackie Chan and she was slated to play his wife. But after Chan turned down the offer, the Daniels role-reversed the story, making Yeoh the lead character.""It was so overwhelming at that point to get a script that said, 'This is a very ordinary woman, an Asian immigrant woman, who is dealing with all the problems that we all can relate to,'"" she said.Meanwhile, Yeoh has also gained a reputation for witty, soundbite-peppered acceptance speeches that often refer to the barriers she's been smashing.When she won the Golden Globe in January, she recalled how people in Hollywood were amazed at her command of English. ""Someone said to me 'You speak English?' I mean, forget about them not knowing Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Asia, India. And then I said, 'Yeah, the flight here was about 13 hours long',"" she recalled wryly to uproarious laughter.While accepting her SAG Award in February, she said: ""This is not just for me, this is for every little girl who looks like me.""She is being widely tipped to win the Academy Award and in the run-up to the event, she has discussed in interviews her nomination and how Asians now approach her with good wishes for her to win.""I think this is beyond just me. It represents so many who have hoped to be seen in this way, to have a seat at the table, to say, 'I am of value too, I need to be seen too'.""Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830819,Taiwan Celts preparing games for St Patrick’s Day,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — On Saturday, March 18, Taiwan Celts will host their annual St. Patrick’s Day festival, featuring both male and female Gaelic competitions, Irish music, beer, and food at Fuhe Park in New Taipei City.
Gaelic football, or what is commonly referred to as just Gaelic, is played on a soccer pitch, and for the uninitiated, is a crude mix between rugby and soccer, two sports which start with an inflated pig’s bladder.

            The event includes a ticketed food and drink option, NT$500 (US$15) for non members and NT$200 (US$6) for new members. Those purchasing tickets can choose from one of three lunchboxes provided by local Latin restaurant Mamacita, and a minimum of three beers per person who wish to drink.

            Organizers are hoping that much of the drinking will occur after the games are completed, but this is not a given considering the event is a St. Patrick's Day celebration. And the activity, after all, is designed to attract more people to the sport, helping the local club field a stronger team for future tournaments.











            Taiwan News exchanged emails with Matthew Goulet, Taiwan Celts’ Men's Player of the Year 2022. Goulet said the group hopes the St. Patrick's Day event will encourage more people to come out and play.

            In Gaelic, a team advances down the field in any number of ways: a hand pass like rugby, a simple kick to another player like soccer, or a self kick akin to Australian rules football. Gaelic is the most popular sport in Ireland, and regularly played by Irish expats when traveling abroad.

            Gaelic involves scoring points, achieved by putting the ball in the other team's goal or over the crossbar and between two upright posts. Goulet warns that Gaelic is not a gentle game, as injuries occur. Tackling is more similar to soccer than rugby, with only shoulder to shoulder hits allowed.

            Goulet says Taiwan Celts have around 100 members with about 120 attending the St. Patrick’s Day event. He expects a similar crowd to attend, rain or shine. A large turnout will allow Taiwan Celts to schedule more games as Gaelic is played between two teams of 15 players. There are 9 teams in Asia.

            Founded in 1995, Taiwan Celts GAA is not only the oldest Gaelic club in Asia, but actively attends and hosts tournaments dedicated to the sport in Asia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830826,Xapo Bank Becomes the First Bank to Offer Near-Instant Bitcoin Payments On the Lightning Network Powered by Lightspark,"Xapo Bank is the first fully licensed bank in the world to integrate Lightning Network.

BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 -  Xapo Bank, a leading Bitcoin custodian and licensed private bank, has partnered with  Lightspark and integrated with the  Lightning Network to enable lightning-fast Bitcoin payments for its customers. Xapo Bank members can now instantly pay for small purchases of up to $100 USD at any vendor which accepts Lightning payments without suffering high transaction fees and long blockchain confirmation waiting times.            The Lightning Network enables scalable payments at millions of transactions per second across the network. This integration will reduce the time-consuming and costly experiences that often plague users who pay for small transactions in Bitcoin. Xapo Bank will be the first fully licensed private bank to offer near-instant Bitcoin payments, and its goal is to be the largest Lightning node, expanding the network's use across a host of new users.   Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, said: ""The average transaction confirmation time of one hour combined with potentially large fees during periods of high usage make the Bitcoin network unsuitable for small daily payments such as groceries. By integrating with the hyper-efficient Lightning Network, we are the first bank in the world to streamline this process and allow our members to pay for small purchases with Bitcoin without having to convert to USD first.    ""Against a backdrop of hyperinflation, economic uncertainty and political turmoil, we are entering a world where digital money is ubiquitous, and we need integrations like this that open up access to Bitcoin payments. We are bringing together the benefits of fast, cost-efficient, and global Bitcoin payments with the security, privacy, and flexibility unmatched in the traditional banking industry.""   Founded in 2013, Xapo was the first institutional holder of Bitcoin and is one of the most trusted custodians in the industry, providing users with a secure platform to store and transact with their Bitcoin. It was the first crypto company in the world to obtain a  banking licence, evolving into Xapo Bank, and has since expanded its offerings to include interest-bearing accounts for both USD and BTC and continues to develop its Wealth Management offering alongside other traditional banking services. Unlike other financial services businesses, members at Xapo Bank own and control their Bitcoin fully, meaning they can receive, hold and send it directly.   David Marcus, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightspark, said:  ""We're thrilled to enable the first bank on the Lightning Network to offer instant, cheap Bitcoin payments to its customers. Xapo has been one of our early closed beta partners, and we're delighted they chose Lightspark's enterprise-grade solution to reliably send and receive payments on the Lightning Network without all the complexity and operational overhead that typically comes with running a node on it. We look forward to talking more about our solution in the months to come.""   To pay via the Lightning Network, Xapo Bank members will need to hold Bitcoin in the Xapo Bank App. After that, they can simply scan and pay an invoice at any merchant accepting Lightning Network payments. The network charges a small fee for each transaction, usually a few Satoshis. Xapo Bank has set a fixed payment fee for SAT 15 (less than $0.01 USD as of Feb 24th) to protect members from executing transactions with high fees.    Wences Casares, Chairman at Xapo Bank, said:    ""We believe that Bitcoin is the future of money, and we are committed to helping our members navigate this new financial landscape. By expanding our services to include instant Bitcoin transfers, we can offer our members better usability and ultimately grow the cryptocurrency that many of our members rely on.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830837,Taiwan national carrier's fine for smuggling cigarettes with presidential plane upheld,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China Airlines’ appeal against its NT$6 million (US$195,000) fine for facilitating the smuggling of cigarettes with Taiwan’s official presidential plane has been stubbed out on Thursday (March 9), per CNA.The Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the airline knowingly cooperated with buyers to help them avoid cigarette duties on presidential flights. China Airlines employees played a key role in the “division of labor” required to carry out the scheme.The scandal came to light in 2018, when allegations surfaced that two National Security Bureau (NSB) officers conspired to use presidential flights to avoid paying taxes on up to 10,000 cartons of cigarettes. China Airlines eventually admitted that between 2014 and 2019, an estimated 35,000 cartons of cigarettes were pre-ordered on presidential flights, going back three presidential administrations.NSB officials were found to be pre-ordering the cigarettes ahead of a presidential trip and storing them in airport tax-free warehouses. When they returned, they loaded NT$6 million worth of cigarettes in government vehicles and joined the president’s motorcade to avoid detection.The NSB officers and the smuggled cigarettes were intercepted by customs officers, who were apparently tipped off prior to the flight’s arrival. NSB officers Wu Tsung-hsien (吳宗憲) and Chang Heng-chia (張恒嘉) were sentenced to over 10 years in prison in 2021.Seven other NSB officials and four China Airlines employees also received prison sentences of between six months to two years. The sentencing court’s verdict said that at least 73 people were believed to have ordered cigarettes illegally smuggled under the cover of presidential trips, but none were prosecuted.In 2019 President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) apologized for her government’s lack of oversight in the scandal, though she is apparently not a smoker herself.",2023/03/09,1135,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830850,BNM decision to affect Malaysian ringgit’s fate this week,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 9 March 2023 - Over the past year, Malaysian ringgit (MYR) has been one of the most resilient currencies among the major 10 Asia currencies that we track. As the Federal Reserve (Fed) started to tighten monetary policy in March last year to rein in inflation, so risk-sensitive currencies began to decline. However,  MYR only lost 6.5% over the past 12 months, outperforming even the global majors, such as the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, which devalued by 15% and 7.7% respectively (see the chart below).        Source: OctaFX calculations based on open-source information       However, things started to turn sour in February. Over the past month,  MYR has been the worst-performing currency among the 10 major Asian currencies that we track (see the chart below). Indeed,  MYR has risen above all key moving averages and closed at 4.4730 against the U.S. dollar (USD) on Friday, setting a new three-month high. Meanwhile, the ringgit also traded mostly lower against its Asian counterparts. It eased versus the Singapore dollar (SGD) to 3.3255/3269 from 3.3210/3252 set on Thursday, fell against the Thai baht (THB) to 12.8998/9105 from 12.8583/8789 previously, and depreciated vis-a-vis the Philippine peso (PHP) to 8.16/8.17 from 8.13/8.14.       Source: OctaFX calculations based on open-source information     The ultimate reason for the general decline in most Asian currencies is essentially the same. Investors have turned bearish on riskier assets, such as emerging markets' debt, after the Fed indicated that it would continue hiking interest rates for longer. Rising U.S. Treasury yields due to the Fed's hawkish stance on monetary policy are making riskier assets less attractive.   'The relative underperformance of  MYR vis-a-vis other Asian currencies is primarily attributable to the fact that Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has been rather cautious in its approach to monetary policy during the current tightening cycle,' explained Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at OctaFX   Indeed, BNM has hiked the rates by only 100 basis points since May and its benchmark interest rate, which currently stands at 2.75%, is still among the lowest in the region. The last hike took place in November last year and Malaysian monetary policy tightening has been essentially on pause ever since. Thus, the divergence between the U.S. and Malaysian monetary policies widened, putting a downward pressure on  MYR.   This week should be rather decisive for MYR as BNM's monetary policy committee will meet to decide on the overnight policy rate on March 9. The market seems to expect BNM to keep the rates unchanged, but in our opinion, a hawkish surprise is quite probable. Two factors are making a rate hike more likely this time around:      No signs of a recession. China, one of Malaysia's top trading partners, recently recorded a very strong growth in its manufacturing and services sectors. According to NBS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February 2023, as production zoomed after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions late last year. In addition, a private survey showed that China's services PMI advanced to 55 in February, signaling more vigorous expansion in the sector.       The Fed remains hawkish. Traders are now pricing in at least three more 25-basis point rate (bps) hikes from the Fed this year, with rates peaking at 5.43% by September. In other words, the Fed is all but certain to raise rates at its next meeting on March 22.        On balance, the Malaysian economy is strong and will likely continue to expand in 2023. The economy of the Asia Pacific region in general is expected to pick up in the short term with gross domestic product (GDP) projected to expand by 3.1% this year, according to a new report published by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Policy Support Unit.  MYR, which has already devalued by more than 5% since late January, will increase aggregate demand in the Malaysian economy and will likely fuel inflation. In addition, rising interest rates in the U.S. will continue to dampen investors' sentiment in the emerging markets.   'It looks prudent for the BNM to hike the rates preemptively in order to offset the negative impact of the hawkish Fed in advance. While forecasting future changes in interest rates is extremely difficult, I believe that BNM will undertake a forward-looking approach and will hike the rates by 25 bps this week. Furthermore, there are signs that the market itself is beginning to price in more rate hikes ahead as the yield on Malaysian 3-year government bonds has risen to 3.465%, the highest in more than two months,' the OctaFX expert Gero Azrul commented.   If BNM does increase rates on March 9,  MYR will appreciate and  USDMYR exchange rate will likely drop towards 4.400 and possibly below. Alternatively, if BNM decided to leave the rates unchanged, USDMYR will likely continue to trade in a sideways mode with a minor bullish tilt, targeting 4.500.  Hashtag: #OctaFX

Drill core (NQ size) is logged and samples are selected by Laurentia Exploration Inc. geologists and sawn in half with a diamond saw at the project site. Half of the core is retained at the site for reference purposes. Sample intervals may vary from 0.5 to 3 metres in length depending on the geological observations. Half-core samples are packaged and sent by ground transportation in sealed rice bags to an independent laboratory, Activation Laboratories Ltd. of Ancaster, Ontario (ISO/IEC 17025:2005 with CAN-P-1579). The core samples are crushed up to 80% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split 250 g and pulverized (mild steel) to 95% passing -200 mesh. Each sample is analyzed for whole rock analysis (code 4B) for 10 major oxides and 7 trace elements by lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion and analysis by ICP-OES.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830940,Taiwan permits more flights to China as 'goodwill gesture',"The Taiwanese government on Thursday said it had agreed to resume more direct flights to China that were stopped after the coronavirus pandemic. It said this was part of a bid to foster ""healthy and orderly exchanges"" with Beijing amid continued tension in the region.Taiwan currently allows air access to only four cities in China, namely Beijing, Chengdu, Shanghai, and Xiamen.Prior to the pandemic, however, there were more direct flights to multiple Chinese cities from Taiwan.Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council has approved regular flights for 10 more cities, including the economic hubs of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Nanjing. Charter flights are also to be resumed for 13 Chinese cities.The latest plan will incorporate 209 flights per week between the two countries. Of those, 99 flights will originate from China, and 110 from Taiwan.Taiwanese health officials also said that covid testing would not be required at present for passengers arriving in Taiwan from China.Chan Chih-hung, an official from the Council, told reporters that the move demonstrated Taiwan's ""most sincere goodwill.""""We also hope to build on the foundation of these resumed flights to gradually increase the exchange of goodwill gestures and cooperative interactions by both sides,"" he said.From 1949 to 2002, no direct flights were in place between Taiwan and China. Passengers had to transit through Hong Kong or Macau.In 2003, the two began charter flights, after which regular direct flights were introduced in 2009.When the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world in 2020, flights were again disrupted.Taipei's government has been attempting to resume its interactions with Beijing after they lifted the strict quarantine regulations last year. The island's president Tsai Ing-wen said she hoped that the efforts would help improve China-Taiwan relations.However, since China considers Taiwan as part of its own territory, Beijing does not hold formal diplomatic relations with Taipei.aa/msh (dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830942,Bangladesh: Food cuts stoke fears of violence in Rohingya camps,"There are about 1 million members of the primarily Muslim Rohingya community living in squalid refugee camps in Cox's Bazar on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh.Many fled the 2017 military clampdown in neighboring Myanmar, which led to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.Though Bangladesh agreed to host the Rohingya, it is largely international aid organizations that have paid the bills.But recently the World Food Programme (WFP) announced that it would have to cut aid because of a $125 million (€117 million) shortfall. The UN organization said that, starting in March, monthly food vouchers would be reduced from $12 to $10 per person. It also warned that there would probably be more cuts if more funds did not come in imminently.Given that malnutrition, anemia and stunted growth are already rife in the camps, where 65% of the population are children and women, people who work with refugees fear that the cuts in rations could have a devastating impact.Ambia Perveen, a co-founder of the Rohingya Medics Organisation, which provides medical care in the refugee camps, told DW that the cuts would affect every Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh.""The food they were provided before was never enough, and now it will affect more, especially children, elderly people, pregnant women and above all the people with chronic diseases,"" she said. ""There is huge malnutrition among children under five years old, severe cases of hepatitis C and anemic pregnant women.""Mohammad Mizanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, told DW that the government could not meet the budget gap and urged international donors to keep up their support.""It's not possible for Bangladesh to carry the burden of hosting the community alone,"" he said. ""The international community has been playing a vital role in managing them. It shouldn't reduce its support and shift its focus to somewhere else.""The cuts to food aid come as there has been an increase in violence in the refugee camps, and observers fear that security will be further destabilized. There have been scores of deadly drug-related clashes in recent months, and numerous community leaders have been murdered. Law enforcement agencies are investigating a series of organized killings.Tensions have also risen along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border because of a rise in illegal activity, such as drug and weapon smuggling.Rezaur Rahman Lenin, a Rohingya researcher based in Cox's Bazar, told DW that the Bangladeshi authorities must immediately increase security and improve management in the camps.""Given that Myanmar's government won't let its people go home and that Rohingya refugees in camps are becoming more vulnerable, it is shocking that the UN is willing to cut these essential humanitarian funds,"" he said.""At least 25 people have been killed in the past five months in the camps, many of whom were Rohingya community leaders,"" he added. ""The people killed were chosen because they supported the rights, security and welfare of the Rohingya people and the return of refugees. It has also been asserted that many of them were killed for helping the police stop criminal activity.""Jasmin Lorch, from the Hamburg-based GIGA Institute for Asian Studies, told DW that the cuts would exacerbate tensions in the overcrowded camps.""While there is no one-to-one relationship between deprivation and crime, increasing hunger and frustration may lead more people to become involved in drug trafficking to secure their livelihood,"" she said. ""Deprivation, enhanced frustration and the feeling of being left alone may also fuel the consumption of drugs.""Following a visit to the country in February, the German-South Asian parliamentary group recommended that, in the wake of cuts, Bangladesh should allow aid-dependent Rohingya Muslims living in camps to work. The group also recommended that children be granted better access to education.""Refugees have to have a chance to develop themselves,"" Renate Kunast, the head of the Bundestag group, told reporters in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka.""The Rohingya children should get an education, and the adult refugees should be able to earn so that they can pay for their essentials,"" Kunast said.""Allowing the Rohingya refugees access to jobs and education would be highly beneficial,"" Lorch said, pointing out that there had been other similar diplomatic initiatives. She added that this would not only allow them to improve their livelihood but would give them prospects in Bangladesh.Lorch said Bangladesh's government was not likely to implement such proposals as its ultimate aim is that the refugees leave.""But a safe return of the Rohingya to Myanmar seems impossible in the foreseeable future, especially since the February 2021 military coup,"" she said.""The Bangladesh government's priority has never been integration,"" Mohammad Mizanur Rahman confirmed. ""It has always been repatriation. Repatriation is the only solution to the problem.""He said most of the Rohingya in Bangladesh could only work as farmers or fishermen but that there were enough of these already and that there might be social unrest in the wider population if the refugees were allowed to work.He added that Rohingya children did have ""access to education in the camps."" However, the makeshift schools there are not allowed to teach the Bangladeshi curriculum or the main language of Bangladesh, Bengali. They are bound to following Myanmar's curriculum. The idea is that the children will eventually leave Bangladesh.Most Rohingya in Bangladesh do not have refugee status, which would provide them more protection.Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830944,Hong Kong: Pro-democracy activist's wife arrested,"Elizabeth Tang, a veteran union leader and wife of a prominent pro-democracy activist, was arrested on Thursday after she visited her imprisoned husband in a Hong Kong jail, according to unnamed sources close to the detained.The city's  authorities apprehended Tang on suspicions of ""endangering national security"" and ""colluding with foreign forces,"" according to the local state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po.Tang is a labor activist working for the International Domestic Workers Federation. She was also a former executive in the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU), which has been disbanded.The CTU was the city's largest pro-democracy trade association before it was dissolved in 2021 due to security threats.Lee Cheuk-yan, Tang's husband, is a leading pro-democracy activist. He was the former head of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China.The alliance organized  mass candlelight vigils on the anniversary of the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.However, after the Chinese government imposed the security law, the coalition voted to dissolve in 2021.Lee was arrested on charges of unlawful assembly and other offenses.Beijing's national security law, introduced in 2021, has led to the arrest of more than 230 citizens, including pro-democracy activists and politicians.The law was implemented in response to the mass pro-democracy demonstrations of 2020.Several Western governments have condemned the law stating that it is a measure to restrict free speech.The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, on Monday, also expressed their concern and requested the authorities in charge to review the security law.Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have denied accusations that the law is being used to suppress the democratic opposition.They say that the law has proved to be beneficial for the city's stability.aa/sms  (Reuters, ap)",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830945,How to combat winter droughts and water shortages,"In Europe, many farmers are worried about their crops because there is already too little rainfall this early in the year.Having enough precipitation in winter is crucial to replenish groundwater reserves, according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.""When we look at maps showing soil moisture, we're seeing a soil moisture deficit,"" she said.In many parts of Europe, this season has been drier than ever before. Though it is still winter, countries from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands to Spain, Belgium, Portugal, France and Italy don't have enough water. In southern Europe, this is already leading to wheat and barley crop failures.The last few summers have been exceptionally hot, causing entire lakes and rivers to dry up in southern Europe. In Italy alone, water scarcity destroyed a large proportion of the rice harvest in just a few weeks. In some countries, water supply restrictions had to be put in place.Due to the climate crisis, dry periods are set to become longer and more severe in future, especially in summer. If there is also too little precipitation in winter, droughts will last longer and the following summer will be even drier.So how can farmers, communities and countries prepare to mitigate the impact of drought?When she spoke to DW last summer, Andrea Colombo of the Po River District Basin Authority in Italy demanded that the infrastructure for different retention basins be expanded.This would allow winter rain and meltwater to be stored in villages, towns and regions near the Italian Alps for use in the spring. Countries in other regions of the world have already implemented this idea.Singapore, for example, has two different water systems. One for wastewater, another for collecting rainwater throughout the city. The water is processed into drinking water and stored in huge reservoirs.Of course, the effectiveness of these basins depends on how much precipitation falls in winter. In the Italian Alps, this season's snowfall has been half the usual amount, according to local environmental organization Legambiente. And the Po, the country's longest river, is only carrying a fraction of the usual amount of water.The organization warns that the situation is critical and requires urgent action.""We have to reduce the withdrawals for different sectors and uses before we reach the point of no return,"" Giorgio Zempetti, head of Legambiente, said in a press release in late February 2023.The organization is calling on the new Italian government to implement a national water strategy that also promotes circular water management. This would include treating and using the water more often to reduce the environmental impact and conserve groundwater.Italy's agriculture minister Francesco Lollobrigida described the water scarcity in early March as a ""state of emergency that requires short and long-term measures."" What is still lacking, however, is a concrete strategy.Another way to save water quickly and effectively would be to plug the holes in the existing water infrastructure and fix pipe leaks.Italy, for example, loses 40% of its water to leaking pipes. The figure is 20% in France and 30% in Portugal, according to the European Association of Water Service Providers. But the volume of water lost is highest in Bulgaria (60%) and Romania (more than 40%).On average, a quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost due to poor infrastructure and inadequate water management.In response the EU proposed an update of its water directive in late 2022. It has called on member states to better monitor water wastage and leaks, as well as investing in appropriate measures and data collection.According to the European Commission, there is also massive potential for treating and reusing water.Currently, only 0.5%, or about one billion cubic meters, of the fresh water withdrawn in the EU is treated and reused. With sufficient treatment plants and the appropriate infrastructure, water could be used much more efficiently, which would significantly reduce the pressure on fresh water reservoirs and dependence on natural water sources.For example, in Italy, treated water accounts for only 5% of artificial irrigation. The rest comes from increasingly scarce freshwater sources. Agriculture currently consumes 30% of all fresh water in the EU.Farmers could also transition to more drought-resistant crops, says Burgess.Should the situation continue to worsen, authorities in France have already announced they may impose restrictions on water use in 87 municipalities.These measures, such as banning filling private swimming pools, are usually only rolled out during extreme droughts at the height of summer.Copa-Cogeca, an association of European farmers, told DW the situation is  ""worrisome.""Climate specialist Samantha Burgess agrees that indications for water supplies in the coming warm months are not good.""Unless we have a series of storms or rainfall events that have a lot of moisture, what we're seeing in the maps of soil dryness at the moment suggests we are facing a very dry spring and a very dry summer,"" she said.Burgess assumes there will be restrictions on water use in affected regions in Europe this summer. However, that doesn’t necessarily leave us high and dry.""Climate change impacts are here and they're impacting us right now,"" she said. ""There are a lot of different things that individuals, businesses and society can do.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830946,"North Korea fires short-range missile, South Korea says","North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile toward the Yellow Sea, South Korean officials said.The Yonhap news agency reported the missile was fired westward toward the sea without giving details.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapon was fired at around 6:20 p.m. (0920 GMT/UTC) from an area around the western coastal city of Nampo.The launch came two days after Kim Yo Jung, the influential sister of leader Kim Jong Un, said her country was ready for ""quick, overwhelming action"" against the United States and South Korea.Pyongyang's short-range launches also come after the US flew a B-52 bomber for joint training with South Korea ealier this week, in a show of force against the North's nuclear and missile threats.The US has mobilized powerful military assets in recent drills, in response to Pyongyang's escalating threats but said Thursday's launch does not pose a threat to the US or its allies.""We are aware of the ballistic missile launch and are consulting closely with our allies and partners,"" the US Indo-Pacific Command said. ""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to our allies, the missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.""Since the collapse of its negotiations with the United States in 2019, North Korea has been accelerating its development of short-range solid-fuel ballistic missiles targeting South Korea.The North has been testing its ballistic missiles at a record pace. It fired more than 70 ballistic missiles last year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with the potential to reach the US mainland.North Korea first tested a long-range cruise missile system in September 2021 and has implied the missiles are being developed to be armed with nuclear warheads.The US and international observers have warned for months that North Korea appears to be preparing for an underground nuclear test, which would be the nation's first since September 2017.While Kim Jong Un has called for an expansion of his country's nuclear arsenal, North Korea's civilian economy faces a deepening crisis. Experts say that COVID-19-related border controls and sanctions may have worsened the country's food crisis.rm/sms (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830965,Maternal mortality: Pregnancy is 'shockingly dangerous',"Pregnancy means new life to most of us — and a unique experience every time, bringing your baby into this world. But in all too many cases, pregnancy also means the end of a life.In late February 2023, the United Nations released a new report on maternal mortality around the world. The report described how  one woman dies every two minutes due to child birthor complications experienced in pregnancy.""Pregnancy is tragically still a shockingly dangerous experience for millions around the world,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO).In the year 2000, the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) stood at 339. That means that 339 pregnant people of child-bearing age died per 100,000 live births.In 2020, the global MMR was 223.But according to the UN report, most countries around the globe have failed to lower their maternal mortality rate (MMR) significantly in that 20 year period.The UN report says there had been a small decrease between the years 2000 and 2015, but that since 2016 the global maternal mortality rate has stagnated. And that is unacceptable, said Jenny Cresswell, a scientist at the WHO and co-author of the report.""Stagnation is absolutely not good enough,"" Cresswell told DW. ""The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. We are currently far off-track to meet this target.""In some countries, including developed ones like the US, the maternal mortality rate has been rising for years.At more than 23, the US has by far the highest MMR of all industrialized countries. The rate increased by roughly 78% between 2000 and 2020.With low total numbers, even minor changes make for a high increase in the percentage of a number. But that doesn't change the fact that the number of pregnant people who die during pregnancy, childbirth or shortly thereafter has been rising for decades in one of the richest countries in the world.It is not easy to explain why the MMR is going up in the US said Munira Gunja, a senior researcher with the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports independent research on health care issues in the US.Gunja said that a number of factors may be contributing to the situation, including ""a lot of underlying health conditions [that] have been on the rise for years now.""Then there's the fact that many Americans don't have health insurance and can't afford to visit their doctor. The cost of health services has gone up as well. And there is a shortage of midwives who can help people through their pregnancies.""The rate at which people in the US skip [medical] care is dramatically higher compared to other developed countries,"" Gunja said. It all comes together to contribute to ""this unacceptable maternal mortality rate,"" Gunja said.But that is not all. The MMR among Black Americans is about three times higher than among white Americans.That stark difference is due to ""structural racism,"" Gunja said. ""[Black Americans] are at a disadvantage from the start: Where they live, their education level, their jobs and salary. And when they see a doctor, they are often faced with direct racism.""Gunja said it would make a big difference already if there were more active midwives in the US. Midwives can build a close relationship with the pregnant person, take care of them at home and check in during the post-partum period, too ― which is when half of all maternal deaths in the US occur.But things may also need to change on clinical and on policy levels.On the clinical level, healthcare professionals need to spot the warning signs right before, during and after a baby is delivered, said Usha Ranji, associate director for women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on health issues in the US.""Some of the factors contributing to maternal deaths were hemorrhaging during and after delivery as well as sepsis [blood poisoning], eclampsia and pre-eclampsia [seizures during childbirth],"" said Ranji.When these things go unnoticed, they can be deadly.Ranji said training among doctors and nurses was improving, those who worked in labor and delivery, and that there was ""a lot more emphasis on listening and better communication with the patients.""On the policy level, Ranji said it is crucial to get everyone on health insurance because 10% of women of childbearing age are still uninsured in the US and, as a result, less likely to seek and receive the medical care they need.""It's important to get people into care well before they're pregnant"" to make sure they're in overall good health, Ranji said. ""But it's hard to get into care when you don't have health insurance.""The UN report says South Asia is one of the few world regions where the maternal mortality rate is decreasing. And India has seen the biggest improvement in its MMR.Maternal mortality fell in India by more than 73% between the years 2000 and 2020.In 2020, India's MMR was at 103 nationwide. That is still a lot higher than the MMR in the US. But while maternal mortality in the US increased at an annual rate of 2.88% from 2000 to 2020, it fell at an annual rate of 6.64% in India during the same time period.Rajib Dasgupta, a professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said India had started to see the benefits of a more liberalized and growing economy in the past two decades.""There has been an overall decline in absolute poverty, a sustained increase in key determinants such as women's education and income, and a growing infrastructure,"" said Dasgupta.These social factors all contribute significantly to improving maternal health and preventing deaths during and after pregnancy, according to the UN report.Countries in South Asia that have seen their MMR decrease over the past 20 years ""have made good progress in terms of economic development, increasing female education and other important areas that all play a role,"" Cresswell told DW. ""They have demonstrated sustained political commitment to increasing women’s access to quality maternity services.""But the experts say India needs more political commitment to spread these improvements across the country.""To make it to the SDG target [a maternal mortality rate below 70], the inequity between the Indian states should receive more attention,"" Dasgupta said.A number of Indian states have achieved the SDG target.The state of Kerala's MMR is 19. It is not the lowest rate in India, but it is a lower MMR than that in the United States.At the other end of the spectrum is the state of Assam, with a maternal mortality rate of 195, more than ten times higher than Kerala's MMR.But even in Assam things are moving in the right direction. Down to Earth, an Indian magazine on environmental and development policy, reported at the end of 2022 that Assam's MMR was 237 between 2014 and 2016. That shows a drop of more than 40 deaths in pregnancy per 100,000 live births.India is on the right path, said Dasgupta — it has invested in medical infrastructure and increased the number of medical personnel across the country and now ""it is the time to build upon this strength.""Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830966,Corinne Diacre sacked as coach of France football team,"The French Football Federation (FFF) on Thursday announced that it had decided to part ways with national team head coach Corinne Diacre after an executive committee meeting.In a press release, the FFF praised Diacre's ""involvement and seriousness"" but said that a four-person committee that had been set up to scrutinize how the women's national team is being run, had ""unanimously"" recommended sacking the coach.""The numerous hearings conducted have made it possible to establish a very important gap with some top players,"" it said. ""This gap has reached a point of no return that damages the team's interests.""The move wasn't completely unexpected, as Diacre had been under growing pressure since captain Wendie Renard announced her resignation from the national team last month.""I can no longer support the current system which falls a long way short of the demands required to compete at the highest level,"" Renard said.Paris Saint-Germain forward Kadidiatou Diani, the top scorer in the French league, who like Renard was nominated for last year's Ballon d'Or, also quit, along with her PSG teammate Marie-Antoinette Katoto.The federation said interim President Philippe Diallo had asked a committee to speak to potential candidates to replace Diacre as head coach ""as soon as possible.""The move could hardly have come at a more inopportune time, with France set to compete in the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July and August.The French federation was already in crisis following the resignation of its scandal-hit 81-year-old president, Noel Le Graet, last week.Diacre, who took charge of the French national team in 2017 and was under contract until August 2024, said on Wednesday that she had become the victim of a smear campaign.Under Diacre, France, as hosts, lost to the United States in the quarterfinals at the last World Cup in 2019.  Les Bleues then lost to Germany in the semifinals of last year's Euros in England.Diacre, who as a player made 121 appearances for the national team, previously coached second-division outfit Clermont — making her the first woman to coach a men's team in a competitive match in France.pfd/msh (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830967,India: Big fat wedding turns green,"When Nupur Agarwal and Ashwin Malwade who had met each other at a beach clean-up drive in Mumbai decided to get married in 2019, they were adamant that their wedding should not contribute further to global warming.""We knew we were going to have a zero-waste wedding because there was no way we wanted to generate the kind of waste that we had picked up on the beach,"" Nupur Agarwal told DW.The couple failed to find a wedding planning firm that could help them organize their special day in an eco-friendly way, so they decided to do it on their own.The members of Ashwin's baraat, the groom's wedding procession, were instructed to arrive at the venue on electric vehicles. Nupur wore her mother's wedding dress, which had been upcycled for the occasion and was decorated with hashtags such as #saynotoplastic and #climatecrisisisreal.The event was such a success that many couples started reaching out to them for advice on how to plan zero-waste weddings. So then they decided to turn this sideline into their profession, setting up an event planning and consulting company called Greenmyna.In the past three years, they have planned seven weddings and given advice to many more couples. They boast that Greenmyna has neutralized over 2 tons of carbon and composed over 5 tons of waste.But this is almost nothing in a country where the wedding industry is believed to be the fourth largest economic sector and an estimated 10 million weddings take place annually.""A typical three-day wedding generates about 700 to 800 kilos of wet waste and 1,500 kilos of dry waste. The carbon emissions for such weddings stand at approximately 250 tons,"" Ashwin Malwade told DW.Pooja Devani and Arjuna Thakker, both non-resident Indians, also wanted to do as little damage to the planet as possible with their wedding in the city of Pune in western India. But they had invited 140 guests from the UK.""The question was how can we be eco-friendly when we are flying people to India?"" Pooja Devani said.In the end, they decided to offset their carbon footprint by planting trees with the help of Greenmyna. ""We realized it's difficult to have a zero-waste wedding, but we can easily have a low-waste wedding.""Shanay Jhaveri, who got married in December last year, also turned to Greenmya for help in offsetting carbon emissions, deciding to plant a Miyawaki forest.""I also had e-invites and the invites that I printed were on seed papers, which we sowed as part of a ceremony with close relatives.""Arindam Ghosal, a project manager based in Dubai, was also looking for a way to plan his sister's wedding in January in a more sustainable way. He came across Climes, a climate finance company that allows individuals and enterprises to buy carbon offsets through online credits, and used the company to neutralize 2,250 kilos of carbon.""I wasn't aware of carbon neutralization till 2021,"" explained Ghosal. ""It was after COP 27 that I became curious to learn more about greenhouse gas emissions.""""Our motto is to cut what you can and neutralize what you can't,"" said founder Anirudh Gupta, who launched the firm in 2021 and now already has over 20 consumer brands as partners.""We need to simplify climate action, make it easily accessible, economically viable and fun to do,"" he said, explaining that to make climate-related action more fun, Climes gave wedding guests credits and QR codes that they can scan to choose a climate solutions project to help finance.""The money moves in the form of Climes credits. Each Clime costs 2 Indian rupees (€0.023 and $0.024) and offsets 1 kilo of carbon from the atmosphere,"" he said.The company boasts of offsetting more than 26 tons of carbon emitted from four wedding ceremonies.According to the online platform Statista, Indian weddings have the largest number of guests in the world, with an average of about 500 attendees. A 2017 study by the Indian Ministry of Consumer Affairs in the Delhi region showed that it was not uncommon for wedding buffets to feature 200 to 300 different dishes.NGOs say that there is often excess food waste that is not only harmful to the environment but could also go to disadvantaged people.""On average, excess food left from weddings could feed up to 100 people,"" said Abdul Wahid, who volunteers in New Delhi with the Robin Hood Army, an NGO that distributes food to less fortunate sectors of society.Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830968,Why Germany is not attractive for foreign workers,"Germany is becoming less attractive to top foreign talents, according to a new Bertelsmann/OECD study that will worry Olaf Scholz's government, which is trying to get more foreign skilled workers to fill labor market gaps.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's ""Indicators of Talent Attractiveness,"" released on Thursday, shows Germany slipping from 12th place in 2019 to 15th this year among the 38 OECD countries. The analysis is based on seven ""dimensions"" that foreign talents are said to value: Quality of opportunities, income and tax, future prospects, family environment, skills environment, inclusiveness, and quality of life.The study isolated four groups of people that governments hope to attract — highly-qualified specialists, businesspeople, start-up founders, and international students — and found that only among one of those groups, the students, was Germany in the top ten. The top four countries were New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia, with the UK and the US in 7th and 8th place.Mara knows more about the pluses and minuses of moving to Germany than most. Having previously lived in the UK, the 30-year-old Romanian was delighted to find a good job in advertising in Berlin. But after a year in Germany, she's already planning a way out. ""Maybe I'll stay another year or two, but I'm not planning long-term anymore,"" she told DW. ""I'll stay in Germany, but I don't see myself here for the next five or ten years.""Getting a job was the easy part. She has since struggled with the bureaucracy, with finding an apartment in Berlin's notoriously difficult market, and with learning German. Loneliness has played a role too: Initially forced to work at home by the coronavirus, she has found it hard to make social contacts and, since her work is mostly in English, she hasn't been able to improve her German, despite taking courses in Bucharest.In contrast, Germany's bureaucracy for foreigners remains stubbornly in German, which hasn't made things easier. ""Of course, I can't ask people in Germany not to speak German. I would never do that,"" she said. ""But I personally felt quite strange when they asked me for different documents, and I didn't understand anything. A little more openness and flexibility would help. And when I ask if they speak English, they usually say 'no' very quickly and loudly.""And yet, Mara opted to move to Germany because she felt the country, and in her case specifically Berlin, had so much to offer. ""My first encounter with Berlin in 2015 was a great experience,"" she said. ""It is a good combination between the East and the West. It felt good.""Germany is growing desperate to keep as many foreign skilled workers in the country, as a looming demographic shift is set to leave millions of jobs unfilled in the coming decade: The last of the ""baby boomer"" generation, which makes up a major part of the current workforce, is expected to retire by 2035.According to calculations by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), part of Germany's Federal Employment Agency, the country needs a net balance of 400,000 immigrants to enter the country every year to fill the gaps in the labor market. The latest prognoses by Germany's official statistics office expects a net yearly immigration rate of 290,000 people — potentially leaving 3.6 million people missing in the job market.But persuading people to come to Germany is only one part of the solution, according to Paul Becker, a social scientist at the Berlin research institute Minor. ""For a successful skilled labor strategy, it will be crucial to ensure not only more immigration but also that fewer skilled workers emigrate again and instead remain in Germany with their families,"" he wrote in a new study released in February. Becker's research indicates that most people who come to Germany to work leave after only three or four years.Moving to a new country is always daunting, and Mara's experience of Berlin chimes in with a pre-study released in December by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IAW), in Tübingen, southern Germany, which also highlighted issues like integration, dealing with authorities, and paying taxes and social insurance.Based on a survey of 1,885 people who have left Germany, as well as 38 long interviews, the IAW study found a complex set of factors fed into why people left, ranging from residency permits, not being able to find suitable work, not being able to bring family over, the high cost of living, and personal issues.The most commonly given reason was simple enough: Legal issues associated with residency.""I'm assuming that in most cases those were residency permits for training or work and these simply expire and weren't extended,"" said IAW study author Bernhard Boockmann.Discrimination was also a factor, if only a relatively minor one. Though just over 5% of those questioned by the IAW named discrimination as a factor in their decision to leave, two-thirds of highly-qualified people from non-European countries said they had experienced discrimination either from authorities or at work.""Of course, we don't want to downplay the problem of discrimination, which is present in very diverse ways, is very problematic, and which needs to be addressed,"" said Boockmann. ""But it's only in rare cases that that's the reason why someone leaves Germany.""Clearly, the government can only influence a few of the issues, and no single law or new measure is likely to persuade thousands of foreign workers to stay. But Mara, Becker, and Boockmann all think there is a concrete measure that could be taken.""The Federal Employment Agency (BA) doesn't have any concrete measures for how it should advise people who are thinking about emigrating again,"" said Boockmann. ""For example, we think that in a situation where someone loses their job, the BA should make targeted consultations.""Similarly, Boockmann thinks the government could do more to win back workers who have left Germany, as many of those he interviewed remained well-disposed to the country.Paul Becker thinks that families are a key factor and that the task goes way beyond labor policy. ""If skilled people come to Germany and bring their families, we have to ask: 'Ok, how can we make sure that the family members get on well here',"" he told DW. ""Do they get an apartment easily; can they find a school place or a kindergarten place? Do they have the opportunity to learn the language? And how quickly are they consulted on issues related to the German labor market and receive the assistance they may need finding a job?""It is, said Becker, a matter of ""many little screws"" that have to be turned to create a good social framework.Mara, meanwhile, said one thing would have helped her: A way to make friends. ""Industry-specific programs for ex-pats should be supported more,"" she told DW. ""For me, it would have been very helpful to have a place where you can meet other professionals from abroad and exchange ideas. It is important to build a connection, an interpersonal relationship.""Edited by: Rina GoldenbergAlina Kühnel and Sabine Kinkartz contributed to this report.",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830969,French Senate votes to increase retirement age to 64,"France's Senate has approved a proposal to increase the retirement age by two years, to 64. Senate members voted 201 to 115 in favor of the bill.The vote comes against the backdrop of massive strikes and protests that have thrown many sectors into limbo as public sector staff and other workers opposed President Emmanuel Macron's proposal.The French government is looking to realign the country's pension system despite strong opposition from labor unions, saying that it is financially unsustainable otherwise.On top of pushing retirement age to 64, Macron is seeking to incerase the period of payment required to qualify for a full state pension.Macron's government argues that the unpopular measures are needed to shore up the scheme for the future.Despite clearing the Senate on Thursday, the bill is still bouncing between France's chambers of parliament.President Emmanuel Macron'sadjustment of pensions also needs to be approved by the lower house of the French parliament, the National Assembly, where majority support might not be as easy to come by.The lower house is also working on proposed amendments in the form of a compromise plan that might also be sent to the Senate for a vote.The increase of retirement age and the proposed changes to the pensions face stiff opposition from parts of French society.Left-wing politicians voiced anger after the Senate voted in favor of the reforms.""Your name will forever be attached to a reform that will set the clock back almost 40 years,"" Socialist Monique Lubin told Labor Minister Oliver Dussopt.Labor unions have promised to increase pressure on the government by calling for mass action by workers across different sectors.Fuel deliveries, schools, trains, and flights are being disrupted by the demonstrations.Dock workers have joined strikes in a bid to convince Macron to change his stance on the bill that he has championed in both of his presidential campaigns — he gave up on the proposed reforms amid the onset of the Covid pandemic in his first term.Most other European countries have already hiked the retirement age to 65 or over, with France's retirement system among Europe's and particularly western Europe's most generous.dmn/msh (dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/09,,

This is a top priority.""After the talks, Sweden's chief negotiator said that Ankara said during the meeting that it recognized ""concrete"" steps taken in Helsinki and Stockholm.""We see that Turkey recognized that both Sweden and Finland have taken concrete steps in this agreement, which is a good sign,"" chief negotiator Oscar Stenstrom told a news conference. He also said that the three countries would hold further meetings, but that no date had been set.Turkey is blocking Sweden's NATO entry, accusing the Swedish government of being too soft on groups Ankara sees as terrorist organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups.Meanwhile, the Swedish government presented a draft to tighten anti-terror legislation on Thursday. Under the new rules, involvement in a terrorist organization or financing such involvement is punishable by several years in prison.Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said they would close a loophole in the current legislation. The Swedish parliament has yet to approve the measures, which are scheduled to come into force on June 1 this year.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has described the proposed law as an important step in fulfilling the commitments Sweden made in an agreement with Turkey and Finland at the end of June last year.Fearing that they would be next targeted after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland and Sweden abandoned their traditional position of military non-alignment and applied for NATO membership in May 2022.All 30 Allies have signed the accession protocols of Finland and Sweden, and 28 have already ratified these texts. However, Turkey and Hungary have sought guarantees and assurances from the two Nordic countries. The parliaments of all existing NATO members must approve their accession by majority vote.The first round of talks between Turkey, Sweden and Finland failed to break the deadlock. Ankara in January paused talks after a Danish politician burned a copy of the Quran near the Turkish embassy in Stockholm. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government has since hinted several times that it might make a decision on Finland before reaching one for Sweden.dh/msh (AP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/03/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830971,India continues to oppose abolishing the death penalty,"In February, a special court in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India handed down death sentences to seven men convicted of being ""Islamic State"" (IS) operatives.The men were arrested in 2017 after officials received information about the group's plan to carry out blasts in different parts of the South Asian country.They were charged for terror activities, including a bomb blast on a train in 2017.A spokesperson for the National Investigation Agency (NIA) told the media that the group had undergone ""online radicalization"" and was aiming to promote IS ideology in India.While the NIA termed the judgment as ""another milestone,"" the death penalty has been a much debated theme in the country.By coincidence, the same day that the men were sentenced, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk demanded that all nations work harder toward abolishing capital punishment, which continues to be implemented in 79 countries.""If we maintain this momentum to eradicate this inhumane punishment once and for all, we can weave a thread of dignity back into the fabric of our societies,"" he said.Indian courts can impose capital punishment for crimes such as murder, child sexual violence, and terrorism, among others.The year 1980 marked a crucial point in the debate around the death penalty.A trial court in the state of Punjab sentenced to death a man named Bachan Singh for the murder of three men.Singh appealed to the high court of the state, which upheld the sentence. Then he approached the Supreme Court of India, asking it to examine the constitutionality of capital punishment in a case that led to a landmark ruling.Subsequently, a five-judge bench was appointed, which laid out a framework and guidelines to be considered when sentencing someone to death in India.The Bachan Singh case led to the establishment of the ""rarest of rare"" doctrine, meaning that courts should only impose the death penalty in the rarest of rare cases.The guidelines also required trial courts to consider both a crime and a convicted person's life circumstances — such as their age, family background, socio-economic status and mental health problems — before deciding on a sentence.Furthermore, they stipulated that a death sentence should be handed down only if a state can prove that a convict is beyond reform.Despite the guidelines' emphasis on reformative justice, they still left many questions unanswered.There was no clarity on who should collect evidence on the life circumstances of a convicted person or who should submit it in court, and how much time the data collection should take or how a court should assess the life circumstances.Research conducted by Project 39A, a legal research, pro bono litigation & public engagement center, revealed that the life circumstances of the accused had not been not considered in 66.7% of the trials that had resulted in 306 death sentences between 2018 and 2020.Observers say the handing down of death sentences is thus inconsistent, arbitrary and potentially discriminatory as sentencing can fall prey to the bias and prejudices of a judge.In 2022, for the first time in 42 years, the Supreme Court acknowledged the gaps in the current sentencing framework and put together another constitutional bench to resolve them.But as the Supreme Court seeks ways to reform death penalty sentencing, trial courts across India continue to hand down capital punishment.Last year saw 165 death sentences — the highest number in over two decades.The ""Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2022"" revealed that by the end of 2022, 539 people were on death row in India, the highest number since 2004.In 2015, the debate around the death penalty in the country gained momentum. After conducting a detailed study, a Law Commission report called for its abolition, except for in terrorism-related cases.The report argued that the death penalty is unconstitutional and an infringement of Article 14 (right to equality before law) and Article 21 (right to life) of the Indian constitution.""The restorative and rehabilitative aspects of justice are lost sight of,"" read the report.In 2018, the Indian Home Ministry asked various state governments to respond to a proposal on abolishing the death penalty.Of the 14 states that responded, only two supported putting an end to capital punishment. The remaining 12 argued that the death penalty is needed to deter people from committing serious and violent crimes.Rights groups and activists say, however, that evidence from around the world shows that the death penalty has no unique deterrent effect on crime.Since 1976, more than 90 nations have abolished the death penalty for all crimes.Apart from India, many countries including US, Japan, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq continue to impose capital punishment.In December 2022, at the UN General Assembly, 125 countries voted in favor of a moratorium on the death penalty. India voted against it.In 2021, at the UN Human Rights Council, India also opposed a draft resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty.Nevertheless, the actual number of executions in India remains comparatively low.Since 2000, India has carried out just eight executions in total.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830985,Former NATO general sworn in as Czech president,"Former NATO general Petr Pavel was sworn in as Czech Republic'spresident on Thursday. In his inauguration speech, he stressed the importance of unity in supporting war-torn Ukraine.""Central Europe's single voice will be important if we are to help Ukraine prevail,"" he said at the ceremony at Prague Castle, vowing to lift his country's reputation abroad ""to a new level.""He said Ukraine was also an example that smaller countries can be successful, especially if they cooperate with others. ""It is not only our historical experience that should be a reason to continue our support. In doing so, we are ultimately helping ourselves,"" Pavel said.Ukraine ""has shown us and our partners that unbreakable resolve is more than the advantage and strength of an aggressor,"" the new Czech president added.Pavel said he would also back policies to quash inflation, which ran at 17.5% in January, while also pledging to fix public finances.Pavel was elected in January, having defeated former prime minister Andrej Babis, a billionaire populist, in the run-off.The social liberal campaigned as an independent and pledged to firmly anchor the Czech Republic in the European Union and NATO and to boost relations with the United States.It was a departure from predecessor Milos Zeman, who had sought to strengthen ties with Russia and China. Zeman served as president for 10 years and his last five-year term expired on Wednesday.While the role is largely ceremonial, the Czech president names the government, appoints the central bank governor and Constitutional Court judges, and serves as the supreme commander of the armed forces.After taking the oath of office, Pavel greeted thousands of supporters at the Prague Castle square, with some waving Czech and European Union flags.Pavel was a career soldier, having joined the army during the Communist era and was decorated with a French military cross for valor during peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.He later rose to lead the Czech general staff and became chairman of NATO's military committee for three years before retiring in 2018.For his first official visit abroad as president, Pavel is planning two days in Slovakia on March 13. The two countries formed Czechoslovakia until their peaceful split on December 31, 1992.After winning the January election, Pavel made headlines when he spoke to Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen on the phone and promised to strengthen ties with Taiwan, provoking criticism from China.dh/kb (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831014,Belarus approves death penalty for high treason,"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday signed a bill introducing capital punishment for state officials and military personnel convicted of high treason.The amendments to the country's criminal code endorsed by Lukashenko envisage death sentences for officials and servicemen who caused ""irreparable damage"" to Belarus' national security through acts of treason.The new law is part of changes to the criminal code aimed at strengthening Belarus' fight against ""crimes of an extremist (terrorist) and anti-state orientation.""The bill that Lukashenko signed also introduced punishment for ""propaganda of terrorism, discrediting the armed forces and paramilitary units and breaching the rules to protect state secrets,"" mimicking the repressive legislation of Belarus' main ally, Russia.Russia passed a similar law after invading Ukraine just over a year ago.Belarus has not sent its own troops into Ukraine, but it allowed Russia to use its territory as a launchpad for its operation in February 2022 and has since let Russian warplanes and drones use its airspace for attacks on Ukraine. Russia has also maintained troops and weapons on Belarusian territory.The endorsement of the new repressive legislation follows an attack on a Russian warplane at an air base outside the Belarusian capital on February 26, which was claimed by Belarusian guerrillas.Belarus is the only country in Europe that hasn't banned capital punishment, which has been applied to those convicted of murder or terrorism. Executions are carried out with a shot to the back of the head.Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for nearly three decades, brutally suppressing dissent. Belarusian authorities unleashed a brutal crackdown against demonstrators who protested his re-election in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged, detaining more than 35,000 and beating thousands.On Monday, a Belarusian court sentenced Lukashenko's main challenger in the election, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in absentia to 15 years in prison on charges including conspiring to overthrow the government.Last week, the country's most prominent human rights advocate and 2022 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Ales Bialiatski, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.dh/msh (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/09,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831024,"ASML, China customers haunted by uncertainty on new Dutch chip export rules","AMSTERDAM, March 9 (Reuters) - The Dutch government has not yet defined crucial aspects of new restrictions on chip-technology exports to China including whether ASML Holding NV ASML.AS can service chip-printing machines the company has already sold in the country.""Those details still need to be worked out,"" Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher told reporters on Thursday in Stockholm.Schreinmacher's remarks highlight that, while the plan announced by the Dutch on Wednesday puts the Netherlands in broad alignment with U.S. goals of undermining China's ability to make cutting-edge chips, ASML and its Chinese customers still do not know exactly how it will affect their businesses.The Dutch firm, Europe's largest technology by market capitalization, had 14% of its sales in China in 2022 and has sold more than 8 billion euros ($8.46 billion) worth of chip lithography equipment in China over the past decade.Companies that buy its machines enter into service agreements with ASML for ongoing maintenance. The ""installed base"" segment contributed about 25% of ASML's worldwide revenue in 2022.The machines -- which cost tens of millions of euros apiece and perform an essential step in creating the circuitry of chips -- require unique parts and constant maintenance to remain in working order.Analysts and the company said the lack of clarity from the Dutch government will hang over the company's outlook. Key questions include any limits on servicing and which models will fall under the restrictionsASML itself has for now repeated its guidance for 2023 of flat sales in China of around 2.2 billion euros. That compares with 25% revenue growth overall, illustrating the likely impact of the restrictions.An ASML spokesperson said on Thursday the company interprets the government's remarks to mean that only a thin additional slice of its second-best product line will now be restricted in China, following a complete ban on its most advanced machines in 2019.But there is an element of guesswork to that. ""ASML is waiting for more information"" the spokesperson said.ING analyst Marc Hesselink calculated that the new Dutch rules could possibly affect products that account for 10% of ASML's worldwide sales. However, that would be a worst-case scenario and the impact will likely be less.That's because ASML customers in China include South Korean chipmakers SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, which will likely be granted licenses, as well as domestic Chinese companies like logic chipmaker SMIC and memory chip maker YMTC, which face U.S. export restrictions and may not be.Schreinemacher said on Thursday the Dutch would grant licenses on a case-by-case basis and not follow instructions from Washington.But Citi analyst Amit Harchandani said the Dutch restrictions appear comparable to those imposed on U.S. companies last year and ASML's assessment of the impact is realistic.For Chinese customers, the picture is less clear. ""What we can say is that their ability to pursue leading-edge nodes development will be significantly curtailed,"" Harchandani said.Hesselink of ING predicted that most Chinese chip makers will now opt to focus on ""trailing edge"" or production of chips using slightly older technology. The Chinese may have a competitive advantage there, and ASML's sales in China could even grow modestly.Regardless, ASML will thrive outside China in the long run as chipmakers worldwide expand capacity, he said.""The demand for ASML machines is not going to be impacted, it's simply going to shift to a different region,"" he said.",2023/03/10,378,World

North Korea has long bristled at the allies' drills as a rehearsal for invasion.North Korean leader Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, said earlier this week any move to shoot down one of its test missiles would be considered a declaration of war and blamed a joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea for growing tensions.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the latest launch posed no threat to the United States or its allies but Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs have a destabilising effect on the region.",2023/03/10,194,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831036,Fukushima water release stokes fresh fears for fisherman,"SHINCHIMACHI, Japan, March 10 (Reuters) - A chilly dawn paints the sky magenta and purple as Japanese fisherman Haruo Ono unloads his catch of flounder, crab and sea bass from his boat at the small port of Shinchimachi.A third-generation fisherman, Ono, 71, has been putting to sea for half a century from Shinchimachi, 55 km (34 miles) north of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, the scene in 2011 of one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.On March 11 that year, a 9 magnitude earthquake struck offshore sending tsunami waves smashing into Japan's east coast. Ono rode out the waves at sea on his boat but on land, the waves devastated Shinchimachi and obliterated Ono's home.The tsunami also crashed into the nuclear plant just down the coast, setting off explosions and meltdowns that released radiation over a wide swathe and shut down fishing for more than a year due to worries about radiation.More than a decade later, Shinchimachi is still recovering as is its fishing industry but a new threat spawned by the disaster could wipe out the progress made.The Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which runs the crippled nuclear power station, plans to soon start releasing more than a million tons of radioactive water from the plant into the sea.""It's been 12 years and fish prices are rising, we're finally hoping to really get down to business,"" Ono said.""Now they're talking about releasing the water and we're going to have to go back to square one again. It's unbearable.""The water was mainly used to cool reactors in the aftermath of the disaster. It is enough to fill about 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools and is being stored in huge tanks at the plant.Officials say the tanks have to be removed for reconstruction.The water is treated, filtered and diluted and Tepco and the government say it is safe. But it does contains traces of tritium.Even though the radioactive isotope is considered relatively harmless, the region's fishermen, like its farmers, have been struggling for years to restore the reputation of their produce and now fear the dumped water will kill their business.""We here in Fukushima have done absolutely nothing wrong, why do they have to mess up our ocean?"" Ono said. ""The ocean doesn't belong to only us humans - and it isn't a garbage can.""Countries in the region have also been worried about the release though some concerns have been easing.'WHY NOT TOKYO'Fukushima has a long, proud fishing tradition. The area used to send its flounder in tribute to feudal lords.But the waves nearly ended all that.Ono was left with virtually nothing. Though his immediate family survived, a brother was killed in the roiling sea.Ono's new home stands high inland, surrounded by other new houses on straight roads laid out after the disaster.His bright main room contains pots of pink geraniums and a photograph of Ono taking part in the 2021 Olympic torch relay.The area where he used to live has been turned into a park.""In the tsunami I lost my house, I lost all my possessions, I lost my younger brother. Then we had the nuclear accident,"" Ono said.""Our pain has been two or three times higher than anybody else's. Why are they still giving us a hard time? Why release water into the Fukushima ocean, why not Tokyo or Osaka?""Experts like Toshihiro Wada, an associate professor in environment and radiation studies at Fukushima University, said the timing of the release of the water, and the alarmist talk it will bring, was unfortunate.""Given how carefully fishing has been expanded, and that it's just approaching past levels, it's only natural this timing is a problem for fishermen who fear the impact of rumours,"" he said.Tepco and the government cite radiation testing standards they say are stricter than those of other countries that also release treated water. The release has also been approved by international atomic regulator the IAEA.""What we say to the fishermen is that we have equipment to treat the water safely,"" Tomohiko Mayuzumi, a Tepco spokesperson, told Reuters at the plant.To prove how harmless it is, Tepco has been raising flounder in tanks at the plant. A live feed of the flat fish is broadcast on Tepco's YouTube channel.Outside, work is underway to extend a pipe into the ocean to release the water from rows of stacked metal tanks.Ono is gloomy about prospects for the next generation of fishing folk.""It's OK for me. I'm 71, I'll keep on working at sea until I die,"" he said. ""But what about the kids in primary and junior school? It's way too unstable for them to make a living from this.""",2023/03/10,221,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831047,China’s Xi calls for ‘more quickly elevating’ armed forces,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s leader Xi Jinping has called for “more quickly elevating the armed forces to world-class standards,” in a speech just days after a top diplomat warned of the growing possibility of conflict with the U.S. unless Washington changes course.China must maximize its “national strategic capabilities” in a bid to “systematically upgrade the country’s overall strength to cope with strategic risks, safeguard strategic interests and realize strategic objectives,” Xi said Wednesday.His remarks to delegates in the ceremonial parliament representing the People’s Liberation Army, the military wing of the ruling Communist Party, and the paramilitary People’s Armed Police, were carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.Xi issued a series of calls to accelerate the build-up of self-reliance in science and technology, bolster strategic capabilities in emergency fields, make industrial and supply chains more resilient and make national reserves “more capable of safeguarding national security.”The program laid out by Xi dovetails with a number of national strategies already underway, including the “Made in China 2025” campaign to make China dominant in 10 key fields from integrated circuits to aerospace, and a decades-old campaign for civilian-military integration in the economy.Xi also mentioned the need for “achieving the goals for the centenary of the PLA in 2027,” a date by which, according to some U.S. observers, China intends to have the capability of conquering self-governing Taiwan, an American ally, by military means.China has defined the centenary goals in mostly vague terms, such as greater “informatization” and raising the PLA to “world-class standards.”China needs to build “a strong system of strategic deterrent forces, raise the presence of combat forces in new domains and of new qualities, and deeply promote combat-oriented military training,” according to a speech Xi gave last year.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang had warned in unusually stark terms about the possibility of U.S.-China frictions leading to something more dire.“If the United States does not hit the brake, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there surely will be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said in his first news conference since taking up his post last year.“Such competition is a reckless gamble, with the stakes being the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of humanity,” he added.That echoed remarks made by Xi on Monday to delegates that seemed to underscore Chinese frustration with U.S. restrictions on access to technology and its support for Taiwan and regional military blocs in unusually blunt terms.“Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented grave challenges to our nation’s development,” Xi was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.A State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, responded by saying Washington wants to “coexist responsibly” within the global trade and political system and has no intention of suppressing China.“This is not about containing China. This is not about suppressing China. This is not about holding China back,” Price said in Washington. “We want to have that constructive competition that is fair” and “doesn’t veer into that conflict.”Meanwhile on Wednesday, Gen. Laura J. Richardson, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for South America and the Caribbean, testified before the House Armed Services Committee that China and Russia were “malign actors” that are “aggressively exerting influence over our democratic neighbors.”China is “spreading its malign influence, wielding its economic might, and conducting gray zone activities to expand its military and political access and influence,” Richardson said.“This is a strategic risk that we can’t accept or ignore,” she added.Among other activities, China has built a massive embassy in the Bahamas, just 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Florida.“Presence and proximity absolutely matter, and a stable and secure Western Hemisphere is critical to homeland defense,” Richardson said.On Thursday, Beijing’s Foreign Ministry dismissed U.S. questions and criticisms of Chinese intentions as an attempt to “make excuses for its military expansion and pursuit of hegemony.”“Before criticizing and blaming other countries, the U.S., as the only military superpower armed to the teeth, should reflect on what it can and should do,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing.In a nod to a China-U.S. relationship that has sunk to its lowest level in decades, she said Washington “should meet China halfway and push China-U.S. relations back on the track of sound and stable development, which is beneficial to both countries and the world.”",2023/03/10,2142,Politics

Beijing will also continue to counter any actions it perceives to be support for Taiwan, the report said.

            Beijing could ramp up military aircraft crossings of the Taiwan Strait median line and may even fire missiles over Taiwan, it added.

            If China succeeds in controlling Taiwan, the global supply chains for semiconductor chips would be disrupted, as the East Asian nation is the primary producer of advanced chips, the report said.











            ODNI cautioned that China will also use mounting numbers military forces to double down on its territorial claims in the South China Sea and to coerce rival claimants into accepting them. Additionally, it will assert its claims in the East China Sea, which is contested by Japan.

            “Beijing is working to meet its goal of fielding a military by 2027 designed to deter U.S. intervention in a future cross-Strait crisis,” ODNI said. The Chinese navy and air force seek to gain air superiority and project power beyond the first island chain, the office said.

            China recently announced it will increase its military spending by 7.2% to approximately 1.55 trillion yuan (US$224 billion).

            “The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said at the opening of the National People’s Congress on March 4.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) will continue efforts to annex Taiwan, according to a report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).The “Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community” warned that China may offer Taiwan incentives to accomplish its annexation goal and oppose closer U.S.-Taiwan interactions.

The Chinese navy and air force seek to gain air superiority and project power beyond the first island chain, the office said.China recently announced it will increase its military spending by 7.2% to approximately 1.55 trillion yuan (US$224 billion).“The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said at the opening of the National People’s Congress on March 4.",2023/03/10,615,Politics

            Held on Thursday (March 9) at AWS offices in Taipei, the event featured women in a variety of careers, from tech accelerators, business development specialists, and social media experts. Panel discussions gave many the chance to air their frustration with gender inequality and the glass-ceiling in many corporations.

            SoGal Foundation is dedicated to closing the diversity gap in entrepreneurship and venture capital. The foundation hosts initiatives to ensure inclusive access to education, networks, and investment capital.

            “Right now, the ratio of female founders in the start-up community is only 20%, whereas males account for 80%. I want to change this status quo,” said AppWorks Principal Alyssa Chen (陳敬旻). She expressed disdain for the word “empowerment” as it applies to women in the work force, as she always believed that she had power equal to her male peers.











            Chen said it was not easy breaking into the tech accelerator industry despite the steep learning curve, though she still enjoys her work six to seven years into her profession. “I think there are a lot of stereotypes that we have to break. We have to make steps to not only be gender neutral, but also be careful about the patterns and biases we put on other people.“

            For example, Chen said that when we mention a soccer player, we automatically think of a male person, and when we encounter the term ballerina, we think of a female. “We need to check ourselves first, and see how much bias we have, and then influence our circle, and grow the circles bigger and bigger.""

            While Chen feels the need to change stereotypes in the office place, the same was not the case for founder and chair of Anemone Ventures, Revital Shpangental.

            “I simply experience challenges as a business person. I don’t have a lens for gender. My challenges are building a business from scratch and building something. Being a woman is an advantage, as men feel that we are less competition and they even want to share information with us. This is power, a way for us to maneuver and progress,” said Shpangental.
There are no business shortcuts

            For Chang Yuan-yuan (張圓圓), founder of the Dadaocheng art gallery, No Copies, “failure is the first step toward success.” She treasures each of the difficulties that she has endured from her transition from being the lead of a prominent accounting firm to someone now opening her fifth gallery.

            When she was with Ernst and Young, she worked with an Indian team and they earned 20% more for their work because they negotiated every item in the contract and fought for their best interest. At first, she thought they were being selfish, but it was really about business culture. She said she appreciated that learning experience.

            For other panelists like Fluv CEO Candace Chen (陳思璇), becoming an entrepreneur was something that she learned from her mother. “I was raised by a single mother who was a software engineer. Having her as a role model inspired me as she helped me become who I am today.”

            “To overcome your obstacles, you have to find your 'why.' It can help you get through anything. I wanted to start a pet care company even though I have no technical background. This did not stop me from achieving my dream. I interviewed 300 engineers to find three people that were interested and eventually one became our CTO,”” said Chen.

            For Tuteemi CEO Camila Saenz, becoming a businesswoman simply was not part of her life plan. “I love triathlons and was happy as a photographer for seven years and I did work with other NGOs. I simply saw a problem and wanted to find a solution.”

            This inspired her to start an online tutoring company. She says that as a Latina she had a different perspective when it came to language learning. And as for her business acumen, some of it stems from her family, which is involved in the coffee business.

            “When it comes to obstacles, as women are always going to have obstacles and we will need to find solutions,” said Saenz.

            Kassy Cho, founder and CEO of Almost says, “I decided to start my company after graduation when I worked for Buzzfeed in London. It was exciting to me that young women were making positive changes. I saw that there was nothing serving the next generation of young women to get the info that they need.""

            “As a woman of color in London, sometimes we can experience conscious and unconscious discrimination. It can be difficult to break in if you are not a white guy who went to Cambridge or Oxford. Finding allies is hard and when we find them we can lean on them to help you.""

            Of the 15 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, one Shenyang J-11 fighter jet entered the northeast corner of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. No PLA aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line during this time.

            In response, Taiwan sent aircraft and naval ships and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.

            So far this month, Beijing has sent 148 military aircraft and 37 naval vessels around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.











            Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831093,Duck egg prices in Taiwan hit record high,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The price of duck eggs rose to a record high on Friday (March 10) due to a shortage of chicken eggs and the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival.Amid a shortage of chicken eggs, Agriculture Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) on Tuesday (March 7) called on the public to buy duck eggs as an alternative, according to UDN. However, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Thursday (March 9) announced that the price of duck eggs would also increase on Friday.The COA said the farm gate price for duck eggs on Thursday was NT$45 per Taiwan catty (600 grams), while the wholesale price ranged between NT$55-NT$60. However, it said both wholesale and farm gate prices would rise by NT$3 on Friday, with the latter climbing to NT$48, a record high.Chiang Wen-chuan (江文全), deputy head of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said duck eggs are mainly consumed as processed salted egg yolks. Chiang said that there are two holidays when they are consumed the most: Lunar New Year and Dragon Boat Festival.As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, duck eggs are one of the popular fillings for some zongzi, and stocking up will begin at this stage, resulting in an increase in demand. In addition, due to the recent shortage of chicken eggs, some eateries have switched to duck eggs instead.Chiang said the high price of feed combined with these changes in supply and demand has led to a price increase of NT$3. When asked whether the culling of ducks at farms impacted by bird flu would lessen the supply of ducks this year, Chiang said there are still more than two million ducks at this stage and the supply will not be affected.Kao Chuan-mo (高傳謨), chairman of an egg sales association, told UDN that due to the shortage of chicken eggs, many consumers have switched to buying duck eggs, thus leading to a shortage of the latter as well. Kao said that as the price of duck eggs increases, the price of processed century eggs and salted duck eggs will increase accordingly.Kao said egg farmers, egg merchants, and consumers are all affected. The pandemic combined with the avian flu epidemic has cost Taiwan's egg processing factories more than NT$20 million over the past three years, while one has closed down recently, said Kao.As for when the egg shortage will dissipate, Kao said if the weather improves, supplies will not be as tight as they are now, but to restore normal production levels, more chickens will need to be acquired.",2023/03/10,1569,Society

She said that the U.S. treasury, commerce groups, the intelligence community, and others have been working to estimate the impact an invasion would have on the availability of Taiwan’s semiconductors.Director of the CIA William Burns echoed Haines, saying that his agency does not see any evidence that Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) has made a decision to invade Taiwan, and that China’s ambitions, while not to be underestimated, have likely been tempered by observing the outcomes of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said Xi has watched Vladimir Putin’s experience closely.Burns said that Xi had been ""sobered"" by the extent that the West was able to put economic pressure on Russia and support the Ukrainian forces. He said that China’s first priority will be economic recovery and reengagement with the world as it comes out of zero COVID.Haines delivered a speech to U.S. lawmakers summarizing the findings of the U.S. intelligence community’s Annual Threat Assessment report, which said that 2023 would likely see more Chinese crossings over the Taiwan Strait median line, and further Chinese missile launches over Taiwan, but that the intelligence community believes that China aims to preserve stability in East Asia. She said China aims to demonstrate a steady relationship with the U.S. to “avoid setbacks in its other relationships around the world, even while signaling its opposition to claimed U.S. provocations.”",2023/03/10,2798,Politics

            “Taiwan stands ready to resume talks with China as long as the latter treats Taiwan equally and stops forcing its one-China principle on Taiwan as a precondition,” Sun said in a Boston Globe opinion article. However, he said Taiwan alone cannot maintain peace in the region.

            The director general called on the world to push China to respond to Taiwan’s goodwill in kind and “resolve cross-strait differences peacefully,” he said.

            Sun said Taiwan is dedicated to maintaining regional peace and stability and will not alter the regional status quo by declaring independence, since it is already a sovereign nation.











            Additionally, Taiwan is determined to defend itself, as demonstrated by its increased 2023 defense budget to 2.4% of its GDP and new military realignment plan.

            In an interview with The Atlantic last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a crisis in the Taiwan Strait would be an international one. “This is not an internal matter, as China would have it, based on its sovereignty. It’s a matter of concern to quite literally the entire world,” Blinken said.

            He noted that 50% of commercial container traffic transits the strait daily and that a majority of the semiconductors needed in common electronics and cars are made in Taiwan. “If there were a crisis in Taiwan as a result of China’s aggression in some fashion, that would have I think disastrous consequences for the world economy and for countries around the world.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831121,China hands Xi Jinping historic third term as president,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping unanimously secured an unprecedented third five-year presidential term on Friday.China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is on track to remain in power for life.Nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress (NPC), voted for Xi to be president, in an uncontested election.Xi was also unanimously voted to serve a third term as the head of the nation's Central Military Commission.The parliament also elected Zhao Leji as the new parliament chair and Han Zheng as the new vice president.It was widely expected that Xi's appointment would be endorsed by the National People's Congress, a ceremonial body whose members are appointed by the ruling party.Since taking power in 2012, Xi has marginalized potential challengers and filled key positions in the Communist Party with his own allies.The vote for Xi was unanimous, with 2,952 members of the NPC supporting his appointment.In October, Xi had already secured a third term as party general secretary, departing from the tradition of transferring power every decade.Earlier, the two-term limit for the presidency was removed from the Chinese constitution, leading to speculation that Xi might rule indefinitely.The election process was shrouded in secrecy, with no candidate lists distributed and Xi and others believed to have run unopposed.Additionally, Xi was unanimously appointed as commander of the 2 million-member People's Liberation Army, a force that takes its orders from the party rather than the country.ss/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/10,,

A search conducted across the entire island, which is located in Kinmen's Lieyu Township, has yet to locate Chen.Prior to a session of the Legislative Yuan on Friday, Chiu was asked by the media to provide an update on the search for the soldier. Chiu said that he had asked the Coast Guard to assist in the search efforts, but there have yet to be any signs of him at sea, reported UDN.Chiu also apologized to the public about the incident because he is a soldier based on a frontline island. He said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) is actively investigating Chen's disappearance.Chiu said he is conducting an in-depth review of the incident, and he is taking full responsibility for the matter. According to Chiu, prior to the soldier's disappearance, there had been no abnormalities with Chen's performance record, daily duties, and interaction with fellow troops.Regarding any outstanding financial debts Chen may have owed, Chiu said, ""There may have been a little bit, but it is not particularly serious."" However, he said that this cannot be completely ruled out and that when Chen is found ""the answer will come naturally.""When asked to comment on the possibility that Chen may have swum to China, Chiu said that there is no way to speculate because there is no information so far. He said that it is a ""very regrettable matter"" and the military will question him once he is found.The defense minister then said that although the temperature of the water is low ""it cannot be completely ruled out (that he swam)."" He said that it is necessary to conduct a review of the Army as a whole and set up a task force, and the commanding officer will conduct follow-up investigations on the island.Erdan Island covers an area of about 0.28 square kilometers and is approximately 12 km away from Kinmen's main island and about 4.4 km from China's Xiamen Island.",2023/03/10,3750,Politics

The Asia Pacific surgical staplers market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% leading to a revenue of USD 0.79 Bn by 2023.Key Companies Covered in the Asia-Pacific Surgical Staplers Market Research are Ethicon (Johnson & Johnson), Covidien (Medtronic), 3M, B.Braun, Dextera Surgical, CONMED and other key market players.Considering the demographics of the region, about half of the Asian countries currently have less than a 5% share of the older population. The countries with a higher share of younger population are located in South Central Asia – Afghanistan (2.5% geriatric), South-Eastern Asia (e.g., Laos, 3.8% geriatric), and Western Asia (e.g., Kuwait – 2.3%; Yemen – 2.7% geriatric). However, East Asia is one of the oldest sub-regions globally that includes the one of oldest countries in the world Japan (26.6% geriatric). Overall, in 2016, 12.4% of the population in the Asia-Pacific region was 60 years or older, which is lower than North Americas 17% (approx.). This unique mix serves a as a major driver for the growth of the surgical staplers market in the Asia-Pacific.Also, Asian countries like China and Japan are large medical devices markets after the U.S. and European Union and are bound to expand more given the fact that the percentage of the geriatric population in Japan is expected to increase from 24% in 2012 to 40% in 2050. These people will require specific age related surgeries. Thus, manufacturers of surgical devices shall get a boost in this region.The Asia-Pacific surgical staplers market is segmented by product into manual and powered surgical staplers and by type into reusable and disposable surgical staplers. Manual Surgical Staplers dominated the market share in 2017 while the reusable surgical is expected to grow at a higher CAGR in the forecast period (2018-2023).Asia-Pacific surgical staplers market is further segmented based on its applications – abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and other surgeries. In 2017, the abdominal surgeries segment held the biggest share of the market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/asia-pacific-surgical-staplers-market/QI042Key growth factors:o Increased medical tourism in countries like Thailand, South Korea, and India (A cardiac operation at best of Indian hospitals costs less than 30% of what it would cost in Europe or the United States) over the years due to the availability of cheaper but quality surgical procedures drives the surgical staplers market in the Asia Pacific region.o The recent launch of public healthcare programs clubbed with increasing private wealth is expected to boost the region’s health care spending by an annual average of 6.6% in 2015-2019. The growth in countries like India is expected to be at a substantial rate of 16.1% per year. The government has set a target of increasing public health expenditure which is expected to boost the demand for advanced medical technologies like surgical staplers.Threats and key players:o Expenditure on healthcare in the Asia-Pacific, though increasing, is still quite low compared to regions like North America. (Healthcare expenditure in NA was USD 3306 Bn per capita in 2015 while in APAC it was almost half of NA with USD 1537 Bn per capita). This might act as a challenge to the adoption of surgical staplers.
o Affordability is an issue in countries like India, Taiwan, etc., and hence hospitals are more focused on providing low-cost medical care. Thus, under such conditions, focus on advanced medical devices like surgical staplers remain low, mainly when hand suturing (stitching) is still a popular method for wound closure.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/asia-pacific-surgical-staplers-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Braun, Grena, Purple Surgical and other key market players.Surgical stapling is a technological advancement in medical wound closure methods and is often used as an alternative to traditional methods like suturing. The use of surgical staplers not only expedites the closure procedure but also minimises post procedural complexities like bleeding, and reduces hospital stays. Surgical stapling is widely used in the EU5 for various types of surgical procedures.The rapid increase of a number of diseases like obesity, cardiovascular problems, and cancers, in the EU5, is contributing to the rise in the number of surgeries of the open as well as minimally invasive type. These are influential factors that contribute to the growth of the market in these countries.France, Spain and Italy are expected to show the maximum growth rates with regard to the adoption of surgical staplers due to a conducive growth environment, contributed by government support for healthcare and greater awareness among the surgeons.Big surgical stapler manufacturing companies like Stapleline, B. Braun, Grena, Purple Surgical, etc., are present in the EU5 countries, and these companies invest heavily in developing advanced surgical staplers, thereby strengthening the surgical staplers market in the region.
o The EU5 surgical staplers market is segmented by product into manual and powered surgical staplers and by type into reusable and disposable surgical staplers. Powered surgical staplers dominated the market share in 2017, and the reusable surgical stapler segment is expected to grow at a higher CAGR in the forecast period (2018-2023).
o The EU5 surgical staplers market is further segmented based on its applications – abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and other surgeries.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/eu5-surgical-staplers-market/QI042Key growth factors:o The percentage of the population aged 65 and above has grown substantially in the last 20 years in the EU5 countries, and the elderly are expected to need health care and surgeries more frequently as they develop chronic, mainly cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The incidence of cancer also rises with age. This is expected to provide a boost to the surgical staplers market in the countries as the number of surgeries will increase.o Given the high purchasing power and affordability of the people in these countries, EU5 as a whole presents a robust target market for surgical staplers. Per capita healthcare spending in Germany is at USD 5,006 (WHO, 2013) and in the U.K. is at USD 3,598 (WHO, 2013) – thereby making adoption of surgical staplers for surgeries not a very challenging affair for people. To club with it, much of the spending on healthcare is publicly financed in the EU5, and out-of-pocket payments account for a very small portion of the total healthcare spending. Thus, opting for critical surgeries of high cost is not a problem. This would drive the surgical staplers market forward.Threats and key players:o The European Parliament published the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017 which applies to the EU5 countries. This may cause prominent changes to the regulatory obligations of legal manufacturers, importers and distributors involved in the medical devices distribution chain and it might temporarily hinder the growth of the market on account of adjustments to the new regulations.
o The EU5 countries as a whole are extremely large medical device markets, but they are mature markets with relatively low 3-4% annual growth rates. The medical devices’ companies entering the countries might not reap staggering growth, which might be expected in developing countries.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/eu5-surgical-staplers-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The use of surgical staplers not only expedites the closure procedure but also minimises post procedural complexities like bleeding, and reduces hospital stays, etc.Most countries in Latin America are experiencing epidemiologic and nutrition transitions. The epidemiologic transition is characterised by a shift from highly infectious diseases and mortality to increase of non-communicable diseases. The nutrition transition is due to a shift from high prevalence of malnutrition to predominance of diet-related non-communicable diseases like obesity. Obesity increases the probability of having heart problems due to rise in cholesterol level, etc., thereby raising the possibility of requiring cardiac surgeries as well as bariatric surgeries for stomach fat reduction. The ageing of Mexico’s population and an increase in chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes (at 56 percent and 219 percent, respectively, between 1980 and 2011), are driving up demand for surgeries in Latin America. Also, there is a surge in health insurance penetration in the region of late.

Also, ageing of the overall population in Latin America will give rise to age-related problems like weak bones, heart problems, etc. These factors will lead to an increase in the number of surgeries in the region.
o Additionally, from 2017, the region was expected to have resume economic growth after a period of recession. Per capita income is expected to grow at a modest growth rate. This is expected to aid the growth of the healthcare sector and boost the adoption of surgical staplers.Threats and key players:o Latin American countries maintain high tariffs on some medical products, creating complications for medical devices exporters from other regions. This might challenge the import and use of surgical staplers manufactured by big U.S. companies like Ethicon.
o Due to the country’s high unemployment rate, many beneficiaries opted out of the private health insurance sector in between 2014 to 2016 to eliminate the payment of premium. Also, to cut down on expenses, companies in Brazil are continuously replacing their employees’ health insurance plans with cheaper coverage plans.

Increased diagnosis and treatment are considered to fuel the North American conjugate vaccine market. Recommended vaccines and dosages are updated on a regular basis to comply with prevalent serogroups of infectious agents. For example, the CDC has its own immunization schedule for US citizens. This has increased the effectiveness of administered vaccines, which thereby increases the demand for the product, leading to increase in market sales.Threats and key players:o The North America conjugate vaccine market is expected to grow positively. But since it is a saturated market, the scope for significant growth is limited. In North America, the population above 65 years of age has decreased from 53,000,000 in 2014 to 51,900,000 in 2016. So, the demand for adult vaccines has also reduced.

The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352301In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Bilirubin Meters Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831305,Lend-lease weapons act for defending Taiwan introduced in US Congress,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Legislation was introduced into the U.S. House and Senate this week calling for Washington to implement a lend-lease weapons program for the defense of Taiwan.In the Senate, the legislation was introduced by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who recently introduced other pro-Taiwan legislation, and Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who visited Taiwan in August 2022. In the House, companion legislation for the lend-lease program was introduced by Representative Michelle Steele of California.The bill, named as the “Taiwan Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2023,” takes its name and inspiration from the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, signed into law by Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. The 1941 bill authorized the gift of food, fuel, weapons, and other materials to allied nations, on the basis that such provisions were vitally necessary for the defense of the U.S. during wartime.In a similar form, the 2023 bill calls for material support to be lent or leased to Taiwan, with a focus on articles essential for Taiwan’s national defense. The bill also calls for Congress to conduct a survey of Taiwan’s defense needs and expedite procedures to ensure the rapid supply of weapons and other materials.Members of Congress were quoted in a press release explaining the importance of the new legislation.“Taiwan must have the capacity to defend itself against an invasion from Communist China. The brave Taiwanese people are a shining example of democracy in the Indo-Pacific — a stark contrast to Xi Jinping’s tyrannical regime that commits gross human rights abuses. I’m proud to join my colleagues on this good bill to strengthen Taiwanese forces and continue to show that we refuse to bow to Xi’s aggression,” said Senator Scott.Steel said, “There is no doubt that the CCP is the greatest threat to global stability and America’s national security.” The legislation “will send an unmistakable message to the CCP that the United States stands with our allies and is prepared to arm Taiwan with the tools it needs to defend itself from a CCP attack. The time to put an end to a CCP invasion is before it begins,” she said.The full text of the Taiwan Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2023 can be viewed here.",2023/03/10,1244,Politics

It is mandatory that firms trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and Taipei Exchange (TPEx) publish information about events of significance that can impact share prices.Cybersecurity incidents are categorized as such events, while failing to reveal relevant information two hours before the trading session the next day will be deemed a violation. This could incur a fine of somewhere between NT$30,000 and NT$5 million, said Huang Ho-ming (黃厚銘), an official of the Financial Supervisory Commission’s Securities and Futures Bureau.The bureau has asked listed corporations to add supervisory positions managing information security. Companies are also invited to join the Taiwan Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (TWCERT/CC), which helps deal with cybersecurity incidents in the private sector.Last month, Taipei-based Breeze Center, a department store chain, was hacked and saw the personal data of 900,000 customers exposed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831321,Taiwan could thwart China's attempt to blockade nation in regional conflict,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A high-ranking Taiwan military official said Taiwan could wreak havoc on Chinese military ships if Beijing attempts to launch a blockade of the nation in a regional conflict.

            Taiwan’s dense air defense and anti-ship missile systems are enough to cause serious damage to Chinese forces, Liberty Times cited the official as saying. He pointed out that Taiwan’s Navy would launch heavy torpedoes from submarines, anti-ship missiles from ships, and use land-based, extended-range anti-ship missiles in a saturation attack on Chinese targets, the official said.

            This kind of tactic, which involves strikes from different directions and locations, is meant to catch the enemy by surprise, they said. The official pointed out that Taiwan has simulated offensive and defensive scenarios and live-fire tests based on different situations during Han Kuang exercises over the years.

            Taiwan must rely on its own to break through or possibly eliminate a Chinese blockade and attack operations of the Chinese army, the official said, but it is best to have military support from partner countries such as the U.S. and Japan.











            However, the official stressed that Taiwan must not completely depend on friendly forces for national security.

            The official added the military is now mass-producing Chien Hsiang anti-radiation loitering munitions and has a number of coastal Harpoon anti-ship missile systems and medium and long-range missiles bought from the U.S., which greatly improve Taiwan’s ability to sink Chinese ships.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A high-ranking Taiwan military official said Taiwan could wreak havoc on Chinese military ships if Beijing attempts to launch a blockade of the nation in a regional conflict.Taiwan’s dense air defense and anti-ship missile systems are enough to cause serious damage to Chinese forces, Liberty Times cited the official as saying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831341,Xi Jinping cements 3rd term as China chairman,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China's National People’s Congress (NPC) on Friday (March 10) formally approved Xi Jinping's (習近平) unprecedented third term as the country's head of state.At the third plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th NPC, 2,952 members voted unanimously for Xi to take his third term as leader of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission, according to China's state-run Xinhua. Staff members reportedly took over an hour to cast their ballots.When it was announced that members had voted for Xi's third term without any opposing votes or abstentions, the cadres clapped their hands in unison and Xi bowed to those both in front of and behind him. He then shook hands with Li Zhanshu (栗戰書) and Li Qiang (李強), before applauding himself.The carefully orchestrated event then featured People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops marching into the main hall and onto the stage carrying a thick, red copy of the ""Constitution of the People's Republic of China."" The audience then stood at attention as a PLA band played the national anthem.Next, Xi took to the main podium, raised his right fist, and placed his left hand on the constitution and took his oath of office. After completing his oath, the crowd erupted with thunderous applause.China now faces uncharted territory as Xi is the first leader to take a third term as chairman since communist forces seized Beijing in 1949. This additional term was made possible after Xi pressured the NPC into eliminating the limit on five-year terms in 2018.",2023/03/10,780,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831433,Micronesia’s president implores lawmakers to switch recognition from China to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Federated States of Micronesia's (FSM) outgoing President David W. Panuelo met Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) in February and negotiated terms for switching diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan, according to a letter he wrote to senior members of his government on Thursday (March 9).The 13-page letter claims that NT$1.5 billion (US$50 million), an additional US$15 million annually, healthcare, scholarships, and training programs “can, and will” be received by the FSM “if and when” the country switches diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan. Wu confirmed to the legislature on Friday afternoon (March 10) that he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with Panuelo, per UDN.A ministry spokesperson told Taiwan News they could not confirm whether or not a physical meeting had taken place.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) did not respond to questions about the reported sums, but issued a statement saying it respects and welcomes the expansion of bilateral relations. ""Taiwan shares core values ... with like-minded countries that care about peace in the Pacific region,"" the statement said.Panuelo's letter also outlines a raft of allegations directed at Chinese officials who Panuelo says engaged in “political warfare,” claiming that China offering bribes to FSM officials is a common practice. He wrote that China was using the bribes to pressure his government to isolate Taiwan and build support for an eventual Chinese invasion.As a remote Pacific Island country, FSM is reliant on aid funding as its primary source of revenue. Panuelo said that given the importance of foreign transfers to his country, and his desire to rid the country of Chinese interference, he felt obliged to see if a better deal could be achieved by switching diplomatic recognition from China to Taiwan.Panuelo said he met with Wu in February to discuss the terms of a diplomatic switch. They also reportedly discussed what benefits FSM could receive in exchange for building on the existing informal relationship, such as establishing a Taipei Economic & Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).“I was transparent with Foreign Minister Wu; we project we need an injection of approximately NT$50,000,000 to meet our future needs,” the letter reads. “We can and will receive this, over a three-year period, if and when we establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan.”Panuelo said that an additional US$15 million in assistance would be granted by Taiwan annually, to be used at the FSM government’s discretion. “Additionally, Taiwan assures me that they will simply ‘pick-up’ any and all projects that China is currently undertaking … using Micronesian labor and Micronesian businesses, unlike China,” the letter said.Panuelo said that he had invited a Taiwan International Development Cooperation Fund (ICDF) team to visit his country in March to survey how Taiwan could provide agricultural development assistance. The two sides also discussed medical referrals to Taiwan for FSM people, and scholarships and job training for FSM students.Panuelo said the monetary assistance was not the only benefit his country would receive. He said switching to Taiwan would protect his country from China, which had “demonstrated a keen capability to undermine our sovereignty, rejects our values, and uses our elected and senior officials for their own purposes.”Despite Penuelo’s interest in pursuing diplomatic relations with Taiwan, he lost his seat in a general election on Tuesday (March 7) and will be out of office in May. Penuelo’s expected successor, Peter Christian, was previously the FSM president between 2015 and 2019, per RNZ.If FSM switched diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, it would not be the first Pacific Island country to do so, with Nauru switching back to Taiwan in 2005 after it had rejected the country for China only three years earlier.",2023/03/10,1677,Politics

            Sources told Financial Times that Tsai is set to speak at a New York event on March 30 hosted by the Washington-based Hudson Institute. The think tank will also present Tsai with its “global leadership award.”

            There had been reports that McCarthy was planning a Taiwan trip sometime this year. On Tuesday (March 7), several sources told the Financial Times that McCarthy agreed with Tsai that it would be better to meet in the U.S. to avoid a repeat of the large-scale military exercises launched by China in response to then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the country in August.











Bloomberg then reported on Wednesday (March 8) that McCarthy confirmed he would be meeting with Tsai in California. But McCarthy added his meeting with Tsai does not mean that he would not visit Taiwan in the future, adding, “China can’t tell me where and when I can go.”

            Meanwhile, China has already protested the upcoming meeting between Tsai and McCarthy. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week said China “firmly rejects all forms of official interactions between the U.S. and Taiwan,” according to Financial Times.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) is slated to give a speech in New York later this month where she will also be presented with a leadership award from a U.S. think tank.Sources told Financial Times that Tsai is set to speak at a New York event on March 30 hosted by the Washington-based Hudson Institute.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831451,US must sink Chinese ships to break Taiwan blockade,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), General Kenneth Wilsbach, on Wednesday (March 8) said the U.S. must sink Chinese warships to break a blockade of Taiwan.While speaking to reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, Wilsbach recalled that in response to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, China deployed ships off the east coast of Taiwan to act ""as a sort of blockade,"" reported Military.com. He said the surface-to-air missiles mounted on the ships created an ""anti-access/area denial engagement zone"" that discouraged warplanes from other countries from entering for fear of being shot down.Although Washington's priority is to deter Beijing from invading, Wilsbach said the military needs to have contingencies in the event China does attack Taiwan. He argued that if hostilities do break out, the first order of business is that, ""We've got to sink the ships.""The commander said that sinking Chinese warships should not only be the main objective of the PACAF ""but really anyone that's going to be involved in a conflict like this."" He stressed the need for the U.S. and the militaries of friendly nations to plan and train together a great deal more.Wilsbach said that many wings under his command are rehearsing the U.S. Air Force's tactic of spreading crews and aircraft across ""many, many islands."" He also recommended the U.S. ""amass firepower"" in the region with the use of armed drones and added the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider could be ""helpful in our mission.""",2023/03/10,6114,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831469,US representative pushes for deeper Taiwan-US partnership,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Representative Jake Auchincloss on Thursday (March 9) expressed support for a strong partnership between Taiwan and the U.S.

            “As the United States seeks to strengthen our position in the Indo-Pacific, let us commit to Taiwan as a long-term ally,” Auchincloss said while addressing the House of Representatives.

            He said the scope and severity of the Chinese threat toward Taiwan has “crystallized.” However, Taiwan’s vibrant democracy and prosperous economy present an opportunity for cooperation with the U.S., particularly in countering disinformation and propaganda.

            “We should also strengthen one another’s economies to increase flows of trade and investment, by negotiating expanded market access, common rules, and the end of double taxation on Taiwanese investment in the United States,” he added. This is especially important as the U.S. tries to build up its semiconductor manufacturing industry.











            The representative was part of a congressional delegation that visited Taiwan last month. Over the course of five days, the group, led by Representative Ro Khanna, met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other government and military officials to discuss bilateral security and economic and trade developments, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

            Representatives Tony Gonzales and Jonathan Jackson were also part of the delegation.

            In response to the trip, a letter addressed to Auchincloss was written on behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., reiterating that Beijing’s “one-China principle” was a part of the international order and Taiwan belonged to China. The letter suggested that members of congress were challenging the “one-China” principle and were the “root cause” behind developing Taiwan Strait tensions.

            “We’re going to stand with freedom and democracy wherever it is in the world, in Ukraine, in Taiwan, and on the streets of Tehran,” Auchincloss said, after receiving the letter.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Representative Jake Auchincloss on Thursday (March 9) expressed support for a strong partnership between Taiwan and the U.S.“As the United States seeks to strengthen our position in the Indo-Pacific, let us commit to Taiwan as a long-term ally,” Auchincloss said while addressing the House of Representatives.He said the scope and severity of the Chinese threat toward Taiwan has “crystallized.” However, Taiwan’s vibrant democracy and prosperous economy present an opportunity for cooperation with the U.S., particularly in countering disinformation and propaganda.“We should also strengthen one another’s economies to increase flows of trade and investment, by negotiating expanded market access, common rules, and the end of double taxation on Taiwanese investment in the United States,” he added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831508,Australian media urges country to prepare for war with China in 3 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — This week, two Australian newspapers, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, warned the country to prepare for war with China in the next three years.The report indicates that a conflict involving Taiwan and China is much more likely than most Australian citizens realize. Further, given the country’s alliance with the U.S., it would be very difficult for Australia to avoid involvement in a war.The independent report, entitled “Red Alert,” was authored by five security analysts and published by the Nine Entertainment media group. The general view of the analysts is that Australia is not ready to be drawn into a war involving China and Taiwan, but that the country should begin preparing with a sense of urgency.“Our assessment of the risk of war is based on President Xi Jinping’s aggressive stance and rapid military build-up,” the Red Alert report reads. It suggests a three-year time frame because, according to the analysis, “a tipping point” will be reached around 2027, after which “Beijing will have military superiority over the U.S. in the Taiwan Strait.”The analysts also factor in China’s demographic crisis. They suggest that from Xi’s perspective, there is only a limited window in which China will be capable of pursuing such a large scale military operation. Such an analysis also infers that, if conflict is unavoidable, it is more favorable to the U.S. if war in the Taiwan Strait begins sooner rather than later.If war does occur, Australian involvement may not have broad support among Australians.While some dissent is to be expected, on the issue of whether the Australian government would support the U.S. and Taiwan in a conflict, one analyst, Mick Ryan said the decision has already been made. “We have made our choice. If the United States goes to war with Taiwan, we are going to support them one way or the other,” he said.Australia finds itself in a precarious position, because its greatest trading partner is also the greatest potential threat to its sovereignty. The analysts believe that Canberra would not be able to resist involvement because the consequences of allowing China to conquer Taiwan would imperil the regional and global order, and thereby, Australia’s own livelihood.“Any attack on Taiwan is neither a marginal matter nor a local one. If successful, it would strike at the heart of global norms that have underpinned international security and prosperity . . . South-East Asia and the Pacific island states could then be dominated by Beijing. Australia’s commercial and security lifelines to the world would operate only at Beijing’s pleasure. Australia would be highly vulnerable to economic coercion, military intrusion or both,” states the report.The key points of the Red Alert report can be viewed here.",2023/03/10,4208,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831510,Taiwan’s TSMC still considers building fab in Europe,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) said Friday (March 10) it was still considering setting up a fab in Europe, rejecting reports it was turning its attention toward Singapore.Previous reports hinted the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer had chosen Germany as its next production base, partly because of its large car industry’s need for computer chips. However, recent media reports suggested the level of financial aid coming from the European Union and from the German authorities might not be sufficient to persuade the company to set up shop, CNA reported.Instead, Singapore was willing to offer tax benefits and subsidies for the use of water and electricity, benefiting the production of 12 inch wafers for memory chips, the report said.Responding to the media discussions, TSMC said it was still evaluating the setting up of a fab for automotive chips in Europe based on the needs of customers and on the level of support from government. In addition, it is also considering building a second fab in Japan.As to other regions and countries, the company did not exclude any possibilities, but there were no concrete plans for such factories at the moment.",2023/03/10,1765,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831591,Bybit Takes VIP Program to the Next Level With Major Upgrades and Improvements,"DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -  Media OutReach - 10 March 2023 -  Bybit, the world's third most visited crypto exchange, has revamped its  VIP program to thank its loyal community for its continued support. The new program introduces expanded tiers and reduced requirements to help traders take greater advantage of the next level opportunities offered by Bybit's powerful platform.   The new VIP program will expand the number of VIP tiers from three to five with a new ""supreme VIP"" tier. The trading volume requirement has also been adjusted across the tiers to make it easier for traders to reach higher levels and is significantly less than Binance and some other leading exchanges.   The asset balance to access Bybit's VIP tiers two and three has been halved to $250K and $500K, respectively. And trading volume across spot and derivatives markets will be aggregated and taken into account when assigning access.   In the new system, maker and taker fees for derivatives can be as low as 0.00% and 0.03% creating more room for traders to benefit from Bybit's next level products and institutional services. VIPs can also unlock bonus benefits such as their own account managers and private events and gifts.   Experienced traders will be able to switch to Bybit's VIP program immediately using trading volume from other exchanges, without the need to build up their trading volume from scratch. Furthermore, VIPs from other exchanges will receive a higher level than before. For example, if their derivatives trading volume on another exchange was $70,000,000 (equivalent to Bybit VIP 3), they'll get bumped up to VIP 4 on Bybit. Non-VIPs can still enjoy amazing perks through Bybit's exclusive offers — like the 14-day free trial card and a special welcome gift when you deposit more than $50K.   Bybit devised the new program as part of its ""listen, care, improve"" philosophy after listening carefully to feedback from its community members and reflecting on how to best help them succeed. Bybit is in constant communication with its community and is always looking for ways to better help them increase their opportunities and earnings.   ""Our mission at Bybit is to empower traders around the world by providing them with the tools they need to succeed in today's fast-paced crypto market,"" said Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit. ""We believe that our revamped VIP Program is a significant step toward achieving this goal, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and improve for the benefit of our clients.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831620,Korean Air jet evacuated before takeoff after bullets found on board,"SEOUL, March 10 (Reuters) - A Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS) jet with 230 people on board was evacuated on Friday morning after two live bullets were found before takeoff at Incheon International Airport in South Korea, police said.
The Manila-bound plane, which was originally scheduled to take off at 7:45 a.m. (2245 GMT on Thursday), departed Incheon at around 11 a.m. (0200 GMT), after security checks identified no immediate terror risk, according to the police.
The 9 millimetre bullets were found by a passenger shortly before the jet was to take off with 218 passengers and 12 crew members on board, leading to the plane to return to the terminal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831629,German police: 8 dead in Jehovah's Witnesses hall shooting,"HAMBURG, Germany (AP) — A shooting at a Jehovah's Witnesses hall in the German city of Hamburg left eight people dead, including apparently the perpetrator, police said Friday. An unspecified number of other people were wounded, some of them seriously.There was no word on a possible motive for Thursday night's attack, which stunned Germany's second-biggest city. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a former Hamburg mayor, described it as “a brutal act of violence.”Police said earlier that they believed there was only one shooter, and that the person could be among the dead.Officers apparently reached the hall while the attack was ongoing — and heard one more shot after they arrived, according to witnesses and authorities. They did not use their own firearms, a police spokesman said.The head of Germany's GdP police union in Hamburg, Horst Niens, said he was convinced that the swift arrival of a special operations unit “distracted the perpetrator and may have prevented further victims.”Germany’s gun laws are more restrictive than those in the United States, but permissive compared to some European neighbors, and shootings are not unheard of.Last year, an 18-year-old man opened fire in a packed lecture at Heidelberg University, killing one person and wounding three others before killing himself. In January 2020, a man shot dead six people including his parents and wounded two others in southwestern Germany, while a month later, a shooter who posted a racist rant online killed nine people near Frankfurt.In the most recent shooting involving a site of worship, a far-right extremist attempted to force his way into a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur, Judaism’s holiest day, in October 2019. After failing to gain entry, he shot two people to death nearby.The German government announced plans last year to crack down on gun ownership by suspected extremists and to tighten background checks. Currently, anyone wanting to acquire a firearm must show that they are suited to do so, including by proving that they require a gun. Reasons can include being part of a sports shooting club or being a hunter.On Friday morning, forensic investigators in protective white suits could be seen outside the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Kingdom Hall, a boxy, three-story building next to an auto repair shop, a few kilometers (miles) from downtown Hamburg. As a light snow fell, officers placed yellow cones on the ground and windowsills to mark evidence.David Semonian, a U.S.-based spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses, said in an emailed statement early Friday that members “worldwide grieve for the victims of this traumatic event.”“The congregation elders in the local area are providing pastoral care for those affected by the event,” he wrote.Police spokesman Holger Vehren said police were alerted to the shooting Thursday night and were at the scene quickly.He said that the officers found people with apparent gunshot wounds on the ground floor, and then heard a shot from an upper floor, where they found a fatally wounded person who may have been a shooter. They did not fire their weapons.Student Laura Bauch, who lives nearby, said there were around four periods of shooting, German news agency dpa reported. “There were always several shots in these periods,” she said.Bauch said she looked out her window and saw a person running from the ground floor to the second floor of the Jehovah’s Witnesses hall.Gregor Miebach, who lives within sight of the building, heard shots and filmed a figure entering the building through a window. In his footage, shots can then be heard from inside. The figure later apparently emerges from the hall, is seen in the courtyard and then fires more shots through a first floor window before the lights in the room go out.Miebach told German television news agency NonstopNews that he heard at least 25 shots. After police arrived, one last shot followed, he said.His mother, Dorte Miebach, said she was shocked by the shooting. “It's really 50 meters (yards) from our house and many people died,” she said. ""This is still incomprehensible. We still haven't quite come to terms with it.Jehovah’s Witnesses are part of an international church, founded in the United States in the 19th century and headquartered in Warwick, New York. It claims a worldwide membership of about 8.7 million, with about 170,000 in Germany.Members are known for their evangelistic efforts that include knocking on doors and distributing literature in public squares. The denomination’s practices include a refusal to bear arms, receive blood transfusions, salute a national flag or participate in secular government.",2023/03/10,189,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831634,Australia state says first AUKUS nuclear submarines could be built overseas,"SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - The South Australia state government said Friday that the first nuclear submarines under the AUKUS pact between the United States, Britain and Australia may be built overseas, but that there could be more than the eight in the initial agreement.
The Australian federal government has indicated it would construct the nuclear-powered submarines in the South Australia state capital of Adelaide, but state premier Peter Malinauskas said he was unclear about the number of orders.
""My hope is we end up producing a lot more than eight nuclear submarines here in South Australia,"" Malinauskas told ABC Radio. ""There is not an example anywhere in the world of any nuclear submarine production line starting and then stopping ... so once you start producing nuclear submarines, you keep producing nuclear submarines.""
Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she believed AUKUS would be ""enormously beneficial"" to her home state of South Australia, as the pact was expected to create local jobs.
Reuters, citing four U.S. officials, reported on Wednesday Australia was expected to buy up to five U.S. Virginia-class nuclear submarines in the 2030s as part of AUKUS.
Adelaide was chosen as the base in 2016 when France won a A$50 billion ($33 billion) deal to build 12 submarines for Australia before Canberra ditched that in favour of AUKUS, causing fury in Paris.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, on an official trip to India, will meet U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday in San Diego, site of major U.S. Navy operations, to chart a way forward on AUKUS.
AUKUS will enable Australia to receive the technology required to deploy nuclear-powered submarines amid China's military buildup in the Indo-Pacific region. China ""firmly objects"" to AUKUS, its foreign ministry said this month.
