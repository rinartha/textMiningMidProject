After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823730,Hong Kong to drop COVID mask mandate from March,"Hong Kong is scrapping its COVID-19 mask mandate from Wednesday, nearly three years after the strict measures were imposed in the financial hub.""I announce that the masking requirement will be completely canceled starting tomorrow, March 1, including for indoors, outdoors and (on) public transportation,"" Chief Executive John Lee said at a media briefing on Tuesday.The Asian city was one of the last places in the world still to require people to wear masks in almost all public settings.It was also mandatory in Hong Kong for people over the age of two to wear face coverings, failing which they could face a penalty of up to HK$10,000 (€1,204; $ 1,275).""We think this is the best timing to make this decision. It is a clear message to show Hong Kong is resuming normalcy,"" Lee said.The move comes after Hong Kong's government launched a promotional campaign called ""Hello Hong Kong"" to bring back tourists and businesses which have stayed away from the former British colony since the start of the pandemic.Hong Kong, along with neighboring Macau, followed China's stringent zero-COVID policy for much of the last three years. People entering the country were required to spend up to 21 days in hotel quarantine.Macau too has announced plans to drop mask requirements for most areas, except public transport and hospitals.dvv/nm (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823731,Serbia and Kosovo accept EU proposal to normalize ties,"The leaders of Serbia and Kosovo on Monday accepted a European Union proposal to normalize the long-strained ties between the Balkan neighbors, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said.Borrell made the announcement after hosting meditation talks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo's prime minister, Albin Kurti, in Brussels.""Progress was made today, and I commend the parties for their engagement,"" Borrell told the media.""At the same time, more work is needed, to ensure that what was accepted today by the parties will be implemented. It is important to agree (but) it is still more important to implement what has been agreed.""Borrell said that a next meeting with Vucic and Kurti is slated to take place in March, with a focus on how to implement the plan.The EU foreign policy chief also said that the two sides vowed not to take unilateral measures that could lead to tensions and put the agreement in jeopardy.""This agreement is above all for the citizens of Kosovo and Serbia,"" he said.Kosovo, which is predominantly Albanian, declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after war brought an end to Serbian rule.However, Belgrade does not recognize the move.Flare ups between the former wartime foes have fanned fears of a return to conflict.Towards the end of 2022, tensions between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in northern Kosovo were high after the arrest of a former police officer of Serbian ethnicity over allegations of inciting attacks on officials of the electoral commission.On Monday night, Borrell's office published the previously secret European peace plan, which was drawn up in Germany and France, but is now, according to the EU's top diplomat, backed by all 27 EU members.Under the new deal, Belgrade stops short of recognizing Kosovo as an independent nation but agrees to recognize official documentation such as passports, diplomas and license plates.The 11-point plan says, without prejudicing recognition of each other's status, that neither side will resort to violence to resolve a dispute, nor seek to prevent the other from joining the EU or other international bodies, a crucial demand from Kosovo.""The parties shall develop normal, good-neighborly relations with each other on the basis of equal rights. Both parties shall mutually recognize their respective documents and national symbols, including passports, diplomas, license plates, and customs stamps,"" according to Article 1 of the document.""Serbia will not object to Kosovo's membership in any international organization,"" Article 4 adds.Later on Monday, Kosovo's Kurti said that he had been ready to sign the deal at the meeting in Brussels.""It is a pity that we did not sign the deal tonight despite the fact that we all agree,"" he told reporters.Speaking to the Serbian media, Vucic said that more discussion was needed.""It's good that we talked and I believe we will be able to overcome unilateral moves which would endanger the safety of the people on the ground,"" the Serbian president said.However, he stressed: ""We don't have a roadmap, people, we don't. We need to sit and work on the roadmap.""Vucic said he had insisted on the need for the association of Serb municipalities within Kosovo and would not budge on recognizing Kosovo documents until this came about.dvv/jsi (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823739,Taiwan defense ministry prepares practical changes to mobilization law,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday (Feb. 28) that a proposed name list of all men and women from the age of 16 would only be used during times of emergency.The drawing up of the list was reportedly one of the provisions set for a proposed reworking of the All-out Defense Mobilization Readiness Act, per CNA. According to a UDN report, the Ministry of Education (MOE) in February invited local education officials to discuss mobilization plans for all male and female students from the age of 16, even including them in rescue and ammunition production operations.However, military officials said the name lists were already in existence, with the only change now being that they would be moved online into a cloud network for more practical consultation.The Ministry of National Defense emphasized Tuesday that the act, introduced in 2001, had been amended twice, in 2014 and 2019, but that the emphasis was too much on preparations and not enough on practical issues once mobilization had been declared.All sectors of society should be aware of how many people could be mobilized in an emergency situation, and how they could be used effectively to prevent a successful enemy invasion, the military said. During the preparation of the amendments, the military would consult public opinion and adapt its proposals before submitting them to the Cabinet.The common aim of the amendments was to protect the nation’s security, the military said, calling on the media and the public to focus on rational discussions and not to distort the law’s intentions.",2023/02/28,1265,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823745,China claims US ‘endangered’ peace with Taiwan Strait transit,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China is crying foul and accusing the U.S. of “endangering” peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait after an American reconnaissance plane flew through the strait on Monday (Feb. 27).

            The Eastern Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said it closely monitored the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance plane as it flew through the Taiwan Strait, according to Reuters. “The U.S. side’s actions deliberately interfered with and disrupted the regional situation and endangered peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We firmly oppose this,” it said in a statement.

            “Theater forces remain on high alert at all times and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” it added.

            The U.S. Navy 7th Fleet on Monday said of the P-8A Poseidon transit that “The United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows including within the Taiwan Strait.” Adding that by “operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations.”











            “The aircraft’s transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the statement said.

            Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said the P-8A had flown in a southerly direction through the waterway, Reuters reported. Taiwanese forces tracked the U.S. aircraft during its transit and noted the situation was “normal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823750,Each Payment to Ransomware Attackers Subsidizes Nine Future Attacks,"New report from Trend shows how ransomware industry is kept afloat

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 28 February 2023 -  Trend Micro (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cybersecurity leader, today published a new report warning that although only 10% of ransomware victims pay their extorters, they are enabling attacks on numerous other organizations by doing so.   To read a full copy of the report,    What Decision Makers Need to Know About Ransomware Risk*, please visit: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/understanding-ransomware-using-data-science   Jon Clay, VP of threat intelligence at Trend Micro: ""Ransomware is a major cybersecurity threat to enterprises and governments today. It's also continually evolving, which is why we need more accurate, data-driven ways to model ransomware-related risk. This new research aims to help IT decision-makers better understand their risk exposure and provide policymakers with the information they need to craft more effective and impactful strategies.""   The report delivers strategic, tactical, operational, and technical threat intelligence and leverages advanced data science to list various threat actor metrics. These metrics can be used to compare ransomware groups, estimate risks, and model threat actor behaviors.   Key findings include:        The 10% of victims that agree to pay usually do so quickly and are generally being forced to pay more per compromise         Risk is not homogeneous – it differs across regions, sectors, and organization sizes         Victims in some sectors and countries pay more often than others, meaning their peers are more likely to be targeted         Paying a ransom often only results in driving up the overall cost of the incident with few other benefits         Ransomware monetization activities are at their lowest in January and July-August, making these potentially good times for defenders to rebuild infrastructure and prepare for future threats      The report reveals that by prioritizing protection left of the kill chain, continuing in-depth analysis of the ransomware ecosystems, and focusing global efforts on reducing the percentage of victims paying, industry stakeholders could help drive down ransomware's profitability.   The insights revealed in this report can also enable decision-makers to better assess possible financial risks stemming from Ransomware. This would help:        IT leaders to justify bigger budgets for ransomware defense         Governments to budget more accurately for restoration services and law enforcement         Insurers to price policies more accurately         International organizations to compare Ransomware more accurately to other global risks      *Jointly produced by Trend Micro and Waratah.io, the report applies data science approaches to information collected from network and host-based telemetry, underground forums, bitcoin, and financial transactions, and chat logs – alongside analysis of criminal business processes – to uncover new trends and choke points of the ransomware ecosystem.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823757,Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an attends 228 Massacre ceremony,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) attended a ceremony in Taipei’s 228 Peace Park on Tuesday afternoon (Feb. 28) to commemorate the 76th anniversary of the 228 Massacre, which was carried out by his great-grandfather Chiang Kai-shek's (蔣介石) Kuomintang (KMT) soldiers.Known as the fourth generation of the Chiang family, Chiang's attendance drew a lot of media attention. Midway through his speech, a large group protested his remarks, causing him to pause for about 10 minutes, per SETN.Chiang later continued saying that as mayor he was deeply sorry for ""the 228 Incident"" that occurred 76 years ago in Dadaocheng, Taipei City. The 228 Massacre refers to the abuse of a cigarette vendor which later led to the killing of tens of thousands of Taiwanese across the country at the hands of KMT soldiers.He described the event as a warning to those in power, noting the purpose of governance is to safeguard basic human rights. Chiang later said Taiwan’s progression from authoritarianism to democracy is the pride of the country, and a remarkable achievement.Earlier in the week (Feb. 21), Chiang visited the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum to meet with Liao Chi-pin (廖繼斌), a family member of a 228 victim, as well as other representatives of victims’ families, per UDN.When the media questioned the Kuomintang mayor about Chiang Kai-shek’s responsibility for the 228 Massacre, his response was that the government should disclose historical materials to reveal the truth of the incident. He side-stepped the issue of direct accountability.Chiang said he would set up a task group to recover the truth about the tragedy and provide assistance to the families of the victims and build up a promising future for the city with love, tolerance, and respect.Controversy over Chiang’s participation in a number of 228 Massacre events has led to a partial boycott by pro-Taiwan independence groups. Chiang’s reaction has been that he will not shirk his municipal duties.Taipei City Government has largely been involved in organizing Taipei-based 228 activities. For the first time, Tainan City has been selected as the location hosting Taiwan’s official commemoration of the 228 Massacre.",2023/02/28,1722,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823776,Taiwan to discuss end of mask mandate on public transport in mid-April,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A discussion about ending the mask mandate on public transport will have to wait at least until mid-April, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Tuesday (Feb. 28).Spokesman Philip Lo (羅一鈞) made the statement after Taiwan recorded two days in a row with fewer than 10,000 new local COVID-19 infections. He cautioned, however, that the figure might surge back up to 20,000 after the end of the current four-day holiday, the Liberty Times reported.Another factor needing consideration is the end of the mask mandate for schools from March 6 and its impact on the number of new local infections, according to Lo. As a result of recent positive trends, the debate about whether to end the compulsory wearing of masks on buses, trains, and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) networks could follow in mid-April, he said.Lo said the decline in local infections during the Feb. 25-28 holiday had been larger than expected, but it would take until Saturday (March 4) to determine whether the level of infections had not been negatively impacted by the holiday period.",2023/02/28,2807,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823837,Academia Sinica economist says Taiwan should hire Ukrainians,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Taiwan faces post-pandemic labor shortages in the tourism and manufacturing sectors as well as a shrinking military recruitment pool, an economist says introducing 30,000 to 50,000 Ukrainians could effectively address these issues.The influx of Ukrainian labor, in the economist's eyes, could help the Taiwan government achieve multiple goals in a pragmatic manner. Even better, it could lead to gratitude from European Union (EU) member states seeking to ease the burden of serving migrants and refugees from Ukraine.Lin Chung-cheng (林忠正), a research fellow at the Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica, proposed this creative solution in his commentary to Ettoday. In the article, he says Taiwan could be an attractive destination for Ukrainian workers in terms of Taiwan's wage levels, living costs, affordable healthcare services, order, and public safety.Lin said, given the country's absence of a refugee law, the Taiwan government could relax employment rules for Ukrainians to work in Taiwan's manufacturing, tourism, healthcare, and construction sectors. Furthermore, given the country's low birth rate and shrinking military recruitment pool, the government could consider hiring Ukrainians who have experience on the battlefield and are familiar with Russian and U.S.-made weapons, which can be leveraged in the event of a war with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).""Their knowledge on the battlefield and of national defense, either in the form of physical or cognitive warfare, would be a great asset to Taiwan's military departments,"" the economist added.The employment opportunities could help the economy of the wartorn eastern European nation if these Ukrainian workers in Taiwan sent money back to their hometown. This could amount to US$900 million (NT$27.6 billion) over three years, as opposed to Taiwanese donating money or material to Ukraine, Lin concluded.",2023/02/28,1417,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823870,Crypto Sets Higher Standards for Proof of Reserves for Traditional Finance: Bybit CEO,"The new norms after 2022: crypto exchanges have set a high bar in transparency with 100% verifiable proof of reserves             DEXs form an important part of a healthy ecosystem by supporting medium and long-term traders             Bybit has a calling as a CEX: delivering seamless integration into Web3 for everyday users       DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -  Media OutReach - 28 February 2023 - The future of the crypto industry is one step closer to its full potential, now trust and transparency is at the forefront, said Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. According to Zhou, technology will lead the way in restoring trust in crypto, and legitimate exchanges have what it takes to outperform traditional financial institutions in terms of transparency.   Speaking as part of a panel discussion at Blockchain Life 2023 in Dubai on Monday, Zhou proposed leveraging the open nature and real-time verification that decentralized technology offers. Blockchain is part of the solution, and crypto-native solutions can help armor the financial industry against traditional and new forms of fraud risk. He noted that crypto exchanges are able to offer real-time, verifiable proof of reserves, which is far and above the transparency traditionally offered by financial institutions.   Bybit is committed to managing user funds with the utmost transparency and integrity, which is why it has real-time proof of reserves with a purpose-built Merkle Tree. Users can use their Merkle Leaf code to check that their assets are recorded as liabilities in Bybit's on-chain wallets down to the granular details.   For Zhou, this kind of technology — powered by blockchain — is the real solution to the constant news of malfeasance in the crypto and wider financial sector. The new industry norm of proof of reserves can offer users more peace of mind and visibility into exchanges' assets, and this has tilted the conventional power dynamics between the customers and financial service providers, he said.   Zhou went on to talk about the role of crypto exchanges as the industry moves forward from a challenging 2022. While security considerations are a given, Zhou revealed why CEXs are still preferred by serious traders: deep liquidity and powerful infrastructure with millisecond precision.   Referring to institutional clients and professional traders, Zhou said that ""centralized exchanges are pretty much their only choice simply because of the liquidity. And you simply can't do high frequency trading on a decentralized exchange (DEX) due to infrastructure limitations."" However, Zhou suggested that those interested in medium-to-long term trades could consider DEXs as an option.   ""Our role — and that of any centralized exchange — is to be ready for mass adoption and be the gateway to Web3 when it happens. So, I still believe in the industry,"" Zhou added. ""In two years, you will see signs of mass adoption. Your uncles, your aunties, your cousins will all start to use crypto,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824014,Russia: Flights resume to St. Petersburg after air shutdown,"The Flight Radar flight tracking website on Tuesday reported that a number of Russian domestic flights headed for St. Petersburg were turned back to their departure points.Russia's defense ministry later said it had carried out air drills involving interceptor jets, which were not previously announced and caused the cancellation of flights.At least five flights from Moscow to Russia's second city were diverted back to the capital as of 11 a.m. local time (0800 UTC/GMT), after initially circling in the air.Traffic was restarted shortly afterward, amid unconfirmed Russian media reports that an unidentified object such as a drone had been spotted in the area.Online Russian news outlet Baza said jet fighters had been dispatched to investigate after the unidentified object was spotted in the sky. Reports later said the jets had not found anything.News agencies reported later on Tuesday that flights had started up again and that a temporary airspace ban within a 200-kilometer (124-mile) radius of Pulkovo Airport had been lifted by noon local time.In a statement issued about an hour after flights had restarted, the defense ministry said it had been carrying out exercises that involved the despatch of fighter jets in Russia's western air space.""During the training, air defense forces worked on the detection, interception, and identification of targets, as well as interacting with emergency services and law enforcement agencies,"" Russian news agencies cited the ministry as saying.Pulkovo, some 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) south of central St. Petersburg, is Russia's fourth busiest airport. The airspace closure was also said to have affected flights on the way to and from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, which cannot fly directly because nearby countries have closed their airspace to Russian aircraft.rc/nm (Reuters, Interfax)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824015,Ukraine updates: Fighting around Bakhmut 'extremely tense',"Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, said on Tuesday that the situation around the eastern town of Bakhmut was ""extremely tense.""""Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defenses of our troops and surround the city,"" Syrskyi was quoted as saying on Ukraine's Media Military Center Telegram messaging platform.Russia's mercenary Wagner Group has played a significant role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The small mining city of Bakhmut has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks.Capturing it would open the way for Russia to control urban centers in the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk region, and would represent the first major win for Moscow in months.Ukraine's general staff said Russia intensified its forces in Bakhmut and was shelling settlements around the city.""The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence. Our soldiers defending the area around Bakhmut are true heroes,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening video address.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Tuesday, February 28:A Russian court has slapped the Wikimedia Foundation with a fine of 2 million rubles (roughly €25,000, $27,000) after authorities accused it of ""spreading misinformation"" about the Russian military.Wikimedia, which owns Wikipedia, has already faced fines in Russia. Last year, it was fined for not deleting two articles about the war.The organization said it was considering appealing the ruling, but it had not yet made a decision.""So far, in the history of courts in Russia, Wikipedia has only had one successful experience of appealing court verdicts,"" the head of the foundation's Russian chapter, Stanislav Kozlovskiy, told Reuters news agency.Russia's Defense Ministry accused Kyiv of launching attempted drone strikes against civil infrastructure targets in two southern Russian regions overnight. The ministry said the alleged attacks had failed.""Overnight, the Kyiv authorities attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles to attack civilian infrastructure facilities in the Krasnodar and Adygea regions,"" the ministry said in a statement.It added that its anti-drone defense systems had repelled the attacks.""Both drones lost control and deviated from their flight paths. One fell into a field, the other, deviating from its trajectory, did not harm the intended target,"" it said.Before the ministry's statement, Russian state news agencies had reported a fire at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region, around 240 kilometers (149 miles) southeast of the Crimean peninsula.Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations said several regional television and radio stations broadcast air raid alerts after a hacking attack.According to Russian media, alerts were broadcast in the Belgorod and Voronezh regions bordering Ukraine.""As a result of hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country, information about the announcement of an air raid alert was broadcast,"" the ministry said in a statement.""This information is false and does not correspond to reality,"" it added.The ministry said a similar cyber attack had triggered air raid sirens across Russia last week.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine would become part of the military alliance in the future, but stressed that in the meantime it's important that the country ""prevails as a sovereign independent nation"" in the face of Russia's invasion.""NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective,"" Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Finland's capital Helsinki.Moscow has cited its worries about what it claims is a NATO eastward expansion as one of its reasons to launch what it describes as a ""special. military operation"" against Ukraine, as Kyiv has ambitions to join the alliance.Stoltenberg was speaking alongside Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, whose country — which borders Russia — has joined Sweden in dropping decadeslong policies of military non-alignment and is seeking to join NATO.""The time has come"" for Hungary and Turkey to ratify NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, Stoltenberg said, as Budapest and Ankara continue to block the ratification.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is set to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday, kicking off a three-day trip in which he will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.A key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko's visit comes after Beijing clarified its position on Russia's war in Ukraine, calling for dialogue between the two sides.In an interview with China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Belarusian leader praised Beijing's statement as ""a testimony to its peaceful foreign policy as well as a new and original step that will have a far-reaching impact all over the world.""Lukashenko's Beijing visit comes as the EU extended its sanctions on Belarus over Minsk's repression of political opposition and its support for Russia's war.Germany's industrial giant Rheinmetall has said it won an order in the double-digit million-euro range to supply Ukraine with automated reconnaissance systems.In a statement, Rheinmetall said it was now cooperating with the Estonian company DefSecIntel to provide the SurveilSPIRE systems, consisting of mobile surveillance towers with day and night-capable camera equipment, autopiloted mini drones and a control system.The company added that the products' delivery had already begun.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia was open to negotiations to end the Ukraine conflict but that new ""territorial realities"" could not be ignored.The comments were made in reference to China's support for a negotiated solution to the conflict.Russia proclaimed it had annexed the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions last September, something that Kyiv and the West have slammed as illegal.But now those regions have been named as constituent subjects of the Russian Federation in a constitutional decree.""The constitution of the Russian Federation exists, and cannot be ignored. Russia will never be able to compromise on this, these are important realities,"" Peskov added.Ukraine has said that no peace plan can be discussed unless Russian troops abandon all occupied territories, including the four annexed regions and the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kazakhstan for a Central Asia trip following the first anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine.During a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, Blinken vowed US support for the country's independence.""As you know well, the United States strongly supports Kazakhstan's sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity,"" Blinken said.""Sometimes we just say those words and they actually have no meaning. And of course, in this particular time, they have even more resonance than usual,"" he added, referring to Russia's assault on Ukraine.Blinken later held talks with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and was set to fly to Uzbekistan afterward.In Astana, the top US diplomat is due to meet the ministers of all five former Soviet republics in Central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.The five countries abstained or did not vote last week to back a UN General Assembly resolution calling on Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine.German police said on Tuesday that the destroyed Russian tank that had been on display in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin had been removed.The T-72 tank was displayed in front of the embassy in the German capital's city center to serve as a memorial against the war on the first anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The organizers of the project said it would be exhibited in the Netherlands next.According to the organizers, the tank was destroyed when it hit a mine during a Russian attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in March.The vehicle is on loan from the Military History Museum of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, which also supported its transport.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not yet said if he would run for the country's next presidential election, scheduled for 2024.""We have not yet heard him say anything about whether he will run or not. That means it is still a bit early,"" Peskov told Moscow daily Izvestia in comments published on Tuesday.Peskov added that Putin was currently very busy and not in the mood to campaign.Putin served as Russia's president from 2000 to 2008, and since 2012. He was prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012.Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said in an interview that he saw no signs that China and Russia were in discussions about arms supplies. 

""As of now, I do not think that China will agree to the transfer of weapons to Russia,"" Budanov told Voice of America (VOA). ""I do not see any signs that such things are even being discussed.""Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had information that suggested China was considering providing Russia with ""lethal support.""Several media outlets have since reported, citing unidentified senior US officials, that Beijing was deciding whether to supply Moscow with drones and munitions as Russia suffers heavy losses in its war in Ukraine.""I am the head of intelligence and I rely, with all due respect, not on the opinions of individual people, but only on facts. I do not see such facts,"" Budanov said.The military intelligence chief added that ""almost the only country that actually transfers more or less serious weapons [to Russia] is Iran.""Budanov dismissal of the claims came after Beijing called for a cease-fire as part of a peace plan it proposed.China's proposal has been largely met with skepticism, but Kyiv has sought to improve its ties with Beijing, Moscow's key ally.Ukraine's joining of the EU is conditional on anti-corruption and de-oligarchizing reforms. But though the war has dented the wealth of the leading oligarchs, they remain rich and still want to wield influence.At the UN Human Rights Council, Ukraine has condemned what officials have called Russia's systematic deportation of Ukrainian children. One estimate suggests more than 6,000 Ukrainian children have been held at sites in Moscow-annexed Crimea and Russia.The war in Ukraine has forced many people onto the front lines. But while soldiers defend their country on the battlefield, Ukraine's best handball team HC Motor Zaporizhzhia is representing the nation in Germany.fb/nm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters, Interfax)",2023/02/28,,

Facing the complicated international situation, the future of the Service Order Software market is full of uncertain. Report Ocean predicts that the global Service Order Software market size will reach million $in 2028 with a CAGR of % from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Request Sample Data To Learn More About This Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352529In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global PEO Software Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824134,Trans woman among Miss Germany finalists,"About 15,000 women nationwide applied to become the next Miss Germany, according to the competition's organizers.The 10 finalists were revealed on Tuesday, and one of them is making headlines: 19-year-old Saskia von Bargen, a trans woman who lives with her parents and three younger sisters in the village of Friedrichsfehn, Lower Saxony.Von Bargen knew from the age of 5 that she was a girl. She preferred playing with girls and wearing dresses. ""Already early on my parents realized that this was not just a phase,"" says the 19-year-old, who praises her parents for being supportive from the start. At school, however, things were not always easy; she wore boys' clothes to avoid bullying.At age 11, von Bargen started taking puberty blockers, followed by feminizing hormone therapy two years later. This is also when she came out at school, which made life easier for her and she started feeling more accepted. When von Bargen was of age, she underwent gender surgery. Saskia is her chosen name.Winning a beauty pageant used to be associated with having good looks and the ability to walk like a runway model.But Miss Germany Studios, the company that organizes the national pageant, has radically changed the judging criteria in an attempt to revamp the contest's image.Since 2019, candidates no longer prance on the catwalk in a bikini. Height and weight are also no longer important. In fact, appearances play absolutely no role, according to Jil Andert from Miss Germany Studios. The women rather have to demonstrate strong personality skills and ""are meant to be a source of inspiration,"" Andert told German press agency dpa.But sociologist Nina Degele from the Freiburg University is left unimpressed by the competition's makeover and considers the Miss Germany format outdated. In order to be relevant, she believes ""the format would have to be abolished and replaced by something completely different.""Von Bargen said the Miss Germany pageant was the ""perfect platform"" for her to tell her story. A retail trainee in a fashion store, von Bargen wants to educate people about what it's like to be a trans woman. She talks openly about things that went wrong in her first surgery. In total, she underwent 12 surgical procedures. Despite the hardship, she doesn't regret it.She applied to the competition so she could promote awareness of transgender issues. She sees herself as an ambassador for the cause. If she wins, she will have €25,000 ($26,500) at her disposal.Von Bargen is not the first trans woman to come so far in a Miss Germany pageant. Last year, Gadou, a trans woman from Hannover, also from Lower Saxony, made it to the finals.But von Bargen is hoping to be the first trans woman to win. The finals will take place on Saturday at the Europa-Park in Rust, in southwestern Germany.Other finalists include an energy consultant who wants to promote women in a male-dominated field and a midwife who aspires to start her own birth center.The Miss Germany competition, which was held for the first time in 1927 but forbidden by the Nazis, is not to be confused with Miss Universe Germany, where an official candidate for the Miss Universe pageant is selected.sl/eg (dpa)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824135,Top US diplomat visits Central Asia with eye on Russia,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday was visiting Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and meeting his counterparts from all five former Soviet republics of Central Asia.The trip is Blinken's first in the region, where Russia and China play a key role.The top US diplomat announced a $25 million (€23 million) support package to help Central Asian nations diversify trade routes and create employment.In remarks with the foreign ministers from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, Blinken said Washington backed their ""sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.""""Sometimes we just say those words and they actually have no meaning. And of course, in this particular time, they have even more resonance than usual,"" Blinken said, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago.Blinken also met Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who voiced ""appreciation"" for US support for Kazakhstan's sovereignty.""We have built very good and reliable long-term partnerships in so many strategically important areas"" with the US, Tokayev said.Tokayev has previously pushed back against territorial claims made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.Kazakhstan, which shares with Russia the world's longest continuous land border, has the second-biggest ethnic Russian population among ex-Soviet republics after Ukraine.With Moscow claiming that it attacked Ukraine to ""liberate"" ethnic Russians, some Kazakhs fear for their country's security.Blinken's visit comes just days after the one-year anniversary of Moscow's war in Ukraine, which has tested Russian influence in a region that also includes Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.The longstanding security and economic ties between Central Asian nations and Russia have come under increasing scrutiny since the war started last year.Moscow has looked to the markets and trade routes of its Central Asian neighbors in a bid to circumvent Western sanctions. The US has also granted some exemptions to the region as part of its sanctions regime, meaning it does not deem countries there to be violating the sanctions in continuing certain trade activities, such as Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline that carries Kazakh oil to the West through Russia.US President Joe Biden's administration has stepped up engagement with Central Asia in an apparent bid to demonstrate the benefits of cooperation with Washington as the region faces economic fallout from the conflict.Unlike Moscow's ally Belarus, Central Asian nations have not rallied behind Russia over the war, typically abstaining in UN votes condemning Russian activities.fb/msh (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824136,Volkswagen China: 'No evidence' of violations at Xinjiang plant,"The German automobile giant Volkswagen Group (VW) said on Tuesday that there were no signs of human rights violations in its plant in China's western Xinjiang region.China's government has been accused of engaging in human rights abuses against the Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang since the 2000s, including mass forced labor in detention camps.The UN has said the allegations could constitute crimes against humanity, but China has denied all claims.""Of course we are aware of the critical reports, we take this very seriously,"" the head of VW's China operations, Ralf Brandstätter, said regarding charges of labor abuses in car production.""But we have no evidence of human rights violations at this plant — that has not changed after my visit,"" he added. He traveled to the company's plant in the city of Urumqi in mid-February for an inspection.""I can talk to people and draw my conclusions. I can try and verify the facts, and that's what I did. I did not find any contradictions,"" Brandstätter said. He noted that VW would continue to monitor the situation.While several major corporations ended their operations in Xinjiang following US claims that China is committing ""genocide"" against the Muslim Uyghur minority, VW opted to stay.Some 29% of the 240 employees at the VW plant belong to ethnic minorities, 17% of them Uyghurs.Brandstätter said he spoke to seven workers individually — including Han Chinese, Uyghurs and Kazakhs — some through a translator chosen by Volkswagen and some in English. He said he held shorter discussions with other workers on his tour, adding that it all occurred without government supervision.But Luke de Pulford of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China — a group of legislators from 30 democratic countries including Britain, Germany, and the United States — said labor standards in Xinjiang could not be verified, as members of the Uyghur minority could not speak freely without fearing for their safety.The World Uyghur Congress in Germany and researchers from Sheffield Hallam University, who authored a report on the auto industry supply chain's links to Xinjiang, said the visit and conversations with workers were likely planned and coordinated with authorities.jcg/nm (dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824137,Banksy mural featured in Ukrainian postage stamp,"Marking one year since Russia's full-scale invasion of their country, Ukraine has issued a postage stamp depicting a mural by British street artist Banksy of a boy defeating a grown man in judo. The phrase ""Get lost Putin"" has been added in Cyrillic to the lower left part of the stamp.The mural was painted by Banksy on a bombed-out wall in the town of Borodyanka northwest of Kyiv, where many buildings were razed to the ground by Russian aircraft at the beginning of the invasion last year. Borodyanka was hit particularly hard by Russian attacks.The mural portrayed in the stamp is part of a series of Banksy works that appeared in different parts of Ukraine at the end of 2022.Banksy has traveled to crisis zones in different parts of the world and has created artworks that are known to convey a social or political message.The face of the man being knocked down is not depicted, but it is most likely alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin who has a black belt in judo. Last year, World Taekwondo stripped off Putin's honorary black belt to condemn the war he is waging against Ukraine.The mural could also be seen as a reference to the biblical story of David and Goliath, symbolizing the unlikely triumph of the underdog, in this case represented by a young opponent as Ukraine.""I think the boy is a symbol of a small Ukraine which defeats the big man, Russia,"" Nataliia Hrebeniuk, a local resident praised the stamp's symbolism. ""It's very representative of the situation.""""We thought that this exact stamp, this exact painting would be the best representation of what every Ukrainian feels about our enemy,"" the head of Ukrainian Postal Service, Ihor Smilianskyi, said before postmarking the first stamp.Enthusiastic residents queued at Kyiv's main post office to buy the new stamp last Friday.Svetlana, a 50-year-old economist, was keen to purchase a stamp ""because I support the Ukrainian armed forces"" and ""the stamp is printed at a historic moment"", one year after the start, on February 24, 2022, of the Russian invasion.Another enthusiastic buyer on its first issue date was Maxime who was delighted to see a ""first stamp from one of Banksy's works.""The 26-year-old told AFP news agency that it's ""a very cool gesture for the world to understand Ukraine,"" as it is important ""that we remain in the spotlight.""sl/eg (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824138,More than mercenaries: Russia's Wagner Group in Africa,"At first, their presence is often just a rumor. Later, it's an open secret. Thousands of mercenaries with Russia's Wagner Group are active in a number of African countries.In the Central African Republic, for example, 1,890 so-called ""Russian instructors"" are supporting government troops in the ongoing civil war, according to the Russian ambassador. In Libya, up to 1,200 Wagner mercenaries are believed to be fighting on the side of rebel leader Khalifa Hifter. In Mali, the pro-Russian, anti-Western military junta has also brought hundreds of Wagner fighters into the country. There, they have been accused of committing serious human rights violations.But the Wagner Group's presence in Africaextends much further, experts say.""Wagner itself has developed over time as an organization that's gone from being a purely private military contracting entity into a multiplicity of business alliances and relations, and a network of companies. Some of them front companies across the countries in which they operate on the African continent,"" analyst Julian Rademeyer told DW recently at the Munich Security Conference. ""It operates in this legal gray zone between illicit activities and more legal illicit activities. And it straddled those quite, quite effectively.""Rademeyer works at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC), where he and his colleagues recently published a report on Wagner in Africa. ""We argue in the report that the Wagner mercenary group, the Wagner private military group, is the most influential Russian actor operating in Africa today, and that its activities and the network of front companies that bolster it are a malign influence on the continent,” he said.Russia seeks greater influence in Africa, and the Wagner Group is likely to be as much a part of this as state visits by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, military cooperation and arms deals, and in some cases even free deliveries of food and fertilizer. Thanks to all this, Moscow was likely able gain 15 abstentions from African countries in the most recent United Nations resolution against its war of aggression in Ukraine. Eritrea and Mali sided even more clearly with Russia by voting against the resolution.The Wagner Group, ostensibly named after German composer Richard Wagner, was founded in 2014 by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he and the group have since become an indispensable private sector player for Russian interests. Only recently, Prigozhin publicly stated for the first time that he was also behind the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory that infiltrates social media, especially in the West, with disinformation in Russia's interests.GI-TOC research has found that the Wagner Group has also engaged in campaigns to influence African populations.The Kremlin uses Wagner as an ""instrument of diplomacy in Africa,"" a representative of the All Eyes on Wagner research collective, which monitors Wagner activities worldwide, told DW. DW knows the identity of the representative, but he uses the pseudonym Gabriel for security reasons.""Private military companies are banned in Russia, but to a certain extent they are allowed to operate outside Russia,"" Gabriel said, explaining that mercenaries on the ground belong to subsidiary companies. ""There is an approval from the Kremlin every time that the Wagner brand develops its activities in Africa.""International research has found that the Wagner brand is active in areas that extend far beyond security. In July, All Eyes on Wagner partnered with 11 European media outlets to uncover how the group has been raking in massive profits with precious tropical timber from the Central African Republic. According to the report, the government in Bangui granted a subsidiary unrestricted logging rights across 187,000 hectares (722 square miles).The case of the Ndassima gold mine, also in the Central African Republic, is similar. Reports say that a concession was withdrawn from a Canadian mining company in favor of one from Madagascar that appears in the GI-TOC report as a Wagner subsidiary. Research by The Africa Report magazine traces how the Wagner network allegedly imported heavy mining equipment through the Cameroonian seaport of Douala. Up to three truck convoys are organized weekly from Bangui to Douala to transport the raw materials, under the protection of Wagner members with heavy weapons.For cash-strapped African governments, it can be quite attractive to pay for Wagner's services with mining rights or market access, Gabriel said. ""You don't have to withdraw money from your account. You can just say, 'Here, for 25, 50 or 100 years, you can exploit this mine without any problems.'""The Wagner Group appears to be ever diversifying its businesses in the Central Africa Republic. Trying, for example, to force French sugar company SUCAF out of the market, said Joseph Bendounga, head of the MDREC opposition party there.Another example: ""They are in the process of framing the French brewery Castel for supporting and financing terrorist forces,"" he told DW. ""In all areas that bring in money, including customs and taxes, the Russians are the masters.""The First Industrial Company, which produces beer and spirits in Bangui — and, according to the GI-TOC report, is apparently registered to a Russian businessman tied to Wagner — could benefit from this.Russia does not deny the links to the First Industrial Company. ""It's going well, because drinks made according to Russian recipes are very popular in the Central African Republic,"" a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Bangui told DW, adding that popularizing Russian culture and doing business with the Central African population is a priority. A private investor can do what he wants, the spokesman said: ""After all, this is the law of the free market.""The economic activities of the Wagner network in Africa appear to be growing in intensity, despite the fact that its mercenaries are now also openly fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine.""In some instances, large numbers of Wagner private military contractors were pulled out to go and fight in the war in Ukraine, but others still remain,” GI-TOC analyst Rademeyer said. ""The activities are continuing, certainly at a downscaled level. But there's no indication that the war in Ukraine is leading to a full pullout of Wagner private military contractors from Africa.""On the contrary: Shortly before the anniversary of the start of the war on February 24, The Wall Street Journal, citing US intelligence sources, reported that the Wagner group was working with local rebels to plan a coup in Chad.""The concern is that Wagner will keep metastasizing and growing within an African context unless there are interventions to to prevent those influences, and also unless European partners and countries work far better with their African counterparts,"" Rademeyer said.With reporting by Dirke Köpp, Kossivi Tiassou, Sandrine Blanchard, and Bob Barry.This article was translated from German.",2023/02/26,165,

The populist former President Rodrigo Duterte, who left office last year, frequently criticized Brussels over what he saw as its lecturing, while the EU was unequivocal in its condemnation of his brutal drug war.The Manila government says around 6,000 people were killed, but human rights groups contend the death toll is far higher. The Duterte administration is also accused of weakening political and human rights across the board.EU-Philippine free trade talks, which began in late 2015, were a casualty as negotiations stalled in February 2017. But President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office last June, has vowed to restore good ties with democratic countries, especially its treaty ally the US, and adopt a muscular foreign policy in light of his country's disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.Marcos Jr., the namesake son of an ousted dictator, also pledges to make good on promises to turn around his country's image on human rights, understanding this to be a prerequisite to improving economic relations with the likes of the EU, its fourth-largest trade partner.The human rights situation is ""not as bad as during the Duterte administration… But the challenge now is to ensure accountability and to investigate all those violations before,"" said Carlos H. Conde, a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch covering the Philippines.Hannah Neumann, the European Parliament subcommittee's vice-president who was part of the delegation to Manila, told local media that the human rights situation is ""better than it was under [former] President Duterte.""The visit ""came at a good point in time to assess the more constructive attitude of the new administration and to send the clear message that we expect implementation of the many promises made,"" she told DW afterwards.""The hand for trade talks is outstretched,"" she added. ""But trade with the EU rests on two pillars: privileged access and implementation of social, human rights and environmental standards. And one is always linked to the other. This will not change under any new scheme.""However, more urgent for Manila is its place in the EU's Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+). Access to this preferential trade scheme expires at the end of the year, although Alfredo Pascual, the Philippines' trade secretary, briefed local media over the weekend that he was optimistic of renewal as European officials were ""receptive"" to the Manila government's claims of having improved human rights and economic liberalization.The European Parliament subcommittee that visited last week insinuated that GSP+ renewal might be conditional on Manila releasing former Senator Leila de Lima, who has been detained since 2017 on allegedly trumped-up drug-trafficking charges. The subcommittee visited her in detention last week.EU lawmakers are also trying to persuade the current government to have Duterte stand before trial in the International Criminal Court (ICC), said Joshua Bernard Espeña, a resident fellow at the International Development and Security Cooperation, a Manila-based think tank.A panel of judges at the ICC in The Hague this month authorized investigators to resume inquiry into alleged crimes against humanity. Dutetre pulled the country out of the Rome Statute, which encompasses ICC activity, in 2017, but foreign governments are now pressuring President Marcos Jr. to rejoin and allow investigators access to the country.""Returning to the ICC would be of course a strong sign in which direction the country wants to move,"" Neumann, the MEP, said last week in Manila.Most analysts reckon the EU will renew the Philippines' GSP+ status, while potentially also giving the go ahead this year to restart talks over a free trade agreement, a decision that will be taken by the European Commission.Speaking earlier this month, Trade Secretary Pascual warned that the EU would be ""competitively disadvantaged"" if delays persist in restarting talks.EU negotiations with Indonesia over a free trade deal entered their 13th round last month, while Thailand's Cabinet in early February approved a motion to restart free trade deal talks with the EU. It's feasible that discussions with these three Southeast Asian states — and potentially Malaysia — could recommence before the end of the year.Lars Wittig, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, pointed out that Manila has also recently enacted ""major economic reforms,"" including amendments to the Retail Trade Liberalization Act and Foreign Investment Act, ""that show that the Philippines is open and ready for more investments.""At present, just 4% of the total EU foreign direct investment in the ASEAN region is making its way to the Philippines, he noted. Trade also has much room for improvement. The International Trade Center, a multilateral body, estimated in 2021 that the Philippines has an export potential of more than €12 billion to the EU, almost double what actual trade was worth that year.""These relatively low trade and investment figures indicate that considerable potential exists for a free trade agreement between the EU and the Philippines to help develop bilateral relations,"" said Wittig.Marcos Jr. is also looking to reinvigorate his country's security alliances and now takes a far more hawkish stance on China than his predecessor, whose attempted pivot to Beijing generated few economic benefits for the Philippines.Earlier this month, Manila and Washington announced a new deal to allow American forces access to four more military sites in the country, and would recommence joint naval patrols in the South China Sea, where China aggressively contests the territory that an international court in 2016 ruled was under the Philippines' jurisdiction.A novel defense agreement between the Philippines and Japan was also finalized this month, allowing Japanese troops greater access to Philippine territory.The EU's own security agenda in Southeast Asia and the wider Indo-Pacific remains uncertain. Although Brussels wants to take a more active role, the EU itself lacks any unified military force, and the two member states with security ambitions in the Indo-Pacific — Germany and France — are distracted by the war in Ukraine.""For the Philippines, credible political support from the EU and Germany in international forums for the South China Sea award of 2016 is crucial. It strengthens Manila's legal position vis-à-vis Beijing,"" said Alfred Gerstl, an expert on Indo-Pacific international relations at the University of Vienna.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824157,Why are so many Pakistanis trying to reach Europe illegally?,"The sinking of a boat carrying migrants to Europe on Sunday — resulting in the deaths of dozens of people, including many from Pakistan — has sparked a debate in the South Asian country about the dire economic situation that is forcing many young people to embark on such perilous journeys in search of better conditions abroad.The boat crashed on rocks and broke up in heavy seas near the town of Steccato di Cutro in southern Italy, killing at least 64 people, including about 14 children.There were 80 survivors, who said that the boat had been carrying about 180 to 200 people.Italy has arrested three men, a Turkish man and two Pakistani nationals, in connection with the incident.Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said 20 citizens had been on the boat and 16 of them had survived but four were missing.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered authorities to ascertain the facts, and the Federal Investigation Agency has launched a probe into human trafficking.Many Pakistanis and experts say the nation's crippling economic crisis is a major reason why many people are looking to migrate abroad, even through risky and illegal means.Pakistan's economy has been in turmoil in recent years, and desperately needs external financing, with its foreign exchange reserves dipping to about $3 billion (€2.8 billion), barely enough for three weeks' worth of imports.The catastrophic floods in 2022 aggravated the crisis by inflicting more than $30 billion in damages and economic losses, and displacing millions of people.Food prices have soared, and the number of people facing food insecurity has doubled to 14.6 million, according to UN figures.The World Bank estimated that up to 9 million more people could be dragged into poverty as a result of the flooding.Over one-fifth of Pakistan's 220 million people already live below the national poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank and IMF.Currently, inflation is running at nearly 30%, the wealth gap is enormous, and tax avoidance by the rich is rampant.According to industry groups, about 7 million workers have lost their jobs in the textile industry alone as production costs rise and exports dwindle, putting the sector on the edge of collapse.Shahida Wizarat, a Karachi-based economist, said flawed policies had landed Pakistan in this economic quagmire.She pointed to the nation's recurring trade deficits causing depreciation of the currency, resulting in high import costs, rising debt burden and increased cost of doing business.Azra Talat Saeed, economist and founder of the NGO Roots for Equity, said the rampant problem of tax avoidance and evasion has also worsened the government's debt burden.In Pakistan, the richest 5% of rural households control almost two-thirds of the total agricultural land, she told DW.""These rich feudal lords do not pay taxes at all and it is only the poor who are burdened with taxes.""Pakistan said last week that its longtime ally China approved a $700 million credit facility for the debt-stricken country.Islamabad has also been in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure a $1 billion loan payout, from the $6.5 billion bailout agreed in 2019.Pakistani authorities have already taken a string of measures, including adopting a market-based exchange rate; a hike in fuel and power tariffs; the withdrawal of subsidies, and more taxation to generate revenue to bridge the fiscal deficit.Officials say the lender is still negotiating with Islamabad over power sector debt, as well as a potential rise in the policy rate, which currently stands at 17%.The strict measures are likely to further cool the economy and stoke inflation.Saeed believes the policies of international institutions could exacerbate Pakistan's crisis.""Our import bill has already risen over the years and now the IMF demands unrestricted imports, which means that Pakistan's import bill may witness an exponential surge in coming years,"" she said.Miftah Ismael, a former finance minister, said the government needs to launch development projects to stimulate the economy and create jobs.By building houses and roads, Pakistan can prevent millions more from plunging into poverty, he said, stressing the need for providing employment to the nation's youth.Mian Ghulam Shabbir, a 42-year-old laborer from Pindi Bhattian area in Punjab province, said Pakistanis are desperately trying to migrate abroad given the lack of economic opportunities in the country.They have no hope of economic revival, he said, adding that he himself tried to migrate to Italy in 2015.""Workers earn nothing here after toiling for over 12 hours a day. And they think that if they do the same work in Italy or any other Western country, they can make tons of money, which can help their families,"" he noted.""So people will continue to risk their lives in search of work abroad.""Abida Choudhary, Lahore-based leader of Awami Workers' Party, pointed out that Pakistan is home to millions of unemployed youths.And, she said, the rising food insecurity, lack of jobs and soaring prices of basic necessities mean that they ""illegally try to migrate to European countries, letting agents bundle them into containers or push them into overcrowded boats, which results in tragedies like the one in Italy.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824169,UK's Sunak sells EU deal as 'prize' for Northern Ireland,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak traveled to Northern Ireland on Tuesday to try and garner support for a new post-Brexit trading deal with the European Union.After sealing the deal a day prior with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Sunak hopes to secure the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and end their boycott of Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreements.The new agreement, called the Windsor Framework, seeks to ease tensions over Northern Ireland's status following the UK's official divorce from the EU in 2020.The deal aims to improve some of the difficulties that have arisen for goods coming to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, while simultanesouly maintaining Northern Ireland's unique status, effectively still remaining part of the European single market after Brexit.Unionists in Northern Ireland, who believe the country should remain part of the UK not join with the Republic of Ireland, had objected to the terms of the deal, saying it made the country's status unacceptably different to that of England, Scotland and Wales.They had been refusing to participate in power-sharing government with their main rivals, citing dissatisfaction with the deal as the reason. Under the complex rules in Northern Ireland designed to keep the peace, that means that the legislature cannot convene at all.During his visit to Belfast and other areas of Northern Ireland on Tuesday, Sunak said he wanted to provide details of the new deal, although he acknowledged this would take time.""I'm also very keen, we've not been shy about saying, that the people of Northern Ireland need and deserve their government,"" he told reporters.During a visit to a Coca-Cola factory in Lisburn, Sunak said the deal would make Northern Ireland ""the world's most exciting economic zone"" — granting it access to both the EU and UK markets.""Nobody else has that. No one. Only you guys: only here, and that is the prize,"" the prime minister said.DUP leader Jefferey Donaldson said that his first reading of the new deal appeared to address his party's concerns of sovereignty.But he added that the party would need time to thoroughly review the deal to see if it meets their requirements for returning to the power-sharing government in the Stormont assembly.The British government has not yet set a deadline for a response.The DUP, which is Northern Ireland's second-largest political party, has refused to take part in the power-sharing government in Stormont out of protest over the initial Northern Ireland Protocol.They argued that the original ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" amounted to a loss of sovereignty and equal status with England, Scotland and Wales.Sinn Fein, the largest republican party which advocates for a reunified Ireland, welcomed the new agreement. Sinn Fein's position has always been that keeping an open Irish border was essential and that remaining in the EU single market was preferable, if not the only way to achieve this.Maintaining an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was a key component of the 1990s Good Friday peace deal that broadly ended decades of sectarian and political violence in Northern Ireland.Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice president and first minister designate, said she'd spoken with Sunak about the deal on Tuesday, saying she ""welcomed yesterday's breakthrough.""""The priority must now be getting Stormont up and moving without delay,"" she wrote on Twitter.Sinn Fein also overtook the DUP as the biggest power in Northern Irish politics last May — the first time a party advocating a unified Ireland was ever the country's strongest force. Some DUP critics had questioned whether that change in the balance of power might also help explain their unwillingness to join a power-sharing government at Stormont.The Windsor Framework seeks to ease trade rules concerning products that are coming from the UK, as well as address some concerns from the DUP about what role EU law plays in the trade agreements.The new deal would create a largely customs check-free lane for goods that are coming from the rest of the UK and which are intended to stay in Northern Ireland — and not pass into the Republic of Ireland and the EU's single market.This would apply for a range of goods including UK-approved sausages, medicines and plants.The Windsor Framework also limits but does not completely get rid of oversight by the EU's European Court of Justice.Under the new deal, a provision called the ""Stormont brake"" would allow Norther Ireland's assembly to block any new laws passed by the EU that would take effect in the province.rs/msh (Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824170,What happened to the German military's €100 billion fund?,"Just over a year ago, Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a speech to the German parliament that is likely to define his chancellorship — and he was barely two months into it. The ""Zeitenwende"" speech (literally ""turning of the times""), a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was built on the announcement that the German military would receive a special one-off fund of €100 billion to be upgraded.On June 3, the center-right opposition in the Bundestag joined forces with the ruling parties to change the constitution and allow the additional debt — an unprecedented occurrence in the history of the Federal Republic.Since then, Scholz's center-left coalition has been dogged by broadsides from the conservative opposition and critics who say Germany's troops have not benefited from this windfall. ""The Bundeswehr has tremendous deficits, and the Zeitenwende hasn't even started in it,"" Roderich Kiesewetter, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper on Monday. ""The military has lost a year and is barer than it was at the start of 2022.""In response, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of the Bundestag defense committee and a member of the governing coalition's Free Democratic Party (FDP), remarked pointedly to the Deutschlandfunk public radio station that, in the 16 years the CDU had occupied the Defense Ministry under Angela Merkel, ""nothing at all"" had been done to modernize the army.She then listed what she said were the government's achievements of the past year: new orders of F-35 fighter jets and heavy transport helicopters from the United States and a new digitalization drive to modernize the forces.For its part, the Defense Ministry says €30 billion of the €100 billion has already been earmarked for major purchases. There has been some criticism from European allies, and within Germany, that so many big orders have been placed in the United States, though ultimately most of the special fund is likely to stay in Germany, which has a strong weapons industry.And anyway, Strack-Zimmermann said, €100 billion isn't something that can easily be spent in a year. Manufacturing sophisticated new equipment takes time. The first eight F-35s, for example, are expected to be delivered in 2026 (they will initially stay in the US while Bundeswehr pilots are trained), with the remaining 27 to be delivered by 2029. Some goods, like new digital communication equipment, will be available more quickly, while others will take even longer.Time is pressing. Economic forces are eating away at the €100 billion. Rafael Loss, a defense specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told DW that the original estimate was that only €8 billion of the special fund would have to go toward the interest payments on the loan that the government had taken out. Now, thanks to rising interest rates, that estimate has gone up to €13 billion. So that leaves €87 billion of actual money to spend.On top of that, there's inflation, dollar-euro exchange rates, and the value-added tax, all of which mean that, once all the extra costs have been covered, only about €50 to €70 billion will be left over to spend on actual hardware. ""The longer you have this money sit around somewhere, the longer factors like inflation and interest payments have to eat away at this pile,"" Loss said.To some extent, Loss agrees that the government could have acted quicker. ""In some ways, last year was a lost year for the Bundeswehr,"" he said. ""But the new defense minister (Boris Pistorius) seems to be pushing for a lot of things to happen on accelerated timelines, like the replacement of the Leopard tanks.""Boris Pistorius took office just over a month ago, after his predecessor Christine Lambrecht, also a Social Democrat, resigned in part because of a wave of discontent with her leadership that leaked from within the army ranks.And the new minister has been pushing for more money: This week he suggested that the special fund was not enough to cover the military's needs, and called for his ministry's budget to be increased by an extra €10 billion. Some of his colleagues, among them his party's co-leader Saskia Esken, appeared less than enthusiastic about the idea.Pistorius' apparent urgency is a shift for the German military, which has for many years suffered from inefficiency in its procurement. Last year, that was a familiar complaint made Hans Christoph Atzpodien, head of the German security and defense industry association BDSV, whose members include all of Germany's biggest heavy military equipment suppliers, including Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, which makes the Leopard 2 tank.Atzpodien has argued that the bureaucratic colossus that is the military's procurement system suffers from a ""perfectionism"" in its regulations that often means the troops don't actually get what they need — citing the example of the German tank crews who don't have the same radio equipment their international partners do, even though these have been specifically requested.That particular wrinkle has since been ironed out. ""I have to give the procurement process credit for the fact that in December 2022 a procurement decision was made for precisely this equipment — even with a German company — which we of course welcome,"" he told DW.This is a new tone. As recently as December, Atzpodien was getting into public rows with senior government figures who alleged that the arms industry should be working harder to increase capacity. Now, the two sides appear to be on the same page: ""We are very confident that the orders that were essentially held up by budgetary bureaucratic processes will now get underway on an appropriate scale,"" he said.Nevertheless, Rafael Loss says that the complexities of procurement remains an issue that defies easy fixes: ""It's a very complex ecosystem between parliament as the budget holder, the defense ministry, procurement agencies, and the armed forces.""After the Cold War, he said, the Bundeswehr settled into a culture in which speed was not a priority. ""There was an enormous risk aversion to doing anything wrong and spending maybe a little bit too much money on things to get them through the procurement pipeline faster,"" he said.On top of that, Loss thinks the regional interests of Bundestag members often played a part in how procurement decisions were made — with Bavarian politicians pushing for Bavarian-based aviation companies to win contracts, for example. ""This leads to budget processes being less oriented towards military needs,"" said Loss. ""I suppose in the US they would call this pork-barrel politics.""In other words, Scholz's famous ""turning of the times"" involves turning round the colossal ocean tanker that is the German military, its culture, and its bureaucracy. Even one year isn't enough to do that.Edited by: Rina Goldenberg",2023/02/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824199,New Frontex boss vows to protect human rights,"When Hans Leijtens, the new executive director of Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency takes office on March 1, restoring trust in the agency and ensuring it safeguards human rights will be two of the main challenges he has to address.The EU's border agency is tasked with the job of planning and coordinating interception operations, as well as carrying out search and rescue missions at sea along the EU's external borders. But its credibility has suffered over the past year. There have been reports accusing it of ignoring — and in some cases even partaking in — human rights violations at the EU's borders.""We are going to restore trust by being very transparent about what we are doing and how we are doing it,"" Leijtens, who was still commander of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee and governor of The Hague at the time, told a press conference in Brussels in January.After congratulating Leijtens on his new role at the press conference, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson acknowledged that it had been a difficult time for the agency but insisted that ""Frontex is well-equipped to actually support EU member states.""While restoring trust in Frontex will be a key priority for Leijtens, he has said that he is keen on ensuring the agency safeguards the fundamental rights of asylum-seekers.In April last year, a joint investigationby Lighthouse Reports, the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, the Swiss media outlets SRF Rundschau and Republik, and the French daily newspaper Le Monde revealed that Frontex had been involved in the illegal pushbacks of asylum-seekers — which involves putting people in life rafts and leaving them adrift  in the Aegean Sea — between March 2020 and September 2021.Subsequently, the EU's anti-corruption watchdog OLAF investigated these claims and concluded that some employees from Frontex had indeed been involved in ""covering up the pushback of migrants from Greece and Turkey.""The accusations led to the resignation of former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri in April last year. However, the agency's interim chief Aija Kalnaja — who is in charge until Leijtens takes over — is also being investigated by OLAF. A spokesperson for the watchdog said that she was a ""person of concern"" in December last year.""Pushbacks by Frontex officers are not legal. They are forbidden,"" Leijtens told reporters in Brussels in January, adding that from this year onwards the agency's fundamental principles would include ""transparency and accountability.""""We are going to do our jobs in accordance with the law and in accordance with what member states want. There should be absolutely nothing to hide,"" he insisted.Meanwhile, a reportby the US-based nonprofit Human Rights Watch in December 2022 claimed that Frontex was also ""complicit in the abuse of migrants in Libya, by collaborating with Libyan coastguards in the Mediterranean Sea.""Frontex Deputy Executive Director Uku Sarekanno denied this. ""Frontex is not in charge of SAR (search and rescue) operations,"" he told DW. ""We only share information with national coordination centers if our aerial asset in the central Mediterranean area detects a vessel in distress and in need of help. In line with international law we inform all coordination centers in the vicinity. It is up to national coordination centers to coordinate SAR operations at sea.""""It is Frontex's responsibility to ensure that our officers within our operations follow the rules, respect fundamental rights, as well the principle of non-refoulement. This also involves active reporting and investigation of serious incidents within the operational area,"" he added.Rights groups in various EU member states have called on Frontex to cease its operations because, they argue, its presence has not stopped national border guards from mistreating asylum-seekers.""I was brutally beaten by guards in Croatia for trying to enter the EU,"" a displaced woman from Suleimani in Iraq, who is currently in an unofficial camp in Dunkirk, told DW.""I had my two young daughters with me when this happened. I need protection because I worked as a journalist in my country and have been targetted for my work. But I didn't expect my human rights to be disregarded in this manner. Frontex has a presence in the region, I wished they helped,"" she added.Listening to her story, another displaced man from Iran at the camp in Dunkirk, shared a similar story about his experience with border guards in Croatia. ""I saw Frontex in the region and expected them to intervene. But in the end, it feels like border management comes down to politics and not human rights,"" he told DW.In 2021, Frontex did temporarily suspend its operations in Hungary after a European Court of Justice ruling stated that the country's treatment of asylum-seekers was illegal.And a recent New York Times report revealed that Frontex's fundamental rights officer had said last year that the agency should stop operating in Greece because of serial abuses by Greek border guards.But the agency has not suspended its operations in Greece so far.Hope Barker, a senior policy analyst for the Border Violence Monitoring Network told DW that there was a need for Frontex to act.""It's been nearly three years that Frontex has been present in the region and all we've seen is a worsening of pushbacks and mistreatment of asylum-seekers. So clearly Frontex is not contributing to fixing that problem. They need to trigger Article 46 of the Frontex Regulation and withdraw,"" she said.That article requires the agency's chief to terminate or not launch any new operations in an EU country where investigations and reports have shown that the fundamental right of asylum-seekers are being violated.Barker added that Frontex also needs to overhaul its system for NGOs and individuals to make official complaints about national border guards. ""There have been steps to do so but it needs to be more transparent,"" she added.For Frontex's Sarekanno, it is not the agency's job to criticize the operations of EU nations' border guards.""So far, our presence has been appreciated in EU member states. It is not for the agency to investigate member states activities outside of our operations. There are other institutions to ensure control and supervision over EU nations' authorities at both the national and EU level,"" he told DW.""It would be helpful if the EU would progress with the legal framework and political toolbox addressing the situations where member nations are facing instrumentalization of migration,"" he added.Meanwhile, with EU leaders agreeing on stricter rules to curb illegal migration, Leijtens's new task will also involve the coordination of returning asylum-seekers who enter illegally to their home countries.The agency aims to spend €95.9 million (ca. $102 million) in 2023 (€93 million without informational activities) and €128 million in 2024 to facilitate such deportations.""I know that returning asylum-seekers itself is not a sustainable solution but it is one of the tools of the EU's migration package,"" Sarekanno told DW.""When it comes to returns there are a lot of layers which have to be considered like the current state of global security and the climate and in some countries, returning people who have fled due to security or climate reasons cannot be considered at all. So it is important to collaborate with third countries when managing returns,"" he added.With the agency's new chief poised to make changes, Dutch politician Tineke Strik, who is one of the EU lawmakers who set up the Frontex Scrutiny Working Group in the European Parliament, will be monitoring his work keenly.""Frontex as an agency is still in crisis and I think initially, we neglected our role in the European Parliament in scrutinizing their actions. But after going over all the reports from last year, we are now stepping up our role and working on drafting a resolution in the coming weeks, to toughen our scrutiny,"" she told DW.""We are now taking stock of monitoring how Frontex plans to implement our recommendations on safeguarding human rights and will also monitor whether they will actually be transparent in their actions at EU borders,"" she said.While Strik is one of Frontex's most prominent critics who has openly criticized countries such as Greece, Hungary and Croatia for denying people in need access to the European asylum system, she has also been pushing EU leaders to protect asylum seekers' rights.""With the EU focussing on cooperating with other countries to manage migration and Frontex's role in this process increasing, our scrutiny group will have more questions for the agency like how they plan to safeguard the rights or people while in transit to their  countries of origin, and also question whether its patrols at sea are in line with EU law,"" she said.""It's very important for the EU and Frontex to take human rights more seriously in order to ensure that no more violent pushbacks take place on EU borders.""Edited by: Andreas Illmer",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824200,France: Soccer chief Noel Le Graet quits amid scandals,"Veteran French Football Federation (FFF) president Noel Le Graetofficially resigned on Tuesday, following a Sports Ministry audit that ""highlighted the inappropriate behavior of Mr. Le Graet towards women"" and a history of psychological harassment.""Considering his conduct towards women, his public comments and the governance failings of the FFF, Mr. Le Graet no longer has the necessary legitimacy to run and represent French football,"" the report said.Le Graet had already stepped aside temporarily in January pending the results of the report, published two weeks ago. Although he has always disputed the allegations, he said he would resign if the report found that he should.However, Le Graet also gave an interview to France's biggest sports daily, L'Equipe, after his resignation saying he had ""never harrassed anyone, morally or sexually,"" and that his lawyers would contest the ministry's report via all available legal channels.Interim President Philippe Diallo will stay on in his stead pending a formal vote in June.Before resigning, the 81-year-old Le Graet had led the FFF for more than a decade. His tenure, which had been due to last until 2024, coincided with a revival of the men's national team that saw them win the 2018 World Cup and advance to the final of the 2022 tournament.However, he has also been accused of serial sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior.Le Graet also caused a stir when he told French radio last month that if legendary France player and former Real Madrid trainer Zinedine Zidane expressed interest in coaching the national team, he ""wouldn't even take his call."" He later apologized for the ""clumsy"" comments.The interview occured right after national team coach Didier Deschamps had his contract extended until 2026.In response to the Sports Ministry audit of what they called Le Graet's ""behavior excesses,"" the FFF stood behind their longtime leader.""The FFF recognizes the remarkable sporting and economic performance of Noel Le Graet,"" the federation said in a statement, before criticizing the ministry report.""The report does not mention any systematic failing. The FFF nevertheless notes that the report is based less on objective facts than on comments that have sometimes led to exaggerated bad-mouthing of the body,"" the statement read.His administration has also seen a period of prolonged strife in the women's national team, with several top players refusing to play in this year's World Cup in Corinne Diacre remains coach.Le Graet is expected to continue on in his leading role at FIFA's Paris office.es/msh (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824201,"As G20 meets in India, is Global South bullied by West?","Russia will have a seat at the table when the foreign ministers of the G20 come together in New Delhi this week. After all, the country has one of the world's major economies — one that is also highly relevant to the global economic system — the measure by which the G20 group defines itself.Moreover, according to a recent survey, emerging powers such as India and Turkey still view Russia as a partner, despite the war of aggression that the Kremlin is waging on Ukraine.For India, which holds the current G20 presidency, it will be a challenge to make the meeting a success. Ashok Malik, a former adviser to the Indian foreign ministry and now country head of The Asia Group —  a business advisory firm — told DW that India will nevertheless strive to produce a joint statement signed by all the participants. Malik said New Delhi intends to put emphasis ""on the inequalities and developmental challenges"" that many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America face today.The West's focus on the ""all-consuming war"" in Ukraine, however, has taken a lot of international attention away the from those challenges. Malik emphasized the fact that such challenges are ""exacerbated by the ongoing fertilizer, food and energy crises caused by both the pandemic and the war.""Malik described India as a country with ""a deep intersection with the West in terms of strategic goals and values."" But, he said, ""it also has deep roots in the Global South. So what India has tried to do is to be a bridge between the G20 members of the developed world, as it were, and the Global South.""Malik said he expects that to be the message New Delhi will take into the G20 and to the foreign ministers' meeting.India has so far refrained from criticizing the Kremlin directly on Ukraine, defying appeals by the West to take a firm stand. It was one of 32 countries that abstained from a recent UN General Assembly resolution vote calling for a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.However, during a visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that India ""is willing to join any peace talks to solve this crisis.""Russia and India share a trusted relationship that has lasted decades since it was established in the days of the Cold War. ""Russia was a friend in India's poorer years in the 1950s and 1960s, when it gave us access to technology that in some cases the West denied us,"" Malik told DW.He said he would not characterize Indian society as anti-Western or pro-Russian due to continuously strengthening ties with the US and Europe. But he made clear that ""Russia will never entirely vanish from India's foreign policy calculus.""It is a sentiment many developing countries apparently share. ""I think the issue here is that there are different perceptions of why the war happened,"" Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), told DW. ""For the South African government, this is a proxy war.""Shortly after the Russian invasion, South Africa urged the Kremlin to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine. Since then, however, the tone has changed. In January, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Pretoria as part of an African tour.During the visit both countries vowed to strengthen bilateral ties and announced joint naval drills with China. South African officials have repeatedly said they do not condone the Russian invasion but will not be forced into choosing sides.""South Africa has long prided itself in having what it calls an independent foreign policy,"" Sidiropoulos told DW.The country is also a member of the BRICS bloc of leading emerging economies. Founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRICs represent an alternative to the G7 bloc of leading industrial economies.Still, Sidiropoulos said she thinks this is just a part of the explanation.The war in Ukraine ""acted as a catalyst for almost all of the other issues that South Africa and other countries in the South have been upset with Europe and the US over,"" Sidiropoulos said.One reason they won't condemn Russia, she explained, is because don't like ""the way the US throws its weight around.""Europe's colonial past is a factor, too, as Sidiropoulos pointed out. The same goes for NATO's highly controversial 2011 intervention in Libya. Thus, Russia has been able to capitalize on anti-imperialist sentiments and popular anti-Western resentment.Many African nations do not see the war in Ukraine as a global security crisis, Sidiropoulos said. Rather, they see it as a European problem ""with global consequences.""They feel Ukraine's Western allies are trying to hijack the G20 forum at the expense of crucial issues such as climate action or tackling development on the continent. Their response therefore is: ""We will make our own decisions. Don't bully us,"" Sidiropoulos said.The fact remains: The West is struggling to win hearts and minds in the so-called Global South – despite Russian atrocities committed in Ukraine.According to a new global survey published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), the Western alliance remains united in its support for Ukraine, but the gulf between their perspective and other powers in the world has grown wider.""It's important to understand the different perceptions of the different powers that are going to be around the table at the G20, and to treat them as the independent sovereign actors that they are,"" senior ECFR policy fellow Susi Dennison told DW. She spoke in favor of a pragmatic approach ""that needs to be part of a new kind of diplomacy on the global stage.""Europe and the US must not allow Russia to frame the war in Ukraine as a West versus the rest of the world conflict, Dennison said. A conflict in which ""the West is supporting Ukraine to preserve an international order that works in the West's favor, and that Russia is the vanguard breaking it down on behalf of the rest,"" Dennison added.She pointed out that ""this would make delivery on global goods such as climate action or shoring up the supply chains very difficult for the West.""As the rules of the post-Cold war order appear to be getting a rewrite, some are concerned about falling into a Cold War 2.0 said Elizabeth Sidiropoulos of the South African Institute for International Affairs.But many, she added, see the current crisis as an opportunity rather than a risk: India and South Africa have been calling ""for reforms of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions for many years. With the West itself being tested or even weakened, the current crisis could create a push for change.""Edited by: Jon Shelton",2023/02/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824202,Denmark abolishes public holiday to boost defense spending,"People in Denmark will no longer get a long weekend off for ""Great Prayer Day"" late in the spring starting next year, after lawmakers passed a bill on Tuesday scrapping it as a public holiday.The move comes as Denmark's newly-formed government seeks to implement reforms aimed at improving the country's welfare model, and as it tries to reach its NATO defense spending targets.The controversial bill passed on Tuesday with 95 votes in favor in Denmark's 179-seat parliament following hours of debate.""Great Prayer Day"" will stop being a public holiday in 2024. Shops and other businesses as well as public institutions will remain open.The Danish government argues the move will add around 3 billion Danish kroner (€403 million; $427 million) to public coffers, reported public broadcaster DR. The money would be generated by people working an additional 7.4 hours and paying taxes on their income.The goal is to use the money to raise the country's defense spending to bring it in line with NATO's target of 2% of GDP.The Danish government has also moved up the timeline in reaching the goal, pushing to reach the target by 2030 instead of 2033 — especially in light of Russia's war on Ukraine.""I don't think it's a problem to have to work an extra day,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in January when presenting the bill. ""We are facing enormous expenditures for defense and security, health care, psychiatry and the green transition.""Unions, church leaders and opposition lawmakers pushed back against the move. Some economists have also questioned the government's plans.Earlier this month, 50,000 protesters gathered outside parliament in Copenhagen to oppose axing the public holiday.""Great Prayer Day"" is a Christian religious holiday that has been observed since the 17th century in Denmark.The holiday falls on the fourth Friday after Easter and was initially created to consolidate several minor Christian holidays.People in Denmark continue to mark the holiday by eating a traditional bread on the day that was purchased a day prior, as bakeries are closed.Prior to Tuesday's vote, Denmark observed 10 national holidays — some of which fall on the weekend rather than in the week. The figure is on-par with the number of public holidays observed by Sweden and Norway.Germany observes nine public holidays nationally, but depending on the state, there can be up to 13 public holidays that are observed.rs/msh (Reuters, dpa)",2023/02/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824222,U.S. House panel on China cites 'existential struggle' at first hearing,"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A new U.S. congressional select committee on competition with China held its first hearing with a focus on human rights on Tuesday, amid tense bilateral ties weeks after a suspected spy balloon flying over North America was shot down.""This is not a polite tennis match. This is an existential struggle over what life will look like in the 21st century — and the most fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said as he opened the hearing.The committee's leaders saw the hearing, the first of what is expected to be many over the next two years asRepublicans hold control of the House, as part of an effort to convince Americans why they should care about competing with China, and to ""selectively decouple"" the U.S. and Chinese economies.""Over the last three decades, both Democrats and Republicans underestimated the CCP, and assumed that trade and investment would inevitably lead to democracy and greater security in the Indo-Pacific. ... Instead the opposite happened,"" said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the select committee, in his opening remarks.Chinese dissidents attended the hearing. In the last few days, Gallagher and other committee members attended several events to draw attention to human rights concerns, including a rally on Saturday outside what U.S. officials call an illegal Chinese Communist Party ""police station"" in New York.Gallagher sent a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week seeking information about such alleged police outposts.China denies operating ""police stations"" on U.S. soil.FOUR WITNESSESTuesday's hearing had four witnesses, including H.R. McMaster, a retired Army lieutenant general who was former Republican President Donald Trump's national security adviser, and Matt Pottinger, a long-time China hawk who was deputy national security adviser to Trump.In his prepared remarks, Pottinger said the United States had no excuse for being ""fooled"" about Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ""deep hostility toward the democratic West and the liberal international order.""He also said the committee must protect the rights of Chinese Americans by ""standing up against bigotry and discrimination here at home.""""Protect, also, Chinese nationals studying and working in the United States so they can enjoy the freedoms that so starkly distinguish the American way of life from the increasingly oppressive atmosphere in China today,"" Pottinger said.Although the committee is bipartisan, some Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns that it could fuel anti-Asian sentiment within the United States. Krishnamoorthi referred to such concerns, and the need for bipartisanship, in his remarks.Also testifying were Tong Yi, secretary to a prominent Chinese dissident who was jailed in China for more than two years, and Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.A desire for a hard line in dealings with Beijing is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, with both Republicans and President Joe Biden's Democrats calling for increased efforts to counteract China's global influence.U.S.-China tensions have been especially high of late, over China's increasingly aggressive military posture toward Taiwan, talk that China may be supporting Russia's war against Ukraine, and the U.S.'s shooting down on Feb. 4 a Chinese balloon suspected of spying over U.S. territory.Beijing has denied that the balloon was a government spy vessel.House Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy had promised he would create a select committee focused on China after Republicans took control of the chamber in January.The select committee has 13 Republican and 11 Democratic members. It will not write legislation, but will draw attention to competition between the United States and China on a range of fronts and make recommendations for legislation.",2023/03/01,342,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824242,"2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report Casts New Light on Shifting Front Lines, Threat Actor Behavior","Overall malware up 2%, with surges in IoT malware (+87%) and cryptojacking (+43%)         Ransomware attacks dipped 25% globally, but 2022 still second-highest year on record for global ransomware attempts (493.3 million)         Education (+157%), finance (+86%) and retail (+50%) verticals hit hardest by malware         Ukraine saw record levels of malware (25.6 million) and ransomware (7.1 million)         In APAC, malware climbs (+38%), with cryptojacking spiking (+129%) and IoT Attacks up (+73%)         SonicWall discovered 465,501 'never-before-seen' malware variants in 2022         Intrusion attempts against Log4j vulnerabilities eclipsed 1 billion      SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 1 March 2023 - SonicWall, publisher of the world's most quoted ransomware data and trusted cyberattack intelligence, today released the 2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report. The bi-annual report details an increasingly diversified cyberattack landscape amid shifting threat actor strategies. SonicWall recorded the second-highest year on record for global ransomware attempts, as well as an 87% increase in Internet of Things (IoT) malware and a record number of cryptojacking attacks (139.3 million) in 2022.   ""The past year reinforced the need for cybersecurity in every industry and every facet of business, as threat actors targeted anything and everything, from education to retail to finance,"" said  SonicWall President and CEO Bob VanKirk. ""While organizations face an increasing number of real-world obstacles with macroeconomic pressures and continued geopolitical strife, threat actors are shifting attack strategies at an alarming rate.""   Threat Actors Shift Strategies, Opt for Covert Cyberattack Methods   Global malware volume increased 2% year-over-year, but it was jumps in IoT malware (+87%) and cryptojacking (+43%) that offset the decline of overall global ransomware volume (-21%), signifying a strategic shift. Threat actors have embraced slower and more stealthy approaches to achieve financially-motivated cyberattacks.   ""Cyberattacks are an ever-present danger for companies of all sizes, putting their operations and reputation on the line,"" said  SonicWall Threat Detection and Response Strategist Immanuel Chavoya. ""It is crucial for organizations to understand attackers' tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and commit to threat-informed cybersecurity strategies to defend and recover successfully from business-disrupting events. This includes stopping sophisticated ransomware attacks as well as defending emerging threat vectors, including IoT and cryptojacking.""   In addition to cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated and covert, threat actors are showing clear preferences for certain techniques, with notable shifts toward weak IoT devices, cryptojacking and potentially soft targets like schools and hospitals.   Prominent ransomware attacks impacted enterprises, governments, airlines, hospitals, hotels and even individuals causing widespread system downtime, economic loss and reputational damage. Following global trends, several industries faced large year-over-year increases of ransomware volume, including education (+275%), finance (+41%) and healthcare (+8%).   ""Organizations today face an evolving threat landscape where threat actors are finding new and creative ways to stay ahead of the enterprise,"" said Debasish Mukherjee, Vice President, Regional Sales, Asia Pacific Japan at SonicWall. ""Cyber risks and their impacts on organizations globally continue to dominate headlines and boardrooms. The 2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report helps elevate us as a credible source and strengthens our ability to provide sound security measures to our customers.""   Diverse Attacks Offset Global Ransomware Decline   Cybercriminals are using increasingly advanced tools and tactics to exploit and extort victims, with state-sponsored activity growing as a concern. While ransomware continues to be a threat, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers expect more state-sponsored activity targeting a broader set of victims in 2023, including SMBs and enterprises.   The 2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report provides insight on a range of cyber threats, including:     Malware – Total volume was up 2% in 2022 after three straight years of decline — just as SonicWall predicted in the 2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report. Following that trend, Europe as a whole saw increased levels of malware (+10%) as did Ukraine, which had a record 25.6 million attempts, suggesting malware was used heavily in regions impacted by geopolitical strife. In APAC, the cyber landscape continues to remain gloomy with all tracked metrics rising in severity, including a surge in malware (+38%). Interestingly, malware was down year-over-year in key countries like the U.S. (-9%), U.K. (-13%) and Germany (-28%).       Ransomware – Although overall ransomware numbers saw a 25% decline globally, the total volume in 2022 was higher than 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. In particular, total ransomware in Q4 (154.9 million) was the highest since Q3 2021.       IoT Malware – Global volume rose 87% in 2022, totaling 112 million hits by year's end. With no corresponding slowdown in the proliferation of connected devices, bad actors are likely probing soft targets to leverage as potential attack vectors into larger organizations.       Apache Log4j – Intrusion attempts against the industry's Apache Log4j 'Log4Shell' vulnerability eclipsed 1 billion in 2022. The vulnerability was first discovered in December 2021 and has been actively exploited since.       Cryptojacking – Use of cryptojacking as a 'low and slow' approach continued to surge, rising 43% globally, which is the most SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers have recorded in a single year. In APAC, cryptojacking continues to see an accelerated reconfiguring of the international cyber frontlines with a spike of 129%. The retail and financial industry felt the sting of cryptojacking attacks, seeing 2810% and 352% increases, respectively, year-over-year.      ""Cyberattacks of all varieties continue to hinder organizations worldwide,"" said Logically Chief Operating Officer Keith Johnson. ""SonicWall's annual intelligence report gives us a deeper understanding of the current threat landscape and helps breakdown why cyberattacks continue to be successful, as well as the drivers and trends behind them. By making this report available to partners, SonicWall helps elevate us as trusted advisors and strengthens our ability to provide sound security measures to our customers.""   Patented RTDMI Discovered more than 465,000 'Never-Before-Seen' Malware Variants in 2022   SonicWall's patented Real-Time Deep Memory InspectionTM (RTDMITM) technology identified a total of 465,501 never-before-seen malware variants in 2022, a 5% year-over-year increase and an average of 1,279 per day. Dating to 2019, this is the fourth straight year RTDMI increased its total of malware discoveries.

However, before he could continue speaking, several protesters ran toward the podium shouting ""murderer"" and carrying white banners that read ""kneel down and apologize.""(CNA photo)The first of the protestors was immediately shoved to the ground by security personnel. Others were intercepted and pulled away by security staff.Chiang halted his speech and looked over his shoulder, before eventually finishing his remarks. After the protesters were wrestled away from the podium, they moved to the surrounding area and continued to hold up the white banners and continually shouted ""Murderer, kneel down and apologize!""(CNA photo)The male and female protestors are a group of college students who are engaged in social movements, reported EBC News. The Facebook page called ""The Powerless"" posted a statement Tuesday afternoon addressed to Chiang which read: ""Since you want to become a descendant of the Chiang family, you have a greater responsibility to reflect on, review, and restore the damage caused by the past dictatorship. Don't become the strongest and most vital symbol of authoritarianism.""(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)(CNA photo)BREAKING Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an was just heckled by a large group of protestors at the 228 memorial event in the capital.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824268,Southern and central Taiwan slammed with unhealthy air quality,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has set a “red light” air quality warning for some areas in south-central Taiwan, indicating “unhealthy” air quality.The EPA said today (March 1) that the unhealthy air conditions observed in Yunlin, Chiayi, Qiaotou, and Tainan areas may cause members of the general public to experience adverse health effects, while those with existing health conditions may experience serious effects. In the areas of Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Datong, and Sanchong, only those with existing health conditions are likely to experience adverse effects.The EPA further recommended that those in the affected areas avoid outdoor activities if possible.The Director-General of the Central Weather Bureau Cheng Ming-dean (鄭明典) said the air pollution originated from outside of Taiwan, and that the relatively light winds in the area are preventing the polluted air from dispersing. He also said that a meteorological phenomenon known as temperature inversion, where warmer air floats above colder air, is causing the polluted air to be trapped in the affected areas.While Cheng said more polluted air is expected tonight, the general forecast for the whole of Taiwan’s air quality is forecasted to improve over the next three days. By Saturday (March 4), the EPA forecasts all areas in Taiwan will experience either moderate or healthy air quality.",2023/03/01,967,Environment

Jeremy Lin led his team with 23 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, while Joseph Lin contributed 10 points, four rebounds, and 10 assists.Jeremy Lin (right) drives past Quincy Davis. (CNA photo)The Steelers ended up losing to the Kings 101 to 88. After the game, the two brothers took to center court and Jeremy reflected on how they were underestimated throughout their childhood and became emotional as he praised his brother as one of the top players in the league over the past three years.When asked to comment further during a post-game press conference, Jeremy said that when Joseph became a professional player, he shied away from speaking up for himself, and Jeremy said it angered him to think about the ways the media had diminished his brother's standing.Joseph Lin (left) guards Jeremy Lin. (CNA photo)Jeremy said that in his first season, his brother was deemed to be too thin and too short to be a professional player, but yet that same year he was selected to the All-Star Game. He said Joseph led the league in assists in his first and second year.""Despite always being understated, he won three championships and has the highest plus-minus value in the league on two different teams for three years,"" said Jeremy. ""I see him being criticized and underestimated by fans and reporters. Do you know how difficult it is to have the highest plus-minus value every year?""Jeremy Lin takes jumper.

He added that ""Only when you understand basketball can you understand the help and influence he brings.”The former NBA player said Joseph spends hours watching film to constantly improve his game, and that he was frustrated to see the public criticize his brother. Jeremy said his brother often does not speak up for himself and always puts his teammates ahead of himself, before pausing and apologizing for ""saying too much.""Joseph Lin celebrates after hitting a three.

Violators risk a fine between NT$50,000 and NT$250,000, pursuant to the Animal Protection Act (動物保護法).Those who already have such dogs are required to have them neutered or spayed and registered before they can be allowed to keep them. It is also mandatory to report the death of the canines as well as a change in ownership or location.As of Tuesday, 33 pit pulls in New Taipei and 28 in Taitung had not been neutered or spayed, according to CNA. Meanwhile, a New Taipei resident surnamed Hsieh (謝) was slapped with a NT$75,000 fine for a repeat offense last month for not muzzling their pit bull, which was kept outside and previously attacked a neighbor's dog.Taiwan currently lists six dog breeds as dangerous, including the Pit Bull Terrier (American Pit Bull Terrier or American Pit Bull, and American Staffordshire Terrier), Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, Neapolitan Mastiff, Fila Brasileiro, and Mastiff (Tibetan Mastiff, Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, and Dogue de Bordeaux).Dogs from these six breeds should be muzzled, leashed with a strap no more than 1.5 meters long, and accompanied by adults when appearing in public places, per the Council of Agriculture.",2023/03/01,767,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824328,Asian stocks jump as strong China data revives reopening optimism,"Asian stocks rebounded from a two-month low on Wednesday as data showing China's manufacturing activity in February expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade cheered investors, offsetting fears over rising interest rates.China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) stood at 52.6 last month against 50.1 in January, based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics, smashing expectations as production zoomed after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions late last year.China's non-manufacturing activity similarly grew at a faster pace in February, while data from the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI also pointed to a rise in factory activity in February for the first time in seven months.That sent MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS surging more than 1% to 516.84, after having bottomed at 509.40 - its lowest since early January - earlier in the session.Chinese stocks also received a boost, with China's blue-chip CSI 300 Index .CSI300 jumping more than 1%, while the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC was last about 0.6% higher.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI climbed 2.67%, while the Hang Seng Tech Index .HSTECH was up 4%. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index .HSMPI surged 3.5%.""The China February PMI data this time has assumed even greater importance due to the usual lack of January/February hard data until later this month,"" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.""The China February official PMIs and Caixin manufacturing PMI all surprised strongly to the upside, and notably higher than the previous January figures.""Japan's Nikkei .N225 steadied at 27,446.91.In currency markets, the dollar unwound earlier gains as some risk-on sentiment took charge, with the euro EUR=EBS and sterling GBP=D3 rising 0.06% and 0.04%, respectively. FRX/The Aussie AUD=D3, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, edged 0.1% higher to $0.6735, bouncing from a two-month low of $0.6695 earlier in the session.Softer-than-expected growth and inflation data in Australia sent the Aussie sliding in early Asia trade.The local stockmarket .AXJO, however, came off recent lows. It was last 0.16% higher.The Chinese onshore yuan CNY=CFXS rose marginally to 6.9302 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart CNH=D3 gained a larger 0.2% to 6.9400 per dollar.RATES RISKThe U.S. dollar has been on a tear in recent weeks and gained on most majors through February, as investors ramped up their expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to take interest rates higher to tame still-sticky inflation.Stocks had handed back January gains in February, while bonds slid on renewed worries about rising rates.As the final month of the first 2023 quarter starts, traders are looking to the next flush of economic indicators to gauge the outlook. U.S. ISM PMI figures are due later in the day.""The upcoming data cycle and anticipated forecast revisions by central banks, which will be presented over the next 2-3 weeks, will be crucial in forming the next leg of financial market trading,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.The mixed tone of data in the last few days seems to have lots of assets pausing at major chart levels.Hotter-than-expected inflation readings in Europe overnight drove bond selling, before weaker-than-expected U.S. confidence figures offered perhaps a glimmer of hope that rate hikes are biting and are perhaps within striking distance of peaking.Two-year Treasury yields US2YT=RR, a guide to short-term U.S. rate expectations, are close to four-month highs, but at 4.8345%, are below a November peak of 4.8830%. Benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR stood at 3.9415% in Asia.Commodities edged slightly higher as China demand hopes and signs of a steady recovery balance global growth concerns, with Brent crude LCOc1 last 0.5% higher at $83.86 a barrel.Gains in grains were capped as rains in parts of the U.S. winter wheat belt and optimism over a Russia-Ukraine export deal drove investors to close out long positions. GRA/Geopolitics is also keeping investors on edge. U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Kyiv and Russian President Vladimir Putin's abandonment of the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the U.S. signaled a hardening of positions.China, which signalled support for Russia by sending its top diplomat to Moscow last week, has issued a call for peace, though it has been met with scepticism and Washington has said in recent days it worries that China could send arms to Russia.""Should Beijing send Russia arms, it risks a rapid geopolitical breaking of the world economy,"" said Rabobank's research head, Jan Lambregts. ""Markets have not even begun to contemplate what this might mean.""",2023/03/01,112,World

Ltd., STP&I Public Company Limited and SMP Group. Customary CPs are expected to be satisfied shortly. Monsoon Wind will construct, own, and operate a 600MW wind power plant and its dedicated 500kV transmission line in the Sekong and Attapeu provinces located in southeastern provinces of the Lao PDR. Monsoon Wind is the first wind power project in Lao PDR and the first cross-border project in Southeast Asia. Under the 25-year power purchase agreement, the electricity generated will be sold to Vietnam Electricity (EVN) through the Project Company's 500kV transmission line.            The project will be co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as lead arranger, Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA), the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (Thai EXIM), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC), Kasikornbank, and Siam Commercial Bank.   Mr. Peck Khamkanist, CEO of IES, said, ""As a pioneer of sustainable solutions, we are keen to be a part of the global fight against climate change by embarking on a green energy journey starting from our home region. Laos possesses natural resources for renewable energy generation. This project also shows the carbon credentials of Lao PDR. We are part of the journey to uplift the well-being and happiness of the local communities in which we operate.""   Monsoon Wind is one of the key projects in the Vietnamese government's electricity development plan. The project will contribute to the strengthening of connectivity in the ASEAN region through the provision of cross-border electricity sales. The Lao government will benefit from the project in various ways such as receiving revenue in foreign currency from royalty fees and other sources based on the Concession Agreement. The project will also promote local employment during both the construction and operation periods. Furthermore, the sponsor's community and ethnic group development program will uplift people's livelihoods by targeting measures in the health, education, and economy sectors.   Mr. Nat Hutanuwatr, MD of Monsoon Wind, said ""Under the 25-year Power Purchase Agreement of Vietnam Electricity and the Concession Agreement with the Government of Laos PDR, the 600MW Monsoon Wind Power will be the largest wind farm and the first of its kind to trade wind power across the border in the region. Monsoon Wind Power Company is very proud to represent all sponsors, to have a close collaboration with the lender group, and be able to execute the extra-ordinary non-recourse financing documents in such a short period of time.""   IES plans to expand an additional 1,000MW nearby the existing Monsoon Wind's site. The project, including the expansion, has potential to offset over 50 million tons of carbon dioxide throughout its lifetime. Wind energy projects will diversify Lao PDR's main source of renewable energy generation, hydropower, which is mainly generated during the wet season. By building and integrating renewable sources with complementary generation profiles, coupled with regional connectivity network, the combination can supply stable, clean, and affordable electricity to ASEAN nations throughout the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824362,South Taiwan schools remove symbols of authoritarian past,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — To discourage idolization of Taiwan’s past authoritarian leader and government, Tainan’s schools will no longer feature buildings named after, or in honor of, Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石).According to a statement from the Tainan City Government released on Sunday (26. Feb), the district's schools will no longer feature buildings named “Zhong Zheng” (中正), an alternate name for Chiang Kai-shek, and “Jie Shou” (介壽), a term used to praise Chiang, and other names that reference authoritarian figures from Taiwan’s past. The Tainan Bureau of Education said these symbols have no place in schools, as they contradict the cultivation of students’ freedom, sense of democracy, and independent thinking.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said that the city had recently completed an inventory of public places and features that displayed authoritarian symbols, and that steps were being taken to gradually replace them. The city government has also published information about the history of various sites named after Chiang, and highlighted areas throughout Tainan where human rights abuses took place.According to a 2017 report, there were 37 localities, 52 schools, and 335 roads throughout Taiwan with names that reference Chiang Kai-shek. This is not counting the ubiquitous Zhong-zheng or Jie-shou pavilions, halls, libraries, and other public places and institutions throughout Taiwan.The decision to remove the authoritarian references from schools came shortly before the annual 228 Memorial Day. The memorial day commemorates the up to 28,000 Taiwanese who died at the hands of the Kuomintang in the 228 Massacre, and the subsequent 38-year period (The White Terror) of human rights abuses, arbitrary detentions, and executions of political dissidents under martial law in Taiwan that followed.",2023/03/01,1510,Society

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 1 March 2023 - Citi announced today that it has entered a multi-year agreement with CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) to purchase up to 106,400,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity generated from local renewable energy sources over a six-year period until 2027. The purchase makes Citi the first bank in Hong Kong to be powering its entire operations using renewable energy locally-sourced from CLP Power, and will result in a reduction of 41,496 tonnes of CO2 emissions.   Citi has long been partnering with CLP Power on numerous environmental sustainability initiatives in Hong Kong. It is one of the largest buyers of CLP Renewable Energy Certificates and a major corporate participant of CLP Power's energy efficiency programs to drive carbon footprint reduction.   In 2021, Citi installed an on-site renewable energy system consisting of 360 solar panels on the rooftop of Citi Tower in Kowloon East. The system is connected to CLP Power's electricity grid.   'As a longstanding corporate citizen of Hong Kong, we have a commitment and responsibility to create a positive impact in the community where we live and work. This includes our ongoing effort to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations,"" said Aveline San, CEO of Citi Hong Kong and Macau.   ""Having achieved our global goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy in 2020, we are proud to be taking our environmental sustainability commitment to the next level by sourcing local renewable energy through our partnership with CLP Power. We look forward to further deepening our collaboration with CLP Power on driving a more sustainable future through innovative solutions and initiatives,"" she added.   ""The 2050 carbon neutrality target is an important milestone for Hong Kong,"" CLP Power Managing Director T K Chiang said. 'We see more businesses exploring ways to manage energy demand to deliver their decarbonization agenda. Purchasing CLP Renewable Energy Certificates is one of the effective ways for businesses to offset their carbon emissions, and we are delighted that there has been an upward trend in larger purchases of Renewable Energy Certificates in recent years.'   'All along, CLP Power has been collaborating with Citi, and we are committed to supporting Citi on its journey to carbon neutrality. We look forward to providing more sustainable energy solutions to Citi in the near future,' he said.   Globally, Citi made a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. This includes the emissions related to Citi's own operations and those financed by its banking activities. For Citi's own operations, the goal is to achieve net zero GHG emissions globally by 2030.   Since 2001, Citi has been working to measure and reduce the direct environmental impact of its own operations through a centralized system and report annually on global energy use, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions, water use, waste-to-landfill, and green building initiatives.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824470,Sennheiser and Kramer partner to deliver video conferencing solution with outstanding sound quality,"Respective industry leaders harmonize to take hybrid meetings to new heights

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 1 March 2023 - Sennheiser, the first choice for advanced audio technology that makes collaboration and learning easier, has partnered with Kramer, the leading audio-visual experiences company, to create an assured, flexible, and easily deployed audio solution for optimized hybrid teleconferencing.            The new solution, officially launched at ISE 2023, combines Sennheiser TeamConnect Ceiling 2 (TCC 2) and TeamConnect Ceiling Medium (TCC M) ceiling microphones with Kramer's AFM-DSP20-AEC audio matrix switcher to deliver superior sound quality while providing an engaging and inclusive audio-visual experience in any medium or large space.   This partnership between Sennheiser and Kramer will further expand both companies' ecosystem, offering ultra-immersive user experiences in hybrid meeting and learning spaces and expanded flexibility for customers and partners.   Engaging, immersive hybrid meeting experiences  The combination of Sennheiser's TCC 2 and TCC M ceiling microphones' premium audio performance and Kramer's best-in-class digital signal processor (DSP) ensures all participants are clearly heard for easy collaboration, efficient learning, and more productive meetings.   Sennheiser's TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions, the TCC 2 and TCC M, are designed to deliver oustanding audio quality in large and mid-sized meeting rooms respectively, as well as in learning or collaboration spaces. These industry-leading TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions employ Sennheiser's patented automatic beamfoming technology and TruVoicelift functionality to allow freedom of movement and perfect speech intelligibility.   The Kramer DSP maintains the quality of the original audio signal with selectable sampling rates up to 96 kHz, ensuring flat frequency response, unmatched sonic performance, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, and extraordinarily low distortion levels. Meanwhile, acoustic echo cancellation further improves teleconferencing sound quality. All in-room and remote participants can hear and be heard so that meetings can proceed smoothly and effectively.   The Sennheiser-Kramer collaboration also offers simplified audio and room-wide control. It supports Audinate's Dante and can be operable by Kramer Control, enabling full automation of the microphones along with other room elements, such as screens, lights, and shades, via a simple click. By removing the time and hassle required to manage a meeting space or classroom, participants can focus on holding their most productive, immersive hybrid calls and lessons yet.   Simple deployment within any working or learning space  The vendor-agnostic design of the Sennheiser microphones and Kramer DSP, dual digital and analog connectivity, and centralized control make a unique solution for everyday use flexible and simple.   As a result, the combined Sennheiser-Kramer solution is ideal for any medium to large classrooms, lecture spaces, and meeting rooms where intelligible speech, simple handling, and seamless integration into the existing room environment are required. Both the Sennheiser ceiling microphones and the Kramer DSP are supported by Kramer's proven low-latency video infrastructure, providing full configuration and installation flexibility.   Assured reliability and accessible support  Millions of Sennheiser and Kramer products are already installed and in use across the globe, trusted by mission-critical organizations for their quality and reliability. The Sennheiser TCC 2 and TCC M microphones and Kramer AFM-DSP20-AEC audio matrix switcher solution are no different, having been cross-certified for compatibility to ensure superior audio performance.   The components of the combined solution are available directly from the global sales networks of Sennheiser and Kramer respectively. The two companies' industry-leading, worldwide support networks support the solution, enabling end-users to easily access any help or advice, if required.   Charlie Jones, Global Alliance & Partnership Manager, Business Communication, at Sennheiser said: ""At Sennheiser, we're proud to combine our renowned audio expertise with Kramer's reliability and ease of use to bring this solution to the market. This is only the first step, as both companies continue to grow our unified communications portfolios and expand our partnership.""   Gilad Yron, CEO of Kramer, said: ""It's a beautiful experience when two audio-visual heavyweights, like Kramer and Sennheiser, come together to create a solution that transcends our respective specialisms. This combined expertise will help to power creativity, collaboration, and engagement within both meeting and education spaces worldwide—and with a wealth of innovations from both companies already shaping the audio-visual experiences of the future, we hope this is the first collaboration of many.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824484,Taiwan court sentences suspect in Maserati road rage incident to 9 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The chief suspect in the beating of a student following a traffic accident involving a Maserati in 2021 was sentenced to nine years in prison by the Taichung District Court on Wednesday (March 1).Sung (宋), 18, a student at Feng Chia University, was driving a car in Taichung early on Nov. 7, 2021, when he sideswiped a Maserati while changing lanes near an intersection.The three men in the Italian luxury car, the driver Lee Wei-sen (李韋霖), 25, Chang Tun-liang (張敦量), 23, and Chen Ching-hao (陳勁豪), 19, assaulted Sung with a baseball bat, leaving him in a coma for several days.Chang was sentenced to nine years in prison for attempted murder and illegal confinement causing injuries, while Lee and Chen received jail terms of four years and eight months each for causing Sung grave injuries and for illegal confinement, the Liberty Times reported. The sentences can be appealed.Chang was not only seen as the most violent perpetrator but also incited public outrage by filing charges against Sung for causing him injuries. Chang initially offered to pay NT$1.5 million (US$49,000) in compensation, which he claimed to be the value of the Maserati owned by his mother. However, the court disputed the sum and pointed out that Chang’s father ran a food company.Reacting to the verdict Wednesday, Sung’s mother expressed dissatisfaction, though she added she respected the court’s judgment, per UDN. She noted that homicide was punishable by a prison sentence of at least 10 years, so she said she would consult with her attorney whether to file an appeal in Chang’s case, though not for Lee and Chen.As her son has not fully recovered, he might interrupt his studies and rest for a time with family outside of Taichung, she told reporters.",2023/03/01,3620,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824550,Japan’s Fukushima wastewater to reach Taiwan waters in 1.5 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The treated radioactive water from Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant is expected to arrive in Taiwan’s waters in 1.5 years after its planned discharge this spring or summer, said a Taiwanese official.The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) has implemented infrastructure for the wastewater release since last August and is likely to begin the work in the summer, said Atomic Energy Council Minister Chang Ching-wen (張靜文) at a legislative briefing on Wednesday (March 1).A small portion of radionuclides could enter waters around Taiwan after the water’s discharge in one to one and a half years, Chang estimated, depending on the influence of seasonal winds and ocean currents.The official said the council has ramped up data collection from Japanese authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors the activities and conducts safety assessments, to get a better grasp of the environmental impact of the move, wrote CNA.Additionally, the council has put in place a laboratory for tritium detection, the first of its kind in Taiwan, which will examine to what extent fish and other marine life around the country’s waters are affected by the health hazard.Tritium, a potential carcinogen at high levels, is a byproduct of nuclear power generation and has caused concerns over the fact that it cannot be removed with TEPCO's treatment technologies. TEPCO has managed to reduce the levels of more than 60 isotopes in the water to meet standards, per AP.Up to 1.3 million tons of treated nuclear wastewater will be dumped into the sea as the 1,000 tanks storing the water are reaching their maximum capacity in the aftermath of the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors in 2011.",2023/03/01,1608,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824561,Has this Taiwanese startup cracked realistic plant-based meat?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Lypid is a San Francisco-based startup founded by two Taiwanese Cornell PhD graduates, and it has one simple goal: “sustainable, tasty, and healthy at the same time.”That is according to the company’s cofounder Jen-yu Huang, who recently spoke to the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast with his cofounder Michelle Cheng. Huang and Cheng’s company is working to create more convincingly “meaty” plant-based meat substitutes by focusing on the fat that goes into them.“There are a lot of alternative proteins on the market right now, but they don’t really taste like real meat,” said Cheng. “Lypid is bridging the gap between the taste of real meats and alternative meats.”Lypid uses a process called microencapsulation to mimic animal fats using plant-based ingredients. The technology alters the structure of the plant-based fats from a liquid to a solid, making it feel more like real meat when eaten. “It’s not just protein, it’s really fat that mimics that juicy mouthfeel,” Huang said.Huang said that there are also many use cases for Lypid’s products that are not exclusively for vegetarian or vegan products. Lypid’s plant fats are what he calls a “complementary” meat product that can be sold alongside traditional meat products, and does not necessarily need to act in direct competition with them.Huang also said that if the plant-based meat industry can leverage the traditional meat industry’s expertise in bringing meat products to market at an industrial scale, plant-based meat products could become widespread much faster. “You can imagine several different approaches, not just vegetarian, or vegan, but …also hybrid approaches,” he said, referencing the possibility of adding his company’s plant-based fats to other meat products to make them healthier.Huang said that the reason why many think plant-based meat substitutes are unhealthy is because of the belief that they are produced with saturated fats. Cheng said that Lypid’s fats are specifically designed to be healthier than traditional saturated fats, and can have 97% less saturated fat than other plant-based options such as coconut oil and palm oil.One of the biggest successes Lypid has had so far is bringing its products to the over 500 Louisa Coffee shops throughout Taiwan. In August 2022, Louisa introduced a line of plant-based burgers.Huang said that Lypid and Louisa went through about six to eight months of development before the product hit the stores. Huang said that for his company, the success of their products at Louisa stores shows that the coffee chain and its consumers have faith in their products, and want to see more of them.",2023/03/01,1484,Business

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352509In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Low Power TV Transmitters Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352511In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Managed Service Programme Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352517In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Network Security Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth.

Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global PBX Phone Software Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824592,COVID pandemic 'likely' caused by Wuhan lab accident: FBI,"The COVID-19 pandemic was likely caused by a leak from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray said.""The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. The agency director did not give more details on the FBI's assessment, saying it was classified.The coronavirus has killed millions across the world since it was first detected in Wuhan in November 2019.Wray's comments came days after the US-based Wall Street Journal reported that the US Energy Department assessed with low confidence that the pandemic originated from an unintended lab leak in China.Other agencies within the American intelligence community believe the virus emerged naturally, and not from a lab, in line with academic studies.On Monday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US government had not reached a definitive conclusion and consensus on the pandemic's origins.When China's Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the Wall Street Journal report, it referred to a report from the World Health Organization that pointed toward a natural origin for the pandemic, rather than a lab leak.Other Chinese officials have denied claims about a lab incident, calling them part of a smear campaign against Beijing.Meanwhile, Wray, in his interview, also accused the Chinese government of attempting to stall the US investigation into the cause of the pandemic.""The Chinese government ... has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here, the work that we're doing, the work that our US government and close foreign partners are doing,"" he said. ""And that's unfortunate for everybody.""The origin of the COVID virus is of critical importance to the scientific community and its efforts to prevent another pandemic.US-China relations have been under strain lately in light of the geopolitical tension over Taiwan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and an alleged Chinese spy balloon detected in US skies.mk/nm (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824593,New hurdles for sea rescuers in the Mediterranean,"The Mediterranean is a perilous place. That is particularly true for migrants who expect a better future for themselves in Europe — and travel towards it on boats which often don't qualify as deep-sea vessels.Last weekend, a boat allegedly carrying at least 150 people crashed off the Italian coast. At least 62 people were killed in the incident. During the first weeks of 2023, dangerous sea crossings have increased, along with problems experienced by civil sea rescuers.Being located in the central Mediterranean Sea, Italy has a particular responsibility: Migrants who first enter EU territory in Italy can apply for asylum in the country.According to the interior ministry in Rome, 14,104 migrants already arrived in Italy between 1st January and 24th February, 2023 — a sharp increase compared to previous years, which saw the arrival of 5,345 (2022) and 4,304 (2021) during the same time period. The majority of them reach Italy by their own efforts, without help from sea rescuers.After the accident off the Calabrian coast, Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, said she felt encouraged ""to stop irregular migration in order to avoid futher tragedies."" At the turn of the year, the government coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia passed a decree that impedes the work of civil sea rescue organizations.The arguably most consequential regulation applies immediately after a maritime rescue has taken place. Rescue boats now have to report a rescue mission without delay, in order to be referred to a specific Italian port. That means they cannot, as they did before, undertake several rescue missions in a row within the same area, and head for a port only afterwards. In addition, the rescue boats are often referred to remote ports located in the north of Italy.When, for instance, the Ocean Viking ship carried out a rescue mission off the Libyan coast in mid-February, it was subsequently dispatched to Ravenna. On the map, the Adriatic port is nearer to London than to Libya.A system of fines punishes any infractions, and is in practice difficult to avoid for rescuers. Meloni's government has also taken the view that the rescue ships' flag states — usually the rescue services' countries of origin, with several coming from Germany — must offer asylum procedures to persons rescued at sea, as opposed to the countries in which people first enter EU soil. Her demand is legally controversial because rescue missions are carried out in international waters and the respective ships' crews do not act on behalf of their governments.Shortly after the decree was released, 18 civil sea rescue organizations and other supporters published a joint statementin which they expressed their ""gravest concerns regarding the latest attempt by a European government to obstruct assistance to people in distress at sea"".The decree violated ""international maritime, human rights and European law, and should therefore trigger a strong reaction by the European Commission, the European Parliament and European Member States and institutions"".""It is clear that if humanitarian ships continue to be stopped, fined, forced to travel unnecessary kilometers, they will not be able to continue to operate for long,"" Veronica Alfonsi, the president of the Italian branch of the Spanish organization Proactiva Open Arms, told DW. ""It is also true, however, that for (the) seven years (that) we have been fighting alone (against) unconstitutional laws and European inaction, we have become very resilient. We will therefore continue to be at sea.""The Geo Barents ship operated by Doctors without Borders (MSF), however, has been incapacitated for the time being: Last week, it was detained in Sicily for a period of 20 days because the Italian government accused the ship's crew of violating the new regulations. In addition, a fine of up to €10,000 ($10,600) is being considered. According to an MSF spokeswoman, a decision on legal countermeasures is in the final stages of preparation.Occasionally, however, new organizations arrive on the scene. The German NGO SARAH Seenotrettung (Search and Rescue for All Humans) is currently readying a ship. The Life Support, launched by Italian NGO Emergency, is operational only since December 2022. The organization had previously offered medical aid and cultural mediation.In addition, NGOs Mission Lifeline, Open Arms, ResqShip, Sea-Eye and Sea-Watch currently have larger ships operating in the central Mediterranean (the SOS Humanity vessel is temporarily moored in a winter dockyard). Apart from the larger ships, the NGOs are also deploying several smaller vessels. Sea-Watch uses two airplanes for aerial reconnaissance purposes.Asked by DW about the maritime accident near the Calabrian village of Steccato di Cutro, Veronica Alfonsi, of Open Arms, replied: ""This is not a tragedy, it is the result of precise political choices."" Alfonsi demands an investigation of the coast guard operation: ""We understand that a Frontex vehicle had raised the alarm, two Coast Guard patrol boats had gone out to look for the boat and had returned due to bad weather. Circumstances to be verified because you do not leave a boat at the mercy of the waves. Under no circumstances.""The ill-fated boat had begun its journey in Izmir, Turkey. Authorities, however, are not yet particularly prepared to deal with the new route, Alfonsi told DW: ""Lately (..), hundreds of people, many Afghans and Iranians, are trying that route because it is somehow considered safer. Wrongly, of course. Calabria has been experiencing this phenomenon recently and tries to help, but is not equipped to do so. Obviously, there is no structured government mission there, as there is none in the central Mediterranean."" Her organization, she added, was now evaluating whether it will become active on this new route.",2023/03/01,,

            The game took place at the Taipei Heping Basketball Gymnasium with players split up into Team Infinity and Team Beyond, according to CNA. Team Infinity came out on top with a 179-124 victory over Team Beyond.

            Howard, who plays for the Taoyuan Leopards, had 37 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, and two steals. The three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was also named the T1 League All-Star Game’s MVP.

            During an interview at center court after the game, Howard said, “Taiwan, I just want to say how grateful I am to be here. Thank you so much for coming out and supporting us in our first-ever All-Star Game. It means so much to me and everyone else who played. We really appreciate you and we love you so much. Thank you.”











            When asked what part of the All-Star activities he enjoyed the most, from taking part in the three-point contest, to being a judge for the slam dunk contest, to the actual All-Star Game itself, Howard said “The whole day was amazing.” He then thanked his teammates, the coach, the players from Team Beyond, and finally the fans for coming out.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former NBA big man Dwight Howard dropped 37 points in the first-ever T1 League All-Star Game on Tuesday (Feb. 28) in Taipei.The game took place at the Taipei Heping Basketball Gymnasium with players split up into Team Infinity and Team Beyond, according to CNA.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824646,Taiwan plans to upcycle used masks,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan may start a trial run of a program to recycle used medical masks later this year as the country seeks to reduce waste from the protective gear.Legislators Wen Yu-hsia (溫玉霞) of the KMT and Su Chiao-hui (蘇巧慧) of the DDP both brought up the topic of mask recycling at a legislative interpellation on Wednesday (March 1) to address the environmental woes of masks with new technologies.According to Su, surgical masks are usually made from more than three materials, making recycling harder. A company in New Taipei, though, has developed a new technique that can manufacture masks out of one material, an invention conducive to the upcycling of the item that has become an essential part of daily living in Taiwan since COVID-19 hit.The firm is open to sharing the patented technology, which if promoted on a large scale can pave the way for mask recycling, CNA quoted Su as saying. Wen said masks produced this way can be turned into plastic particles and used to make things like planks, a feat that will help boost Taiwan’s green credentials.While supporting the idea, Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Chang Tzi-ching (張子敬) said more research is needed to determine the cost-benefit of the approach. Issues such as subsidies and recycling methods also need discussion, he added.Wang Yu-bin (王嶽斌), an official of the EPA’s recycling branch, said only single-material-made masks will be recycled to ensure quality. Used masks from medical institutions will not be accepted due to hygiene concerns.EPA is bringing in expertise and incorporating opinions from the industry and retail sector as a pilot program is set to be rolled out at designated places in the second half of the year, according to Wang.",2023/03/01,2227,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824658,ECOVACS ROBOTICS Offers Uncompromising Cleanliness with New DEEBOT N10 Family,"The new DEEBOT introduced by the APAC No.1 robot vacuum brand gives all-rounded cleaning experience without sacrificing performance for budget.

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 1 March 2023 - ECOVACS ROBOTICS, the world's leading service robotics maker, today announces the launch of the DEEBOT N10 Family in Singapore. It sets a new standard for delivering uncompromising cleanliness by bringing a superior cleaning experience to every home.              Best-in-class vacuum and mop In-one-go from ECOVACS       The new DEEBOT N10 Family robots boast improved 4300 Pa suction power to remove dirt, dust, and debris from even the toughest crevices and deepest carpet fibers. The over-the-air (OTA) deep cleaning modes allow customers to use their mobile phones to enable simultaneous vacuuming and mopping of embedded dirt.           The DEEBOT's floating main brush makes floor cleaning much more efficient. Together, they loosen dirt from carpets and direct it into the vacuum stream. This makes the robots ideal for homes with carpets and pets with long fur.           The OZMOTM Mopping System is a smart and efficient cleaning solution thanks to its leak-preventing feature. With micro-water pumps that automatically adjust, customers can enjoy spotless floors without worrying about over-wetting. The sensors on the DEEBOT also allow it to switch between vacuuming and mopping modes seamlessly, ensuring carpets stay dry and clean and the suction power remains powerful for a more extended period.       Auto-Empty Station brings 60 days hands-free dustbin cleaning        Most conventional robotic vacuum cleaners in the market require customers to manually empty the dustbin, which can be tedious and unhygienic. DEEBOT N10 PLUS's Auto-Empty Station accessory, equipped with a large-volume 2.5L hypoallergenic dust bag and made with an all-natural paper handle, can store dust for up to 60 days, improving customer convenience and hygiene.           The suction inlets seal automatically when pulled out to ensure no dust is left behind at unintended locations at the customer's home. The four-layer antibacterial dust bags keep the surrounding air clean by effectively filtering up to 99% of dust particles and allergens as small as 0.3μm. DEEBOT N10 PLUS also offers 5 dust collection modes to allow customers to select the most convenient mode for emptying the dustbin. DEEBOT N10 is also compatible with Auto- Empty Station, which is sold as separated accessory.       TrueMapping Technology maps homes with 2x better coverage and 4x accuracy        The DEEBOT N10 Family robots use TrueMapping laser-based mapping and navigation technology to map floors within seconds. They can intelligently navigate a user's home, choose the right map for the floor, and find the most optimal cleaning path. With N10 Family, users can customize the cleaning mode, suction power, water flow, and cleaning times for each room. They can also use the ECOVACS Home App to set the order in which the robots clean the rooms, set up schedules, and create no-go zones.       Worry-free, high performance for longer hours       The new DEEBOT N10 Family robots feature a charging and mobility upgrade. The robots automatically return to the charging dock when the battery runs low. When fully charged, they resume operations where they previously stopped. A stride length of 20mm provides stronger mobility, allowing the robots to negotiate most sills and carpet edges. The N10 Family comes with a new 5200mAh battery, which extends use on a single charge and water fill.       Antibacterial designs remove foul odors       The DEEBOT N10 Family robots include an antibacterial dust bag and filter. The dual antibacterial design, which consists of a non-woven surface layer and an inner layer of melt blown with DuPont silver ion antibacterial agent, can filter large particles and 99.99% of bacteria. The use of four layers of high-quality materials prevents any dust leakage.           The antibacterial E11 filter captures 95% of 0.3μm dust and allergens. The use of two antibacterial agents for treatment eliminates bacteria, mold, and mildew growth on the surface, preventing unpleasant odors and discoloration. The activated carbon layer on the filter also absorbs odors produced by ordinary household wastes, keeping the air fresh and clean.       Pricing and Availability       The DEEBOT N10 Family includes the DEEBOT N10 and DEEBOT N10 PLUS models. Both are available today, for SGD 999 and SGD 1,299 retail price respectively, both models are up to 57% discount during Double 3 promotion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824665,Belize Embassy launches art exhibit celebrating women at Taiwan's National Central Library,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Belize Embassy in Taipei on Wednesday (March 1) unveiled an exhibit showcasing Belizean women and culture in the form of paintings, crafts, and sculptures at the National Central Library to celebrate International Women’s Day (March 8).

            “Some of the barriers women face consistently are cultural,” Belize Ambassador to Taiwan Candice Pitts said, including “the ways particular groups in particular societies understand gender, their expectations of womanhood, and their treatment of women and girls.”

            “Therefore, deploying cultures to celebrate women can help us to rethink and address some of these problems even at the level of our thoughts and creative imagination,” Pitts said.

            Commenting on the importance of women supporting each other, Pitts said, “When one of us make it, all of us make it; when one of us is celebrated, all of us are celebrated.” She also stressed that “when we acknowledge women, we do not devalue men.”











            The ambassador also said that women must work together to “level the proverbial playing fields” and to “strike a balance with the genders that will allow women to have fair access, fair participation, fair representation, fair recognition.”

            The exhibit features images of women from all walks of life who contribute to Belize society. All of the artwork celebrates womanhood and many of them were made or painted by women, according to the ambassador.

            The commissioning of the artwork also provided economic opportunities for these women and their families, Pitts said. There are multiple paintings by Belizeans showcasing the friendship between Belize and Taiwan.

            One of the more notable crafts is the table runners woven by Martina Pop, an Indigenous Mayan woman from Belize. Table runners are one of the primary cultural productions of Belize Mayan communities, Pitts said.

            The main feature of the art collection is a series of six wooden sculptures, titled “Inspire: The flight of 6 Belizean women,” carved by three sculptors: Curl Gordon, Bobby Westby, and Anthony Vacarro. The project’s commissioning was funded by Taiwan’s Central American Trade Office and received support from Belize City’s Institute of Creative Arts.

            The works were made out of wood found in the forest and each was inspired by six real Belize women.

            The sculptures “Genesis” and “Mother and Child “ were made by Westby, while the sculptures “Flight” and “Emergence” were made by Vacarro. The sculptures “Mother of Creation Essence” and “Essence” were made by Gordon.

            The woodworkers chose to carve larger sculptures than requested, causing a delay in shipping. As a result, the sculptures will be on display beginning March 8.

            The exhibit will run from March 1-31.
