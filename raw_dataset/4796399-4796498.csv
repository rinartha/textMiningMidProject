https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796399,"PSG signing of Ziyech left hanging, Terem Moffi joins Nice","Paris Saint-Germain's attempt to sign Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech apparently hit a late snag Wednesday as the January transfer window came to a close without an official announcement from the clubs.

            Soon after the midnight deadline, PSG said it loaned goalkeeper Keylor Navas to Nottingham Forest until the end of the season, but there was no word on the expected arrival — also on loan — of Ziyech.

            According to newspaper L'Equipe, both clubs reached an agreement but the signing of Ziyech was not immediately validated by the French league because Chelsea submitted some documents too late.











            PSG is counting on Ziyech to add some creativity in midfield ahead of a crucial period for the French champions.

            PSG has been struggling since the start of the new year, with two defeats in its last four league matches. 

            Ziyech showed his creative abilities and technical skills with Morocco at the World Cup last year, helping the team reach the semifinals. But he has not enjoyed the same kind of form in the Premier League in recent seasons and is no longer a regular starter at Stamford Bridge.

            PSG, whose ambition is still to win the Champions League for the first time this year, only has a few weeks to rediscover its attacking spark: it hosts Bayern in the first leg of their round-of-16 match in the Champions League on Feb. 14.

            “We have to find some consistency in our matches, at the moment we are playing with too much fluctuation in quality, there are tough moments in a season, we have to turn things around,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said on Tuesday.

            On a busy deadline day in France, Nice signed Terem Moffi after beating southern rival Marseille for the prolific Nigeria striker on the final day of the transfer window.

            Nice said Moffi, who joined from French club Lorient and has been one of the best players in the league this season, signed a loan deal with a obligation to make the deal permanent.

            “We’re delighted that Terem’s determination to sign for OGC Nice, combined with our own, has led to this outcome,"" Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivère said. “It’s an investment that matches our ambitions.”

            The 23-year-old Moffi arrived in the French league in 2020 after stints in Lithuania and Belgium. He scored 35 goals in 90 matches with Lorient. Moffi’s 12 goals this season put him second in the scoring chart, one behind Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappé.

            Marseille was interested in signing Moffi, with the striker set to be part of a reported swap deal that would see Bamba Dieng sign with Lorient. The Senegal forward did sign a four-year deal with Lorient last week, but Moffi opted for Nice.

            Nice said Moffi could start as soon as Sunday against Marseille, which turned its focus toward highly-rated Braga striker Vitinha. The 22-year-old Vitinha, who was also courted by Southampton, finalized a long-term deal until June 2027 with the 1993 Champions League winners. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but L'Equipe reported that Marseille paid 32 million euros ($34.8 million) for Vitinha, making him the most expensive player in the club's history.

            Bidding for a Champions League birth next season, Marseille had already reinforced its midfield with the arrival of Morocco international Azzedine Ounahi from Angers. Ounahi has excellent dribbling skills and an attacking profile likely to fit coach Igor Tudor's vision.

            Hoping for a boost after a so far disappointing season, seven-time champion Lyon signed Botafogo striker Jeffinho until the end of June 2027. Lyon said the transaction was worth 10 million euros ($10.9 million), with possible add-ons of up to 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) depending on the club's results and the player's performance.

            The 23-year-old Jeffinho scored twice in 24 games for Botafogo in last year’s Brazilian topflight. His arrival came a day after Lyon signed another forward, Swedish youth international Amin Sarr, in a move aimed at compensating for the departures of Karl Toko Ekambi and Tete. 

             John Textor, who in December completed his takeover of Lyon, is the majority owner of Botafogo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796400,Settlement ends police brutality suit in Ohio's largest city,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Officials in Ohio's largest city have reached a $225,000 settlement with a man who said police officers used improper force during a 2017 arrest.

            The Columbus City Council voted unanimously Monday to approve the deal with Timothy Davis. As part of the settlement, neither the city nor the officers admitted to any wrongdoing.

            Davis had sued the city in federal court, alleging civil rights violations, but a jury rejected his claims in December 2021. A federal judge granted a partial new trial in September, saying a complete jury verdict in favor of the officers was ""against the clear weight of the evidence.” The settlement reached in December and approved Monday resolves that matter.











            Davis' lawyers had said during the trial that Columbus officers verbally abused, punched, kicked and used a stun gun on him; pulled out his hair; and stripped him nearly naked from the waist down during the September 2017 arrest. 

            A lawsuit also accused officers of trying to block bystanders from filming the arrest. 

            The city denied the allegations, saying police acted properly when they arrested Davis on several warrants for violent crimes, including assaulting an officer. The city also denied officers tried to block the filming of the arrest. 

            The jury issued a verdict denying all claims against nine officers and the city, which has acknowledged that remarks by an officer at the scene were “inappropriate” but said the officer wasn’t involved in taking Davis into custody.

            “I’m going to choke the life out of you,” the officer said at one point, referring to how he would have handled the arrest.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Officials in Ohio's largest city have reached a $225,000 settlement with a man who said police officers used improper force during a 2017 arrest.The Columbus City Council voted unanimously Monday to approve the deal with Timothy Davis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796401,Tyre Nichols' parents to attend Biden State of Union speech,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The parents of Tyre Nichols, the Black man who was severely beaten by a group of Memphis, Tennessee, police officers and died days later, will attend President Joe Biden's State of the Union address next week at the U.S. Capitol. 

            RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Nichols, have accepted an invitation to attend the speech from Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, according to Vincent Evans, a spokesperson for the group of Black lawmakers.

            Videotape released last week of the violent Jan. 7 encounter between Nichols and the police officers shows the officers savagely beating the 29-year-old FedEx worker for three minutes while screaming profanities at him. 











            Nichols was hospitalized and died on Jan. 10.

            
                Five police officers, who also are Black, have been fired and charged with second-degree murder and other offenses in Nichols' beating and death. On Monday, two more Memphis police officers were disciplined and three emergency medical technicians were fired in connection with the case. 

            Horsford said it was important for Nichols' parents to hear from the president and their elected representatives in Congress. 

            “I have invited the Nichols family as guests of the Congressional Black Caucus so they will be there on that day to hear from the president and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to hear how we will finally take action to keep our communities safe,” Horsford told MSNBC on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796402,Pedal through cycling history at this Ohio bike museum,"NEW BREMEN, Ohio (AP) — In a former hotel here in rural, western Ohio is a museum offering more than two centuries of bicycle history, from early high-wheelers to candy-hued 1960s Sting Rays. 

            There's a 1901 ice bike, a kitschy 1949 Donald Duck artifact, a military-issued bike with a machine gun mount, bikes that appeared in movies (Pee Wee Herman's) or belonged to stars (Robin Williams), and lots of Schwinns. As a bonus, there's a Boy Scout cap worn by the first man on the moon, who grew up nearby.

            The exhibits fill three floors and, of course, rotate.











            The Bicycle Museum of America traces the bike's impact on culture, transportation and plain ol’ fun, showing how it became synonymous with convenience and ease (thus the phrase, “It’s like riding a bicycle.”)

            Take, for example, the Donald Duck bike made by the Shelby Cycle Company in 1949. The Disney character’s head is on the front of the frame, with flashing, battery-powered eyes. The horn quacks, and the bike is a vibrant blue and yellow.

            Hanging above Donald in the exhibit is the ice bike, with a sled runner instead of a front wheel, and a rear wheel with 30-plus spikes so riders could pedal across a frozen pond. Maybe.

            Nearby is one of the modified 1953 Schwinn DX bikes used in “Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure,” the 1985 movie about a childlike man’s quest to find his stolen bicycle.

            The museum owes its creation to the end of an era: the Schwinn era. The once-dominant American manufacturer, founded in 1895 by Ignaz Schwinn, went bankrupt in 1992. The Schwinn family’s collection of hundreds of bicycles was sold at auction in 1997.

            “It’s hard to take care of this mess of stuff,” Richard Schwinn, great-grandson of the founder, told the Chicago Tribune at the sale. “We could put it in storage or we could sell it and I’m tired of storing it.”

            James Dicke II, head of the family-owned Crown Equipment Corp. of New Bremen, which makes forklifts, bought more than 150 bicycles and memorabilia at the auction for about $500,000, according to newspaper reports. That led to the creation of the Bicycle Museum of America, which Dicke continues to financially support. It's housed in the former, upscale Hotel Central, built in 1891.

            There are other cycling artifacts in museums around the world. The Smithsonian and Henry Ford Museum of Innovation each have large bicycle collections. There are a handful of other dedicated bicycle museums scattered across the country, including the Bicycle Heaven Museum in Pittsburgh, the Houston Bicycle Museum, and the Marin Museum of Bicycling in Fairfax, California.

            The Bicycle Museum of America has one of the largest and most interesting collections, with more than 700 bikes, of which 173 are currently on display. It also has more than 10,000 other bicycle-related objects, from catalogs and advertisements to blueprints and correspondence, said Ryan Long, the museum’s coordinator.

            The first floor features the oldest models in the collection, starting with a replica of what many consider the world’s first bicycle: the 1816 Draisine, invented by Karl von Drais. The German’s “walking machine” has two wheels of similar size, one behind the other, and a steering device, but no pedals. Riders propelled the crude, wooden vehicle with their feet, ala Fred Flintstone. 

            The next major advancement was the French velocipede, the first bike with pedals. The pedals were attached to the front wheel, and the bikes were nicknamed “boneshakers” for their bouncy ride. 

            The boneshaker led to the high-wheeled bicycle, or penny farthing. There are several on display, including a high-wheeler that visitors can ride. Fortunately, it’s attached firmly to the ground with steps that make the climb to the saddle less dangerous.

            The term “taking a header” is said to have originated with these tall, unstable bicycles, as many riders flew face first over the handlebars.

            The invention of the safety bicycle in 1885 by Britain’s John Kemp Starley made cycling easier. It has the same basic design still in use today: two wheels of the same size, a diamond-shaped frame, and pedals between the wheels that turn the rear wheel. Add the invention of pneumatic tires and by the mid-1890s, the world was bicycle mad.

            “The 1890s was the greatest bicycle boom to date,” Long said. “Everyone wanted a bicycle and production swelled throughout the 1890s until the automobile took over the market.”

            Women took to the bicycle in huge numbers, and museum signage quotes suffragist Susan B. Anthony saying the safety bicycle “has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.” It also helped popularize bloomers.

            Annie Oakley claimed she was the first woman to ride a bicycle in London, and she did some fancy trick shooting while pedaling.

            The military went further, mounting a Colt machine gun on an 1896 Columbia Model 40. The museum’s model has a storage case for ammunition and assorted supplies mounted on the rear rack.

            Robin Williams, who died in 2014, loved cycling and collected more than 100 bikes. The museum has two of them: a high-tech Zipp bike from 1992 and a La Carrera Futura 2000, an Italian-made, all-white model covered in polka dots that proves bicycles can be works of art.

            Tandems were all the rage in the 1890s, and Ignaz Schwinn built one for his wife and himself in 1897. It featured a seat between the two riders to hold one of their infant children. The museum has the only known model.

            Perhaps the most popular Schwinn model was the Sting Ray, manufactured from 1968 to 1973. It featured the famous banana-shaped seat, and a five-speed shifter on the tube that ran from the saddle to the handlebars. Sting Rays came in vivid colors with model names like Lemon Peeler, Grape Krate and Orange Krate.

            Near the Sting Ray are two more unique bikes: A 1955 Huffy Radiobike has a working radio built into the frame with volume-control and tuning dials. And Harley Davidson sold bicycles from 1917 to 1922, a marketing maneuver to attract young riders to the brand; the museum has one with a sidecar.

            Neil Armstrong, who grew up in nearby Wapakoneta, flew to fame in a different type of vehicle, but there’s a collection of his memorabilia in the museum. The Armstrong collection includes two of the astronaut's flight suits, a leather jacket, his Air Force Training Certificate, and the Boy Scout cap he may have worn as he pedaled to weekly troop meetings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796403,Italy on alert amid anarchist attacks on diplomatic missions,"MILAN (AP) — Italy's government has increased security at its diplomatic missions around the globe in response to “a crescendo of terroristic attacks” by an informal anarchist network acting in solidarity with an imprisoned Italian militant, the foreign minister said Tuesday. 

            Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani cited nearly a dozen attacks since the end of November, ranging from vandalism to explosive devices that have caused damage to Italian diplomatic targets in Argentina, Bolivia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. No injuries have been reported.

            “It is obvious that there is an international solidarity (among anarchists) and therefore an attack against Italy, against Italian institutions, is being carried out across the world,’’ Tajani said, adding that security was being raised at all Italian embassies and consulates as well as the foreign ministry.











            Tajani said they believe the network includes both Italians and anarchists from other countries acting in concert. He referred to graffiti scrawled in Catalan on the building housing the Italian Consulate in Barcelona. 

            The most serious of the attacks was the firebombing of two cars at the residence of an Italian diplomat in Athens in early December — one car was torched, and Tajani said only the failure of the second bomb targeting a car inside the garage of the residence and near a gas line averted worse consequences.

            The attacks and as well as a series of protests, including one planned Tuesday in Madrid, are in solidarity with Alfredo Cospito, who has been on a hunger strike since October to protest a strict prison regime reserved for terrorists and mafiosi. The 55-year-old militant is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting in the leg an energy executive for a state-controlled company and 20 years for a series of dynamite attacks in Italy. 

            An appeals court in Turin last spring toughened his prison conditions to include solitary confinement except for one hour a day and a strict limit of family visits. The regime is imposed on prisoners who are considered to pose a danger even from inside prison. 

            Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said that the fact of the attacks only reinforces the necessity of the regime in Cospito’s case. 

            Cospito’s lawyers are currently appealing the strict conditions.

            In the meantime, Cospito has been transferred from Sardinia to a prison south of Milan, which Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said was best equipped to deal with the health challenges of the hunger strike. 

            In Italy, anarchists on Monday torched cars belonging to the TIM telecommunications company, scrawling slogans denouncing Cospito's treatment nearby. This weekend, a small group of his supporters clashed with police in Rome and two incendiary devices were lobbed in the parking lot of a police station in the capital. No one was injured.MILAN (AP) — Italy's government has increased security at its diplomatic missions around the globe in response to “a crescendo of terroristic attacks” by an informal anarchist network acting in solidarity with an imprisoned Italian militant, the foreign minister said Tuesday.Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani cited nearly a dozen attacks since the end of November, ranging from vandalism to explosive devices that have caused damage to Italian diplomatic targets in Argentina, Bolivia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. No injuries have been reported.“It is obvious that there is an international solidarity (among anarchists) and therefore an attack against Italy, against Italian institutions, is being carried out across the world,’’ Tajani said, adding that security was being raised at all Italian embassies and consulates as well as the foreign ministry.Tajani said they believe the network includes both Italians and anarchists from other countries acting in concert. He referred to graffiti scrawled in Catalan on the building housing the Italian Consulate in Barcelona.The most serious of the attacks was the firebombing of two cars at the residence of an Italian diplomat in Athens in early December — one car was torched, and Tajani said only the failure of the second bomb targeting a car inside the garage of the residence and near a gas line averted worse consequences.The attacks and as well as a series of protests, including one planned Tuesday in Madrid, are in solidarity with Alfredo Cospito, who has been on a hunger strike since October to protest a strict prison regime reserved for terrorists and mafiosi. The 55-year-old militant is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting in the leg an energy executive for a state-controlled company and 20 years for a series of dynamite attacks in Italy.An appeals court in Turin last spring toughened his prison conditions to include solitary confinement except for one hour a day and a strict limit of family visits. The regime is imposed on prisoners who are considered to pose a danger even from inside prison.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said that the fact of the attacks only reinforces the necessity of the regime in Cospito’s case.Cospito’s lawyers are currently appealing the strict conditions.In the meantime, Cospito has been transferred from Sardinia to a prison south of Milan, which Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said was best equipped to deal with the health challenges of the hunger strike.In Italy, anarchists on Monday torched cars belonging to the TIM telecommunications company, scrawling slogans denouncing Cospito's treatment nearby. This weekend, a small group of his supporters clashed with police in Rome and two incendiary devices were lobbed in the parking lot of a police station in the capital.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796404,Spanish government to close loophole in sexual consent law,"MADRID (AP) — Spain’s government committed Tuesday to amend a new sexual consent law that while intended to increase the protection of women has inadvertently allowed hundreds of sex offenders to get their prison sentences significantly reduced.

            The law, known as “only yes means yes,"" made verbal consent, or the lack thereof, the key component in cases of alleged sexual assault. But it also revised the minimum and maximum prison terms for sexual assault convictions, a move which has opened the door to judges shaving months or even years off convictions for rapists and abusers on appeal.

            For the first time since the controversial law entered into force almost four months ago, the coalition government’s socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez publicly spoke about a correction to the text.











            “The Law on Sexual Freedom has had an unwanted consequence, the reduction of sentences in some cases. This is a technical question that does not reflect the will of the Executive,” he told a Senate session Tuesday. “And those unwanted effects, of course, we are going to correct them.”

            Since the law took effect, over 300 convicted sex offenders have had their sentences shortened and at least 30 who had been near the end of their sentences have been released from prison.

            That has led to an outcry by women’s groups and consternation among the general public, putting pressure on the government — which plays up its feminist credentials and which has a majority of women ministers — to act.

            Changing the law, however, could produce tensions during an election year between Sánchez' ruling Socialists and their junior partner, the anti-austerity “United We Can” party.

            Equality Minister Irene Montero, who championed the sexual consent law, said negotiations are ongoing among coalition members to reform it.

            “I am not going to hide from you that we have a discrepancy about the consent, we are going to continue working so that there is an agreement” said Montero, who is one of four ministers in the cabinet from the junior coalition member. 

            She blames judges for misinterpreting the law due to what she considers endemic sexism in the courts. Spain’s judiciary, along with politicians from various parties, has responded that the law was poorly crafted.

            Minister and Cabinet spokesperson Isabel Rodriguez referred to technical adjustments but refused to give more details on how to match the interests of both coalition partners. 

            “It’s obvious there is concern, there is a social alarm,"" she said at the weekly Cabinet briefing. “We need to be aware of the feelings of victims ... And therefore, we understand that today the best possible way to defend the ‘only yes is yes’ law is to carry out the necessary technical adjustments.”

            The law had been voted by 205 of the 350 parliament members in August, after a nearly two-year-long process of drafting.

            “I am convinced that ... none of the people that took part in the drafting process wanted the undesired effects that ... have generated a social concern shared by the government,"" Spain's Minister of the Presidency Felix Bolaños said Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796407,Indiana justices won't hear 2nd abortion case for now,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana's high court said it will not immediately consider a challenge to the state's abortion ban that is based on the argument that the law violates some people's religious freedoms, leaving that decision to an appeals court, at least for now.

            The state Supreme Court issued an order Monday saying the state Court of Appeals will first consider the case, after a lower court judge in December sided with residents who claim the state's abortion ban infringes on their religious beliefs. 

            The state attorney general's office appealed that decision and asked the high court to take up the case in December, saying in a statement Tuesday that it would “keep defending the law and fighting for life"" in the appeals court.











            The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of those residents — who hold Muslim, Jewish and other faiths — after Republican state lawmakers enacted the ban last summer. The ACLU did not immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday.

            Indiana's ban, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, goes against those residents’ religious values regarding when they believe the treatment is acceptable, the lawsuit argues.

            Earlier in January, the state Supreme Court heard arguments in a lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators. The court has maintained a block on the abortion ban while it considers the case, after a county judge in September initially found the law likely violated privacy protections under the state constitution.

            While Indiana’s ban is blocked, abortion will remain legal in the state up to 20 weeks post-fertilization. 

            After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, religious freedoms lawsuits against states' abortion bans have sprouted across the country, where abortion-rights supporters are aiming to protect access to abortion and defend their beliefs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796408,Thai police apologize for Taiwan actor's alleged extortion,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand's police commissioner apologized Tuesday after seven officers were placed under investigation for allegedly extorting money from a Taiwanese actor who was visiting Bangkok on a holiday. 

            Charlene An posted on social media that she was traveling in a taxi with friends after a night out in the Thai capital when they were stopped and searched at a checkpoint in the early hours of Jan. 5. She said she was threatened with a criminal charge for having an e-cigarette and later paid 27,000 baht ($820) before they were able to leave.

            Two captains, two senior sergeant majors and three sergeants who were at the checkpoint were transferred to inactive positions while the investigation is ongoing, police said.











            “There are still many good police. We must encourage the good ones and deal with the bad ones,"" police Gen. Damrongsak Kittiprapas told reporters at police headquarters.

            ""I would like to stress that our city has lots of visitors coming. Immigration police, tourist police and local police must take the best care of tourists. And for the incident that has happened, if there is wrongdoing, as the head of the organization, I apologize to the victims affected by what happened,” he said.

            Anyone found guilty will be punished, he said.

            Thai police earlier denied the accusation and suggested An was intoxicated and had not been able to produce travel documents, possibly because of a language barrier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796412,US consumer confidence lags as 2023 gets under way,"American consumers are kicking off 2023 a bit less confident than they were at the end of last year as inflation and the possibility of a recession loom.

            The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index slipped to a still-optimistic 107.1 in January, down from 109 in December. Last month's reading was the highest the index has reached since April. 

            The business research group’s present situation index — which measures consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions — rose to 150.9 from 147.4. Respondents continue to express optimism about the stability of their incomes and the broader U.S. job market, which has held up well even as the Federal Reserve has tried to cool the economy and with a succession of “jumbo” rate increases.











            The board’s expectations index — a measure of consumers’ six-month outlook for income, business and labor conditions — deteriorated to 77.8 in January from 83.4 in December. A reading under 80 often signals a recession in the coming year, the Conference Board said.

            The conference board said consumers' intention to buy big-ticket items like cars held steady, but plans to purchase homes fell even further with higher interest rates and home prices.

            Getting a read on consumers’ view of the economy lately has been as uneven as the economy itself.

            Earlier this month, the government reported that Americans cut back on spending in December for the second straight month as inflation and the rising cost of using credit cards slowed consumer activity over the crucial holiday shopping season. Retail sales fell a worse-than-expected 1.1% in December, following a revised 1% drop in November, the Commerce Department reported.

            Solid hiring, rising pay, and savings beefed up by government financial support during the pandemic enabled most Americans to keep up with rising prices. That government assistance has long ended, however, and some Americans have dipped into savings accounts since then. Credit card defaults are on the rise with some households slow to adjust their spending to a new reality.

            Still, the job market is still a pillar of strength in the U.S. economy and wages continue to rise, creating a conflict for the Fed which needs to cool spending and hiring to control inflation.

            Inflation does appear to be in retreat, falling for the sixth straight month, to 6.5% in December.

            The willingness to buy a home has faded with mortgage rates that are nearly doubled what they were a year ago. The National Association of Realtors reported earlier this month that sales of previously occupied U.S. homes declined for the 11th straight month in December and 2022 sales declined nearly 18% from 2021. That’s the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since 2008, during the housing crisis of the late 2000s.American consumers are kicking off 2023 a bit less confident than they were at the end of last year as inflation and the possibility of a recession loom.The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index slipped to a still-optimistic 107.1 in January, down from 109 in December.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796416,Calls for independent probe into Rwandan journalist's death,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Dozens of African civil society groups and press associations on Tuesday called for an independent investigation into the death of a Rwanda-based journalist, saying the official explanation lacked backing evidence.

            Investigative journalist John Williams Ntwali had previously expressed fears for his life and told the Human Rights Watch rights organization that he had received phone threats and had strangers visiting his house.

            His family was informed on Jan. 19 of his death, which Rwandan police attributed to a motorbike accident.











            A joint statement by 90 organizations on Tuesday said that no evidence of the accident has yet been released.

            “Rwandan authorities have failed to provide a police report, the exact location of the alleged accident, any photo or video evidence or detailed information on the others involved"" in the accident, the statement said.

            Ntwali has been described as Rwanda’s last independent journalist who exposed alleged human rights violations on detained opposition figures and journalists.

            His latest coverage was highlighting the plight of people facing land evictions by the authorities.

            United States Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power on Saturday urged the Rwandan government to independently investigate Ntwali's death.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796418,Why workers at growing number of nonprofits are unionizing,"Over his six years at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Esteban Gil watched colleague after colleague leave. Part of it was the nature of the work: helping people in immigrant detention and in prison. It is high-stakes, high-stress work. But there was also something deeply wrong with the way the group operated and the very low pay, he says.

            “People burn out and they tire out, and then they leave,” says Gil, a program associate in the group’s criminal-justice-reform division. They didn’t have autonomy in their jobs, he says, and didn’t feel respected. Some folks left for more money, and others left to get away. “We had a problem with mismanagement and toxicity.”

            A union, Gil thought, could be the answer, so he and his co-workers decided to form one. 











            Money was a key issue for staff at the nonprofit, which monitors hate groups and brings lawsuits over civil-rights, immigration, and criminal-justice issues. Jackie Hurst, who works as a bilingual administrative assistant, says that her department, part of the immigrant-justice project, had been chronically understaffed. After taxes and other deductions, Hurst took home just $1,100 for two weeks of work. She earned so little that she lives 54 miles away from the group’s Decatur, Georgia, office, where housing is cheaper. “Our pay was not sustainable,” she says.

            The Southern Poverty Law Center is far from alone. Nonprofit cultural institutions, advocacy groups, and social-service organizations have all had employees unionize. That includes big names like the Philadelphia Museum of Art and smaller ones like the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. Even as the economy cools and fears of recession grow, both union organizers and consultants who advise nonprofit leaders on the issue say nonprofit staff are continuing to unionize at the same fast pace. 

            Roughly two dozen museums have unionized in the past three years, according to the American Alliance of Museums. The Nonprofit Professional Employees Union has grown from 300 workers at 12 organizations in 2018 to 1,500 workers at nearly 50 organizations today. Since 2019 the Nonprofit Employees United has unionized workers at 68 organizations. The NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America went from having five unions recognized in 2019 to 44 today. 

            The increase in nonprofit unions comes at a time when unions have been rising in popularity among all Americans. Approval of unions, at 71%, is at its highest since 1965, according to Gallup. While the number of nonprofits that are unionizing is increasing, they likely make up a small part of the overall work force. The government does not break out statistics for nonprofit unionization, but union members make up about 10% of the total workforce — about half of what it was in 1983, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

            Nonprofit employees may be more predisposed to unionizing than other workers. They tend to be younger, well educated, and altruistic — a perfect blend of characteristics that tip people toward interest in unions, says David Zonderman, a history professor at North Carolina State University who teaches labor and nonprofit history. 

            Nonprofits come out of a tradition of charity and sacrifice, and most pay their employees less than private companies and government. As a result, many unionizing workers are looking for livable wages and opportunities to advance, all the more important as housing costs and inflation have shot up. Others see unions as a way to press for greater racial equity.

            At museums and other nonprofits, the pandemic exposed a business model based on underpaying employees, says Laura Lott, CEO of the American Alliance of Museums. Younger workers are challenging the idea that work at prestigious institutions should come with substandard pay.

            The arguments nonprofit leaders have long made to push back demands for better pay — budget and contract constraints, the importance of the mission, and the idea that raising wages would take desperately needed funds away from services — are not working as well as they once did, says Hil O’Connell, a national organizer at the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America.

            That’s certainly been the case at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project in Arizona. 

            Yesenia Ramales, a senior legal assistant, says that no one got raises for two years. At the same time, caseloads were growing and everyone was doing more work. Every time she asked for a raise, she says, she was told the group was there for the community — aren’t you here for the community?

            Ramales and her fellow employees were sick of that answer, so they formed a union.

            “I just want to be compensated for the work I’m doing,” she says. “I just want them to acknowledge that prices are rising, bills are getting more expensive, and I can’t live off of the salary.”

            Lillian Aponte, the group’s co-executive director, said she couldn’t comment on ongoing contract negotiations. She says the group has embraced unionization and that it’s an opportunity for “meaningful discussion.”

            At the Southern Poverty Law Center, contract talks were long and acrimonious. 

            Management tried to be respectful, listen to workers, and take the high road, says Lecia Brooks, chief of staff and culture at the organization and management’s lead negotiator with the union. But, she says, the union treated management “like we were all the devil.” She says the union attacked negotiators personally and talked to the media about the substance of the negotiations. “We didn’t do any of that,” she says.

            Gil, one of the union’s negotiators, doesn’t think unions should pull punches. “This is ultimately a conflict between two classes, the class that works and the employer class, and our interests are at odds,” he says. “We didn’t think anything was out of bounds.”

            After 18 months of negotiations, both sides reached an agreement on a contract. It raises minimum pay from $15 to $20 an hour. Some workers saw their salaries jump from $38,000 a year to $60,000. Employees who have worked at the organization longer earn more money for each year of seniority they have. Hurst’s take-home salary jumped from $1,100 to around $1,400 per pay period. 

            A section of the agreement is devoted to racial justice, equity, and inclusion. The union is proud that the group is banned from using nondisclosure agreements, which are often used to silence employees who experience discrimination or harassment.

            The attorney that represented the law center, Joyce Goldstein, is happy with the contract, which she says provides generous vacation and other benefits. But Brooks is disappointed that the process was so contentious. She thinks there’s a better way for staff and management to come to an agreement on how to run the workplace, especially if both sides have similar values as is often the case at nonprofits.

            Some experts say that when management voluntarily recognizes a union, negotiation can be less contentions and that educating both sides about the unfamiliar contract negotiation process can also help. 

            Even Gil, for all his suspicion of management, would like to see a better process. 

            “If you hold yourself out to be a progressive nonprofit, then walk the walk,” Gil says. “Let’s talk about how we can share power and be a model for the kind of society we want to live in.”

Part of it was the nature of the work: helping people in immigrant detention and in prison. It is high-stakes, high-stress work. But there was also something deeply wrong with the way the group operated and the very low pay, he says.“People burn out and they tire out, and then they leave,” says Gil, a program associate in the group’s criminal-justice-reform division. They didn’t have autonomy in their jobs, he says, and didn’t feel respected. Some folks left for more money, and others left to get away. “We had a problem with mismanagement and toxicity.”A union, Gil thought, could be the answer, so he and his co-workers decided to form one.Money was a key issue for staff at the nonprofit, which monitors hate groups and brings lawsuits over civil-rights, immigration, and criminal-justice issues. Jackie Hurst, who works as a bilingual administrative assistant, says that her department, part of the immigrant-justice project, had been chronically understaffed. After taxes and other deductions, Hurst took home just $1,100 for two weeks of work. She earned so little that she lives 54 miles away from the group’s Decatur, Georgia, office, where housing is cheaper. “Our pay was not sustainable,” she says.The Southern Poverty Law Center is far from alone. Nonprofit cultural institutions, advocacy groups, and social-service organizations have all had employees unionize. That includes big names like the Philadelphia Museum of Art and smaller ones like the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. Even as the economy cools and fears of recession grow, both union organizers and consultants who advise nonprofit leaders on the issue say nonprofit staff are continuing to unionize at the same fast pace.Roughly two dozen museums have unionized in the past three years, according to the American Alliance of Museums. The Nonprofit Professional Employees Union has grown from 300 workers at 12 organizations in 2018 to 1,500 workers at nearly 50 organizations today. Since 2019 the Nonprofit Employees United has unionized workers at 68 organizations. The NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America went from having five unions recognized in 2019 to 44 today.The increase in nonprofit unions comes at a time when unions have been rising in popularity among all Americans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796420,Pakistan army: Boating accident death toll rises to 51,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The death toll from a boating accident in a lake in northwest Pakistan over the weekend reached 51, the military said Tuesday. The wooden boat was carrying children and teachers from a seminary on a picnic.

            Police on Sunday said at least 10 students drowned after the large wooden boat they were in capsized in Tanda Dam in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. They said at the time that the vessel was carrying 25 people.

            Later, however, officials said the boat was overcrowded and in fact was carrying 57 people, mostly children, and at least 51 had died. Qismat Khan, area police chief for the district of Kohat, said authorities have handed over the victims' bodies for burial but police were still investigating. 











            The military said in a statement that divers from the army and local emergency service rescued five survivors. It said the search for the remaining person was continuing.

            Khan said the casualties might have been avoided if the owner of the boat, who also died in the incident, had provided life jackets to the picnic goers. Khan said divers from the army and local emergency service searched for missing boaters since the accident Sunday.

            Hundreds of relatives and family members of the missing children and their teachers waited near the lake for news.

            “Whenever divers returned with the bodies, we heard cries from the relatives of these children,"" he said. Footage and photos provided by the military showed divers in boats returning with at least three children who were rescued and later transported to a nearby hospital. They were among the five survivors and were listed in stable condition.

            The body of the owner of the boat, Sajid Din, was found Tuesday.

            Such accidents are common in Pakistan, where rickety wooden boats are often used to transport goods and people on rivers and lakes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796439,Tyre Nichols' family grieves 'on sacred ground' in Memphis,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — On the eve of the funeral for Tyre Nichols, who died days after a brutal beating by Memphis police officers just minutes from his home, his family was sharing remembrances and expressing grief.

            Nichols’ older brother, Jamal Dupree, lamented he was not there to save his brother from the attack he suffered at the fists and feet of the five officers, who have been charged with second-degree murder and other offenses.

            “I’ve been fighting my whole life and the one fight I needed to be here for, I wasn't here,"" said Dupree, adding that violence was against his brother's nature.











            “My brother was the most peaceful person I've ever met in life,” he said. “If my brother was here today and he had to say something, he'd tell us to do this peacefully.”

            The family gathered Tuesday evening with the Rev. Al Sharpton at the historic Mason Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis — where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his final speech the night before he was assassinated — to speak about Nichols and the latest developments in the case. Sharpton, who will eulogize Nichols at the funeral Wednesday morning, said he wanted the family to stand where King stood before they lay Nichols to rest. 

            “They’re standing on that ground because we will continue in Tyre's name to head up to Martin’s mountaintop. That’s why we wanted to start this right on this sacred ground. This is holy ground. And this family now is ours and they're in the hands of history,” Sharpton said.

            Among those expected in attendance Wednesday is Vice President Kamala Harris, who the White House said was invited by Nichols’ mother and stepfather, RowVaughn Wells and Rodney Wells. Harris spoke by phone with the Wells family on Tuesday, expressing her condolences and offering her support. President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Nichols’ family last week.

            Harris will be joined by former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a senior adviser to the president for public engagement, and Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior advisor and infrastructure implementation coordinator, who is a former mayor of New Orleans, said Harris’s press secretary, Kirsten Allen.

            
                Five Black officers have been fired and charged in Nichols’ Jan. 7 beating and subsequent death. Video of the beating, which was released publicly last week, shows that many more people failed to help Nichols, who was also Black, beyond the five officers charged in his death. 

            Two more Memphis police officers have been disciplined and three emergency responders fired in connection with Nichols’ death, officials said Monday. Officer Preston Hemphill, who is white, and another officer whose name wasn’t released, have been suspended, police said.

            Six of the officers involved were part of the so-called Scorpion unit, which targeted violent criminals in high-crime areas. Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said after the video's release that the unit has been disbanded. 

            “It’s a step in the right direction, but due to the severity of the situation it’s not enough,” Damion Carrick said as he participated in a protest Monday evening at Shelby Farms Park. “You got a man dragged out of his car, beaten senseless, to a pulp and nobody doing nothing about it. It’s heartbreaking.” 

            Nichols’ death was the latest in a string of early accounts by police about their use of force that were later shown to have minimized or omitted violent and sometimes deadly encounters. 

            Memphis Police Department officers used a stun gun, a baton and their fists as they pummeled Nichols during the nighttime arrest. Video shows Nichols running away from officers toward his house after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving. The video footage released Friday shows the 29-year-old father calling for his mother and struggling with his injuries as he sits helpless on the pavement.

            The five officers chatted and milled about for several minutes as Nichols remained on the ground, but other authorities were on the scene. Two Shelby County sheriff’s deputies also have been suspended without pay while their conduct is investigated.

            Nichols' sister, Keyana Dixon, was among more than 100 friends, family and supporters who gathered for a candlelight vigil Monday night at a skate park in Sacramento, where Nichols grew up, The Sacramento Bee reported.

            “This was his favorite place to skate,” she said at the vigil. “I just want to thank all of you for your continued support for our family, and making sure his name is never forgotten.”

            A childhood friend, Ryan Wilson, said he met Nichols at a skate park when he was 12 and they became fast friends, sharing their dreams for the future. Nichols had some struggles while young, but he focused on making others happy, Wilson said. 

            “I just feel like all he wanted to do was find his place in this world, and he just wanted to be happy,"" Wilson said. 

            Nichols' mother and step father have accepted an invitation to attend Biden’s State of the Union address next week at the Capitol. They will attend with Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, according to Vincent Evans, a spokesperson for the caucus.

            Nichols' funeral will be held at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis. After Sharpton's delivers the eulogy, Nichols' family attorney Ben Crump will issue a call to action. Others expected to be in attendance include Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, and Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd.

            The deaths of Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Floyd in Minneapolis, at the hands of police sparked protests across the nation about racial injustice.

(AP) — On the eve of the funeral for Tyre Nichols, who died days after a brutal beating by Memphis police officers just minutes from his home, his family was sharing remembrances and expressing grief.Nichols’ older brother, Jamal Dupree, lamented he was not there to save his brother from the attack he suffered at the fists and feet of the five officers, who have been charged with second-degree murder and other offenses.“I’ve been fighting my whole life and the one fight I needed to be here for, I wasn't here,"" said Dupree, adding that violence was against his brother's nature.“My brother was the most peaceful person I've ever met in life,” he said. “If my brother was here today and he had to say something, he'd tell us to do this peacefully.”The family gathered Tuesday evening with the Rev. Al Sharpton at the historic Mason Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis — where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his final speech the night before he was assassinated — to speak about Nichols and the latest developments in the case. Sharpton, who will eulogize Nichols at the funeral Wednesday morning, said he wanted the family to stand where King stood before they lay Nichols to rest.“They’re standing on that ground because we will continue in Tyre's name to head up to Martin’s mountaintop. That’s why we wanted to start this right on this sacred ground. This is holy ground. And this family now is ours and they're in the hands of history,” Sharpton said.Among those expected in attendance Wednesday is Vice President Kamala Harris, who the White House said was invited by Nichols’ mother and stepfather, RowVaughn Wells and Rodney Wells. Harris spoke by phone with the Wells family on Tuesday, expressing her condolences and offering her support. President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Nichols’ family last week.Harris will be joined by former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a senior adviser to the president for public engagement, and Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior advisor and infrastructure implementation coordinator, who is a former mayor of New Orleans, said Harris’s press secretary, Kirsten Allen.Five Black officers have been fired and charged in Nichols’ Jan. 7 beating and subsequent death. Video of the beating, which was released publicly last week, shows that many more people failed to help Nichols, who was also Black, beyond the five officers charged in his death.Two more Memphis police officers have been disciplined and three emergency responders fired in connection with Nichols’ death, officials said Monday. Officer Preston Hemphill, who is white, and another officer whose name wasn’t released, have been suspended, police said.Six of the officers involved were part of the so-called Scorpion unit, which targeted violent criminals in high-crime areas. Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said after the video's release that the unit has been disbanded.“It’s a step in the right direction, but due to the severity of the situation it’s not enough,” Damion Carrick said as he participated in a protest Monday evening at Shelby Farms Park. “You got a man dragged out of his car, beaten senseless, to a pulp and nobody doing nothing about it. It’s heartbreaking.”Nichols’ death was the latest in a string of early accounts by police about their use of force that were later shown to have minimized or omitted violent and sometimes deadly encounters.Memphis Police Department officers used a stun gun, a baton and their fists as they pummeled Nichols during the nighttime arrest. Video shows Nichols running away from officers toward his house after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796440,Santos steps down from House panels amid ethics issues,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Rep. George Santos of New York announced Tuesday he is temporarily stepping down from his two congressional committees, a move that comes amid a host of ethics issues and a day after he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 

            Santos has faced numerous calls for his resignation and is facing multiple investigations by prosecutors over his personal and campaign finances and lies about his resume and family background. 

            Santos was assigned to two fairly low-profile panels, the House Committee on Small Business and to the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Still, his arrival has left GOP leadership frequently answering questions about the congressman rather than about their priorities for the coming months.











            In a prepared statement, Santos said he wanted to focus on serving his constituents “without distraction."" 

            “I want to personally thank Speaker McCarthy for meeting with me to discuss the matter and allowing me to take time to properly clear my name before returning to my committees,"" Santos said. “To my constituents, I remain committed to serving the district, and delivering results for both New York’s Third Congressional District and for the American people.” 

            Before issuing the statement, Santos addressed Republican lawmakers in a weekly closed-door meeting they have when in Washington. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the decision was well-received from the GOP conference. “I think it was the appropriate thing to do and I was proud of him for getting up and doing this,"" Cole said.

            McCarthy met with Santos on Monday night but did not disclose their conversation.

            “You'll see,” McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.

            The questions surrounding Santos go beyond his misrepresentations to voters to include whether his congressional campaign followed the law in its reporting to the Federal Election Commission. There have been lingering questions about irregularities in his campaign committee's financial reports and the source of Santos’ wealth.

            If Santos’ campaign is found to have knowingly and willfully made any “materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation” on its paperwork, it could potentially face criminal charges, the FEC said in a letter to the campaign last week.

            Republicans described the decision by Santos to temporarily step down from the two House panels as voluntary. Rep. Roger Williams of Texas, the chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, said he was surprised.

            “The bottom line is that he’s chosen to be off committees until his situation gets handled at a level that he’s comfortable with,” Williams said. 

            
                Democrats have been highly critical of Santos as well as McCarthy for his efforts to oust three Democratic lawmakers from committees, while at the same time backing committee assignments for Santos, who has lied so thoroughly to his constituents about his background.

            “The hypocrisy just grabs you by the throat,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “This is a Republican speaker who is seating a human fraud, George Santos, on committees, a serial fabricator about every part of his existence.""

            McCarthy blocked Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., from being re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, though they will be able to serve on other committees. He's also committed to removing Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from serving on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, though such a move would come to the full House for a vote, where undoubtedly Democrats would renew questions about the propriety of allowing Santos to sit on committees as their members are being removed.

            Late Tuesday, House Republicans put in motion a process toward ousting Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, once she is formally seated on the panel for the new Congress. A vote by Republicans on a resolution to remove Omar from the committee could come as soon as Wednesday.

            McCarthy has little margin for error if he chooses to pursue her expulsion for remarks McCarthy has described as antisemitic regarding Israel. Omar has apologized, and said in a CNN interview Sunday she “might have used words at the time that I didn’t understand were trafficking in antisemitism.”

            Shortly after Omar arrived in Congress in 2019, the House approved a resolution condemning antisemitism and other forms of bigotry — without mentioning her by name — after she made remarks that critics said accused Israel supporters of having dual allegiances.

            At least two Republicans had said they won't vote for Omar's removal from the foreign affairs panel. They said Democrats were in the wrong for removing Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from their committees two years ago. And Republicans were making a similar mistake when it came to Omar.

            “It’s just wrong,” said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. “Let’s stop ruining this place. Let’s make it better.”

            But McCarthy appeared to be winning over some GOP skeptics. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., said previously “two wrongs do not make a right"" when it comes to ousting Omar. She issued a statement Tuesday reversing course and stating she would support a removal resolution after McCarthy expressed his willingness to add due process provisions. 

            “I think setting a precedent of allowing an appeal process for the Speaker’s and majority-party removal decisions is particularly important to freedom-loving legislators who usually are on the receiving end of issues like this,” Spartz said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796442,Suspects sought after Florida drive-by shooting wounds 11,"LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) — The four-door sedan pulled up near an intersection in a central Florida city where people were milling about, the tinted windows came down and people from inside the vehicle started shooting in all directions, wounding 11 men, including two critically, police officials said.

            Only a minute earlier, a school bus had dropped off children in the Lakeland neighborhood on Monday afternoon.

            “It sounded like one of those huge rolls of firecrackers tied up to each other,” said neighborhood resident Tina Smith, who lives 50 feet (15 meters) from the lot where the shootings took place. “But you knew it wasn’t firecrackers.”











            Authorities on Tuesday offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspects involved in the shooting in Lakeland, a city of 112,000 residents located about halfway between Tampa and Orlando.

            One of the critically-injured men was shot in the stomach, and the other was shot in the jaw. The others had non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities said Monday night that there were 10 shooting victims but updated that figure to 11 on Tuesday, adding that one of the injured men later had walked into a hospital with minor injuries.

            The victims were males between the ages of 20 and 35, said Lakeland Police Chief Sammy Taylor at a news conference.

            After the shootings, the vehicle peeled off. Detectives believed they found it Tuesday morning in a Lakeland neighborhood and planned to run lab tests on it to verify it was the vehicle involved in the shootings.

            “I’ve been here 34 years, and I can tell you I have never worked an event where this many people were shot at one time, ever,” Taylor said. “We consider ourselves to be a small town ... and when stuff like this happens, it hits home, for me, at least.”

            Taylor said investigators believe the shooting was a targeted attack and wasn't random. Some of the shooting victims were cooperating but others weren't, detectives said.

            Police said marijuana packaged for sale was found at the scene of the shooting, and investigators believe drug sales were taking place. While the lot was known for drug dealing and other street crime, nothing had ever taken place on the magnitude of the shootings, Smith said.

            “It's definitely unexpected,” Smith said. “But I still feel safe. It wasn't like the whole block was sprayed. They were coming with names on the bullets, obviously.”

            Taylor described the neighborhood of cinder block and wood frame bungalows with small yards as “challenged,” a place where a lot of renters reside, and he said the police had focused a lot of attention on the area in recent years. Many of the homes have bars on the windows, and on Tuesday multiple bullet holes could be seen in the window of a nearby apartment building near the empty lot where the shootings took place.

            Miguel Joseph, a neighborhood resident, said drug dealing was common at the lot, and he believed the suspects came from outside the neighborhood.

            “That’s all they do, every day,” Joseph said of the drug selling. “I hope they don’t come here anymore.”

            The police chief said officers had tried to remove “the criminal element” from the neighborhood, and they had put “quite a few people in jail from that neighborhood,” but often former criminals return to dealing drugs when they get out of jail.

            “It's a tough neighborhood and there are some challenges,” Taylor said. “We've put a lot of resources and manpower in trying to fix that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796443,"Durenberger, former US senator from Minnesota, dies at 88","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Former U.S. Senator David Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who espoused a progressive brand of politics and criticized the GOP after his political career, died Tuesday at age 88.

            Durenberger’s health had declined in recent months, his longtime spokesperson Tom Horner said. Horner told The Associated Press that Durenberger died Tuesday morning of natural causes. He was at his St. Paul home surrounded by family.

            Durenberger — a former executive secretary to GOP Gov. Harold LeVander, former corporate attorney and former captain in the U.S. Army Reserve — won a U.S. Senate seat in 1978. He served three terms and championed health care reform. He pushed proposals to expand Medicare benefits, protect rights for disabled people, including the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, and to promote gender equity.











            “Senator Dave Durenberger was a true public servant,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said in a statement. Klobuchar, who holds Durenberger’s old seat, said he had personally showed her much kindness when she was first elected in 2006.

            “He was a dedicated legislator who was always guided by his devotion to bipartisanship and improving people’s lives,” Klobuchar said. “His work to advance the Americans with Disabilities Act and prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities changed millions of lives for the better and made our nation stronger.”

            Democratic Gov. Tim Walz will give a eulogy at Durenberger's funeral next Tuesday at the former senator's alma mater, St. John’s University in Collegeville, Horner said.

            “His work on health care reform saved lives,” Walz said in a statement. “He was deeply kind, generous, and honest, and he put his work on behalf of Minnesota above all else. He valued collaboration and bipartisanship in the spirit of improving peoples’ lives.”

            Durenberger’s first wife, Judy, died of breast cancer in 1970, leaving him a widower raising four sons. Dave Durenberger, his son, said he stayed an active father, attending their athletic matches.

            When he ran for office in the late 1970′s, his sons helped stuff envelopes at their dining room table, joined parades and helped on the campaign.

            “He was sort of our north star for how we needed to live our lives,” Dave Durenberger said.

            As he rose through the Senate, Durenberger went through troubled periods in his personal life. He separated from his wife, Penny, in 1985 -- a personal agony he openly discussed with several reporters at the time. He married Susan Foote, a former member of his staff, in 1995.

            Dave Durenberger said his father in recent years was a frequent presence at his grandchildren’s school and sports events. Durenberger showed his family how to value people, regardless of their social status, he said.

            “He tried to find the goodness or the common bond that he shared with everybody. Everybody had the potential to be his friend -- whether it was the King of Jordan or the Jordanian immigrant driving a cab,” Dave Durenberger said.

            But Senator Durenberger's career took a downturn in 1990. He was unanimously censured by the Senate following an Ethics Committee investigation into payments he received for book royalties and federal reimbursements for stays in a Minneapolis condo. In 1995, Durenberger also pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges related to the condo payments.

            “If there is a smudge on the Seal of the United States Senate, or on the Star of the North, as we like to call our state, I will work my hardest to polish both back to brightness,” Durenberger told his Senate colleagues after his censure.

            He decided not to run for reelection in 1994. Following his exit from politics, he worked with a number of initiatives focused on health care policy. As chair of the National Institute of Health Policy at the University of St. Thomas Opus College of Business, he addressed systemic health care problems.

            As the Republican Party tilted toward fiscal conservatives focused on slashing government programs, Durenberger became a critic. He told a Minnesota political podcast in 2005 that Democrats are “better equipped to carry the day” on health care policy, though he said at the time he would not become a Democrat.

            In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, he endorsed Democrats Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden over Donald Trump. And in 2018, he wrote a book with political reporter Lori Sturdevant titled, “When Republicans Were Progressive.” It mourned a nearly-extinct wing of the GOP in which lawmakers prided themselves on bipartisanship and sought to assist vulnerable people.

Dave Durenberger, his son, said he stayed an active father, attending their athletic matches.When he ran for office in the late 1970′s, his sons helped stuff envelopes at their dining room table, joined parades and helped on the campaign.“He was sort of our north star for how we needed to live our lives,” Dave Durenberger said.As he rose through the Senate, Durenberger went through troubled periods in his personal life. He separated from his wife, Penny, in 1985 -- a personal agony he openly discussed with several reporters at the time. He married Susan Foote, a former member of his staff, in 1995.Dave Durenberger said his father in recent years was a frequent presence at his grandchildren’s school and sports events. Durenberger showed his family how to value people, regardless of their social status, he said.“He tried to find the goodness or the common bond that he shared with everybody. Everybody had the potential to be his friend -- whether it was the King of Jordan or the Jordanian immigrant driving a cab,” Dave Durenberger said.But Senator Durenberger's career took a downturn in 1990. He was unanimously censured by the Senate following an Ethics Committee investigation into payments he received for book royalties and federal reimbursements for stays in a Minneapolis condo. In 1995, Durenberger also pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges related to the condo payments.“If there is a smudge on the Seal of the United States Senate, or on the Star of the North, as we like to call our state, I will work my hardest to polish both back to brightness,” Durenberger told his Senate colleagues after his censure.He decided not to run for reelection in 1994. Following his exit from politics, he worked with a number of initiatives focused on health care policy. As chair of the National Institute of Health Policy at the University of St. Thomas Opus College of Business, he addressed systemic health care problems.As the Republican Party tilted toward fiscal conservatives focused on slashing government programs, Durenberger became a critic. He told a Minnesota political podcast in 2005 that Democrats are “better equipped to carry the day” on health care policy, though he said at the time he would not become a Democrat.In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, he endorsed Democrats Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden over Donald Trump. And in 2018, he wrote a book with political reporter Lori Sturdevant titled, “When Republicans Were Progressive.” It mourned a nearly-extinct wing of the GOP in which lawmakers prided themselves on bipartisanship and sought to assist vulnerable people.___Groves reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796444,"Who benefits? Spain, Catalan separatists dispute EU ruling","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The European Union’s top court issued a ruling Tuesday that allows Spain to make another attempt to seek the extradition of a former Catalan separatist politician living in Brussels.

            But the Court of Justice of the EU introduced several caveats that do little to clarify what is to come next in a legal and diplomatic saga that is five years running and shows no sign of ending anytime soon.

            Spain has unsuccessfully tried to get Belgium to hand over former Catalan government member Lluís Puig since he and ex-Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont fled Barcelona along with other cohorts following their illegal 2017 secession bid for Spain’s Catalonia region.











            The Belgian courts justified their repeated refusals by agreeing with Puig that Spain’s Supreme Court, which requested his extradition, lacked jurisdiction — instead arguing that a lower court in Catalonia should take the case — and that he would not get a fair trial.

            However, the European court based in Luxembourg, in a ruling made on a request by Spain’s Supreme Court to clarify the situation, said an EU country should only refuse to execute a European Arrest Warrant issued by another member state under “exceptional” circumstances.

            That would mean, the court said, that a judge would have to determine that the person to be extradited would be at risk of not receiving a fair trial due to “the systemic or generalized deficiencies in the operation of the judicial system of the issuing Member State"" or “deficiencies affecting the judicial protection of an objectively identifiable group of persons to which the person concerned belongs.”

            The court also said that Spain could issue a new arrest warrant for Puig.

            Where the decision leaves Puig, and the precedent it could set for Puigdemont, is unclear.

            Puig celebrated the decision from Brussels, saying “we will continue our fight.”

            His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, who also represents Puigdemont, has repeatedly said that their defense is founded on the claim that Spain’s judiciary is biased against Catalan separatism.

            But the spokeswoman for Spain’s government, Isabel Rodríguez, said that the decision backs the position of Spain’s Supreme Court and reduces the options for Puig and Puigdemont.

            “This decision appears to mean that it will make it easier for Puigdemont to finally stand before a Spanish court,” she said.

            Puigdemont himself is awaiting a ruling on his immunity as an European Parliament member that is expected in the coming months.

            Spain’s government issued partial pardons in 2021 to the nine leaders of the 2017 bid who did not flee and were later convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds, in an attempt by central authorities to reduce tensions with wealthy northeast Catalonia. 

            The left-wing government in charge in Madrid also recently reformed laws on sedition and embezzlement which had been used to prosecute the separatist leaders.

            Mario Pereira, professor of law at Spain's University of Navarra, said that the decision by the European court may be nothing more than a small win for Spanish judge Pablo Llarena, the magistrate who has led the extradition requests.

            “Luxembourg has said that judge Llarena acted correctly … and that the European Union, the European Union warrant system, and Belgium’s justice failed,” Pereira said.

            “But that doesn’t mean that (the Catalan separatists) have lost” since Belgium could still deny an extradition, he said.

            Polls and elections in recent years show that Catalans are roughly equally divided over the secession question.BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The European Union’s top court issued a ruling Tuesday that allows Spain to make another attempt to seek the extradition of a former Catalan separatist politician living in Brussels.But the Court of Justice of the EU introduced several caveats that do little to clarify what is to come next in a legal and diplomatic saga that is five years running and shows no sign of ending anytime soon.Spain has unsuccessfully tried to get Belgium to hand over former Catalan government member Lluís Puig since he and ex-Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont fled Barcelona along with other cohorts following their illegal 2017 secession bid for Spain’s Catalonia region.The Belgian courts justified their repeated refusals by agreeing with Puig that Spain’s Supreme Court, which requested his extradition, lacked jurisdiction — instead arguing that a lower court in Catalonia should take the case — and that he would not get a fair trial.However, the European court based in Luxembourg, in a ruling made on a request by Spain’s Supreme Court to clarify the situation, said an EU country should only refuse to execute a European Arrest Warrant issued by another member state under “exceptional” circumstances.That would mean, the court said, that a judge would have to determine that the person to be extradited would be at risk of not receiving a fair trial due to “the systemic or generalized deficiencies in the operation of the judicial system of the issuing Member State"" or “deficiencies affecting the judicial protection of an objectively identifiable group of persons to which the person concerned belongs.”The court also said that Spain could issue a new arrest warrant for Puig.Where the decision leaves Puig, and the precedent it could set for Puigdemont, is unclear.Puig celebrated the decision from Brussels, saying “we will continue our fight.”His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, who also represents Puigdemont, has repeatedly said that their defense is founded on the claim that Spain’s judiciary is biased against Catalan separatism.But the spokeswoman for Spain’s government, Isabel Rodríguez, said that the decision backs the position of Spain’s Supreme Court and reduces the options for Puig and Puigdemont.“This decision appears to mean that it will make it easier for Puigdemont to finally stand before a Spanish court,” she said.Puigdemont himself is awaiting a ruling on his immunity as an European Parliament member that is expected in the coming months.Spain’s government issued partial pardons in 2021 to the nine leaders of the 2017 bid who did not flee and were later convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds, in an attempt by central authorities to reduce tensions with wealthy northeast Catalonia.The left-wing government in charge in Madrid also recently reformed laws on sedition and embezzlement which had been used to prosecute the separatist leaders.Mario Pereira, professor of law at Spain's University of Navarra, said that the decision by the European court may be nothing more than a small win for Spanish judge Pablo Llarena, the magistrate who has led the extradition requests.“Luxembourg has said that judge Llarena acted correctly … and that the European Union, the European Union warrant system, and Belgium’s justice failed,” Pereira said.“But that doesn’t mean that (the Catalan separatists) have lost” since Belgium could still deny an extradition, he said.Polls and elections in recent years show that Catalans are roughly equally divided over the secession question.",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796447,Difficulty measuring methane slows plan to slash emissions,"NEW YORK (AP) — The doors of a metal box slide open, and a drone rises over a gas well in Pennsylvania. Its mission: To find leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, so that energy companies can plug the leaks and reduce the emissions that pollute the air. 

            The drone is among an array of instruments whose purpose is to detect leaks of methane, which scientists say causes roughly 30% of manmade global warming. Along with satellites, ground sensors and planes armed with infrared cameras, drones are part of the backbone of a new federal policy to compel energy companies to record and slash their methane emissions.

            The problem is, no one knows when — or even whether — that will be possible. Technology that might allow for precise methane measurements is still being developed. Under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, enacted into law last year, companies must start producing precise measurements of their methane emissions next year and face fines if they exceed permissible levels. Yet if no one knows how much methane an energy company has emitted, it's unclear that any fines could be justified.











            “They don’t measure the methane because the capability hasn’t been there,” Drew Shindell, a professor of earth science at Duke University, said of regulators. “It’s challenging to really go measure all these methane sources.”

            Even energy companies that have begun developing systems to reduce their methane emissions are likely years away from being able to make comprehensive calculations Most of them are measuring leaks for only a fraction of their operations.

            Satellites, which help connect emissions to a single source, aren't widely enough available. Ground-based sensors and drones require vast amounts of money and time to widely distribute. 

            On top of all that, any agreement on what equipment would be acceptable to measure methane and how it should be used requires a rigorous process involving industry, government and environmental scientists.

            “We need to develop these standards, and this can take years, so the process is slow,” said Thomas Lauvaux, a climate scientist at University of Reims in France. 

            Despite the obstacles, climate scientists and environmentalists say they still welcome the administration's effort, under the Inflation Reduction Act, to slash methane emissions. Even if the timeline outlined in the law's methane reduction program is unrealistic, they say, it's likely to prod companies to accelerate their efforts to reduce leaks.

            “The fact that there are these rules and now a pricing regime for methane for the first time is a huge benefit for dealing with the oil and gas sector that we just haven’t had the tools to do until now,” said Deborah Gordon, senior principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which seeks to accelerate a transition to clean energy.

            Under the new law, the EPA can fine companies $900 per ton of methane starting in 2024, rising to $1,500 in 2026. For companies with significant leaks, the costs could be substantial. Kayrros, a satellite analytics firm, observed a Texas natural gas compressor station that released about 2,000 tons of methane over eight days in 2020. That leak would trigger fines of of $1.8 million if it occurred in 2024 or $3 million in 2026.

            Most energy companies don’t measure their actual methane emissions. Instead, they produce estimates based on how much methane they say typically escapes from their equipment.

            Scientists have found that those estimates vastly understate the problem. Using data from satellites and aerial surveys, they concluded in peer-reviewed studies that nations and companies are emitting double or triple as much methane as they're reporting. 

            “The past three years have been the fastest-growing years on record in terms of methane emissions, which is kind of scary,” said Daniel Jacob, a leading climate scientist at Harvard University. “It’s absolutely critical because ultimately, from the standpoint of evading climate change, you want to stop methane from increasing and you want it to start decreasing.”

            And while scientists count it as progress that energy companies will eventually have to accurately measure emissions of the destructive gas, it seems doubtful that this can be achieved within a year, after which the government could fine companies for emitting too much methane.

            “We need many more satellites before we can even pretend that we are tracking,” Lauvaux said.

            The companies that are now gathering emission measurements from planes, drones, ground sensors or infrared cameras on satellites face a significant obstacle: Those efforts are sporadic and cover only a sliver of the vast oil and gas industry.

            The EPA hasn’t yet released details on how companies should measure methane emissions. And the task of sorting out the details falls on an EPA staff that was depleted under the Trump administration.

            Methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, has been shown to produce roughly 80 times the climate-warming power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The gas is released from pipelines, storage tanks and energy facilities. It also wafts from landfills and the cattle industry. Scientists say a substantial reduction in the emissions is among the changes that could make the swiftest impact on climate change. 

            Though oil and gas companies have equipment to capture methane leaks, it's not widely deployed. Even the most advanced such equipment is often improperly installed or maintained and is prone to failure.

            “If we can collectively get our act together over the next eight years and dramatically slash methane emissions around the planet, we still have a chance as a society to get our arms around the larger climate problem and avoid the worst impacts,” said Riley Duren, CEO of Carbon Mapper, a nonprofit that analyzes emissions data from satellites and flights.

            In recent years, climate scientists and companies have found and fixed methane leaks using infrared cameras on airplanes or satellites. In a series of flights over California and other states since 2016, Carbon Mapper detected 8,000 methane plumes and published its findings on a public portal. When Carbon Mapper alerted the facilities to the problem, Duren said, roughly half the leaks were fixed. 

            “It’s still a patchwork quilt,” he said of the nation’s ability to measure methane emissions. “It’s not comprehensive and continuous, but it’s becoming more expansive.”

            Aided by philanthropic donations, Carbon Mapper hopes to launch a network of satellites that would share data publicly. It would start this year with two philanthropy-funded satellites that can detect roughly 200 methane plumes each day. (Planes can typically find 10 to 20 a day.)

            “The goal is to expand to many more satellites, but that’s contingent on securing the capital to do that,” Duren said.

            The company has suggested that government help would be needed to operate at the scale necessary to combat climate change.

            A handful of orbiting satellites can detect methane plumes and pinpoint the source of the leak within about 100 feet (30 meters). Most are privately owned by companies such as GHGSat, which sells data to energy companies. Using that data, scientists at a satellite data firm or energy company can try to pinpoint leaks and, based on the image and wind speed at the time, estimate how much methane was emitted. 

            Yet there are limitations to the technology. Infrared cameras use the sun’s rays, so they can’t detect methane at night or on cloudy days. And they provide only a snapshot in time. So it can be hard to determine how much methane escaped before a leak was detected.

            With GHGSat’s six orbiting satellites, the company can produce images of a site once every three to five days. The company plans to have 10 of them in orbit by year's end, after which it could observe each site roughly once a day.

            “The biggest challenge for us is to scale faster, to offer the service to more people in more places around the world more often,” said Stephane Germaine, president of GHGSat. “How do we respond to that in a way that is commercially viable, short of a government standing up and spending billions of dollars to deploy this kind of system?”

            Drones produced by American Robotics, like the one in Pennsylvania, have found unlit flares emitting methane. These drones can make several trips each day to check oil wells or storage tanks. But they’re not widely deployed. American Robotics expects to have 30 drone systems deployed by year's end, said Reese Mozer, the company's CEO.

            “There’s more demand for our systems than we have the capacity to serve right now,” Mozer said. 

            Exxon Mobil has been using airplanes equipped with infrared cameras to find methane leaks for several years. But data from aerial flights is imperfect. A plane may fly over an oil production site for two or three seconds, perhaps six times a year.

            “The problem with quantification is, you don’t know what happens when the plane’s not there,"" said Matt Kolesar, Exxon’s chief environmental scientist. ""What was going on right before that airplane, and what was going on right after that airplane? And so that’s where industry has always struggled to say, ‘Do I assume it happens until I go look again? Do I assume it goes away?’ ”

            Exxon is installing around-the-clock methane detectors in the Permian Basin, the nation's most productive oil and gas field, comprising large chunks of Texas and New Mexico. It's installed the sensors in 14 sites; its goal is to deploy sensors at 700 sites by 2025. But just 15% of the oil and gas Exxon produces comes from the Permian Basin. So most of Exxon’s sites won’t receive the sensors soon.

            “It requires an awful lot of additional capacity, both continuous coverage and covering a much larger portion of the facilities,” said Shindell, the Duke professor. 

            Thousands of sites of methane leaks, he said, might exist in areas like the Permian Basin.

            “There are just tons of lines that gather from wells and then compressor stations that move the gas along and then storage tanks and just one thing after another, so getting a sense of that really is a big endeavor,” Shindell said. “Even the best companies are not doing that. So it requires building this whole new system to improve understanding.”

            The EPA is still in the early stages of implementing the climate law. The agency plans to propose a rule this year that would change emissions reporting rules to ensure that reporting and calculation of fines are based on empirical data, said Khanya Brann, an EPA spokeswoman. 

            The EPA has also proposed allowing energy companies to use a broader range of technologies to detect methane leaks than what’s now allowed. This could make it easier for varying types of companies to comply.

            The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, wants companies to have the flexibility to use a variety of technologies. The API doesn't track how much of the industry already uses methane monitors, drones, aerial flights or satellite data to find and measure emissions, said Cole Ramsey, a vice president of the institute. 

            “This is a process that’s going to take some time,” Ramsey said.

            The challenges don’t end with adding satellites and sensors. Any measurement system created by scientists must withstand legal challenges. If a company is accused of emitting methane, it could dispute the accuracy of the satellite images or the way scientists calculated how much leaked.

            “The minute we release a policy,"" Lauvaux said, “they’re going to jump at it with 50 lawyers and look at any loopholes, gaps, mistakes, unclear sentences.”

            Even so, climate scientists and environmentalists generally say they're hopeful that even if the system is imperfect, the eventual fines for improperly emitting methane would cause the offending companies to take the steps necessary to reduce emissions.

            “That’s the great thing about the methane fee: There’s actually a benefit to stopping it quickly because there’s a financial reward for not leaking,” said Gordon, of the Rocky Mountain Institute.

            “I think the problems are way smaller than the opportunity to finally, finally deal directly with a greenhouse gas — and especially a very powerful greenhouse gas that has never been on the agenda.""NEW YORK (AP) — The doors of a metal box slide open, and a drone rises over a gas well in Pennsylvania.

The company plans to have 10 of them in orbit by year's end, after which it could observe each site roughly once a day.“The biggest challenge for us is to scale faster, to offer the service to more people in more places around the world more often,” said Stephane Germaine, president of GHGSat. “How do we respond to that in a way that is commercially viable, short of a government standing up and spending billions of dollars to deploy this kind of system?”Drones produced by American Robotics, like the one in Pennsylvania, have found unlit flares emitting methane. These drones can make several trips each day to check oil wells or storage tanks. But they’re not widely deployed. American Robotics expects to have 30 drone systems deployed by year's end, said Reese Mozer, the company's CEO.“There’s more demand for our systems than we have the capacity to serve right now,” Mozer said.Exxon Mobil has been using airplanes equipped with infrared cameras to find methane leaks for several years. But data from aerial flights is imperfect. A plane may fly over an oil production site for two or three seconds, perhaps six times a year.“The problem with quantification is, you don’t know what happens when the plane’s not there,"" said Matt Kolesar, Exxon’s chief environmental scientist. ""What was going on right before that airplane, and what was going on right after that airplane? And so that’s where industry has always struggled to say, ‘Do I assume it happens until I go look again? Do I assume it goes away?’ ”Exxon is installing around-the-clock methane detectors in the Permian Basin, the nation's most productive oil and gas field, comprising large chunks of Texas and New Mexico. It's installed the sensors in 14 sites; its goal is to deploy sensors at 700 sites by 2025. But just 15% of the oil and gas Exxon produces comes from the Permian Basin. So most of Exxon’s sites won’t receive the sensors soon.“It requires an awful lot of additional capacity, both continuous coverage and covering a much larger portion of the facilities,” said Shindell, the Duke professor.Thousands of sites of methane leaks, he said, might exist in areas like the Permian Basin.“There are just tons of lines that gather from wells and then compressor stations that move the gas along and then storage tanks and just one thing after another, so getting a sense of that really is a big endeavor,” Shindell said. “Even the best companies are not doing that. So it requires building this whole new system to improve understanding.”The EPA is still in the early stages of implementing the climate law. The agency plans to propose a rule this year that would change emissions reporting rules to ensure that reporting and calculation of fines are based on empirical data, said Khanya Brann, an EPA spokeswoman.The EPA has also proposed allowing energy companies to use a broader range of technologies to detect methane leaks than what’s now allowed. This could make it easier for varying types of companies to comply.The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, wants companies to have the flexibility to use a variety of technologies. The API doesn't track how much of the industry already uses methane monitors, drones, aerial flights or satellite data to find and measure emissions, said Cole Ramsey, a vice president of the institute.“This is a process that’s going to take some time,” Ramsey said.The challenges don’t end with adding satellites and sensors. Any measurement system created by scientists must withstand legal challenges. If a company is accused of emitting methane, it could dispute the accuracy of the satellite images or the way scientists calculated how much leaked.“The minute we release a policy,"" Lauvaux said, “they’re going to jump at it with 50 lawyers and look at any loopholes, gaps, mistakes, unclear sentences.”Even so, climate scientists and environmentalists generally say they're hopeful that even if the system is imperfect, the eventual fines for improperly emitting methane would cause the offending companies to take the steps necessary to reduce emissions.“That’s the great thing about the methane fee: There’s actually a benefit to stopping it quickly because there’s a financial reward for not leaking,” said Gordon, of the Rocky Mountain Institute.“I think the problems are way smaller than the opportunity to finally, finally deal directly with a greenhouse gas — and especially a very powerful greenhouse gas that has never been on the agenda.""",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796448,Lukashenko: Belarus willing to offer more help to Russia,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday that his country is willing to offer more assistance to close ally Russia in its war against Ukraine.

            But Lukashenko stressed that Russia does not need “any help” right now.

            “However, if our Russian brothers need help, we are always ready to offer such assistance,” he said on a state visit to the southern African nation of Zimbabwe — which is also close to Russia.











            Lukashenko was speaking through a translator in a brief response to a question on whether his country is under pressure to step up its support for Russia in the nearly yearlong war against Ukraine.

            Lukashenko did not specify what that help would entail.

            Belarus allowed Russia to stage part of its invasion from its territory last February and has also been a launching pad for Russian missiles into Ukraine. But Belarus hasn't committed any of its troops to the war.

            Russia and Belarus have engaged in joint military exercises on Belarusian territory this month and Ukraine says it has maintained forces along its border with Belarus to fend off any potential invasion.

            The Pentagon says that it hasn’t seen any Russian troop movement in Belarus that would indicate an imminent attack.

            Also, analysts have said that if Belarus’ small and inexperienced military gets involved, the additional troops could help Moscow cut off some key transportation corridors but it's unlikely to significantly help Russia's position.

            
                Lukashenko arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday in a visit that seeks to cement economic and political ties between two countries.

            The visit, according to Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry, is aimed at boosting “strong cooperation in political, economic, mining, agriculture and disaster risk management.""

            Belarus has provided Zimbabwe with farm equipment such as tractors, combine harvesters and trucks under a deal worth tens of millions of dollars following Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s visit to Minsk in 2019.

            On Tuesday, the two countries signed several agreements ranging from agriculture to taxation and education.

            Lukashenko also offered to sell potash fertilizer to Zimbabwe, adding that despite Western sanctions, Belarus “was able to sell big amounts of potash fertilizer.”

            “There are states ready to cooperate with Belarus,” he said.

            Lukashenko's visit to Zimbabwe comes soon after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's latest trip to Africa. Lavrov visited South Africa, Eswatini, Angola and Eritrea last week, pulling on some of Moscow's historic ties to the continent to rally support for Russia's position and blame the West for the war in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796449,UN expert: Deaths of Bangladeshi migrants should be probed,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The countries where Bangladeshi migrant workers are employed, including former World Cup host Qatar, should thoroughly investigate all cases of deaths and human rights violations, a United Nations expert said Tuesday.

            Asked about the reported deaths of at least 450 Bangladeshi workers involved in construction projects in Qatar including stadiums used for the World Cup, U.N. special rapporteur for the human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales said the destination country should deal with any deaths to uphold the rights of workers. 

            “The deaths connected to (the) World Cup, well, the situation in Qatar has been addressed by my mandate, my office. We have sent a number of communications to Qatar. This is, of course, not the matter at stake here to assess the behavior of Qatar in a specific manner,” he said at a news conference in Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka. 











            As a general matter, he said, the destination countries for Bangladeshis ""should investigate and prevent, investigate and sanction all the human rights violations, particularly deaths that have occurred in many cases.” 

            Separately, Bangladesh’s High Court on Monday asked the government to provide a list of about 450 Bangladeshi workers who reportedly died in Qatar between 2010 and 2022 while they were engaged in building infrastructure, including stadiums. 

            The High Court ruled in response to a petition that the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates’ Welfare must submit a report within four weeks about the dead workers and whether their families have been compensated. The petition said the workers who died were treated “inhumanely” in Qatar and sought the court’s intervention.

            Morales said he had met with some people during his visit to Bangladesh whose relatives had died abroad. 

            “It's not entirely clear in each and every case how the deaths occurred. So it’s indispensable that the countries of destination conduct thorough investigations of the killings or the deaths,” he said. 

            Morales also recommended that Bangladesh do more to ensure the rights of its migrant workers. 

            More than 10 million Bangladeshis live abroad, most of them employed in Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia.

            Morales said he also visited refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district which house more than 1 million minority Rohingya who fled from persecution in neighboring Myanmar.

            “It’s true that there are security concerns. I think it is a tremendous challenge to address the situation of almost 1 million people living in those overcrowded conditions. And it’s very important to enhance the coordination between the U.N. agencies and the government in this regard,” he said.

            He said the situation could improve if the refugees receive training. 

            “I think it’s very important to have advances in terms of having different type of initiatives for the Rohingya there, including the provision of training of different skills to improve their education so they can have more normal lives, as far as the conditions of the environment allow of course,” he said.

            Of the more than 1 million Rohingya refugees, about 740,000 crossed the border starting in August 2017 when Myanmar's military launched a “clearance operation” against them following attacks by a rebel group.

            A federal jury convicted Ibraheem Izzy Musaibli, 32, on Monday of charges of providing and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group, conspiring to provide material support to the group, and attending an Islamic State training camp.

            The Dearborn, Michigan, man faces a maximum 50-year prison sentence at his sentencing, which is set for May 11, federal prosecutors said.











            Musaibli’s lawyer, John Shea, declined to comment on Monday's verdict, The Detroit News reported.

            Musaibli, a natural-born U.S. citizen, was captured by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in 2018, flown back to the U.S. and charged in July 2018. He was convicted following a 9-day trial in U.S. District Court in Detroit, prosecutors said.

            According to evidence presented at his trial, Musaibli traveled to Yemen in April 2015 and continued his previous research into the Islamic State group there, including downloading propaganda from the group and a book on how to get into Syria.

            He then traveled in the fall of 2015 from Yemen to Syria, where he attended a religious training camp run by the Islamic State before undergoing military training where he learned to shoot, carry, and otherwise handle an AK-47 assault rifle, according to trial evidence.

            After graduating from the Islamic State's military training camp, Musaibli swore allegiance to the group and its leader and remained with the group for over 2 1/2 years, prosecutors said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796452,FDA revamping foods program to move past ‘constant turmoil’,"The head of the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced an overhaul of the agency’s food safety and nutrition division, vowing that a new structure will better protect consumers and the U.S. food supply. 

            FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he would create a new human foods program led by a deputy commissioner with authority over policy, strategy and regulatory activities for the part of the agency that oversees 80% of the foods Americans eat. 

            “This is one of the most important changes in the history of the FDA,” Califf said in an interview. 











            The move merges two existing FDA programs and some regulatory authorities. Tapping a single leader “unifies and elevates the program while removing redundancies, enabling the agency to oversee human food in a more effective and efficient way,” Califf said. 

            The announcement follows months of scrutiny of FDA over contamination at a Michigan factory that led to a nationwide infant formula shortage. And it follows a scathing report that found FDA’s food division was plagued by decentralized leadership, indecisiveness and a culture of “constant turmoil” that impeded actions to protect public health. For years, the agency has been criticized for responding too slowly to outbreaks in produce, heavy metals in baby food and the need to reduce sodium in the U.S. diet, among other issues. 

            Califf’s actions drew mixed reviews from food safety advocates. Some said it was a good start, while others said he didn’t go far enough to dismantle ingrained structural problems.

            “I think it does a good job of identifying the essential problems and addressing them head-on,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which focuses on consumer nutrition, food safety and health. 

            Mike Taylor, who previously served as FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, said the new deputy doesn’t appear to have full authority over the office responsible for inspecting company plants, laboratory testing, imports and investigations.

            “If that's the case, the human foods program at the FDA will remain fragmented and the deputy commissioner will not be empowered to make the change that is necessary,” Taylor said. 

            Califf said that the deputy commissioner will have authority over the human foods budget and priorities. He said it would be a mistake to create “a monolithic organization"" to overcome aversion to change. 

            “Just because there's been resistance in the past, it doesn't mean it can't work,” Califf added. 

            The changes aim to straighten out a convoluted leadership structure. The FDA oversees human and veterinary drugs and medical devices, along with much of the U.S. food supply. The Agriculture Department also oversees some food products. 

            Frank Yiannas, the current FDA deputy commissioner for food policy and response, is leaving his post next month. Susan Mayne, director of the current Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement that Califf asked her to stay on through the transition. The new deputy, who will report directly to the commissioner, will be named by spring, Califf said.

            The revamped foods program will include a separate center focused on nutrition, including foods such as infant formula, plus an office to coordinate state efforts to identify and prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. The plan also calls for a new expert advisory committee to weigh in on food safety, nutrition and new food technologies. 

            Under the new structure, the deputy commissioner will not oversee FDA’s veterinary medicine center. Califf said that's because much of the center’s work involves animal drugs and devices, not food. In addition, the animal feed industry worried that it would become “subsidiary to human food,” Califf said. 

            That disappointed Mitzi Baum, president of the nonprofit STOP Foodborne Illness. Human foods, animal foods and outbreaks are often closely linked and they should be part of the same program, she said. 

            “Any change is messy. It’s going to be disruptive,” Baum said. “Why not make all of the changes that need to be made in order to create the most efficient and effective agency?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796453,"Mexico's growth slows to 0.4% in 4Q, 3.6% in 2022","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s economy slowed in the last quarter of 2022 but still managed to advance by 0.4%, bringing economic expansion for the full year to 3.6%, the National Statistics Institute announced Tuesday. 

            The country’s gross domestic product had expanded by 0.9% in the third quarter, but the effects of high domestic interest rates and inflation slowed growth in the fourth quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796455,"Experts seek investigation of Wagner Group, Mali forces","GENEVA (AP) — Independent human rights experts working with the U.N. on Tuesday called for an investigation of possible abuses, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government forces in Mali and the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian military contractor.

            More than a dozen experts, who focus on issues as various as the use of mercenaries, torture, and violence against women and girls, cited accounts of “horrific executions, mass graves, acts of torture, rape and sexual violence” and other alleged crimes over the last two years by government forces and “their allies” in the area of central Mopti and elsewhere in the restive West African country.

            “We are particularly worried by credible reports that over the course of several days in late March 2022, Malian armed forces accompanied by military personnel believed to belong to the Wagner Group, executed several hundred people, who had been rounded up in Moura, a village in central Mali,” the experts said in a statement.











            The experts said they were “disturbed by the apparent increased outsourcing of traditional military functions to the so-called Wagner Group in various military operations.""

            
                Western officials say hundreds of fighters from the Wagner Group began working more than a year ago alongside Mali’s armed forces to try to stem a decade-long insurgency by Islamic extremists in the West African country. 

            Diplomats, analysts and human rights groups say indiscriminate violence against civilians has grown since the mercenaries arrived, warning that extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have only become stronger.

            The outside experts, who aren't U.N. staff, work under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council in Geneva to help keep tabs on a vast array of human rights concerns around the world. 

            “The lack of transparency and ambiguity over the legal status of the Wagner Group, combined with reprisals against those daring to speak out, create an overall climate of terror and complete impunity for victims of the Wagner Group’s abuses,” the experts said, adding that they've relayed their concerns directly to the government in Bamako.GENEVA (AP) — Independent human rights experts working with the U.N. on Tuesday called for an investigation of possible abuses, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government forces in Mali and the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian military contractor.More than a dozen experts, who focus on issues as various as the use of mercenaries, torture, and violence against women and girls, cited accounts of “horrific executions, mass graves, acts of torture, rape and sexual violence” and other alleged crimes over the last two years by government forces and “their allies” in the area of central Mopti and elsewhere in the restive West African country.“We are particularly worried by credible reports that over the course of several days in late March 2022, Malian armed forces accompanied by military personnel believed to belong to the Wagner Group, executed several hundred people, who had been rounded up in Moura, a village in central Mali,” the experts said in a statement.The experts said they were “disturbed by the apparent increased outsourcing of traditional military functions to the so-called Wagner Group in various military operations.""Western officials say hundreds of fighters from the Wagner Group began working more than a year ago alongside Mali’s armed forces to try to stem a decade-long insurgency by Islamic extremists in the West African country.Diplomats, analysts and human rights groups say indiscriminate violence against civilians has grown since the mercenaries arrived, warning that extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have only become stronger.The outside experts, who aren't U.N. staff, work under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council in Geneva to help keep tabs on a vast array of human rights concerns around the world.“The lack of transparency and ambiguity over the legal status of the Wagner Group, combined with reprisals against those daring to speak out, create an overall climate of terror and complete impunity for victims of the Wagner Group’s abuses,” the experts said, adding that they've relayed their concerns directly to the government in Bamako.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796456,"Mets lock up batting champion McNeil on $50M, 4-year deal","NEW YORK (AP) — Batting champion Jeff McNeil and the New York Mets finalized a $50 million, four-year contract Tuesday that avoided a salary arbitration hearing.

            The move was the latest by the high-spending Mets. who added pitcher Justin Verlander and David Robertson, catcher Omar Narváez and outfielder Tommy Pham, and also reached a $162 million, eight-year deal to keep outfielder Brandon Nimmo.

            ""It starts with ownership,” McNeil said at a news conference. “They want to put a winner on the field. It’s been pretty amazing to see what that’s looked like the last few years.”











            He gets $6.25 million this year, $10.25 million in 2024 and $15.75 million in each of the following two years. The Mets have a $15.75 million option for 2027 with a $2 million buyout, a season that if exercised would make the agreement worth $63.75 million over five years.

            He would get $100,000 for winning the World Series MVP, $50,000 for League Championship Series MVP, Gold Glove, Silver Slugger or making the All-Star team. McNeil would receive a one-time $500,000 assignment bonus if traded, payable by the receiving team. He also gets a hotel suite on road trips.

            A two-time All-Star, McNeil led the majors with a .326 average last season. The second baseman asked for a raise from $3 million to $7.75 million this year, while New York offered $6.25 million.

            He was the only one of seven Mets eligible for arbitration who did not agree to terms on a deal and formally exchanged salary proposals with the team at the Jan. 13 deadline.

            But the sides settled on a multiyear agreement weeks later, avoiding arguments before a three-person panel in St. Petersburg, Florida.

            McNeil, who turns 31 in April, could have become a free agent following the 2024 season but agreed to push that back at least two years, possibly three.

            An excellent contact hitter and a versatile defender, McNeil also made 44 starts in the outfield last season: 33 in left field and 11 in right. He had an .836 OPS at the plate with nine home runs, 39 doubles and 62 RBIs in 148 games for a Mets team that made its first playoff appearance in six years.

            He won a Silver Slugger Award and finished 15th in NL MVP voting.

            McNeil is a .307 career hitter in 4 1/2 big league seasons with 46 homers and an .827 OPS. He has struck out only 242 times in 2,039 plate appearances.

            McNeil was drafted by the Mets in the 12th round out of Long Beach State in 2013.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796461,European court rejects intersex birth certificate plea,"The European Court of Human Rights rejected a challenge to French law Tuesday by an individual who sought to have their birth certificate changed to recognize them as intersex.The Strasbourg court said French authorities had not violated the European Convention on Human Rights in rejecting the individual's request. The court is part of the European Council, which works to protect human rights in its 46 member states and is not part of the EU.Intersex people defy gender norms of male or female and are often born with these characteristics.A person born in 1951 who is identified as male on his birth certificate brought forth the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Medical certificates indicate that the individual was biologically determined to be intersex not long after birth and this status had not been altered.For these reasons, they sought to remove ""male"" from their birth certificate and see it replaced with either ""neutral"" or ""intersex.""A court in Tours, France, agreed to a reassignment on the person's birth certificate. However, that decision was overturned by an appeals court in Orleans and an additional high court dismissed an appeal. And now the European Court of Human Rights has backed that decision.The court did acknowledge in a statement, ""the discrepancy between the applicant's biological identity and his legal identity was liable to cause him suffering and anxiety.""The court noted that French authorities had not violated the private or family life of the intersex individual at the center of the case.The need for a reliable administrative sorting of gender status was foremost in the court's decision. If a ""neutral"" or ""intersex"" gender status were to be introduced, the move would have to follow France's procedures and therefore come through the French Parliament.If the judges had agreed to the change, the rights court argued that it would have performed a normative role that belongs to the state and its legislators and the society more broadly. The court ruled the administrative pace of such changes was up to France.ar/nm (dpa, KNA)",2023/01/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796463,"Veteran AP, Plain Dealer reporter Mark Gillispie dies at 63","Mark Gillispie, a veteran journalist who wrote about many of Ohio’s biggest stories and characters during a four-decade career primarily with The Associated Press and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, has died. He was 63.

            Gillispie, who was diagnosed with cancer last fall, died Sunday while in hospice care, his children, Sam Gillispie and Martha Hanna Gillispie, said Monday.

            After joining the AP in 2014 as a reporter in its Cleveland bureau, he wrote about the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, a breakaway Amish group that carried out beard-cutting attacks, and a statehouse bribery investigation involving Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. He was sent to the scenes of several major breaking stories, including the 2018 massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue. He was one of the AP's leading reporters on the opioid crisis and its legal aftermath for communities in Ohio and beyond.











            Gillispie previously worked at The Plain Dealer for 24 years, writing investigative stories that included reporting on mortgage fraud and questionable overtime practices by Cleveland police. He also covered police, courts and local government, including the corruption case of former U.S. Rep. James Traficant.

            He could put up a gruff exterior but just as easily show sensitivity to people dealt bad news. In the newsroom, he enjoyed offering guidance to young reporters.

            “Journalism was Mark’s passion — poring over complicated documents, digging deep into stories, sharing sage advice to new reporters. But it was his family he was most passionate about,” said Christina Paciolla, AP's deputy director for text and former Ohio state news editor. “We’d often swap stories of our families, and bond over everything from baseball to living with grief. We will all miss Mark terribly as a colleague but more importantly, as a friend.” 

            At The Plain Dealer, he worked with his wife, Mary Lou Gillispie, a copy and design editor. He wrote lovingly about their marriage and about grieving her after she died of cancer in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

            They were married in a Las Vegas chapel by a “man in a green leisure suit and a bad pompadour,"" he wrote.

            “Mary Lou and I were the quintessential journalist couple. We met at a small paper outside Cleveland and snagged the big-city newspaper jobs we dreamed about,” he wrote.

            The personal essay was a departure for someone who built a reputation as a tough but fair reporter who held public officials and institutions accountable.

            “The pain endures, yet the darkness is slowly lifting,” Gillispie wrote two months after his wife's death. “I comfort myself with thoughts of how our final weeks in isolation were the most poignant of our 30 years together.

            “The pandemic helped teach me the meaning of abiding love in all its guises. For that, I will be forever grateful.”

            Gillispie grew up in Perry, Ohio, along Lake Erie. He was an avid cook, golfer, poker player and Cleveland sports fan, dreaming of the day when the city would celebrate a World Series championship.

            He studied theater for a while at Wright State University, performed in community theater and enjoyed singing, though, he rarely shared his talent. 

            He surprised his daughter at her wedding last year, serenading her with “Sunrise, Sunset” from ""Fiddler on the Roof.” 

            Gillispie served in the U.S. Army as a finance and accounting specialist, a time in his life that he said was transformative. He began his journalism career near his hometown at The News-Herald in Willoughby, where he was a reporter and editor. He met his wife there.

            In addition to his two children, survivors include a brother and two sisters.Mark Gillispie, a veteran journalist who wrote about many of Ohio’s biggest stories and characters during a four-decade career primarily with The Associated Press and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, has died. He was 63.Gillispie, who was diagnosed with cancer last fall, died Sunday while in hospice care, his children, Sam Gillispie and Martha Hanna Gillispie, said Monday.After joining the AP in 2014 as a reporter in its Cleveland bureau, he wrote about the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, a breakaway Amish group that carried out beard-cutting attacks, and a statehouse bribery investigation involving Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. He was sent to the scenes of several major breaking stories, including the 2018 massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue. He was one of the AP's leading reporters on the opioid crisis and its legal aftermath for communities in Ohio and beyond.Gillispie previously worked at The Plain Dealer for 24 years, writing investigative stories that included reporting on mortgage fraud and questionable overtime practices by Cleveland police. He also covered police, courts and local government, including the corruption case of former U.S. Rep. James Traficant.He could put up a gruff exterior but just as easily show sensitivity to people dealt bad news. In the newsroom, he enjoyed offering guidance to young reporters.“Journalism was Mark’s passion — poring over complicated documents, digging deep into stories, sharing sage advice to new reporters. But it was his family he was most passionate about,” said Christina Paciolla, AP's deputy director for text and former Ohio state news editor. “We’d often swap stories of our families, and bond over everything from baseball to living with grief. We will all miss Mark terribly as a colleague but more importantly, as a friend.”At The Plain Dealer, he worked with his wife, Mary Lou Gillispie, a copy and design editor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796464,New Mexico candidate indicted in drive-by shooting case,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A political newcomer who lost his bid for the New Mexico statehouse has been indicted on charges of allegedly orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials.

            A Bernalillo County grand jury returned a 14-count indictment Monday against Solomon Peña, prosecutors said. The counts include criminal solicitation to commit shooting at a dwelling, shooting at a dwelling, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and possession of a firearm by a felon. 

            The 39-year-old felon remains in custody after a judge last week ordered him to be held without bond pending trial. 











            Detectives identified Peña as their key suspect using a combination of cellphone and vehicle records, witness interviews and bullet casings collected at the lawmakers’ homes.

            Authorities arrested Peña on Jan. 9, accusing him of paying for a father and son and two other unidentified men to shoot at the officials’ homes between early December and early January. The shootings followed his unsuccessful Republican bid for a district long considered a Democratic stronghold. He claimed the election was rigged.

            No one was hurt, but the case reignited the debate over whether lawmakers should make it harder for people accused of violent crimes to make bail. Lawmakers during this legislative session also are considering a measure that would shield the home addresses of elected officials.

            Prosecutors have outlined Peña’s previous time in prison and described him as the “ringleader” of a group that he assembled to shoot at people’s homes, saying ballistics testing determined that a firearm found in the trunk of a car registered to Peña was linked to at least one shooting. Another man was found driving that car and was arrested on an unrelated warrant. 

            Peña’s defense attorney has raised questions about the credibility of a confidential witness that shared information with authorities, saying some of the statements used in a criminal complaint were contradictory. She also argued her client’s criminal history did not involve any violent convictions or crimes involving firearms and that he has not been in trouble with the law — other than two traffic citations — since his release from prison in 2016.

            Court records show Peña was incarcerated for several years after being arrested in 2007 in connection with what authorities described as a smash-and-grab burglary scheme that targeted retail stores. His voting rights were restored after he completed probation in 2021.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796467,US reassures Kosovo it won't support Serb-majority ministate,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — The United States on Tuesday reassured Kosovars that it wouldn't support the creation of a Serb-majority ministate in Kosovo — like one in Bosnia — as Washington attempts to convince the country to accept a controversial association.

            The U.S. Embassy in Pristina met with a group of civil society leaders, government officials and political leaders to discuss the Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities, or ASM.

            “We do not support any arrangement that violates Kosovo’s Constitution,” U.S. Ambassador Jeff Hovenier said after the meeting. “We strictly oppose the creation of any entity resembling Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”











            The ASM's aim is to coordinate the work of Serb-dominated municipalities on education, health care, urban and rural planning and local economic development.

            Pristina has been reluctant to accept the creation of the ASM, fearing that it could lead to the creation of a ministate — like Republika Srpska in multi-ethnic Bosnia-Herzegovina.

            The ambassador urged Pristina “to provide its own vision for an ASM that it believes protects Kosovo’s future as a sovereign, independent, multiethnic, democratic state and that provides for minority rights.”

            “This is critical, important, and urgent,” he added, also offering “expertise and political support to ensure that it works in the best interest of all Kosovans.”

            On Monday, U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet and Gabriel Escobar, special envoy for the Western Balkans, published an op-ed as part of U.S. and European Union efforts to promote “a healthy, peaceful, and sustainable relationship between Serbia and Kosovo.”

            U.S. and EU envoys have visited Pristina and Belgrade over the past few weeks to encourage both sides to accept a new proposal for the two countries to normalize relations and boost their EU accession bids.

            The proposal’s details haven't yet been made public. 

            A few hundred Kosovo Albanians held a demonstration against the association.

            “We are neither against the Serbs, nor the international community, but we are against the association, which would not allow Kosovo’s development,” protester Rudi Berisha said.

            The ASM’s establishment was agreed on in Brussels in 2013, and the details in another agreement in 2015, and approved in the Kosovo parliament. But Kosovo’s Constitutional Court later deemed it unconstitutional, because it wasn't inclusive of other ethnicities and could entail executive powers.

            An EU-mediated Kosovo-Serbia dialogue has been ongoing since 2011, but few of the 33 signed agreements have been implemented.

            The dispute between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo has remained a source of instability in the Balkans long after the 1998-99 war, which ended with a NATO intervention that forced Serbia to pull out of the territory.

            In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, which Belgrade has refused to recognize, supported by Russia and China. The U.S. and most EU nations have recognized Kosovo as a sovereign nation.PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — The United States on Tuesday reassured Kosovars that it wouldn't support the creation of a Serb-majority ministate in Kosovo — like one in Bosnia — as Washington attempts to convince the country to accept a controversial association.The U.S. Embassy in Pristina met with a group of civil society leaders, government officials and political leaders to discuss the Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities, or ASM.“We do not support any arrangement that violates Kosovo’s Constitution,” U.S. Ambassador Jeff Hovenier said after the meeting. “We strictly oppose the creation of any entity resembling Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”The ASM's aim is to coordinate the work of Serb-dominated municipalities on education, health care, urban and rural planning and local economic development.Pristina has been reluctant to accept the creation of the ASM, fearing that it could lead to the creation of a ministate — like Republika Srpska in multi-ethnic Bosnia-Herzegovina.The ambassador urged Pristina “to provide its own vision for an ASM that it believes protects Kosovo’s future as a sovereign, independent, multiethnic, democratic state and that provides for minority rights.”“This is critical, important, and urgent,” he added, also offering “expertise and political support to ensure that it works in the best interest of all Kosovans.”On Monday, U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet and Gabriel Escobar, special envoy for the Western Balkans, published an op-ed as part of U.S. and European Union efforts to promote “a healthy, peaceful, and sustainable relationship between Serbia and Kosovo.”U.S. and EU envoys have visited Pristina and Belgrade over the past few weeks to encourage both sides to accept a new proposal for the two countries to normalize relations and boost their EU accession bids.The proposal’s details haven't yet been made public.A few hundred Kosovo Albanians held a demonstration against the association.“We are neither against the Serbs, nor the international community, but we are against the association, which would not allow Kosovo’s development,” protester Rudi Berisha said.The ASM’s establishment was agreed on in Brussels in 2013, and the details in another agreement in 2015, and approved in the Kosovo parliament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796468,Judge drops R. Kelly sex-abuse charges at prosecutor's wish,"CHICAGO (AP) — A judge dismissed sex-abuse charges against R&B singer R. Kelly on Tuesday based on the recommendation of a Chicago prosecutor. 

            The hearing lasted just minutes and came a day after Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly will spend decades in prison for separate convictions in federal court.

            Kelly was awaiting trial on state charges of sexually abusing four people in the Chicago area, three of whom were minors. He was not present when Judge Lawrence Flood dismissed the indictments.











            Federal juries in Chicago and New York have convicted Kelly of a raft of crimes, including child pornography, enticement, racketeering and sex trafficking related to allegations that he victimized women and girls.

            Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence in the New York case and awaits sentencing on Feb. 23 in Chicago federal court.

            Foxx acknowledged Monday that some Kelly accusers would be disappointed. Indeed, Lanita Carter said justice was ""denied for me."" 

            “I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,"" Carter said Monday.

            Another sexual-misconduct case is pending in Hennepin County, Minnesota, where the Grammy Award-winner faces solicitation charges. Prosecutors haven’t said whether they still intend to take Kelly to trial.

            Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He beat child pornography charges in Chicago in 2008, when a jury acquitted him.

            Widespread outrage over Kelly’s sexual misconduct didn’t emerge until the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 release of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796470,Jitoboh's recovery coming into focus year after eye injury,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Jason Jitoboh won’t step foot onto a basketball court without his glasses. And he doesn’t even need them to see.

            The darkened lenses merely provide extra protection for what eyesight Jitoboh has remaining.

            Florida’s 6-foot-11 center took a finger to his left eye at Tennessee last January and spent the better part of a year trying to get right. He’s had four surgeries already and might have a fifth following the season.











            So when the Gators (12-9, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) host the second-ranked Volunteers (18-3, 7-1) on Wednesday night, Jitoboh will be focused on finding some closure on a trying and unexpected journey that started with a routine rebounding effort during a midweek game in Knoxville and continues a little more than 12 months later.

            “I’ve had this game marked for a while,” Jitoboh said.

            For good reason. Jitoboh left his last outing against the Vols bloodied and unable to see in one eye. He had surgery the next morning to repair a ruptured muscle that had prevented any eye movement. He had several more operations to repair a detached retina and optic nerve damage.

            Adding to disorientation and discomfort, doctors dropped protective oil into his healing eye and ordered him to lay face down for roughly 20 hours a day for three months. He would spend 50 minutes with his head in a massage pillow and then get a 10-minute break during which he’d try to cram in all his normal activities.

            “I would’ve gone crazy if I did that all day,” Jitoboh said. “So I tried to find loopholes. I’d stand up and look down. It was just finding different ways to heal and also live life.”

            With his parents living in Abuja, Nigeria, and unable to get to Gainesville on short notice, Jitoboh relied on head athletic trainer Duke Werner for moral support.

            “He got to the point where he didn’t know if he wanted to play again,” Werner said. “He got really down. … There’s been a real toll on this guy that people probably don’t realize. It was serious.”

            Jitoboh missed the final 14 games last season. His sight slowly started to return a few weeks after the injury. He could make out shapes, then colors. His peripheral vision returned, too, but his straight-ahead sight in that eye remained foggy for months — even to this day.

            “It’s been a long process, long journey for sure,” said Jitoboh, whose mother was able to join him in Gainesville for two weeks around his third surgery. “I think I’m most proud of not giving up, my resiliency, not just laying down and not letting it change my character, who I am as a person. I think that’s what I’m most proud of.

            “What I did is almost impossible. It would’ve been easier to lay down and give up and just let the obstacle win.”

            Jitoboh missed an entire semester of coursework because he couldn’t look at a computer screen, and he packed on a few extra pounds because he was unable to work out, let alone practice.

            He eventually gained clearance to return to the court in short stints last May, but “my depth perception was horrible.” Catching the ball was difficult; running without losing his balance was nearly impossible.

            Over time, as his workload increased, his brain started suppressing his left eye and recalibrating everything he does through the right one. He’s still a work in progress, coming off the bench to spell Colin Castleton and averaging 2.7 points and 1.5 rebounds while playing a little less than 10 minutes a game.

            But considering where he was a year ago, he'll take it.

            “Not a lot of guys can go through what he’s been through,"" Castleton said. “The biggest thing for me that really shocked me was just the approach he took every day, having a great, positive mindset. He has great energy.""

            Jitoboh, who attended Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tennessee, knows several of his upcoming opponents well. He holds no grudge against Tennessee senior Olivier Nkamhoua, who poked him during the rebound.

            He just wants his vision back to normal, something that will require more time and maybe another surgery.

            “I don’t want to show that I belong ’cause I know that I belong,” he said. “I just want to show people what I’m still capable of. Like, I can still play at a high level. I can still impact winning no matter what.”

(AP) — Jason Jitoboh won’t step foot onto a basketball court without his glasses. And he doesn’t even need them to see.The darkened lenses merely provide extra protection for what eyesight Jitoboh has remaining.Florida’s 6-foot-11 center took a finger to his left eye at Tennessee last January and spent the better part of a year trying to get right. He’s had four surgeries already and might have a fifth following the season.So when the Gators (12-9, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) host the second-ranked Volunteers (18-3, 7-1) on Wednesday night, Jitoboh will be focused on finding some closure on a trying and unexpected journey that started with a routine rebounding effort during a midweek game in Knoxville and continues a little more than 12 months later.“I’ve had this game marked for a while,” Jitoboh said.For good reason. Jitoboh left his last outing against the Vols bloodied and unable to see in one eye. He had surgery the next morning to repair a ruptured muscle that had prevented any eye movement. He had several more operations to repair a detached retina and optic nerve damage.Adding to disorientation and discomfort, doctors dropped protective oil into his healing eye and ordered him to lay face down for roughly 20 hours a day for three months. He would spend 50 minutes with his head in a massage pillow and then get a 10-minute break during which he’d try to cram in all his normal activities.“I would’ve gone crazy if I did that all day,” Jitoboh said. “So I tried to find loopholes. I’d stand up and look down. It was just finding different ways to heal and also live life.”With his parents living in Abuja, Nigeria, and unable to get to Gainesville on short notice, Jitoboh relied on head athletic trainer Duke Werner for moral support.“He got to the point where he didn’t know if he wanted to play again,” Werner said. “He got really down. … There’s been a real toll on this guy that people probably don’t realize. It was serious.”Jitoboh missed the final 14 games last season. His sight slowly started to return a few weeks after the injury. He could make out shapes, then colors. His peripheral vision returned, too, but his straight-ahead sight in that eye remained foggy for months — even to this day.“It’s been a long process, long journey for sure,” said Jitoboh, whose mother was able to join him in Gainesville for two weeks around his third surgery. “I think I’m most proud of not giving up, my resiliency, not just laying down and not letting it change my character, who I am as a person. I think that’s what I’m most proud of.“What I did is almost impossible. It would’ve been easier to lay down and give up and just let the obstacle win.”Jitoboh missed an entire semester of coursework because he couldn’t look at a computer screen, and he packed on a few extra pounds because he was unable to work out, let alone practice.He eventually gained clearance to return to the court in short stints last May, but “my depth perception was horrible.” Catching the ball was difficult; running without losing his balance was nearly impossible.Over time, as his workload increased, his brain started suppressing his left eye and recalibrating everything he does through the right one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796471,Slovakia's parliament sets early election for Sept 30,"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Slovakia's parliament on Tuesday approved Sept. 30 as the date for an early election in the country.

            Ninety-two lawmakers in the 150-seat National Council — two more than needed — voted in favor of the move that came a week after lawmakers amended the country’s constitution to make it possible to hold early elections.

            The Slovak Constitution previously didn't allow for an early election.











            After the coalition government led by Prime Minister Eduard Heger lost a no-confidence vote in parliament in December, President Zuzana Caputova gave lawmakers a Jan. 31 deadline to make the needed constitutional changes and approve a date for the snap vote.

            The opposition called the no-confidence vote following months of political crisis. Caputova asked Heger’s Cabinet to stay in office with reduced powers as a caretaker government.

            The president had said she would select a new prime minister and swear in her government if lawmakers didn't meet the Jan. 31 deadline.

            The Sept. 30 date was supported by the parties that formed the outgoing coalition government. The opposition wanted the election to be earlier — in June or May.

            The opposition would stand a good chance to win an early ballot, according to recent polls.

            The outgoing government has been donating arms to the Ukrainian armed forces while opening its border to refugees fleeing the war with Russia.

            Some current opposition leaders, including former populist Prime Minister Robert Fico, oppose military support for Ukraine and European Union sanctions against Russia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796472,Isco's move to Union Berlin called off amid disagreement,"BERLIN (AP) — Union Berlin's attempt to sign former Real Madrid star Isco Alarcón fell apart Tuesday, with the German club saying it called the deal off at the last moment. 

            The 30-year-old Isco had looked set to sign for Union as a free agent after undergoing a medical in Berlin on the final day of the transfer window, but club officials announced the deal had collapsed. 

            “We would have been happy to see Isco among us, but we have our limits. These were exceeded today, contrary to the previous agreement, so the transfer is not taking place,” Union general manager Oliver Ruhnert said.











            Gestifute, the player agency run by Jorge Mendes which represents Isco, declined to comment on why the deal fell apart. 

            Isco was earlier pictured in Berlin arriving for his medical check at the sports medicine department of the Charité hospital.

            The 30-year-old midfielder was available as a free agent after agreeing with Sevilla in December to cancel his contract less than five months after he joined the club. Isco scored one goal in 19 appearances across all competitions for Sevilla.

            He was expected to sign a deal with Union through 2024 with the option for another season.

            Ruhnert later suggested that Isco’s representatives demanded more than previously agreed with the club.

            “We had to discover that previously discussed things were different from the side of the player’s agent,” Ruhnert told Sky before Union’s German Cup game against Wolfsburg. “Before you go through with a medical, everything is discussed and everything was clear for us. Then changes to the contract were requested again.”

            Ruhnert said Union had been happy to proceed with what the club thought was already agreed.

            “After the changes there today, we said, ‘Not like that.’ Then it was clear for us to say – even if the player was already there – that we don’t get involved in anything that doesn’t suit us,” Ruhnert said. “In the end the player has to decide. He probably had other assumptions.""

            It would have been a marquee signing for a club that has steadily improved since clinching promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in 2019. Isco won the Champions League five times in a trophy-laden spell at Madrid from 2013-22. Union has never played in the competition.

            Isco, who played 38 times for Spain up to 2019, became a fan favorite at Madrid after joining in 2013 but did not play as much in recent seasons. Madrid did not renew his contract when it expired last year. Altogether he scored 53 goals and set up 57 more in 353 games for the Spanish giant.

            When Isco was surprisingly linked with Union in recent days, the club’s fans and players seemed to greet the speculation with disbelief. Union captain Christopher Trimmel posted a picture on Instagram of the players celebrating Saturday’s derby win at Hertha Berlin with the words “This victory is for you Isco” and a kissing emoji. Other players reacted with laughing emojis, while Isco himself reacted with a biceps emoji.

            Union is currently second in the Bundesliga, one point behind Bayern Munich after winning all three games since the winter break. It's the only current Bundesliga team to have played in the old East German league.

            Union was hosting Wolfsburg in the third round of the German Cup, while it faces Ajax in the first leg of their Europa League playoff in Amsterdam on Feb. 16.

            Isco would have been Union’s fourth winter singing following the transfers of Croatia right back Josip Juranović from Celtic, Tunisia midfielder Aïssa Laïdouni from Ferencvaros and French defender Jerome Roussillon from Wolfsburg.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796473,US sanctions Myanmar groups ahead of coup anniversary,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. said Tuesday it was imposing sanctions on a group of people and organizations connected to Myanmar's military regime as the two-year anniversary nears for the coup that removed the country's civilian government.

            Six people and three organizations were designed for sanctions, including the country's elections commission, several mining firms and their executives, and current and former military officials, according to the Treasury Department. The sanctions block access to money and resources under U.S. control. 

            The sanctions come as Myanmar's military has conducted aerial bombings and other attacks against pro-democracy forces, killing and displacing civilians. The military relies on fighter jets and helicopter gunships supplied by its allies Russia and China, according to the organization Myanmar Witness and other experts. 











            Myanmar’s military-controlled government has also enacted a new law on registration of political parties that will make it difficult for opposition groups to mount a serious challenge to army-backed candidates in a general election set to take place later this year.

            The administration uses a February 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden as its authority to impose the sanctions.

            ""The U.S. Department of the Treasury, along with partner nations like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia continue to stand with the people of Burma as they seek freedom and democracy,” Brian Nelson, Treasury's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.

            “The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who provide financial and material support to, and directly enable, the violent suppression of democracy in Burma.""

            A February 2021 military coup removed State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. Officials arrested her and top members of her governing National League for Democracy party, which had won a landslide victory for a second term in a November 2020 general election.

            The military crackdown triggered armed resistance in much of the country, plunging Myanmar into a prolonged civil war. 

            A human rights monitoring group said in a report Tuesday that Myanmar’s military is increasingly turning to airstrikes with deadly results to try to crush stiff armed resistance two years after it seized power. 

            According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks killings and arrests in Myanmar, 2,940 civilians have been killed and 17,572 have been arrested by authorities since the army takeover.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796474,Endangered rhino poaching nearly doubled in Namibia in 2022,"WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Rhino poaching in Namibia increased dramatically last year, with nearly twice as many of the critically endangered animals killed than the year before, the country's environment ministry says.

            The Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism released figures on Monday showing that 87 rhinos were poached in 2022, up from 45 in 2021.

            It was “a serious concern,” the ministry said.











            Of the 87 rhinos poached last year, 61 were black rhinos and 26 white rhinos, the ministry said. And 46 of those rhinos were poached at the Etosha National Park, Namibia's flagship game reserve.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796475,"Column: The only rivalry in golf is about tours, not players","PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Jon Rahm began his year by winning two in a row on the PGA Tour. Rory McIlroy began his year with birdies on the last two holes to win in Dubai.

            This would seem to have the look of golf's latest rivalry in the making, except that it will be difficult to replace the rivalry golf already has.

            It's a rivalry between tours, not players.











            That much was clear in Dubai when there was as much attention on McIlroy leading as the players who were chasing him.

            That starts with Patrick Reed, a thorn in McIlroy's side dating to that energy-draining Ryder Cup singles match at Hazeltine in 2016 that Reed won. Not to be forgotten is when they played in the final group of the 2018 Masters. Reed led by three and went on to win his lone major as McIlroy faded to a 74.

            But at various times Monday during the final round in Dubai, a chunk of LIV's roster was lined up behind McIlroy — Reed, Ian Poulter, Richard Bland, even Bernd Wiesberger made a push to get on the fringe of contention.

            McIlroy's star power is enough to carry any tournament. Reed plays the role of villain exceedingly well, and that made it even juicier. But no one was watching that production without thinking it was the establishment against the Saudi-funded newcomer.

            It was like that at the U.S. Open last summer at Brookline, quiet chatter about which LIV player would have the best finish (Dustin Johnson tied for 24th).

            Any other year, watching such talent as Rahm and McIlroy win early would prompt the tired phrase, “The Masters can't get here soon enough.” This year is no different, only the anticipation goes beyond who's playing well to who's playing where.

            Is that such a bad thing?

            Players with LIV Golf are outsiders in the established world of golf. And it will be that way at the other three majors, though the Masters most likely will have the most LIV players (16) in the field.

            The networks won’t want to talk about it. Everyone else will be thinking it.

            The presumption is LIV players are no longer as motivated with so much money already in the bank, that they won't be as sharp by competing over 54 holes with no cut against the same roster of players, many of them past their prime. What better place to prove otherwise, particularly since it will happen so infrequently?

            The European tour next week goes before an arbitration panel in London that effectively will determine if LIV players can keep showing up. Then again, the European tour schedule is such that it likely won't attract a strong field until the month leading up to the British Open.

            LIV players are not allowed on the PGA Tour. That court case isn't likely to be decided for at least another year.

            McIlroy has been the loudest voice, at times sounding petty, such as when he subtly pointed out upon winning the Canadian Open that his victory moved him past LIV leader Greg Norman in career PGA Tour titles.

            But he has put himself out there, and he has backed it up. Not only did McIlroy end last season as the FedEx Cup champion and eventually returned to No. 1 in the world, he delivered the goods on Monday in Dubai to beat a nemesis after an extraordinary week.

            Yes, this was personal.

            “I had to work really hard to forget about who was up there,” McIlroy said.

            McIlroy had not competed in two months and said he was most proud of winning without his best stuff. Even so, the presence of Reed — it had to be Reed — made it look at times as though he had more to lose than to gain.

            The week started ominously when Reed approached McIlroy on the range and got blanked, leading the American to casually flick a LIV tee in McIlroy's direction and later call him an “immature little child.”

            McIlroy, long a supporter of the toughness with which Reed plays, had reason to ignore him. He wasn't happy about being served a subpoena on Christmas Eve, even though that was from a lawsuit with which Reed was not involved. The subpoena was part of a lawsuit filed by Larry Klayman against the PGA Tour and European tour. Call it guilt by association, for Reed hired Klayman to file two defamation lawsuits against the media.

            They were sent off at roughly the same time on opposite sides of Emirates Golf Club for the opening two rounds, but they were never too far apart on the leaderboard. And if not for McIlroy making a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th to win, he would have faced Reed in a sudden-death playoff.

            That would have dwarfed a Brooks Koepka-Bryson DeChambeau pairing back when golf only thought it had a nasty rivalry.

            Of course, there was another side story in Dubai.

            Henrik Stenson wound up in the same group as Luke Donald in the third round. Both were appointed Ryder Cup captain for Europe last year. Donald will be leading his team at Marco Simone in September. Stenson will be coming off a LIV event at Rich Harvest Farms in the Chicago suburbs, which once hosted a Solheim Cup.

            Donald said it was just like any other round, and that's probably true. That doesn't mean the chatter will go away during the four majors. No one will one to talk about it. That doesn't mean they aren't thinking about it.

But no one was watching that production without thinking it was the establishment against the Saudi-funded newcomer.It was like that at the U.S. Open last summer at Brookline, quiet chatter about which LIV player would have the best finish (Dustin Johnson tied for 24th).Any other year, watching such talent as Rahm and McIlroy win early would prompt the tired phrase, “The Masters can't get here soon enough.” This year is no different, only the anticipation goes beyond who's playing well to who's playing where.Is that such a bad thing?Players with LIV Golf are outsiders in the established world of golf. And it will be that way at the other three majors, though the Masters most likely will have the most LIV players (16) in the field.The networks won’t want to talk about it. Everyone else will be thinking it.The presumption is LIV players are no longer as motivated with so much money already in the bank, that they won't be as sharp by competing over 54 holes with no cut against the same roster of players, many of them past their prime. What better place to prove otherwise, particularly since it will happen so infrequently?The European tour next week goes before an arbitration panel in London that effectively will determine if LIV players can keep showing up. Then again, the European tour schedule is such that it likely won't attract a strong field until the month leading up to the British Open.LIV players are not allowed on the PGA Tour. That court case isn't likely to be decided for at least another year.McIlroy has been the loudest voice, at times sounding petty, such as when he subtly pointed out upon winning the Canadian Open that his victory moved him past LIV leader Greg Norman in career PGA Tour titles.But he has put himself out there, and he has backed it up. Not only did McIlroy end last season as the FedEx Cup champion and eventually returned to No. 1 in the world, he delivered the goods on Monday in Dubai to beat a nemesis after an extraordinary week.Yes, this was personal.“I had to work really hard to forget about who was up there,” McIlroy said.McIlroy had not competed in two months and said he was most proud of winning without his best stuff. Even so, the presence of Reed — it had to be Reed — made it look at times as though he had more to lose than to gain.The week started ominously when Reed approached McIlroy on the range and got blanked, leading the American to casually flick a LIV tee in McIlroy's direction and later call him an “immature little child.”McIlroy, long a supporter of the toughness with which Reed plays, had reason to ignore him. He wasn't happy about being served a subpoena on Christmas Eve, even though that was from a lawsuit with which Reed was not involved. The subpoena was part of a lawsuit filed by Larry Klayman against the PGA Tour and European tour. Call it guilt by association, for Reed hired Klayman to file two defamation lawsuits against the media.They were sent off at roughly the same time on opposite sides of Emirates Golf Club for the opening two rounds, but they were never too far apart on the leaderboard. And if not for McIlroy making a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th to win, he would have faced Reed in a sudden-death playoff.That would have dwarfed a Brooks Koepka-Bryson DeChambeau pairing back when golf only thought it had a nasty rivalry.Of course, there was another side story in Dubai.Henrik Stenson wound up in the same group as Luke Donald in the third round. Both were appointed Ryder Cup captain for Europe last year. Donald will be leading his team at Marco Simone in September. Stenson will be coming off a LIV event at Rich Harvest Farms in the Chicago suburbs, which once hosted a Solheim Cup.Donald said it was just like any other round, and that's probably true. That doesn't mean the chatter will go away during the four majors. No one will one to talk about it. That doesn't mean they aren't thinking about it.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796476,No new hearing on condemned Missouri man's innocence claim,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The attorney for a Missouri man facing lethal injection next week said Tuesday that he will ask the state Supreme Court to postpone the execution by three or four months to allow more time to investigate his innocence claim.

            
                Leonard Taylor, 58, faces execution Feb. 7 for the deaths of his girlfriend and her three children in suburban St. Louis in 2004. Attorney Kent Gipson had asked St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell to request a hearing on Taylor's claim that he was out of state when the killings occurred. A relatively new provision in Missouri law allows a prosecutor to seek a hearing before a judge if evidence of a wrongful conviction emerges.

            But Bell said Monday that he wouldn't file such a motion, saying in a statement that “the facts are not there to support a credible case of innocence.” Bell said he would support a stay of execution “so his counsel may further investigate the time that the victims died.”











            Gipson said he would ask the Missouri Supreme Court to postpone the execution date by 90 to 120 days so that experts can seek to determine how long the victims were dead before their bodies were found — a question at the heart of the case.

            Unless the court intervenes, Missouri risks executing a potentially innocent man, Gipson said.

            ""I think any fair-minded person that looks at all the evidence we have now would have serious doubts about whether he's guilty, and that's all we're really asking for — to be able to be given an opportunity in front of a judge,"" Gipson said.

            Taylor had an extensive criminal record and was the live-in boyfriend of Angela Rowe. Her relatives had not heard from her for several days and asked police to go to her home in Jennings, Missouri. On Dec. 3, 2004, officers found the bodies of Rowe, her 10-year-old daughter Alexus Conley, 6-year-old daughter AcQreya Conley, and 5-year-old son Tyrese Conley.

            All four had been shot to death. Taylor was arrested days later in Kentucky.

            What remains unknown is precisely when the victims were killed. That's key to Taylor's innocence claim since he boarded a flight to California on Nov. 26, 2004 — eight days before the discovery of the bodies.

            Gipson said authorities first believed the killings happened only a few days before the bodies were found, at the time when Taylor was in California. But at Taylor’s trial, medical examiner Phillip Burch said the killings could have happened two or three weeks before the discovery of the bodies.

            “Several of (Rowe's) family members, and a neighbor who had no reason to lie at all, saw her alive after Leonard left town,” Gipson said.

            Meanwhile, Taylor's adult daughter, Deja Taylor, claimed in a recent court filing that she and her father called Angela Rowe during his visit to California. Deja Taylor said she spoke with Rowe and one of the children. The court filing said Deja Taylor's mother and sister corroborated her story.

            The execution would be the third in Missouri in three months, all involving cases out of St. Louis County. Kevin Johnson was executed in November for killing a police officer in 2005. Amber McLaughlin was put to death Jan. 3 for killing a woman in 2003. It was believed to be the first execution of a transgender woman in the U.S.ST.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796478,HarperCollins to cut North American workforce by 5%,"NEW YORK (AP) — HarperCollins Publishers plans to cut its workforce by 5% in the U.S. and Canada by the end of June, citing increased costs and lower sales in a statement released Tuesday. 

            The announcement comes the day before HarperCollins and the union representing some 250 striking employees are to meet with a federal mediator, the first negotiations since the strike began more than two months ago.

            HarperCollins cited similar issues in laying off a “small number” of staff members last fall. A new round of layoffs has already started, although the company expects reductions to come through a combination of layoffs and positions left unfilled.











            “As noted last October, HarperCollins continues to experience unprecedented supply chain and inflationary pressures resulting from the pandemic, including increased paper, manufacturing, labor, and distribution costs,” according to the company's statement. “Coupled with declining sales over the last few quarters, these issues have resulted in us having to make difficult decisions to realign the needs and resources of the business.""

            The company said it will implement “a variety of cost-saving measures” in addition to the workforce cuts in North America.

            HarperCollins, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, has around 4,000 employees worldwide, more than half located in North America.

            Editorial assistants, production designers and other mid- and entry-level employees have been on strike since Nov. 10, with salaries among the issues. The employees, who have been without a contract since last spring, are represented by Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers. 

            “The company has not communicated with us on this matter so we are still investigating the scope of layoffs,” Olga Brudastova, the local's president, told The Associated Press. 

            Most of the major New York publishers saw sales decline after 2021, one of the best years in recent memory for the industry, although none have announced the kinds of reductions intended by HarperCollins.

            “We will not legitimize the legislative work of a government that is demonstrably ... deviating from democracy,” opposition leader Alexis Tsipras, who heads the left-wing Syriza party, told reporters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796480,New gun regulations on stabilizing braces targeted in court,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservative and gun-rights groups challenged new federal regulations on pistols with stabilizing braces in court Tuesday, suing to block a gun-control action touted by President Joe Biden after the accessories were used in two mass shootings.

            Two lawsuits were filed in federal court in Texas against the move to treat the guns like short-barreled rifles, a weapon like a sawed-off shotgun that has been heavily regulated since the 1930s.

            The cases argue that millions of people have guns with the braces and use them to make firing “more accurate, and therefore safer,"" according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of three veterans by the conservative Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty.











            They said in the lawsuit that the new rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives forces owners into “unthinkable choices” of removing the brace, submitting to a national registry or opening themselves up to possible charges.

            “The new rule unlawfully usurps Congressional authority by significantly expanding the definition of ‘rifle’ under federal law and, with it, imposes potential criminal liability on millions of Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights,” the lawsuit argues. A decade ago, the ATF found that the braces did not make guns similar to short-barreled rifles. 

            The group Firearms Policy Coalition also challenged the new rule in another lawsuit filed in Texas.

            At least three million guns with stabilizing braces are in circulation in the U.S., according to the ATF. Other estimates place the number much higher, the suit claims. The plaintiffs are asking the court to block enforcement of the rule. 

            The regulation was one of several steps Biden announced in 2021 after a man using a stabilizing brace killed 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A stabilizing brace was also used in a shooting in Dayton, Ohio, that left nine people dead in 2019. 

            The agency declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The rule has drawn pushback from gun-rights groups since its proposal. 

            Stabilizing braces transform a pistol into a weapon that's powerful and easy to conceal, Attorney General Merrick Garland said when he announced the rule earlier this month. Originally developed for disabled veterans, the accessories became a loophole exploited by gunmakers to make weapons more deadly, gun-control groups said.WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservative and gun-rights groups challenged new federal regulations on pistols with stabilizing braces in court Tuesday, suing to block a gun-control action touted by President Joe Biden after the accessories were used in two mass shootings.Two lawsuits were filed in federal court in Texas against the move to treat the guns like short-barreled rifles, a weapon like a sawed-off shotgun that has been heavily regulated since the 1930s.The cases argue that millions of people have guns with the braces and use them to make firing “more accurate, and therefore safer,"" according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of three veterans by the conservative Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty.They said in the lawsuit that the new rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives forces owners into “unthinkable choices” of removing the brace, submitting to a national registry or opening themselves up to possible charges.“The new rule unlawfully usurps Congressional authority by significantly expanding the definition of ‘rifle’ under federal law and, with it, imposes potential criminal liability on millions of Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights,” the lawsuit argues.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796482,European king Real Madrid out to rule Club World Cup again,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Few would have expected Real Madrid to be competing for the Club World Cup title before the team's unlikely run to Champions League glory last season.

            Carlo Ancelotti’s team needed dramatic comebacks to defeat Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City before beating Liverpool in the final last May.

            It was further proof of Madrid's ability to produce on the biggest stage, and it means the Spanish powerhouse gets another opportunity to shine when the seven-team Club World Cup kicks off Wednesday in Morocco.











            Madrid is aiming to be crowned club world champion for a record-extending eighth time.

            The 14-times Champions League winner is the overwhelming favorite to do just that with Copa Libertadores champion Flamengo the only team that looks capable of beating the odds in Morocco.

            While the Seattle Sounders can dream of a historic victory, they have already earned a place in the record books by becoming the first MLS team to qualify for the Club World Cup.

            The Associated Press looks at some of the key issues ahead of the tournament.

            UNSTOPPABLE REAL?

            No other team can compare to Madrid's record in the Champions League and the same applies on the world stage.

            Its recent dominance in Europe — lifting the Champions League trophy five times in eight years — has made it a regular at the Club World Cup, which it has gone on to win in 2014 and from 2016-18.

            It is hard to see that sequence being halted in this year’s tournament, even if Real’s priorities are to successfully defend its Champions League and Spanish league titles.

            ENDING EUROPE’S DOMINANCE

            If any team can topple Real, it’s Flamengo, but the weight of history is against the Brazilians.

            The previous nine tournaments were won by European teams, with another Brazilian team, Corinthians, the last to take the title back to South America. That broke a five-year run of European victories.

            Perhaps the hiring of a European coach in Vitor Pereira, from Portugal, can be the difference for the Copa Libertadores champion.

            Pereira would make himself a club icon if he could.

            This would only be Flamengo’s second world championship title after beating Liverpool in the Intercontinental Cup final in 1981.

            In 2019, Flamengo came close to winning the trophy when it took Liverpool to extra time in the final.

            SOUNDERS MAKE HISTORY

            The Seattle Sounders vs. Real Madrid. That potential matchup is the stuff dreams are made of and it could become reality if the MLS team progresses to the semifinals.

            But Seattle has already made history, just by qualifying for the tournament after winning the CONCACAF Champions League last May.

            It is an underdog in Morocco and few would give it any hope of overcoming Madrid if the two teams meet. But perhaps it can be inspired by the host nation, which confounded expectations by reaching the semifinals of the World Cup in Qatar last month.

            Either way, it is a remarkable achievement for the Sounders, who before getting a shot at Madrid will face either Al Ahly or Auckland City.

            LATEST SAUDI STATEMENT

            While all the attention has been on Al Nassr in recent weeks because of Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival, it is another team from Saudi Arabia that will be mixing it up on the world stage.

            Al-Hilal is the country’s most successful team, having won 18 titles and four Asian Champions League titles, and could further raise the profile of Saudi soccer with some strong performances in the tournament, including a potential semifinals match against Flamengo.

            That would set the stage for the latest Saudi statement after the national team produced the shock of the World Cup by beating eventual champion Argentina in the group stage.

            UNCERTAIN FUTURE

            If FIFA has its way, it is only a matter of time before the Club World Cup is totally revamped.

            Gianni Infantino, the president of world soccer’s governing body, wants an expanded tournament of possibly 24 or 32 teams to be played during the summer, more akin to the World Cup.

            That will not happen until 2025 at the earliest, which means a midseason event, with only a small number of teams, will continue for the time being.

            A tournament that has traditionally been pushed down the list of priorities for European teams may finally become more worthy of its name when eventually expanded.

            Only then might it become one of the most coveted trophies in the sport.

That broke a five-year run of European victories.Perhaps the hiring of a European coach in Vitor Pereira, from Portugal, can be the difference for the Copa Libertadores champion.Pereira would make himself a club icon if he could.This would only be Flamengo’s second world championship title after beating Liverpool in the Intercontinental Cup final in 1981.In 2019, Flamengo came close to winning the trophy when it took Liverpool to extra time in the final.SOUNDERS MAKE HISTORYThe Seattle Sounders vs. Real Madrid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796485,"Bring back dodo? Ambitious plan draws investors, critics","WASHINGTON (AP) — The dodo bird isn’t coming back anytime soon. Nor is the woolly mammoth. But a company working on technologies to bring back extinct species has attracted more investors, while other scientists are skeptical such feats are possible or a good idea.

            Colossal Biosciences first announced its ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth two years ago, and on Tuesday said it wanted to bring back the dodo bird, too.

            “The dodo is a symbol of man-made extinction,” said Ben Lamm, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder and CEO of Colossal. The company has formed a division to focus on bird-related genetic technologies.











            The last dodo, a flightless bird about the size of a turkey, was killed in 1681 on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.

            The Dallas company, which launched in 2021, also announced Tuesday it had raised an additional $150 million in funding. To date, it has raised $225 million from wide-ranging investors that include United States Innovative Technology Fund, Breyer Capital and In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital firm which invests in technology.

            The prospect of bringing the dodo back isn't expected to directly make money, said Lamm. But the genetic tools and equipment that the company develops to try to do it may have other uses, including for human health care, he said.

            For example, Colossal is now testing tools to tweak several parts of the genome simultaneously. It's also working on technologies for what is sometimes called an “artificial womb,” he said.

            The dodo's closest living relative is the Nicobar pigeon, said Beth Shapiro, a molecular biologist on Colossal's scientific advisory board, who has been studying the dodo for two decades. Shapiro is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press’ Health and Science Department.

            Her team plans to study DNA differences between the Nicobar pigeon and the dodo to understand “what are the genes that really make a dodo a dodo,” she said.

            The team may then attempt to edit Nicobar pigeon cells to make them resemble dodo cells. It may be possible to put the tweaked cells into developing eggs of other birds, such as pigeons or chickens, to create offspring that may in turn naturally produce dodo eggs, said Shapiro. The concept is still in an early theoretical stage for dodos. 

            Because animals are a product of both their genetics and their environment — which has changed dramatically since the 1600s — Shapiro said that “it's not possible to recreate a 100% identical copy of something that's gone.”

            Other scientists wonder if it's even advisable to try, and question whether “de-extinction” diverts attention and money away from efforts to save species still on Earth.

            “There's a real hazard in saying that if we destroy nature, we can just put it back together again — because we can't,” said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who has no connection to Colossal.

            “And where on Earth would you put a woolly mammoth, other than in a cage?” asked Pimm, who noted that the ecosystems where mammoths lived disappeared long ago. 

            On a practical level, conservation biologists familiar with captive breeding programs say that it can be tricky for zoo-bred animals to ever adapt to the wild. 

            It helps if they can learn from other wild animals of their kind — an advantage that potential dodos and mammoths won't have, said Boris Worm, a biologist at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has no connection to Colossal. 

            “Preventing species from going extinct in the first place should be our priority, and in most cases, it's a lot cheaper,” said Worm.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796486,Church of England sheds light on 'shameful' slave trade ties,"LONDON (AP) — Three centuries ago, an enslaved person in Virginia wrote to a leader of the Church of England, begging to be released from “this cruel bondage.” There was no reply from the church, which at the time was accumulating a tidy profit from the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

            The handwritten letter from 1723 — whose author says they must remain anonymous for fear they will “swing upon the gallows tree” if exposed — has gone on display in London as part of efforts by the Anglican church to reckon with its historic complicity in slavery.

            “It’s a very poignant document, and also extraordinarily rare,” Giles Mandelbrote, archivist at the church’s Lambeth Palace Library, said Tuesday.











            The letter is included in an exhibition at the library exploring the church’s role in the 18th-cenury slave trade. It coincides with a new report setting out that role in hard facts and figures.

            The Church Commissioners, the body that administers the church’s 10 billion-pound ($12.3 billion) investment fund, hired forensic accountants in 2019 to dig through the church’s archives for evidence of slave trade links. They spent two years poring over centuries-old ledgers, and what they found is “shaming,” the church said.

            The investment fund has its roots in Queen Anne’s Bounty, established in 1704 to help support impoverished clergy. It invested heavily in the South Sea Company, which held a monopoly on transporting enslaved people from Africa to Spanish-controlled ports in the Americas. Between 1714 and 1739, the company transported 34,000 people on at least 96 voyages.

            The commissioners’ report says the church at the time knew what it was involved in. 

            “Investors in the South Sea Company would have known that it was trading in enslaved people,"" it said.

            The fund also received donations from individuals enriched by the slave trade, including Edward Colston, a British slave trader whose statue in his home city of Bristol was toppled by anti-racism protesters in 2020.

            Those ledgers recording the profits of human bondage are now on display, alongside documents showing how views of slavery within the church ranged from justification to opposition.

            Some Anglicans wanted to convert slaves to Christianity, while others saw that as a “slippery slope” that could lead to demands for freedom. The exhibition contains a version of the Bible intended for slaves, with all references to freedom from bondage removed. That meant cutting 90% of the Old Testament and half the New Testament.

            The exhibition includes tracts justifying slavery in religious terms, and others using faith to argue for abolition, including a 1680 book by Anglican clergyman Morgan Godwyn, who argued that those endorsing the slave trade were making a deal with the devil.

            There is a speech to Parliament from 1789 by leading abolitionist William Wilberforce, who would campaign for 18 more years before Britain outlawed the slave trade. And there is a letter to John Newton, the captain of a slave ship, from a trader who says “I have sent you one boy slave on board.” Newton later repented, became an abolitionist and wrote the hymn “Amazing Grace.”

            “In the late 18th century, increasingly there was more and more publicity about the horrors of the slave trade and the inhumanity of it, and that helped to generate a movement for abolition,” Mandelbrote said.

            Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1807, but did not legislate to emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833.

            When the commissioners' report was published Jan. 10, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby promised to “take action to address our shameful past.”

            That action includes a 100 million pound ($123 million) fund to support projects “focused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery.”

            The commitment falls short of demands from some campaigners for institutions that benefitted from slavery to pay compensation to descendants of the enslaved.

            “This isn’t about paying compensation to individuals, and its not really just about the money,” said Church Commissioners chief executive Gareth Mostyn. He said the new fund is part of the church’s “journey of repentance.”

            “No amount of money will ever be enough to repair the damage done through the trans-Atlantic slave trade,” he said. “But we hope that our response will be a means of investing in a better future for all.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796487,Column: Kennedy takes bold risks with NASCAR family business,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Ben Kennedy may someday be the head of NASCAR. 

            If it happens, it won't be a case of nepotism. Yes, he is the the great-grandson of NASCAR’s founder, but the 31-year-old graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in sports management and has spent his entire life learning the family business. 

            Once a little boy tagging alongside his grandfather to the hidden hot dog stand Bill France Jr. installed inside Daytona International Speedway, Kennedy grew up and eventually had to staff that snack shack. He's sold programs, parked cars, drove the truck that empties the waste from motorhomes and worked in the signage shops. 











            Kennedy gave it a go as a driver and entered 90 races at NASCAR's national level. He scored a victory in the Truck Series race at Bristol in 2016, the year he ran a full season and finished seventh in the standings. 

            But he's also seen as the future leader of NASCAR, which this year is celebrating its 75th season. NASCAR is currently run by his 78-year-old uncle, chairman Jim France, and his mother, Lesa France Kennedy, the executive vice chairman. 

            Once he turned in his firesuit, Kennedy moved into the operations side of NASCAR and is presently the senior vice president of racing development and strategy. He is young, progressive, unafraid to take gambles and returns this weekend to what will forever be a milestone moment in his young career. 

            It was Kennedy who devised the idea to take NASCAR's unofficial season-opening exhibition race to Los Angeles, where the iconic Coliseum is transformed into a temporary short track for a stock car race. It could have been a disaster of terrible racing, poor track conditions or a snoozefest for an LA audience with no shortage of entertainment options. 

            
                But it was a success and Kennedy, primarily the architect of NASCAR's most recent season-long schedules, put the Clash back at the Coliseum this Sunday for a repeat performance. Actor Rob Lowe is the grand marshal, Cypress Hill will play a pre-race concert and Wiz Khalifa will perform at halftime. 

            “The Coliseum, for us, was a huge, huge risk. And there were so many questions, and so much uncertainty, and frankly I was uncertain,” Kennedy said in an interview with The Associated Press at NASCAR headquarters overlooking Daytona International Speedway. “We knew as much as we possibly could, but we didn't know what the race was going to be like until we put cars on a temporary circuit inside a football stadium.” 

            Kennedy has a dream list of places he'd like to take NASCAR. For now, he is content returning to the Coliseum as a warm-up for the Feb. 19 season-opening Daytona 500. 

            “I think on many metrics last year was a a big success. So for us, it was very difficult to say ‘Hey, this was a really big success and now we’re going to go do something else,'” Kennedy said. ""I think this year will be really kind of telling because last year it was new and different, and there were a lot of novel concepts that had a lot of people talking. 

            “I think it’s it’s on us, NASCAR, to make it so that when the fans come out, or they tune in on TV, that this year is just as good, if not better than what it was last year.”

            Kennedy didn't exactly need to prove himself to NASCAR's Board of Directors, but after pulling off the Clash plans rapidly moved forward on staging a Cup Series race on the streets of downtown Chicago. The once outlandish idea is now scheduled for July 2 for a series that has traditionally stuck to oval tracks with banked turns. 

            “I would say a lot of the Chicago conversations really started picking up steam after the Clash,” said Kennedy, dismissing speculation that the race will fall through and noting excellent relationships with the mayor's office and other city agencies. 

            “What we’ve continued to focus on is this is brand new for NASCAR. This is brand new for the city of Chicago, and we're really trying to help everyone understand what this will look like,"" he said. ""We want this to be successful for NASCAR, but even more so successful for Chicago and something that Chicagoans can look forward to.”

            It seems inevitable that Kennedy will soon be running the entire show. Steve Phelps is the current president of NASCAR and only the third non-France family member to hold the position in 75 years; Steve O'Donnell currently runs competition. 

            Kennedy does not believe his future is pre-determined. 

            “I don’t think it’s inevitable for for me and I tell Steve and Steve and my family this all the time: 'I want to earn my stripes along the way. The last thing that I want to do is be put in a position that isn’t for the betterment of the company and the people around us are being put in a position that I’m not competent for,'"" Kennedy said. ""I want to centrally deserve whatever that position or promotion might look like. It’s really important to me. I think it earns me a bit of respect. It makes it that much more meaningful. 

            “Do I end up there? I have no idea. But I have to do a good job to earn that right.”

For now, he is content returning to the Coliseum as a warm-up for the Feb. 19 season-opening Daytona 500.“I think on many metrics last year was a a big success. So for us, it was very difficult to say ‘Hey, this was a really big success and now we’re going to go do something else,'” Kennedy said. ""I think this year will be really kind of telling because last year it was new and different, and there were a lot of novel concepts that had a lot of people talking.“I think it’s it’s on us, NASCAR, to make it so that when the fans come out, or they tune in on TV, that this year is just as good, if not better than what it was last year.”Kennedy didn't exactly need to prove himself to NASCAR's Board of Directors, but after pulling off the Clash plans rapidly moved forward on staging a Cup Series race on the streets of downtown Chicago. The once outlandish idea is now scheduled for July 2 for a series that has traditionally stuck to oval tracks with banked turns.“I would say a lot of the Chicago conversations really started picking up steam after the Clash,” said Kennedy, dismissing speculation that the race will fall through and noting excellent relationships with the mayor's office and other city agencies.“What we’ve continued to focus on is this is brand new for NASCAR. This is brand new for the city of Chicago, and we're really trying to help everyone understand what this will look like,"" he said. ""We want this to be successful for NASCAR, but even more so successful for Chicago and something that Chicagoans can look forward to.”It seems inevitable that Kennedy will soon be running the entire show. Steve Phelps is the current president of NASCAR and only the third non-France family member to hold the position in 75 years; Steve O'Donnell currently runs competition.Kennedy does not believe his future is pre-determined.“I don’t think it’s inevitable for for me and I tell Steve and Steve and my family this all the time: 'I want to earn my stripes along the way. The last thing that I want to do is be put in a position that isn’t for the betterment of the company and the people around us are being put in a position that I’m not competent for,'"" Kennedy said. ""I want to centrally deserve whatever that position or promotion might look like. It’s really important to me. I think it earns me a bit of respect. It makes it that much more meaningful.“Do I end up there? I have no idea. But I have to do a good job to earn that right.”___https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/01,,World
