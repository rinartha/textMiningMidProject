After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Inverters Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Inverters market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

In addition to prospective prospects, this study offers a historical analysis of growth, cost structure, revenue, market trends, and capacity (2023-2030).

Of late, cyberattacks in the financial services sector have increased manifold. Cyberattacks against financial services firms increased by over 70% in 2017, which reflects that the financial services sector is currently vulnerable to such attacks. In the future, adoption of effective cyber security techniques will become a necessity to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and illegal use of systems, networks and technologies.Cyberattacks and data breaches in financial services firms are more common than in any other industry. In 2017, a data breach at Equifax created a turmoil in the global markets, since more than 143 Mn consumers were affected by that. Also, incidents like the WannaCry and Petya ransomware in 2017, which badly affected Russian and Ukrainian banks, further exposed the world to direct financial threats posed by cyberattacks. These incidents highlight the urgent need for stringent cybersecurity in financial firms.Based on end user industries, the market is segmented into banking, insurance, stock brokerages, credit unions, investment funds, card and mobile payments, and governments. Among these segments, the card and mobile payments segment is expected to register a high growth rate through the forecast period of 2018-2023. Given that card and mobile payments are being adopted swiftly as a mode of cashless transactions, the risk of cyberattacks increases due to the critical nature of the financial data transmitted in each payment.By solutions and services, the global cybersecurity in financial services market is categorised into mobile enterprise management, endpoint security, identity and access management (IAM), mobile security, security information and event management (SIEM), content security, data loss prevention (DLP), datacenter security, and firewall. The mobile enterprise management solution segment is expected to have the highest growth rate owing to its wide adoption in contactless payment systems within various industries.By regions, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Asia-Pacific is projected to grow with the highest CAGR through the forecast period of 2018-2023.Download Free Sample Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/cybersecurity-in-financial-services-market/QI042Key growth factorsIncidents of data breaches are on the rise, thereby having an impact on the digitization of financial services like cashless payments via cards and mobiles. Hackers are finding this sector extremely vulnerable to prey upon. Thus, the threat of cyberattacks on the financial services sector is increasing and consultants are increasingly looking into ways to reduce such cyber risks. This is a major driver for the adoption of cybersecurity in the financial services sector.
In 2016, financial services customers suffered over 60% more cyberattacks than customers in any other sector. This increase in the number and scope of attacks on the financial sector is necessitating governmental actions and policies to curb it. Federal laws like National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), etc. are helping accelerate the adoption of cybersecurity in the financial sector.Threats and key playersAlthough cybersecurity in financial services market is expected to have positive growth globally, lack of adequate funds may act as a hindrance to the growth of the market. Buyers are allocating exorbitant budgets to tackle cyberattack but the nature of the crimes is evolving every passing day. Spending on new types of cybersecurity tools and services for companies is a major problem for the financial sector and may hinder the growth of the market.Whats covered in the report?1.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Keyless Go Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Keyless Go market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Pressure Sensor Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Pressure Sensor market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Radial Tire Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Radial Tire market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Sensor Cable Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Sensor Cable market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

This is because the healthcare technological development in the region is quite low compared to other parts of the world. In addition to that, the development of new technology and awareness about its benefits and usage is not distributed uniformly, i.e., it is mostly present in the urban areas. This categorizes the market in the region to an untapped potential type, which holds many opportunities for the investors. The governments are trying to make inroads in this aspect by introducing various plans and schemes.Threats and key playersThe introduction of goods and services tax (GST) in India has put the healthcare industry in a tough situation as costs of basic healthcare facilities, like hospital room rent, have increased. Also, the price of various treatment types has increased significantly. This will discourage people from engaging in robotic surgeries, which are generally costlier than conventional surgeries.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Smart Key Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Smart Key market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Stabilizer Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Stabilizer market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Vehicle Temperature Sensor Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Vehicle Temperature Sensor market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Microalbuminuria is the main characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. Patients with diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2, are susceptible to kidney-related issues that impair their kidneys’ typical capacity to eliminate waste products and extra fluid from the body. Diabetes that is not well managed over time might harm blood vessel clusters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. High blood pressure and renal damage may result from this.Factors Influencing Market Growth
The growing geriatric population and rising number of patients suffering from diabetes, chronic renal disease, atherosclerosis, and hypertension drive the global market.The growing prevalence of diabetes and obesity in different regions of the world boosts global market growth. The National Center for Biotechnology Information reports that 126 million people had diabetic nephropathy in 2010; by 2030, it is projected to affect more than 191 million people.Diabetes patients worldwide are becoming more aware of early detection of diabetes, healthcare structures are improving, and advanced technology is creating several treatment options for diabetics.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828775,Canada to probe alleged Chinese election interference,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday announced the appointment of an independent special investigator who will investigate the alleged Chinese interference in Canadian elections.Trudeau's announcement came after Canadian media, citing unidentified intelligence sources, reported on Beijing's alleged attempts to meddle in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.China has denied all allegations calling it ""defamatory"" and said that it has no interest in becoming involved with Canada's internal affairs.The opposition Conservatives have called for an independent public inquiry into the matter, however, turning down the demand Trudeau said, ""We will ask the independent special rapporteur, as one of the first tasks of their mandate, to provide the government with a recommendation as to what the appropriate next step be — whether it be an inquiry, an investigation or a judicial review — and what the scope of that work may be.""Trudeau added: ""All political leaders agree that the election outcomes in 2019, and in 2021, were not impacted by foreign interference. But even if it didn't change the results of our elections, any interference attempt, by any foreign actor, is troubling and serious.""Besides appointing a special investigator, Trudeau has also appointed two committees to probe potential foreign interference.Canada's National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) will investigate and report its findings to the parliament.Last month, The Globe and Mail reported that China preferred Trudeau's Liberal Party stay in power rather than the Conservative Party, which is considered hostile to Beijing.Trudeau has been under pressure after reports of China's alleged interference in elections were made public. Recent surveys have indicated that citizens expect him to respond more forcefully to alleged election interference by China.Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre has criticized the idea of a parliamentary committee being involved. He said that officials will present opposition lawmakers with ""some information and then swear them to secrecy so they could never speak about it again.""mf/sms (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828776,China warns US of potential for 'conflict and confrontation',"Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang has cautioned the United States over its approach to Taiwan, saying on Tuesday that no country has a right to interfere in what China regards as its domestic affairs.During his first press conference since becoming China's top diplomat, Qin outlined China's foreign policy stance — especially focusing on the United States, Taiwan, Russia and the war in Ukraine.Speaking on the sidelines of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing, Qin said the issue of Taiwan — and Washington's One China Policy — is the basis of all relations between the two global powers.He said no other country had the right to interfere in the Taiwan issue, calling it a ""red line"" that Washington must not cross.Qin added that China reserves the option to take measures that it deems necessary to achieve ""reunification"" with Taiwan.Under the One China Policy, the US recognizes Beijing and also acknowledges China's position that Taiwan is part of the country.A number of US lawmakers sparked Beijing's ire by visiting the self-ruled territory last year.Qin addressed China's increasingly tense relationship with the United States, saying Washington was to blame for the downward spiral in ties.The foreign minister said US policy toward China has ""deviated form the rational, sound track.""He said the recent US decision to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon created a diplomatic crisis that could have been avoided. China said the aircraft was used for weather research.If Washington does not change its course, there will ""surely be conflict and confrontation,"" Qin said.Prior to taking the post of foreign minister, Qin served as China's ambassador to the US.While Qin urged for peace talks and a diplomatic resolution to Russia's war on Ukraine, he also appeared to claim some countries had a hidden agenda behind the conflict.An ""invisible hand"" has been ""using the Ukraine crisis to serve certain geopolitical agendas,"" he said.In a recent position paper on China's stance on the war, Beijing called for dialogue but did not propose new initiatives for peace talks.While Russia has grown further and further isolated on the international stage, its ties with China have been growing.According to Qin, China believes any peace talks must respect the ""legitimate security concerns of all parties."" He also appeared to urge countries to soften punitive measures toward Russia, saying ""sanctions and pressure will not solve the problem.""In the year since the war erupted, China has not yet condemned Russia's move to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Germany and other Western countries are increasingly concerned that China could send weapons and other supplies to ammunition-strapped Russia.rs/jsi (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828803,Top 10 users in Taiwan’s Hsinchu Science Park to cut water usage,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Amid the continued lack of rainfall in many areas around Taiwan, the 10 biggest consumers of water at the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) are cutting water usage by 5%, an official said on Monday (March 6).

            While the supply of water to the HSP is better than it has been compared to the average level over the past five years, CNA cited Wang Yung-chuang (王永壯), director-general of the Hsinchu Science Park Bureau as saying, the lack of rainfall has led the 10 companies to cut back their water usage by 5% since March 1.

            Wang said companies at HSP use between 140,000 to 150,000 cubic meters of water a day. That number jumps to 190,000 cubic meters if the Zhunan, Longtan, and Yilan campuses are also added.

            The Shihmen Reservoir in Taoyuan supplies 150,000 cubic meters of water to Hsinchu daily, Wang said, while a pipeline connecting the reservoir to the Second Baoshan Reservoir in Hsinchu is slated to be finished in 2026. The Shihmen Reservoir is currently at 68.64% capacity, while the Second Baoshan Reservoir stands at 63.99% capacity, according to Water Resources Agency data.











            Meanwhile, the water situation in the south of the country is much more of a concern. Taiwan uses a four-level water alert system, with green being the lowest level, followed by yellow, orange, and then red.

            Tainan was placed on orange alert on March 1, which means in addition to reduced water pressure, some residential, commercial, and industrial users in certain areas will see a reduction in the amount of water supplied. Chiayi was placed on a yellow alert on March 1, which means reduced water pressure for users, while Kaohsiung is set to be placed on a yellow alert on March 8.

            Authorities are calling on the public to conserve water as significant rainfall is not expected for the coming weeks.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Amid the continued lack of rainfall in many areas around Taiwan, the 10 biggest consumers of water at the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) are cutting water usage by 5%, an official said on Monday (March 6).While the supply of water to the HSP is better than it has been compared to the average level over the past five years, CNA cited Wang Yung-chuang (王永壯), director-general of the Hsinchu Science Park Bureau as saying, the lack of rainfall has led the 10 companies to cut back their water usage by 5% since March 1.Wang said companies at HSP use between 140,000 to 150,000 cubic meters of water a day.

This included a fictitious tea date with a Taipei City municipal advisor to claim roughly NT$600 (US$20), according to CNA. Other expenses Chen claimed included a hotpot meal, groceries from Carrefour, items from a Linkou outlet store, and the cost of a Mother’s Day meal.Prosecutors have also indicted Chen for colluding with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Legislator Tsai Pi-ru (蔡壁如), who reportedly told Chen about possible labor regulation infringements at Mirror TV, after which Chen launched an investigation into the company. Following the investigation, Chen provided Tsai with confidential information that Tsai then passed to TPP Legislator Lai Hsiang Ling (賴香伶), who used the findings to publicly question the station’s political neutrality in March 2022.The leaked information was used by TPP legislators to hold a press conference in which they questioned Mirror Media’s ties to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and made allegations of possible government interference in the media. It is not clear why Chen made the decision to leak the confidential information to Tsai.Tsai is best known for her role as a close aide to former DPP-aligned Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), who subsequently broke away from the DPP and founded the TPP. Chen’s predecessor for the role of Taipei City Department of Labor head was the TPP’s Lai, who spearheaded the press conference using the leaked information.Authorities were alerted to the suspected malpractice when Kuomintang Legislator Yu Shu-hui (游淑慧) alerted the media that she had received information regarding Chen’s fraudulent expense claims. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office carried out an investigation in July 2022, after which Chen resigned from her position in September of the same year.Chen has been prosecuted for using her government position for fraudulent means, forging documents, and leaking secrets other than national defense as a civil servant.",2023/03/07,1068,Politics

            RENK America will provide the engine assembly lines to Taiwan’s Army Command, which will set them up at its ordnance development center in Nantou. The process is expected to be completed by 2028.

            The tanks are currently equipped with a 750-horsepower engine, but due to the aging vehicles and the long hours of use, its overall performance has declined, Liberty Times cited a military source as saying. The new engines are said to have 1,000 horsepower.

            Additionally, the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology will upgrade the tanks’ firing, gun control, and sighting system for NT$15.56 million, according to Janes.

This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong.""Relations between the two superpowers have been tense for years over a number of issues including Taiwan, trade and more recently the war in Ukraine but they worsened last month after the United States shot down a balloon off the U.S. east coast that it says was a Chinese spying craft.The U.S. says it is establishing guardrails for relations and is not seeking conflict but Qin said what that meant in practice was that China was not supposed to respond with words or action when slandered or attacked.""That is just impossible,"" Qin told his first news conference since becoming foreign minister in December.""If the United States does not hit the brakes, and continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailment, which will become conflict and confrontation, and who will bear the catastrophic consequences?""Qin likened Sino-U.S. competition to a race between two Olympic athletes.""If one side, instead of focusing on giving one's best, always tries to trip the other up, even to the extent that they must enter the Paralympics, then this is not fair competition,"" he said.'JACKALS AND WOLVES'During a nearly two-hour news conference in which he answered questions submitted in advance, Qin made a robust defence of ""wolf warrior diplomacy"", an assertive and often abrasive stance adopted by China's diplomats since 2020.""When jackals and wolves are blocking the way, and hungry wolves are attacking us, Chinese diplomats must then dance with the wolves and protect and defend our home and country,"" he said.Qin also said that an ""invisible hand"" was pushing for the escalation of the war in Ukraine ""to serve certain geopolitical agendas"", without specifying who he was referring to.He reiterated China's call for dialogue to end the war.China struck a ""no limits"" partnership with Russia last year, weeks before its invasion of Ukraine, and China has blamed NATO expansion for triggering the war, echoing Russia's complaint.China has declined to condemn the invasion and has fiercely defended its stance on Ukraine, despite Western criticism of its failure to single Russia out at the aggressor.China has also vehemently denied U.S. accusations that it has been considering supplying Russia with weapons.ADVANCING RELATIONS WITH MOSCOWQin said China had to advance its relations with Russia as the world becomes more turbulent and close interactions between President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, anchored the neighbours' relations.He did not give a definite answer when asked if Xi would visit Russia after China's parliament session, which goes on for one more week.Since Russia invaded its southwestern neighbour a year ago Xi has held talks several times with Putin, but not with his Ukrainian counterpart. This undermines China's claim of neutrality in the conflict, Kyiv's top diplomat in Beijing said last month.Asked whether it was possible that China and Russia would abandon the U.S. dollar and euro for bilateral trade, Qin said countries should use whatever currency was efficient, safe and credible.China has been looking to internationalise its renminbi, or the yuan, which gained popularity in Russia last year after Western sanctions shut Russia's banks and many of its companies out of the dollar and euro payment systems.""Currencies should not be the trump card for unilateral sanctions, still less a disguise for bullying or coercion,"" Qin said.",2023/03/07,508,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4828910,Anonymous hacks into Chinese weather balloon that flew over India twice,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Decentralized international hacktivist group Anonymous last month hacked into a Chinese weather balloon, which flew over India twice, and posted screenshots from its control panel on a defaced Chinese study abroad website.Amid the uproar over the flight of a Chinese spy balloon over the U.S. in early February, an Anonymous representative who goes by the Reddit handle ""HaileeSteinfeldFan"" on Feb. 18, informed Taiwan News that the collective had hacked into a Chinese overseas art education website where it posted screenshots from a stratospheric weather balloon control panel and recent flight path. The hack of the Shanghai-based DP Art & Design Center included a main defacement page, a ""Wandering Balloons"" page, and a page with screenshots of the ""thunder monitoring system.""At the time of publication, the defaced pages were still accessible online. However, in anticipation of the eventual removal of the vandalized pages, Anonymous has created archived versions of the defacement, balloons, and control panel.(Anonymous image)The top defacement page starts out with the Anonymous logo, the ""Taiwan Numbah Wan!"" meme, the Taiwan flag, the Taiwan emblem, and the music video for ""Fragile."" The collective then announces that the hack is a response to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for sending a balloon to America as a form of ""trollish provocation.""The hacktivists criticized the CCP for its handling of the COVID pandemic and how it ""aims to control the world like a James Bond villain through overseas police stations!"" This was followed by a photo of the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the U.S., a trailer from the Disney/Pixar film ""Up,"" and CNN archive footage of Tank Man in 1989.Next was a poem generated by ChatGPT mocking the Chinese surveillance dirigible:Oh lost balloon, so light and so fair,
Drifting through the sky with not a care,
Once held tight, now free to soar,
Through the clouds you go, forever more.
Your journey takes you to new lands,
Soaring over hills and shifting sands,
The winds of fate carry you away,
On your journey through the skies so gay.
With every gust, you rise and fall,
Dancing in the air, having a ball,
A symbol of freedom and of glee,
Lost balloon, you soar so free.
And though you're gone, your spirit remains,
In the hearts of those who watch your gains,
A reminder to embrace life's ride,
And to follow your dreams, wherever they may guide.The collective also railed against Wikipedia for allegedly underrepresenting women in its articles, having a ""spending cancer,"" engaging in deletionism, and committing POV skewing. It also accused Wikipedia of failing to adequately support two Wikipedia Arabic editors, Osama Khalid and Ziyad al-Sofiani, who have been imprisoned by the Saudi government for ""swaying public opinion"" and ""violating public morals.""The page then included footage and images of Tyre Nichols, Anthony Lowe, and Joe Frasure Jr., all of whom were killed by police. The last section of the page criticized the disregard for human and animal lives by the Soviet Union during its pursuit of 'firsts"" in the Space Race.Location of balloon in Beijing on Feb. 15, 2023. (Anonymous image)The Wandering Balloons page includes six photos of the Chinese spy balloon that flew over North American airspace from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4. Next is Sky News footage showing the moment the Chinese spy balloon was shot down and a 10-hour version of the song ""Married Life"" from the film ""Up.""Anonymous then claimed to have successfully hacked into the control panel of a similar Chinese balloon. As proof, it included screenshots from a map from the system showing the location of the balloon in Beijing as of Feb. 15, 2023.Map shows complete flight path of balloon. (Anonymous image)The next screenshot shows a previous flight path for the balloon which started near Nanchang in China's Jiangxi Province and flew southwest over Myanmar, Bangladesh, southern India, the Arabian Sea, eastern and central Africa, and the Gulf of Guinea.It then flew back to the northeast over central and eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Arabian Sea, Pakistan, India, and Nepal, before arriving in Beijing. A series of six screenshots then showed English defacements the collective had inserted in the control panel.Starting point of balloon. (Anonymous image)Examples of messages posted included ""Please donate your money to Turkish earthquake victims,"" ""Where is Peng Shuai?,"" ""CCP did you flew (fly) your wandering balloons across India?,"" ""RIP LI Wenliang,"" and ""Free East Turkistan.""Two subsequent screenshots showed the precise coordinates where the balloon originated near Nanchang at an altitude of 168 meters and moved at a speed of 0.32 kilometers per hour, with the ""data time"" listed as June 23, 2018. It was then recorded in Beijing at a height of 71.3 meters moving at a speed of 0.32 kilometers per hour on a ""data time"" of Aug. 1, 2018.Ending point of balloon. (Anonymous image)Higher on the page are five screenshots of what appears to be the magnified version of the defacements. The third page merely includes the Anonymous logo, a screen capture of the balloon's control panel, and a meme showing an irate Greta Thunberg with the words ""How dare Wikipedia"" printed above and ""Distorts to insult holocaust victims and survivors"" below.Screenshot of defacements placed in balloon control panel.

The study examines the market’s current and future developments.The market segmentation analysis in the study and the forecast of market size will help investors better understand the dynamics and structure within the ABS Sensor industry. The research is a buyer’s guide by clearly outlining the comparative study between the top ABS Sensor companies by price, financial status, and product portfolio.The ABS sensor (or anti-lock brake system sensor) is a component of a vehicle’s system to monitor the speed of each wheel. This sensor is used in conjunction with an ABS control module to prevent wheels from locking up while braking. This can lead to the vehicle losing control or skidding.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-abs-sensor-sales-market-report-2021-qy/720965/#requestforsampleThe ABS sensor is typically composed of a magnet with a wire coil that generates small electrical currents when the wheel spins. To determine whether a wheel is locking up, or sliding, the ABS control module compares each wheel’s speed. The ABS module will apply brake pressure to the wheel that is slowing down more than the other wheels. This prevents it from locking up and then the brake pressure will be released on the wheel.Modern vehicles have ABS sensors as a crucial safety component. They can significantly improve braking performance and stability during emergency situations. The ABS system can fail or become damaged if an ABS sensor is not functioning properly. This could increase the chance of an accident. It is crucial to get your ABS system repaired and diagnosed as soon as possible if the ABS warning light appears on your vehicle.Continental AG

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829093,EU lawmakers push ahead with building ties in Southeast Asia,"The EU has for years been pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing its influence in the key region of Southeast Asia, not just in terms of trade deals, but also in political cooperation.The creation of a parliamentary assembly of lawmakers from the EU and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — in line with a European Parliament resolution from last year — may still be many years off, but a flurry of visits by MEPs to the region appears to be building momentum.The parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs traveled to Indonesia and Vietnam late last month, while the subcommittee on human rights was in the Philippines. Three further separate delegations are expected to visit the region in April alone.Relations between the EU and ASEAN were upgraded to a ""strategic partnership"" in 2020 and leaders from all parties attended a summit in December. Southeast Asia's importance as a trading partner is only increasing, and the region lies on many geopolitical fault lines.""The strategic partnership between ASEAN and the EU is not just a matter for our executive branches. Regular exchanges between parliamentarians on both sides are key to keep the relationship from moving to the political backbenches amid diverging regional priorities,"" David McAllister, a German MEP and chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, told DW.The latest EU-ASEAN plan of action for 2023-2027 spells out that both sides should ""encourage linkages"" between the European Parliament and the individual parliaments of ASEAN member states, as well as the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA), a confederation of lawmakers from those states. This was the first time that parliamentary links had been noted in such an action plan.Building on this, the European Parliament will dispatch several more delegations to Southeast Asia in the coming months, McAllister noted.In April, a delegation of the Committee for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will travel to Singapore, while the Committee on Legal Affairs will be in Malaysia and the Subcommittee for Human Rights will visit Vietnam. One month later, a delegation from the Committee on Transport and Tourism will head to Indonesia.On top of that, ""the European Parliament has decided to send its own officials to work on parliamentary affairs within the EU Delegation to ASEAN, as a way to enhance the parliamentary dimension of the EU-ASEAN strategic partnership,"" McAllister said.Siti Rozaimeriyanty Dato Haji Abdul Rahman, general secretary of the AIPA, says that there is also much optimism among Southeast Asians for better parliamentary ties.""While diplomats predominantly direct a country's foreign policy, members of parliaments play an important role in influencing countries' policy priorities, holding governments accountable and providing a stronger foundation for good governance,"" she said.""Parliamentary diplomacy serves to compliment diplomatic efforts of the executive to advance national interests on the regional and international level.""Last June, the European Parliament adopted a plenary resolution that called for ""the establishment of an EU-ASEAN parliamentary assembly."" The following month, another resolution noted that such a forum is needed to ""strengthen the democratic dimension of the partnership.""Rahman says that there is ""consensus from all AIPA Members"" to boost ties but the European proposal was ""to create an assembly, which… AIPA Parliament members believe it's quite a bit of a stretch for the time being.""National Assembly Chairman Vuong Dinh Hue, chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly, reportedly told McAllister last month that he would support the creation of an EU-ASEAN parliamentary assembly.This all comes amid a wide tug-of-war between the European Commission, the European Council — a body of the leaders of the 27 EU members — and the European Parliament over who should dictate the EU's foreign policy and how much oversight the MEPs should have to scrutinize Commission decisions.Southeast Asia is not a hotbed of democracy, and the European Parliament has often taken more principled and values-based approaches to relations than the European Commission.It has, for instance, adopted a resolution demanding the expulsion of the Philippines from the EU's GSP+ preferential trade scheme over the alleged human rights violations committed under the brutal drug war of former President Rodrigo Duterte.A month after the European Parliament called for the formation of an EU-ASEAN parliamentary assembly, it passed another resolution that noted this forum is needed to ""strengthen the democratic dimension of the partnership.""""The European Parliament is founded upon the principles of democracy, the respect for human rights and the rule of law,"" McAllister said. ""In our external engagement, including that with ASEAN member states, we make sure to portray these values.""Improved parliamentary discussions might also allow for more engagement with Southeast Asian lawmakers from the pro-democracy opposition parties, whereas the European Commission is left primarily talking to diplomats or government officials.""In the EU-ASEAN context, stronger inter-regional parliamentary cooperation presents diverse opportunities from facilitating negotiations and overseeing the implementation of trade agreements (and beyond) to allowing for an open and honest discussion on critical issues where such discussion at the executive level is more normative in nature,"" Rahman said.She also reckons that greater parliamentary connections could improve areas like women's rights.  As well as the 2021-2025 Action Plan on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in External Action, ASEAN has launched its new Gender Mainstreaming Strategic Framework, a policy to improve gender equality across the region.""The two policy frameworks obviously reflect the same passion and commitment of the EU and ASEAN,"" she said.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829094,Qatargate: Suspect interviews leak EU corruption details,"This was the deal former EU lawmaker Pier Antonio Panzeri made with Belgian investigators: to reveal the details of the Qatargate corruption scandal and receive a reduced sentence for his part in it.Leaked transcripts of two interviews conducted in early February by investigators with the central figure in the scandal, seen by DW, provide a much deeper insight into how the political scam began, who was involved and how it was perpetrated.The details outlined in this report come from the transcripts and only reflect Panzeri's side of the story. They can be used in court, but will likely be challenged by prosecutors.The so-called Qatargate scandal has rocked the European Parliament in Brussels since four people were arrested in Brussels on December 9, with Belgian police seizing €1.5 million ($1.6 million) in cash from private residences.They were Greek lawmaker Eva Kaili, then one of the vice presidents of the European Parliament, her life partner Francsco Giorgi, who was also Panzeri's professional assistant, Pazneri himself and Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the head of a human rights NGO. It now appears that Niccolo Figa-Talamanca may have been mistakenly caught up in the investigation, having since been released ""unconditionally.""The leaked interview transcripts show that the corruption scandal started with Morocco, not Qatar.In the interviews, Panzeri described how a relationship with Abderrahim Atmoun, who now serves as Morocco's ambassador to Poland, began in 2012.Panzeri said the Moroccan diplomat paid €50,000 for one of his election campaign events in Milan back in 2014, and that his ""friendship with Atmoun has grown stronger over time.""A winding set of stories in the transcripts claims Ambassador Atmoun also paid for lavish trips to Morocco for Kaili, Giorgi and two other EU lawmakers, Andrea Cozzolino and Maria Arena.According to Panzeri, bags of hard cash only started to be paid by Morocco from 2019, when he and Giorgi agreed to take €50,000 per year in exchange for working to create a favorable impression of the North African state within EU policy-making circles in Brussels.The former European Parliament member also claimed a similar agreement had been set up with the officials from the government of Mauritania around the same time. Panzeri said this situation only lasted throughout 2019, with both him and Giorgi receiving only two payments each of €50,000.The government of Morocco has denied any involvement in the scandal, while Mauritania has yet to reply to a request for comment from DW.During the interviews, Panzeri claimed Qatar began trying to expand its network of influence in the EU institutions in late 2017. This is when the payments made to the EU policy makers began to rocket upwards.Panzeri said that after meetings in early 2018 with Qatar's labor minister, Ali bin Samikh Al Marri, the Gulf state agreed to pay him and Giorgi each €1 million per year in 2018 and 2019.Preparations for Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup were already well underway at the time, and the country was coming under increasing scrutiny for its treatment of migrant laborers to build stadiums and infrastructure for the monthlong competition. Panzeri's former position as a leading voice in the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights made him the perfect person to adjust the narrative in Brussels.After leaving office in 2019, Panzeri went on to set up an unregistered NGO called Fight Impunity to continue this work.The transcripts suggest that it was around this time that Giorgi's partner, Eva Kaili, began to get involved. Panzeri claimed the Greek MEP received €250,000 from Qatar to finance her 2019 European Parliament reelection campaign.While some of the details of the money transfers remain unclear, Panzeri said much of the Qatari money was funneled to them through a ""Turkish businessman and his lawyer in London.""Panzeri also claimed another Italian MEP also received cash and met with interlocutors involved in the alleged corruption ring.In response to a DW request for comment, the state of Qatar replied with its repeated denial, saying it ""categorically rejects the accusations. Any association of the Qatari government with the reported claims is baseless and gravely misinformed.""At one point during the nearly six hours of interviews, Panzeri told prosecutors that he wanted to ""dismantle the idea"" that he is the ""big boss.""He said his assistant, Giorgi, was the ""conductor"" and would hand envelopes and bags of cash to those involved, including to Panzeri himself.Panzeri did, however, outline how he personally ""approached"" MEP Marc Tarabella, of Belgium, with an initial €20,000 in cash, and that Tarabella received up to €140,000 over a period of time. Tarabella voted to waive his own parliamentary immunity in February, and was arrested shortly afterwards.What remains unclear is whether the millions Giorgi and Panzeri each allegedly received from the Qataris were to be used to bribe other EU officials, or was solely for payment for their services.Panzeri lost his seat in the 2019 European Parliament elections, and in the transcripts he claimed that his place in the alleged corruption ring was taken by his fellow Italian lawmaker, Andrea Cozzolino, who he says received at least €600,000 to lobby favorably on behalf of Qatar.Giorgi then became Cozzolino's assistant in the European Parliament and was on a ""high salary,"" according to Panzeri.Last month, British daily newspaper The Times reported that Panzeri and Giorgi had surprisingly been held for weeks in the same cell in the Saint-Gilles Prison in Brussels, despite being charged with collusion in this corruption scandal.Later that month, Giorgi was granted release on electronic tag, while Panzeri remains incarcerated, as do Kaili and Tarabella. Cozzolino, currently in Italy, faces a European arrest warrant.Sources close to Panzeri have told DW that his mental and physical health are ""deteriorating significantly"" while he remains in prison.Among numerous accounts of cash changing hands in different parts of the world, Panzeri told investigators the story of how €15,000 was stolen from his suitcase on a train between Paris and Brussels.He recounted how he had separated the cash into two separate wads in different places in his bag. While traveling, the cash was removed from the bag, which was left behind.Panzeri also said that following a cash exchange with one of the many European Parliamentary assistants named in the interview, he decided to ""throw the money in a trash can when [he] got home.""By 2021, Panzeri said, he wanted to change the system, as he ""already had too much [cash] and didn't know what to do with it.""Another of the significant revelations in the transcripts is Panzeri's claim that the fourth person who was initially arrested and held in prison for almost two months may be innocent.Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the head of a well-respected, officially registered human rights NGO called No Peace Without Justice, was taken in during the initial arrests.Panzeri's Fight Impunity shared an office with the NGO, and in the transcripts, DW read that he approached Figa-Talamanca with offers of donations of up to €500,000, which could be considered common for human rights bodies to accept.""Niccolo never participated in any meeting with [an interlocutor] and knew nothing about the business,"" Panzeri told investigators.A lawyer for Figa-Talamanca told DW that his client is ""in no way involved in any wrongdoing.""Another Belgian MEP, Maria Arena, whose name has been frequently linked to the corruption scandal, did travel to Qatar according to the transcripts and met with some of the people involved. But at no point did Panzeri mention that Arena took cash from anyone.Arena has repeatedly denied any involvement in the corruption scandal.Prosecutors have tried to limit the information given to the press from the outset of the scandal, meaning the hunt for details has been ferocious. But several leaks have come to light in recent weeks, including these transcripts.Concerns are now growing about how the prosecution may mount its legal case, with so much information now in the public domain.DW reached out to the offices of each of the people named in this report for comment, and was either told ""no comment"" or did not receive a reply by publication.Edited by: M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829095,Strikes cripple French refineries over pension reforms,"French labor unions on Tuesday launched major strikes nationwide, in a fresh effort to push against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans.Unions have vowed to bring the country to a standstill as they battle pension reforms that would push the retirement age up two years and require further years of work to earn a full pension.Police expect between 1.1 million and 1.4 million people to take to the streets in over 260 locations on Tuesday, the French AFP news agency cited an anonymous source as saying.Strikes are also expected to affect regional and high-speed trains, halting four of the five in operation. Even more critically, refinery workers joined the strike, affecting fuel transfer nationwide.Protests against the proposed pension reforms have been recurring since the start of the year. The biggest protest saw some 1.27 million people participate on January 31.The strikes blocked fuel deliveries from refineries nationwide as of Tuesday morning, according to the hard-line CGT union. The blockage could cause shortages at petrol stations.The Esso refineries in northern France's Port Jerome and the south's Fos-Sur-Mer joined the Tuesday strike, the CGT announced.""The strike has begun everywhere... with deliveries blocked from all the refineries this morning,"" AFP quoted Eric Sellini, branch coordinator for the CGT union, as saying. The union had orchestrated a fuel shortage last autumn by launching a similar blockade.Fuel giant TotalEnergies told the Reuters news agency that fuel deliveries at its French sites were halted. Out of the group's 296 agents on sites, 64% were on strike on Tuesday, a group spokesperson said.Sellini told Reuters that a strike at Normandy's Gonfreville refinery was scheduled to hold until Thursday, whereas another at the Donges refinery in western France would last until Friday.Protests against the pension reform plans have recently intensified, as the controversial bill arrived at the French houses of parliament for inking.Weeks of debate in the French lower house ended without voting on raising the retirement age. The bill has now moved on to the upper house, with a debate that dragged on until the early hours of Tuesday morning.The debate is due to resume Tuesday afternoon.Reforming the country's pension system was part of  Macron's platform both during the 2017 and 2022 elections.The president and his administration argue that the reforms are ""indispensable"" for the pension system's survival. Macron said the pension fund is experiencing a looming deficit that must be dealt with as France's population gets older.The president has argued that the population would have to work a little more to keep the pension fund in balance. To achieve this, the new system raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.However, critics insist the government must find alternative ways to finance the pension fund.They also argue that increasing the years of work in some strenuous, manual labor professions would not be physically possible, as well as unfair, given that these professionals start their careers at an earlier age.rmt/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829097,Germany: The gender pay gap just won't go away,"Another year, another batch of bad news for working women. In 2022, women in Germany continued to be at a disadvantage in the labor market in many respects, according to a new study from the Düsseldorf-based Institute of Economic and Social Research (WSI).Coinciding with International Women's Day, the study highlights working hours, income and the lack of promotions as three big issues facing working women today. The latest study also confirmed that gender inequality exists across nearly all sectors of the country's economy, albeit in different ways.To come to these conclusions the team looked at the latest data published by the Federal Statistical Office and the Federal Employment Agency, which covered 2021 and 2022. What they found may be surprising when considering the big untapped potential and the much talked about skilled-labor shortage in the country.Still, it is always the gender pay gap, which is the difference in average gross earnings between men and women, that makes headlines.In this case, the researchers estimated that in 2022 women in Germany earned 18% less on average compared with their male counterparts. Men made an average of €24.36 ($25.94) gross per hour across all sectors while women earned €20.05 ($21.35) per hour before taxes.The study looked deeper and divided workers into their different sectors. It found that though the female employment rate has risen in recent decades, many parts of the economy are still male-dominated. Mechanical engineering, construction, civil engineering and freight transport are areas that are particularly male-dominated. The service industry, on the other hand, has a much higher portion of female employees. These include jobs like health care, social services and teaching.Of the 46 sectors it investigated, the study found that in 45 of them, women earned less than men. The gender pay gap based on specific industries ranged from 4% in passenger and freight transport to 5% in social services all the way up to 30% in health care and 32% in the legal and tax advice industry. The only exception was the postal service. Here the gross hourly wage for women is 2% more than for men, though the base pay is quite low.The study looked at more than just pay. Women are disproportionately responsible for running the household and child care. It is a complex issue, but can this really be the answer to why they earn less? The study took working hours into consideration and found big differences. Across all business sectors, men worked more often in a full-time capacity, which can lead to promotions and more experience.Additionally, more men were in leadership positions than women. In 26 out of 34 sectors for which data was available, women were less likely to hold managerial positions than men, the study found. There were no significant gender differences in the seven sectors. The only area where women led more is in the passenger and freight transport industry. Still, in general, men make more management decisions than women.The researchers noted that a lot needs to be done to enforce gender pay equality and suggest an equal opportunity law for the private sector that would oblige German companies to develop and implement equal opportunity strategies.And Germany has a long way to go to achieve gender pay equality since it has one of the largest gender pay gaps in all of Europe. In 2021, it was only slightly better than Switzerland, Austria and Estonia. The European Union has not been ignoring the issue.Last November, the European Commission calculated that overall in the EU women are paid 13% less than men on average for an equal job. This means that for every €1 a man earns, a woman will only earn 87 cents. That may not sound like a lot, but it can add up to around two months of a yearly salary.The gap is closing, but over the past decade, it has only changed by 2.8% in Europe. There are also big differences between various EU countries. The get a handle on these gender pay gap problems the European Commission has introduced a number of directives on equal pay, pay transparency, work-life balance and introducing more women to company boards.""Equal work deserves equal pay. This is a founding principle of the European Union. Solving the injustice of the gender pay gap cannot come without change to the structural imbalances in society,"" Vera Jourova, vice president of the European Commission for Values and Transparency, said in November 2022 on the occasion of European Equal Pay Day.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/03/07,,

It was reported that 42 people were trapped in 27 houses that were buried in mud.The official death count stands at 10 while the villagers put the death toll at 15. More than 1,200 people have been displaced because of the landslide.""The number of fatalities might change at any time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829099,Japan: New H3 rocket fails minutes after launch,"Japan's attempt to launch its next-generation H3 rocket failed Tuesday after the launcher's engine did not ignite in space.The country's space agency, JAXA, aimed to compete in a market dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.The H3 rocket's launch was delayed by several years. Last month, an attempt for the launcher's liftoff failed when its boosters did not ignite.The second attempt launch from the Tanegashima Space Center on Tuesday seemed to be a success when the rocket lifted off at 10:37 a.m. (0137 GMT).However, issues started to appear when the rocket was around 300 kilometers above ground.The rocket's second-stage engine failed to ignite upon reaching space.""The destruct command has been transmitted to H3 because there was no possibility of achieving the mission,"" the command center said during the live broadcast.JAXA commentators said that the agency would investigate the reasons for the failure.The next-generation rocket was equipped with the ALOS3, a satellite for disaster management land observation.Built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), the rocket was designed to carry supplies to the International Space Station.It also potentially would have been able to detect North Korean ballistic missile launches with its experimental infrared sensor design.According to MHI, the H3's cost per launch is estimated to be nearly half that of its predecessor, the H-II, enabling it to compete in a global market dominated by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.A report published in September by the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated the cost of a Falcon 9 launch to be around $2,600 per kilogram for a low Earth orbit. In contrast, the H-II costs around $10,500 for similar conditions.Had the launch been successful, the Japanese rocket would have been ahead of the scheduled launch of the  European Space Agency's latest low-cost Ariane 6 later this year.Hirotaka Watanabe, a professor at Osaka University with expertise in space policy, said that the failed launch ""will have a serious impact on Japan's future space policy, space business, and technological competitiveness.""aa/sms (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829100,Ukraine updates: Kyiv generals vow to keep defending Bakhmut,"Ukrainian top generals have vowed to continue to defend the contended eastern city of Bakhmut amid reports suggesting that Russia is inching closer to capturing it.After months of fighting in and around Bakhmut, Russian forces remain adamant about capturing the city, which would be their first significant battlefield victory in some six months.Western strategists and officials suggest a Russian occupation of the city would be of more symbolic than strategic value.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, however, said control of Bakhmut would allow Moscow's forces to mount further attacks deeper inside Ukraine.""The city is an important hub for defending Ukrainian troops in the Donbas. Taking it under control will allow further offensive actions to be conducted deep into Ukraine's defensive lines,"" he said.Reports from the battlefield suggest that Ukrainian troops have recently been reinforcing positions west of the city, apparently preparing to withdraw.However, in his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he held discussions with top generals and they agreed ""not to withdraw.""""The command unanimously supported this position. There were no other positions. I told the commander-in-chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut,"" Zelenskyy said.The battle has drained both sides' artillery reserves, with thousands of shells fired daily.The Russian Wagner mercenary force, which is leading the assault, has pleaded for more ammunition to secure a victory.Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin has been vocal about a deepening rift with the Russian Defense Ministry amid rising rivalry between the two bodies on the Ukrainian battlefield.""I'm knocking on all doors and sounding the alarm about ammunition and reinforcements, as well as the need to cover our flanks,"" Reuters quoted him as saying in a statement.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Tuesday, March 7:German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius says Berlin is committed to protecting its NATO partners but expressed skepticism about permanently stationing a Bundeswehr brigade in Lithuania — as called for by the Baltic country.While on a visit to joint Lithuanian-German military exercises, Pistorius said it would observe the military alliance's mutual defense pact ""with no ifs or buts.""The minister said a German unit that traveled to Lithuania, the armored infantry brigade 41, had proven capable of easily deploying there, noting that the troops covered 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) from Germany ""in record time "" with only one vehicle breakdown.Some 1,450 soldiers from Germany are presently stationed in Lithuania, including parts of the brigade involved in the exercises.After visiting the troops, Pistorius was sent to hold military policy talks with counterparts in the capital, Vilnius.Ukraine has started talks with partners on extending the Black Sea Grain Initiative to ensure Kyiv can continue shipping grain to the global market, a senior Ukrainian government source told Reuters news agency.The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv's understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow.The Black Sea Grain Initiative was brokered by the UN and Turkey last July and was extended in November. It is due to expire on March 18.A Moscow court has sentenced Dmitry Ivanov, a former mathematics student and creator of the Protest MGU telegram channel, to more than eight years in a penal colony.Ivanov was tried under a section of law about ""military fakes"" for posts about Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities. He was prosecuted over 11 posts that dealt with, among other things, the events of March last year in Bucha, where Russian troops are alleged to have committed war crimes, and the shelling of Mariupol.Ivanov pleaded not guilty and maintained that the information in his posts was true.""Literally the entire indictment, from the first to the last word, is contrary to reality. I subscribe to every word that I wrote a year ago,"" he said.The Timiryazevsky Court of Moscow, which found 23-year-old Ivanov guilty of spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian army, also banned him from being an administrator on internet and social media sites for four years after his release. The prosecution had asked the court to sentence Ivanov to nine years in prison.Ukraine's investigative department is treating the incident of a purported shooting of a seemingly Ukrainian unarmed man at the hands of what are believed to have been Russian forces as a crime, the country's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said.A video circulated on social media on Monday, causing an outcry in Ukraine. The video shows what appears to be an unarmed man in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm. The man is heard saying ""Slava Ukraini,"" which means ""Glory to Ukraine,"" before multiple shots are heard and the man is seen collapsing as bullets hit his body.A voice is heard telling him to ""die"" in Russian.In a statement on Monday, Kostin tweeted that the video ""shocked Ukrainian society"" and was being investigated under Ukraine's criminal dode.Kostin stressed that ""even war has laws,"" accusing Russian forces of ""systematically"" neglecting international law.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang claimed that an ""invisible hand"" has been ""using the Ukraine crisis to serve certain geopolitical agendas.""During his first press conference since becoming China's top diplomat on Tuesday, Qin said that China believes any peace talks must respect the ""legitimate security concerns of all parties.""He also appeared to urge countries to soften punitive measures toward Russia by saying, ""Sanctions and pressure will not solve the problem.""In a recent position paper on China's stance on the war, Beijing called for dialogue but did not propose new initiatives for peace talks.While Russia has grown increasingly isolated on the international stage since it launched the war, its ties with China have been growing.In the year since the war erupted, China has not yet condemned Russia's move to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.To avoid international sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the country's chess federation is set to switch from the European Chess Union to the Asian Chess Federation.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the battle for Bakhmut was unlikely to ""change the tide of the war."" Ukrainian forces are said to be in a ""painful and difficult"" battle in the Donbas. Read our updates from Monday here.rmt/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829115,Cargo ships out of action causing food shortages: Matsu DPP head,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The defense minister has apologized to Matsu-based troops as reports emerge that the island’s food shortages are causing temporary business closures after 20 days without receiving a supply ship.The chairman of Matsu’s Democratic Progressive Party wing Lii Wen (李問) on Tuesday said the shortages are because two of the three cargo ships that regularly run between Taiwan and Matsu are undergoing maintenance. The remaining ship is apparently too large to dock at the smaller wharf on the island of Juguang, leading to the long delay.Lii said he supported the decision to send a transport plane to supply Matsu's soldiers, but that the county government also owed a duty of care to the residents of Matsu. He said it was unfortunate that the county government had yet to come forward with a clear plan for solving the problem.The manager of Juguang guesthouse Together Station told Taiwan News the island is about to enter the tourist season, and that she is worried the transportation situation hasn’t been improved, noting the cost of shipping had doubled recently. She said she had heard there would be an additional cargo ship this week, but Taiwan News cannot confirm this.The manager said finding a way to import ingredients or find another supplier from the larger township of Nangan is her biggest challenge. She said that while the two cargo ships are out of action, the remaining one does not operate on a fixed schedule, making it hard to order products from Taiwan when they are needed.The manager also said that ordinarily, for the one-hour journey between Juguang and the larger port at Nangan, ships are not refrigerated. She said that it would be possible to use privately run refrigerated shipping options, but that the cost of this would be “unimaginable.”There is one 7-Eleven in Juguang, but the guest house operator said that supplies there are limited. “Instant noodles and biscuits are finally on the shelves today,” she said.Matsu’s lack of meat made headlines on Monday after soldiers complained that they were only getting canned meat, in “S.O.S” style messages written in the sand on the island’s beaches. On Monday (March 6), Minister of National Defense Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱國正) apologized to the legislature for the shortages and dispatched a transport plane with supplies.Like the rest of Taiwan, Matsu is also facing an egg shortage. Matsu Daily News reported that the Council of Agriculture delivered 20,000 eggs to Nangan township on Thursday, selling out after 30 minutes to 200-meter-long queues of people.",2023/03/07,1368,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829208,Italy: Mid-air collision kills two air force pilots,"Two Italian Air Force pilots were killed when a mid-air collision occurred during training exercises being conducted near Guidonia Air Base, roughly 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of the capital Rome.The exercises were being conducted in lightweight SIAI-Marchetti S.208 training aircraft — single-engine vehicles capable of carrying up to five individuals including the pilot. The planes have a top speed of 285 kilometers per hour (177 mph).No cause was given for the collision, nor were any injuries reported on the ground.Italy's ANSA news agency said one plane fell onto a parked car while the other landed in a field.Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni expressed her condolences to the family and friends of the pilots as well as to the Air Force.""We are devastated to hear about the deaths of two Air Force pilots during a training exercise near Guidonia,"" said the politician.js/ar (AFP, AP)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829209,UK reveals plan to stop asylum seekers in small boat,"The British government on Tuesday announced a new law barring the entry of asylum seekers who cross the English Channel in small boats.UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the legislation ""pushed the boundary of international law"" after the number of migrants arriving on England's south coast rose to more than 45,000 last year.The legislation means most people who arrive on small vessels, rather than by official means, will not be allowed to claim asylum in Britain itself.Instead, they could be detained without bail or judicial review for 28 days before being deported, either to their home country or a safe third country.The UK Home Secretary, as interior minister, would have a legal duty to remove the cross-Channel migrants.Only children, people who are medically unfit to travel, or those at a ""real risk of serious and irreversible harm” would be allowed to stay and have their claims processed in Britain.Otherwise, their case would be decided remotely after removal. The legislation would also disqualify migrants from using modern slavery laws to challenge removal by claiming they are the victims of human trafficking.At the end of 2022, government figures showed more than 160,000 people were waiting to have their asylum claims considered.While the UK's asylum system is slow, some two-thirds of small boat arrivals whose cases are examined are deemed genuine refugees.Braverman said she could not make a definitive statement that the plans were compatible with the Human Rights Act. However, she said she was ""confident that this bill is compatible with international obligations.""""If you enter Britain illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed,"" Braverman said.The opposition Labor Party immigration spokeswoman Yvette Cooper accused the government of ""ramping up the rhetoric on refugees"" while failing to solve the ""deeply damaging chaos"" in Britain's asylum system.""This bill isn't a solution,"" said Cooper. ""It is a con that risks making the chaos even worse.""The Refugee Council charity says the law meant tens of thousands of genuine refugees would be ""locked up like criminals"" under the plans. It said the new rules are unworkable and would ""shatter"" Britain's UN refugee convention commitments.Charities say migrants risk the dangerous crossing because there are not enough safe and legal ways to enter the UK as an asylum seeker.""No one wants to see families continue to risk their lives crossing the freezing channel in small boats,"" said Katy Chakrabortty of charity Oxfam GB. ""But instead of implementing this cruel bill, the UK should provide more safe and legal routes for people needing protection.""The British government has said it will establish more legal routes to asylum once the laws to stop the boat traffic are in place, adding to established for people from Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and Ukraine .However, it has not said when any new programs might begin and how many people would be accepted. It is also unclear what safe third countries might be willing to accept the migrants.A planned policy to deport new arrivals to Rwanda is being challenged in the courts and, so far, no migrant has been flown to the country.rc/ar (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829210,How China controls its top students in Germany,"Studying abroad offers a certain kind of freedom. It's something young people all over the world dream of doing. Yet, for many students, it is often only possible with the help of a state-sponsored scholarship.But what if that scholarship didn't offer you any kind of freedom at all?An investigation conducted jointly by DW and the German platform CORRECTIV shows that Chinese students in Germany are placed under repressive rules by the Chinese state. This is particularly true of young scientists and academics who come to Germany on scholarships from the China Scholarship Council (CSC).CSC scholars must sign in advance a declaration that they will not take part in any activities that ""harm"" China's security. The restrictive scholarship contract requires them to report back to the Chinese embassy on a regular basis, and anyone who violates these conditions is subject to disciplinary action.At least 30 German universities have welcomed CSC scholars from China. Some institutions have even entered into official partnerships with the council, which answers directly to China's Ministry of Education.The Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), for example, signed an agreement in 2005 to train students up to doctoral levels. So far, 492 CSC scholars have participated in this program.""The CSC has been one of the LMU's most important academic partners in China to date,"" the university responded when approached for comment.In a video posted on the university's website to mark the 15th anniversary of their cooperation, officials celebrated the CSC as ""one of the cornerstones of international relations"" and conveyed their ""heartfelt thanks.""In another example, a total of 487 doctoral CSC students have enrolled at the Free University of Berlin (FU) since 2009. The university says it has a ""privileged partnership"" with the CSC, which considers it ""a preferred host institution for CSC scholars.""Since the start of such partnerships, few, if any, questions have been raised about the China Scholarship Council as a partner.""To date, we are not aware of any agreements made between the Chinese scholars and the Chinese government,"" the LMU said. It also noted that it had never received any reports of attempts to intimidate Chinese scholars.""Academic freedom and the freedom of expression are fundamental values for the LMU, which we also demonstrate by example and communicate to the international students,"" it said.In Berlin, the FU told DW and CORRECTIV that it did not know of any specific individuals who had signed such contracts. ""However,"" it added, ""it is known that the scholars must return to China at the end of the scholarship period, otherwise they must apparently repay the scholarship money.""The FU also stressed that it ""defends the academic freedom of its members against foreign influence."" But how realistic is this, especially when it comes from China?CORRECTIV and DW have obtained copies of a number of CSC contracts from different years and from different countries. The most recent is from 2021, and was for a doctoral student studying at a German university. The document, nine pages long in the original Chinese, was translated for this investigation and compared with the other contracts. Differences were minimal.The central commitment is one of absolute allegiance to the Chinese state. The CSC scholar pledges ""to develop a sense of responsibility and mission to return to China and serve the country."" They sign that they ""shall not engage in activities that harm the interests and security of the motherland.""Furthermore, the scholar ""shall consciously safeguard the honor of the motherland, (and) obey the guidance and management of embassies (consulates) abroad."" This includes reporting to the Chinese embassy or the nearest Chinese consulate within ten days of their arrival in Germany and maintaining ""frequent contact.""They are obliged to regularly document their academic progress and provide reports to the embassy or consulate, which can include obtaining information on third parties. The scholar is required to ""promptly update personal information and mentor information"" — referring to professors and other academic staff.For at least two years after their return, the scholar is required to live in China to ""serve the country."" The contract, which also extends to relatives and friends by a guarantee clause, does not expire until after this commitment is met.Two personal guarantors must be named in advance for every CSC scholar. They are forbidden to leave China for more than three months at a time for the duration of the scholarship.If any clauses of the contract are violated, the guarantors are held jointly liable.Such predicaments can already arise if the scholar's academic performance is inadequate or the scholarship is terminated prematurely ""without a good reason"". In such cases, a penalty fee is incurred in addition to the funding amount. A four-year scholarship pays the equivalent of around €75,000 ($80,000).Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow working on China at the German Marshall Fund, sees the CSC contract as a demonstration of the Chinese Communist Party's ""mania for control.""""People are actively encouraged to intervene if anything happens that might not be in the country's interest,"" Ohlberg said.Harming China's interests is in fact considered the worst possible breach of the contract.""It's even listed ahead of possible involvement in crimes, so effectively even ahead of murder,"" she noted. ""China is making its priorities very clear here.""However, what constitutes activities detrimental to China's interests is left deliberately vague — as are the possible personal and financial consequences, seemingly aimed at creating a climate of fear.""Even abroad, Chinese people are not free, but are to remain under observation by the Party,"" Ohlberg said.A young man who has signed a CSC contract told CORRECTIV about his fears for his family, noting that he would never take part in a demonstration in Germany because the Chinese embassy reacts ""very harshly"" to criticism.He also spoke about a nightmare in which he is back home and being interrogated right at the airport: ""They ask me if I know this person or that person. I always say, yes, yes, but that I don't know what they did."" Interviews with five other Chinese students, none of them on CSC contracts, echoed similar fears.In the past five years, according to the general secretary of the CSC, Sheng Jianxue, a total of 124,000 scholarship recipients have been sent to study abroad.Just last December, Sheng emphasized that to ensure the success of the state scholarship program, ""we must first and foremost insist on arming our minds with the Chinese-style socialist ideology of [Chinese president and Party leader] Xi Jinping.""DW and CORRECTIV have approached the China Scholarship Council in Beijing as well as the Chinese Embassy in Berlin with specific questions about the controversial scholarship program. So far, the inquiries have remained unanswered.Kai Gehring, the chair of German parliament's Committee for Education and Research, says the CSC contracts are ""not compatible"" with Germany's Basic Law, which guarantees academic freedom.""Mandatory loyalty to the one-party system and patriotic sentiments, as well as family liability in the event of a supposed breach of contract, make joint, independent research work characterized by curiosity, free thinking and creativity impossible,"" he said.Yet, which institution is responsible for taking action against such restrctive agreements?Responding to inquiries from DW and CORRECTIV, Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) said that it was aware ""that the China Scholarship Council demands ideological conformity of its scholarship holders.""The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), which also awards scholarships and has cooperated with the CSC for years, argued that the CSC contracts reflect the reality of China, ""in which universities have increasingly had to comply with ideological requirements for several years.""However, the German organization noted that it was not aware of any specific clauses in the CSC contracts.In Germany, the constitution protects science and academia from political influence. As a result, the education ministry said it is up to the universities to take action.""From the BMBF's point of view, it is important that host institutions in Germany are aware of the possible constraints that CSC scholars may be under, and ensure that the academic freedom and freedom of expression enshrined in the Basic Law can also be fully enjoyed by this group of people.""The LMU in Munich and the FU in Berlin have stated that they strive to do precisely that — yet individual professors have told DW and CORRECTIV about their Chinese students' fears of possible surveillance and denunciation.Security sources told DW that they have also observed a ""forced connection"" of Chinese students to the Chinese state, particularly through CSC scholarship holders.Since the beginning of this year, reports about the problematic CSC contracts have also appeared in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The first universities there have now responded — by suspending their cooperation with the CSC.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829211,UK oil and gas workers push for clean energy transition,"""The whole country is angry at the oil and gas companies,"" said Mark, an oil rig worker who has been based on the North Sea off the coast of Scotland for 20 years.""They're taking money off the public. If BP made $9.3 billion (€8.7 billion) in profit last quarter, surely they're able to give something back,"" he added.Mark said he ""felt like crying"" when he realized that one colleague couldn't afford heating over the winter — ""someone who has worked their whole life in the industry.""Meanwhile, BP, a pioneer in North Sea oil and gas extraction since the 1960s, announced a record 2022 annual profit in February of near $30 billion on the back of the energy crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company said it was upping its shareholder dividends and cutting back emission reduction targets.Mark is part of a coalition of North Sea-based offshore oil and gas workers, climate campaigners, and trade unions who this week launched a campaign to demand a ""just"" transition from fossil fuel production to renewable energy.The plan calls for greater public investment in a clean energy sector that fairly shares the spoils with workers and communities while protecting the climate.The plan is articulated through the report ""Our Power: Offshore Workers' Demands for a Just Energy Transition,"" published Monday and authored by the London-based climate activism and research group Platform and Friends of the Earth Scotland.Created through workshops with 34 workers, the plan calls for rapid decarbonization and greater public control of the energy sector. Of over 1000 surveyed oil and gas workers, more than 90%  support the ""transformative"" demands created by colleagues that make job security and fair pay essential to the clean energy transition.To limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels, the target set by the Paris climate agreement, wealthy nations such as the United Kingdom should phase out oil and gas production by 2031, according to the report.Yet the United Kingdom has not created a plan for the managed phaseout of oil and gas production in the North Sea, with the oil industry able to determine the speed and strategy of any transition,""In the face of political refusal to plan a transition, workers are ready to lead,"" the report states.""Our Power"" also details how 73% of oil and gas companies invest nothing in renewable energy production in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, recent research shows the large disparity between the sector's promises to act on climate change and nominal efforts to actually cut planet-heating emissions.""No part of society will be safe from the impacts of climate breakdown, though the brunt of impacts will be felt by the poorest,"" the report notes.""One of the most exciting things about 'Our Power' is that it's the labor and climate movement coming together to say the same thing,"" said Gabrielle Jeliazkov, a just transition campaigner with platform and the report's co-author. ""And that is relatively rare,"" she added, ""because they are often pitted against each other.""The just transition is as much a socio-economic as it is a climate issue, she explained, with workers the victims of a fossil fuel ""boom and bust"" cycle in which some have been made redundant several times.This has especially impacted communities like the northern Scottish city of Aberdeen where one third of all jobs are related to the coal and industry, according to Jeliazkov.A worker-led just transition would institute a permanent ""excess profits"" tax on energy companies in the UK, with the money to be reinvested in communities through a sovereign wealth fund.While Norway's sovereign wealth fund totals $1.2 trillion drawn from taxes on the oil and gas extracted in its waters, and is redistributed to support public services, such a fund barely exists in the UK.This is partly because multinational fossil energy companies also pay among the lowest taxes in Europe, according to ""Our Power,"" meaning workers suffering amid a cost of living crisis are failing to share in the record windfalls.Though the five so-called super major oil and gas companies made almost $200 billion profit in 2022, fossil companies in the UK keep more revenue than in any country due to low taxes, notes ""Out Power.""But the report also cautions that renewable offshore wind business models cannot be made ""in the broken image of the oil industry.""Global energy giants like Sweden's Vattenfall have invested heavily in offshore wind in the North Sea, but have benefited from a loophole that allows the industry to pay foreign workers below the minimum wage, notes Gabrielle Jeliazkov.  ""Our Power"" notes that one wind farm off the Scottish coast paid crew under £5 (€5.62) per hour while working 12 hour days, 7 days a week.As energy workers around the world are being absorbed into the booming green power sector ,  offshore oil and gas workers in the UK want to lead the decarbonization of the sector.""Workers have been very angry at the way companies have been treating them, they have been quite frustrated with the lack of government support,"" Jeliazkov said.""The future of the UK's energy system should be in the hands of workers and communities,"" she added. ""Industry profiteering and government inaction has left us with soaring bills, declining working conditions and no plan for an energy transition.""Importantly for a more rapid energy transition, ""Our Power"" demands include retraining for up to around 32,000 of workers to make the leap into the clean energy sector.""These demands provide a blueprint for climate organisations to centre the needs of workers,"" states ""Our Power,"" adding that they can provide inspiration for workers in other industries also looking to transition.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829212,UN says Turkey's earthquake damage exceeds $100 billion,"A UN Development Program (UNDP) official said Tuesday that the damages resulting from the devastating earthquake that shook Turkey and Syria in early February will exceed $100 billion.Louisa Vinton of the UNDP further added that recovery costs could ""be on top of that"" while talking to reporters in a video call from Gaziantep in Turkey.The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6 has claimed the lives of more than 50,000 people in both countries.Last week, the World Bank calculated the damage to be at around $ 34.2 million for Turkey with recovery costs to account for double the amount.However, Vinton said that the Turkish government, with the help from the UNDP, World Bank, and the EU, estimated the costs would be far higher.She also expressed that the UNDP was ""very disappointed and saddened"" by the low-level response to the funding pleas.She said that hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed, images of which are ""apocalyptic.""""The needs are vast but the resources are scarce,"" she further added.Vinton's press briefing comes ahead of a major donor conference that aims to raise funds for the earthquake victims.

The United States and Japan praised the plan.But opposition lawmakers and activists joined the victims at a rally where they demanded a full apology and compensation from the companies involved.Yang Geum-deok, a former forced worker at a Mitsubishi factory, said that she never ""felt so distressed"" in her life.""Even if I die of hunger, I would not accept that dirty money,"" she yelled during a protest.The head of the opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, urged President Yoon Suk Yeol's government to withdraw the ""insulting"" plan. He claimed that it ""isn't a solution and will only create new problems.""During the colonial era, around 780,000 Koreans, were recruited into forced labor by Japan, according to data from Seoul.Japanese troops also forced Korean women into sexual slavery, numbers of which have not been accounted for in the data.But Japan has pressed that the 1965 accord settled all the compensation issues.The treaty aimed to restore the strained relations between Tokyo and Seoul following the 35-year Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula until the end of the World War.Yeol also defended his government's compensation scheme on Tuesday stating that it was crucial for not only bilateral but global ""freedom, peace and prosperity.""However, the lawyers representing the victims said that they will continue their efforts to secure payments from the Japanese companies despite the government's plan.""It was the Japanese who dragged us to Japan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829215,Vatican Parthenon Marbles to return to Greece,"It's a significant move that some hope could pave way for other remnants of the 160-meter-long (520-foot) frieze of the Parthenon Temple on the Acropolis to be returned to Athens.The three pieces in the Vatican museum's collection have been there since the 19th century. Now, they're finally making their way back to Athens after a transportation deal was finalized, said the Vatican. The marble fragments will arrive later in the month, with a ceremony planned to receive them on March 24, Associated Press reported.One is fragment is the head of a horse that was pulling Athena's chariot in the frieze. Another depicts the head of a young boy, believed to be taking part in a procession to commemorate the founding of Athens. The third piece is the head of a bearded male, according to the Vatican News website.In December 2022, Pope Francis gave them to Ieronymos II, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, ""as a concrete sign of his sincere desire to follow in the ecumenical path of truth,'' according to the Vatican. Similarly, in January, another fragment of the Parthenon sculptures depicting the foot of a goddess was returned to Athens by the Antonino Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo, Sicily.Such prominent museums returning fragments to Athens sends a strong signal about the reunification of all surviving pieces of the Parthenon frieze.The main debate revolves around the British Museum, which has pieces of the frieze at the centerpiece of its collection in London.The 2,500-year-old sculptures, commonly referred to as the Parthenon Marbles or ""Elgin Marbles"" have been at the center of the British Museum's collection since 1832.Greek authorities have long been campaigning for their return, claiming the items were acquired under murky circumstances.The British Museum, meanwhile, says they were acquired legally and should remain in the UK. Some scholars following the topic have gone as far as calling the decades-long discussion, the original restitution debate.The pieces on the frieze in London, which depict scenes from Greek mythology, make up roughly half of the surviving fragments of the Parthenon.They were taken under order by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople, which controlled Athens until 1832. His staff began removing them from the Acropolis in 1801 and later sold them to the British government, along with hundreds of other antique items taken from Athens.Many other marble sculpture fragments of the frieze are currently in the Athens Acropolis Museum, which opened its doors in 2009.Presently, legal barriers make it difficult for the marbles to be returned to Athens. The British Museum Act of 1963 prevents the British Museum from permanently removing objects from its collections, with only a few exceptions.In January, the UK's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said there were no plans to change such a law.Meanwhile, The British Museum confirmed in January that ""constructive discussions"" with Greek authorities related to a return — potentially a loan to Athens were ""ongoing.""Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/03/07,,

He also expressed concerns about suppression of political activism in parts of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.The report also raised concerns about the ""excessive use of force, racial profiling and discriminatory practices by police — most recently in Australia, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom.""rc/ar (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829233,EU regulator opposes brothel near its Amsterdam headquarters,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Tuesday that it was ""very concerned"" with Amsterdam's plans to open an ""erotic center"" near its headquarters.The center is to include about 100 ""work spaces"" for sex workers, as well as bars and entertainment.The agency is tasked with reviewing approvals for vaccines and new medicines, among other things.The capital of the Netherlands has been considering relocating brothels out of its historic red-light district for years as it seeks to curb the effects of mass tourism on residents. Prostitution has been legal in the country since 2000.The EMA building is near a number of major hotels and the city's financial district.Also in February, Amsterdam's city council announced a plan to ban the smoking of cannabis in the red-light district in a bid to tackle mass tourism.In February, Amsterdam announced three possible locations for the shift, including two near the new EMA building.A decision is to be made in autumn.The agency said it was ""very concerned"" about the plan to move the center.""The change of the location of the Red Light District is motivated by concerns of nuisance, drug-dealing, drunkenness and disorderly behavior,"" the EMA said.""Locating the Erotic Center in close proximity to EMA's building is likely to bring the same negative impacts to the adjacent area,"" it said, adding that it was concerned about the safety of staff and visitors.The EMA moved its headquarters from London to Amsterdam in 2019 following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.The agency noted that it had an agreement with the Dutch government on guaranteeing ""security and tranquility"" at its offices. It said it would fight the plan ""at the highest appropriate political and diplomatic level"" alongside the European Commission.sdi/ar (Reuters, dpa, AFP)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829234,Can Pakistan afford to hold general elections?,"The demand for general elections is gaining momentum in Pakistan. Supporters of ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan believe that it is the only way to drag the country out of the acute political and economic crises it is confronting. A fresh mandate for a political party, or a coalition, will do the country good, they argue.Holding elections is easier said than done, though. The incumbent Pakistan Democratic Movement government, headed by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, is reluctant to accept Khan's demand, possibly fearing that the former premier could return to power.Khan was ousted from office in 29022 by a no-confidence vote in Parliament. He accused the then army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and the US of orchestrating his ouster.The former cricket star, who heads the center-right Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been riding high in the public opinion polls ever since. The Muslim-majority South Asian country is also facing a crippling economic crisis, with the government struggling to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The economic chaos, soaring inflation, and an acute shortage of gas and electricity in the country, has made Sharif's government quite unpopular among the masses.The shortage of fuel and other essential goods, as well as a record inflation, has put many basic food items out of people's reach.Long queues of cars can be seen outside gas stations in major cities, including Pakistan's economic hub, Karachi. Many households currently have no gas to cook food, while factories are struggling to maintain operations amid power outagesand a lack of fuel.There are all kinds of other shortages right now in Pakistan.On January 26, the Pakistani rupee fell 9.6% against the dollar, which is the biggest one-day drop in over two decades. The balance of payments crisis is so severe that hundreds of foreign containers carrying food and medical supplies have been stranded in ports for weeks as authorities do not have the money to make payments.Sharif's government is now facing a difficult task to convince the IMF to renew its loan for the country to avoid a default.Could fresh elections take Pakistan out of this crisis?""The country's economic situation is a big mess, and we have run out of money. Holding general elections is a costly affair, and I think Pakistan can't afford it right now,"" Zia Rehman, an investigative journalist and political analyst, told DW.""The ideal way forward is that all stakeholders, including politicians and the army top brass, sit together and agree on a national consensus government, whose main job should be to fix the economy,"" Rehman said.Some political observers in Pakistan are of the view that the biggest hindrance to a national dialogue is Khan, whom critics accuse of being ""inflexible.""""Khan treats politics as sports, where the sole objective of a sportsman is to defeat the opponent at any cost. Politics don't work like this. Politicians have to engage with everyone, even with their opponents,"" Ghazi Salahuddin, a senior journalist, told DW.Khan's PTI believes that national dialogue is not possible with senior party leaders being targeted by the government. Several party officials have been rounded up in the past few months, and Khan, too, is facing an imminent arrest on corruption allegations.Fawad Chaudhry, a PTI leader, recently said the government was making excuses to delay the general election, adding that its ""days are now numbered.""Economic crisis is not the only obstacle to holding general elections in Pakistan. The security situation, with the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ramping up violent attacks in various parts of the country, has worsened in the past few weeks.In February, five people died after a Taliban suicide squad attacked a police compound in Karachi.In January, a bomb at a mosque often frequented by police personnel in Peshawar killed more than 80 officers.A suicide bombing killed at least 10 officers in southwest Pakistan on Monday, a police spokesperson said. More than a dozen others were wounded in the blast, which targeted a police truck near Sibi, a city 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Quetta in Balochistan province.""Pakistan does not have funds to deal with the security challenge. This poses a great risk to the country's stability,"" the analyst Rehman said.The situation is worrisome for the powerful military, which has also come under sharp criticism from Khan and his supporters. Against this backdrop, observers say, early elections alone might not end the political tug-of-war, resolve Pakistan's economic issues and overcome security challenges. Things could get even worse.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829235,Bangladesh: Explosion kills at least 11,"At least eleven people have been killed and scores more injured following an explosion in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, police said.The explosion occurred in a commercial building in Gulistan, a busy commercial area in Dhaka.According to fire department official Rashid bin Khaled details of the cause of the explosion remain scarce and could not be immediately determined.Fatal building fires and explosions are not uncommon in Bangladesh, where enforcement of safety regulations is often lacking.The explosion shook the fourth and the fifth floor of the building, causing damage to two neighboring buildings. No fire broke out though.More than 150 firefighters from 11 different fire teams were at the scene to help in rescue efforts, a fire services spokesperson said.According to police inspector Bacchu Mia, at least 40 people were injured and hospitalized, 11 of whom had died.""Two of the dead are women,"" he said, adding, ""the rest are injured and being treated.""A man in a bloody shirt told reporters that he had been caught up in the blast, which had shattered windows and damaged a wall of the building.""There were people lying on the floor. I escaped by climbing out from the window,"" he said.The country has a history of industrial disasters including factories catching fire with workers trapped inside. Observers have blamed reluctant safety enforcement and corruption for the recurring disasters.In 2012, about 117 workers died when they were trapped in a garment factory behind closed doors in Dhaka. The following year, the Rana Plaza garment factory outside Dhaka collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people the worst industrial disaster in the country.In 2019 an inferno burnt an area in Old Dhaka, claiming 67 lives. Another fire in the same area killed at least 123 in an illegal chemicals warehouse.In 2021, another blaze killed at least 52 people at a food and beverage factory, many of whom were trapped inside by an illegally locked door.An explosion at an oxygen plant near the southern port city of Chittagong on Saturday killed three people.dmn/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/07,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829236,Women's Day: Iranian women vow to press on despite clampdown,"People across the world are celebrating International Women's Day this Wednesday, March 8, but in Iran, Women's Day this year fell on January 13.In the Islamic republic, the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima, is marked as Women's Day.The fact that it is also celebrated as Mother's Day fits in with the official image of women.Fatima's birthday in the Islamic lunar calendar has no fixed place in the Persian solar Hijri calendar.Therefore, the official Women's Day must be determined newly every year and adapted to the Persian calendar, which regulates all public life in Iran.But the ideology behind it hasn't changed for decades. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the nation's clerical rulers have been trying to control the image and role of women in the public sphere.In their view, the role model for women must be Fatima, who was married off at the age of nine and became a mother of five children. They want today's Iranian women to be like her — a pious wife who was compliant, subordinate and hardly visible in public.Despite 44 years of propaganda in state media and systematic attempts at brainwashing in all educational institutions — from kindergarten to university — the Iranian regime has failed to prevent women from rising up against the clerical establishment.Last year, Iran witnessed the biggest and longest protests since 1979, triggered by the death of a young Iranian-Kurdish woman — the 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini — under suspicious circumstances after being arrested by Iran's ""morality police"" for allegedly failing to properly wear the hijab.""The protests were unprecedented in our city. In the first seven days, three-quarters of the protesters were women,"" Leila, from a city in the country's Kurdish region, told DW.Leila said she and her friends also organized demonstrations in her city.The first rallies took place at Jina Mahsa Amini's funeral in her Kurdish hometown.But the protests quickly spread, even to cities better known for their conservatism where protesters would be easily recognized.The lack of anonymity meant those breaking the rules — like not wearing the Islamic headscarf in public — faced a greater danger of being identified and caught by authorities.""The security services were surprised by our courage. I even had the feeling that they were afraid,"" said Leila.She was arrested on the seventh day of the protests.""Not for the first time. In the last few years, I have been arrested several times. But this time it was different. The people who interrogated me had less self-confidence and were visibly nervous,"" she noted.""But that didn't mean they were at all lenient. They were violent, not only on the streets, but also in the prisons. We know that many women were raped — to break them and intimidate them.""Two weeks after her arrest, Leila was released on bail. She was later sentenced to two years probation. ""If I make one wrong move, they will lock me up,"" she said.""We will not give up. Our uprising has drawn people from all generations, ethnicities and classes. We are looking for other forms of resistance and will soon mobilize ourselves.""Anti-government protests have subsided in recent months following the regime's harsh clampdown. According to rights groups, at least 525 demonstrators have been killed by security forces, including 71 minors, during more than 100 days of protests.While around 20,000 were arrested by early January, some of them were released from overcrowded prisons by the end of February.The pressure on women's activists and civil society organizations, however, has not abated, with authorities summoning and trying to intimidate them one by one. ""They want to silence us,"" said a well-known lawyer, who does not want to be named due to security concerns.""I will continue to stand up for the people who are fighting for their rights. That's what bothers the security authorities: the courage of women who think independently and stand up for what they believe is right. And there are many of them in Iran.""""The world should stand by these women,"" said Masih Alinejad, a US-based Iranian women's rights activist and prominent critic of the Islamic regime.Alinejad, who has nearly nine million followers on social media, was invited to the Munich Security Conference this year as a representative of Iranian civil society.For the first time, no representative of the Islamic Republic was invited to the forum.""The world's leading democratic countries must isolate the Islamic Republic, just as they have isolated [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" she said.""We see that the tone toward the Islamic Republic of Iran has changed. We now demand that they announce a new Iran policy and, for example, classify the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization,"" she added.""Iranian women need strong decisions from politicians and a global sisterhood.""Many female politicians from Western countries have expressed their solidarity with the protest movement in Iran.Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, for instance, chopped locks of her hair in solidarity.But the minister came under sharp criticism from activists after she met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in late February, with many casting doubts over her support for Iranian women.Observers think that the meeting between both foreign ministers may have been focused on the case of a Belgian aid worker, Olivier Vandecasteele, imprisoned in Iran.Vandecasteele was sentenced to 40 years in prison and 74 lashes in January 2023.There is reason to believe that Iranian authorities are holding him in order to persuade Belgian authorities to agree to a prisoner exchange, which could pave the way for an Iranian diplomat convicted of terrorism by a Belgian court to be sent back to Tehran.""The support and solidarity of female Western politicians meant a lot to us in the beginning,"" said Leila. ""But we know that in the end, they think of their political and economic interests. We won't make our struggle dependent on them.""This article was originally written in German.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/07,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829249,UK architect David Chipperfield wins 2023 Pritzker Prize,"British architect David Chipperfield won the 2023 Pritzker Prize, organizers announced on Tuesday.The US-based Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said in a statement that Chipperfield was honored for ""timeless modern design that confronts climate urgencies, transforms social relationships and reinvigorates cities.""The foundation said that every one of Chipperfield's works ""becomes a civic undertaking serving society."" It praised the architect for his ""subtle yet powerful, subdued yet elegant"" works.""He is a prolific architect who is radical in his restraint,"" the foundation said.Hyatt Foundation chairman Tom Pritzker said, ""He is assured without hubris, consistently avoiding trendiness to confront and sustain the connections between tradition and innovation, serving history and humanity.""The Pritzker Prize was first awarded in 1979. Winners of the profession's most prestigious award receive a bronze medallion and a $100,000 (€94,552) grant.The prize has been awarded to the UK's Norman Foster, Japan's Arata Isoyaki and India's Balkrishna Vithaldas. In 2022, Burkina Faso-born Diebedo Francis Kere become the first prize winner from Africa.Chipperfield said that he was ""overwhelmed"" to win the prize.""I take this award as an encouragement to continue to direct my attention not only to the substance of architecture and its meaning but also to the contribution that we can make as architects to address the existential challenges of climate change and societal inequality,"" he said.Architects ""can have a more prominent and engaged role in creating not only a more beautiful world but a fairer and more sustainable one too,"" Chipperfield said.""We must rise to this challenge and help inspire the next generation to embrace this responsibility with vision and courage.Chipperfield is known for renovations and reconstructions of old buildings while honoring their history and preserving the environment.He rebuilt the Neues Museum in Berlin, which was built in the 19th Century and largely destroyed during World War II.He is also known for rebuilds of Venice's Procuratie Vecchie, the Museo Jumex in Mexico City and the Museom of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany.Chipperfield has completed more than 100 projects in Asia, Europe and North America.Last month, Athen's National Archeological Museum announced that he would lead an upgrade of the institution.sdi/ar (AFP, AP)",2023/03/07,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829253,Ukraine: How the war is making soil and water toxic,"At some point, the war in Ukraine will end, hopefully. But even when it does, when the deathly explosions of all the rockets and bombs cease, their destructive potential will be far from exhausted.Because the grenades, mines and other explosive shots have destroyed buildings and that has released asbestos into the environment. They have also hit refineries, allowing oil and other chemicals to leak into the ground, soils and water systems. That's not to mention the ammunition itself, which contains toxic elements. These corrosive chemicals have come to stay.The news agency Reuters reports that at least 10.5 million hectares of agricultural land in Ukraine has been contaminated with chemicals, with ramifications for global food security.Once those chemicals get into the soils and ground water, it may only be a matter of time before they get into humans via plants, animals and drinking water.At least, that is what toxicologists say could happen. They are not entirely sure how the environment will deal with these toxic substances or what effect they could have on humans.""We're only just starting to deal with the munitions left in the oceans,"" said Edmund Maser, director of the Institute for Toxicology at the University Clinic in Kiel, Germany.So, many questions remain unanswered. But Maser's research has led him and his team to one conclusion already — and that is that poisonous chemicals are bad news for living things.Alone in the German parts of the North and Baltic Seas, said Maser, there are 1.6 million tons of rusting munitions resting on the seabed.As these munitions degrade and corrode, they release toxic cocktails into the water, endangering the ecosystem, and those toxins may ultimately end up in fish and other seafood that people eat.Among the most dangerous elements in munitions are the explosives themselves, and the heavy metals. That includes Trinitrotoluene, better known as TNT, a nitroaromatic compound that is known for its explosive power.""We know through feeding experiments on rats and mice that TNT is toxic,"" said Maser, who has also observed how TNT from the sunken munitions is toxic for ocean life.""TNT compromises the ability of marine life to reproduce, grow and develop,"" said Maser. ""We also know from these studies that TNT and other explosives are carcinogenic.""Some heavy metals, such as arsenic and cadmium, are carcinogenic.""Above all, the detonators contain heavy metals, such as mercury in the form of a fulminant that makes the TNT explode faster,"" said Maser. A fulminant acts as a kind accelerant.As a heavy metal, mercury is also damaging for nerve cells: ""It can lead to birth defects in unborn babies,"" said Maser.Lead has similar effects and can cause development disorders or miscarriages.Kateryna Smirnova, a researcher at the Sokolovsky Institute for Soil Science and Agrochemistry Research at Ukraine's National Academy of the Sciences, said that soil samples from Kharkiv — one of the major battle sites in the east of the country — had already shown higher concentrations of lead and cadmium.Smirnova's colleague, Oksana Naidyonova, a microbiologist at the Sokolovsky Institute, explained that heavy metals have a negative effect on bacteria in the soil.""They inhibit the development of plants and the supply of micronutrients, which leads to physiological defects and reduces their ability to withstand disease,"" Naidyonova said.But the chemicals won't necessarily stay in the soil. TNT, for example, could be carried away by the wind and distributed farther afield, said Maser. And rain may reach some of the substances found deeper in the ground.""The elements may then get into surface waters and contaminate streams, rivers and lakes,"" he said.Based on his research in the North and Baltic Seas, Maser said it was possible that the munitions chemicals in Ukraine would enter the food chain.""We are concerned that people could be at risk if they eat contaminated fish,"" he said.And if the rains run off, allowing the chemicals to get into the ground water, ""that would mean drinking water was at risk of becoming contaminated,"" Maser said.If the water ""seeps"" in that way, plants could consume mercury and other chemicals. And if those plants happen to be crops like wheat or vegetables, then those chemicals would likewise end up on our dinner plates.Maser thinks the war will leave the Black Sea — off Ukraine's southern coast, where a lot of the fighting has taken place — in a similar state as the North and Baltic Seas when this war is over. He said it will be a sea full of poisonous munitions that is easily forgotten.His team are looking for ways to extract toxic TNT from the water. ""We hope that bacteria could do it,"" he said. But the researchers have yet to find a bacterium that could be deployed systematically. So, it's still a problem to be solved.The toxicologist said it may be possible to remove the top layer of soil in Ukraine and use various processes to remove the heavy metals and TNT. Such methods are, however, expensive and take a long time.The experts DW contacted at Ukraine's Sokolovsky Institute said they estimated the total damage could run to more than $15 billion. But they stressed that that was a preliminary calculation.In any case, when we talk about removing heavy metals, all we mean is moving them from one location to another, where they would be less likely to harm people and other living things. As Maser told us, heavy metals are heavy metals forever: ""You can't get rid of them.""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/07,,

Furthermore, the exchange  announced its plans to apply for a license from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to provide crypto trading services in the city under the new regulatory framework.            ChangeNOW's metrics indicate that Hong Kong users are highly interested in the platform. Its Hong Kong user base has grown by 62% in February compared to January, according to its  figures, showing a steady upswing in demand.   Based on a  survey of 389,345 people across 26 countries, the Finder 2022 Cryptocurrency Adoption Index ranks Hong Kong fourth for its adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to it, there are approximately 1.4 million crypto owners in Hong Kong, which represents a 21% ownership rate, higher than the global average of 15%.   The sudden rise in popularity of ChangeNOW in Hong Kong is most probably triggered by a combination of several factors. These include ChangeNOW's good name, extensive product and service infrastructure, an innovative customer service model, along with low fees and fast transaction times.   ChangeNOW has a well-earned reputation for being a trustworthy crypto exchange. This is especially after the case in late 2021 when it  returned over $15 million in crypto to Compound, which lost over $89 million due to a system bug. In total, ChangeNOW was able to  recover over $19 million in crypto funds.   Over 3.5M users worldwide have taken advantage of the platform's ecosystem built over 6.5 years of operation. Aside from its native non-custodial  NOW Wallet, ChangeNOW also offers a portfolio tracker and crypto payment service. In addition, it provides an affiliate program and custody solutions for businesses.   Beginners will find the platform’s interface easy to use, and Mandarin localization aims to make it accessible to Chinese-speaking Hong Kong residents. ChangeNOW allows Hong Kong users to buy, sell, and exchange more than 800 crypto assets and 40 fiat currencies, including HKD and USD, through a mobile and web-friendly interface.   However, ChangeNOW's key feature is its non-custodial nature. The crypto industry is still reeling from the FTX/Almeda scandal, involving Bankman-Fried and his fellow founders stealing $8 billion from FTX customers' crypto deposits for Alameda's own purposes. This is a major reason for ChangeNOW's growing popularity in Hong Kong, as its non-custodial model ensures that there is no risk of users’ funds being misused in any way.   Additionally, the platform’s fixed rate options along with the fees built into the exchange rate, make it a popular choice among users who prefer to know what they're getting up front.   Although other exchanges have also announced expansion plans in Hong Kong, the number of Hong Kongers exchanging assets with ChangeNOW continues to rise. This highlights the fact that ChangeNOW's user base is growing in the region despite the increased competition.   With its licensing plans in Hong Kong, ChangeNOW further cements its commitment to bringing cryptocurrency exchange services on an international scale in an efficient, compliant manner.

This week, construction began on the power transformation and computation center infrastructure at Pow.re's 8.5 hectare site directly adjacent to ANDE's newly commissioned substation.   On February 26th, 2023, ANDE, Paraguay's national public utility, energized the first of three 500 kV transmission lines between the Itaipu dam and Yguazu. ANDE President, Felix Sosa, announced on Twitter that Paraguay would ""for the first time in history be able to withdraw 100% of the power corresponding to it in the ITAIPU Binacional, thus achieving our national energy sovereignty"". The Itaipu dam is the third largest in the world with a 14 GW production capacity, the ITAIPU Binacional agreement entitles Paraguay and Brazil to consume 50% of this capacity each (historically, Paraguay has sold the bulk of its share of Itaipu power capacity to Brazil).   The project is a singular opportunity to generate emission-free computing power from a world-class hydroelectric power plant, made even more timely as the US energy sector has been plagued with soaring electricity prices due to regional reliance on natural gas. Pow.re Director of Engineering, Maxime Bisaillon stated, ''This is a unique opportunity to access a large amount of 100% renewable power at a competitive price. We believe this set of circumstances doesn't exist anywhere else in the world'' adding, ""This further validates our position that stranded sustainable power can be put to use for the mutual benefit of green power producers like Paraguay and HDC enterprises like Pow.re''   When fully operational, the Yguazu site would allow Pow.re to produce an additional estimated 4.5 EH/s (exahash per second) of computing power.   In conjunction with deploying this project, the Company also welcomes Andres Romero and Matthew Carson as advisors. Mr. Romero has an extensive understanding of the South American business landscape and the digital asset mining sector, while Mr. Carson brings a wealth of experience deploying large-scale projects such as Project Spokane and Whinstone. Both advisors formerly held positions at Canaan Creative (NASDAQ: CAN) and Northern Data (ETR: NB2) and are respected industry veterans that will help advance the Company's business development goals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829356,"Growth in Asia will lose pace in 2023, only to pick up next year","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 8 March 2023 -  Atradius, a global trade insurance leader, has today released its  2023 Regional Economic Outlook report,  setting out growth forecasts for key economies in Asia, including the outlook for a newly reopened China,  and offering a long-term view on the risks of geo-economic fragmentation resulting from ongoing supply chain reconfigurations and geopolitical tensions.   Please find below the key takeaways from  Bert Burger, Principal Economist, Atradius, and the full report is available for download  here.   Overall Asia macro-economic outlook:        Asian economies are on course for modest growth this year as they try to shake off the negative effects of tighter financial conditions, inflation, a weak global economic environment and geopolitical tensions.               Except for China and Thailand,      most economies in Asia will likely see lower real GDP growth this year than in 2022. However, as the aforementioned headwinds weaken over the coming months and the impact of China's reopening cascades through the region,      the recovery is expected to pick up momentum in 2024.     Major Asian economies' performance: a mixed bag        For China, weak export demand from developed economies and a struggling real estate sector will counterbalance the benefits of reopening and supportive fiscal and monetary policies — capping growth at no higher than 4.5% this year compared to 3% in 2022. Over the long run, structural issues such as an ageing population, low productivity growth, human capital mismatch, supply chain shifts and geopolitical rivalry may limit China's growth,      risking a middle-income trap.         India is set to be the fastest-growing economy in Asia this year and next, expanding at 4.8% and 6.8%, respectively. The country's relatively strong performance is underpinned by a less severe surge in inflation, a      strong domestic economy that is offsetting decline in external demand, and      improving overall business environment, which is attracting international investments.       In Japan and South Korea – growth will be muted this year at 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively – as high inflation dents their recovery. High household debt in South Korea has kept a lid on consumer spending after recent rate hikes. Meanwhile, pent-up demand in Japan will partly compensate for inflation, supporting the recovery in domestic consumption to continue but at a slower rate than last year.      ASEAN-5[1] more resilient than ever:            With their increasingly robust economies and financial systems, the five largest emerging markets in Southeast Asia known as      ASEAN-5 have remained resilient against recent external shocks, making them more likely to benefit from the global supply chain diversification trend.           The      Philippines is poised to grow the fastest at 4.1%, followed by Thailand (4%) and Vietnam (4%).      Thailand's resurgence as a preferred holiday destination will boost tourism revenues and push growth to 4% compared to 2.6% in 2022. Indonesia will be a laggard, growing at 3.6% before seeing a surge in growth to 5.5% in 2024, as private investments benefit from a new law.          Emerging risk of geo-economic fragmentation:          While the diversification of supply chains, triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, has benefited countries like India, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, a broadening of this trend may risk a      sharp geo-economic fragmentation of financial and trade flows.                Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions on the country have already led to increased uncertainty around future trade relations. The potential      consequences of a fragmentation scenario – reduced investments, jobs and growth – are expected to result in large economic losses for Asia due to its central role in global manufacturing.         [1] ASEAN-5 consists of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Together with five other states, they form ASEAN or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829359,Giant 56 kg stingray caught off southwest Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A monstrous stingray was caught off the coast of southwestern Taiwan on Tuesday (March 7) and was sold for NT$672 (US$21.81) to a restaurant, which promptly cooked it up for customers that same day.Fishermen caught the stingray off the coast of Chiayi County's Dongshi Township, which weighed in at 56 kilograms, reported Liberty Times. According to Wu Chun-yu (吳純裕), director of the Donghsi Fish Market of the Chiayi District Fisherman's Association, the tail of the common stingray is hard with barbs, but this specimen's tail is ""feather-like and soft in appearance.""(Wu Chun-yu photo)Wu said it was the first time that he had seen this species. He said that fishermen call this type a ""water stingray"" because no one dares to eat it.During an auction at the fish market, the owner of a stir-fry restaurant in Yunlin County bought the fish for NT$12 per kilogram, which came to a total of NT$672. He said he would put it on display in front of his eatery.Deepwater stingray (left) compared to common stingray. (Wu Chun-yu photo)Kuo Shih-jung (郭世榮), an associate professor of the Department of Aquatic Biosciences at National Chiayi University, said the fish was a deepwater stingray or giant stingaree (Plesiobatis daviesi) and is the sole member of the family Plesiobatidae. He said that this is different from the common stingray and may have been caught by deepwater bottom trawls.Wu said that the fishermen caught the stingray Tuesday morning in the open sea. As there are few deepwater commercial fisheries operating in its range, which includes Taiwan, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists its status as least concern.(Wu Chun-yu photo)Later on Tuesday, the stingray was spotted outside the entrance of a stir-fry restaurant in Yunlin County's Douliu City. Restaurant owner Hsieh Chia-ta (謝佳達) told UDN he was the man who had bought it at the Dongshi Fish Market.Hsieh said that the species is difficult to handle, and many people do not know how to prepare them. However, he said that because he is a chef and runs a stir-fry restaurant, he is skilled at preparing such unusual seafood and has the ability to turn the stingray into a ""delicious Q bomb.""(Wu Chun-yu photo)A customer at the restaurant surnamed Hu (胡) said that they had never seen such a big stingray and it was very strange to eat one for the first time. Hu said that it was a real eye-opener to watch the restaurateur fillet the stingray.According to Hu, when stir-fried, the stingray's liver was soft and tender, with a somewhat ""fishy smell."" However, when its liver was deep-fried, it was salty, fragrant, and crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside, with almost no such fishy odor.(Wu Chun-yu photo)Hu described the experience as a really rare feast for the palate.(Wu Chun-yu photo)(Wu Chun-yu photo)(Wu Chun-yu photo)(Wu Chun-yu photo)(Wu Chun-yu photo)",2023/03/08,2276,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829388,McCarthy confirms he will meet with Taiwan president,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy confirmed that he plans to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) during her trip to the U.S. this year, but he stressed that the meeting does not mean he is ruling out a future trip to Taiwan.On Tuesday (March 7), the Financial Times cited several sources saying McCarthy agreed with Tsai that it would be better to meet in the U.S. to avoid a repeat of the provocative military maneuvers launched by China after then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit. Bloomberg on Wednesday (March 8) cited McCarthy as confirming he indeed plans to meet with Tsai during her visit to his home state of California.McCarthy emphasized that his meeting with Tsai, ""has nothing to do with my travel, if I would go to Taiwan."" He then defiantly added, “China can’t tell me where and when I can go.""Days before former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last year, McCarthy pledged he would visit if he became house speaker. He then reiterated that vow in February after taking Pelosi's post and had been reportedly preparing to take a bipartisan group of lawmakers with him.However, the Financial Times on Tuesday cited a Taiwanese official as saying that Tsai had presented McCarthy with, ""some intelligence about what the Chinese Communist Party is recently up to and the kinds of threats they pose."" The official also referenced China's current domestic turmoil and reportedly described China as ""not in a good situation.""",2023/03/08,2598,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829422,US-Taiwan Business Council urges Washington to provide substantial support for Taiwan's defense,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Washington needs to do more to bolster Taiwan’s defense, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) President Rupert J. Hammond-Chambers said in a USTBC press release issued on Tuesday (March 7).

            U.S. military and government officials, as well as lawmakers, have all “expressed a sense of urgency” about the Chinese threat towards Taiwan, but the White House has not acted with the same imperativeness. According to Hammond-Chambers, “General rhetorical support for Taiwan is not enough, nor is the narrowness of security assistance focused solely on a so-called asymmetric approach.""

            Hammond-Chambers indicated that the proposed Taiwan Policy Act would establish a standard for U.S. interests regarding Taiwan and benefit national security. However, the bill ultimately did not garner enough support due to fear of provoking China.

            Hammond-Chambers noted that some of the bill’s security provisions were included in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, but the most impactful Taiwan-related provisions were left out.











            The council president believes the Taiwan government is now in a ""quandary."" It needs to maintain close relations with the U.S., but the Ministry of National Defense, Legislative Yuan, and National Security Council are all concerned about the “asymmetric” approach to defense that is currently applied by Washington.

            “The threat that China poses to Taiwan extends beyond a D-Day style attack, but American support for the island apparently does not,” said Hammond-Chambers.

            He also added that the White House’s failure to help boost Taiwan’s defense only leaves one winner in this situation: China. Hammond-Chambers asserted, “Their silence on this matter to date is deafening, and it is a good indication that they’re staying out of the way lest any comments end up rallying support for future grants to Taiwan.”TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Washington needs to do more to bolster Taiwan’s defense, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) President Rupert J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829447,84-year-old philanthropist vying for Taiwan presidency in 2024,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's former Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien (王建煊) on Tuesday (March 7) announced his intention to run in the 2024 presidential elections, while claiming the country is ""entering its doom.""According to Taiwan's election laws, to be eligible to run, Wang needs to collect 282,104 signatures, representing 1.5% of registered voters from the last national election, by September.Currently, the political parties eligible to nominate presidential candidates based on previous elections are the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP). Potential candidates at this point are Vice President and DPP Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德), New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) of the KMT, and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) of the TPP, while Foxconn founder and billionare Terry Gou (郭台銘), who is looking to return to the KMT, has also said he is interested in running.Wang served as the head of the Control Yuan under the Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) administration between 2008 and 2014 and as finance minister between 1990 and 1992. The 84-year-old Wang is known for his tax expertise and wide range of philanthropic activities.In 1993, he left the KMT after a feud with other party factions and co-founded the pro-China New Party with other former prominent KMT members. The New Party advocates peaceful unification with China and is opposed to Taiwan's independence, while it has failed to secure any legislative seats since 2016 and has become increasingly marginalized.Wang told the media that Taiwan should have diverse political views. He said he feels that the DPP's pro-independence views and the KMT's ambiguity between pro-unification and pro-independence will lead to Taiwan's doom if China decides to invade.""Taiwan is now in an extremely dangerous situation, and I will join the race for the good of the people,"" Wang said in an interview with Awakening News. He claimed the DPP was too friendly to the U.S. and obsessed with power at the expense of the people.""The NT$500 billion in arms deals with the U.S. should all be scrapped,"" Wang said. The pro-China candidate claimed that the weapons were unnecessary due to his belief that ""Chinese won't attack Chinese.""Despite his opposition to U.S. arms sales, he emphasized that he is not anti-American and is grateful for the decade-long financial aid the U.S. provided to Taiwan between 1951 and 1965. Wang is expected to formerly announce his presidential bid in Taipei on March 29.",2023/03/08,1261,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829470,Taiwan's gross national income tops South Korea for 1st time in 20 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's gross national income (GNI) per capita last year beat South Korea's for the first time in 20 years, due to greater relative depreciation of the South Korean won to the U.S. dollar and stronger performance by Taiwan's semiconductor industry.South Korea's GNI per capita last year was US$32,661, representing a 7.7% decrease from 2021, according to the Bank of Korea. In 2022, the won suffered a 12.9% depreciation against the dollar, leading to a drop of 8.1% in South Korea's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) denominated in U.S. dollars.However, the bank pointed out that on a won basis, South Korea's nominal GDP actually rose 3.8% over the previous year to 2,150.6 trillion won. In addition, its GNI on a won basis rose by 4.3% to 42.203 million won.With a GNI per capita of US$33,565 in 2022, Taiwan exceeded South Korea's GNI by US$904. This marks the first time Taiwan has surpassed South Korea's per capita GNI since 2002.Meanwhile, the New Taiwan dollar depreciated less against the U.S. dollar compared to the won at 6.8%.Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's (TIER) Department of International Affairs, outlined two main factors cited by CNA leading to Taiwan rising past South Korea. First, the won depreciated against the U.S. dollar more than the NT dollar.The second factor, according to Chiu, is that during the pandemic, Taiwan's exports, particularly of semiconductors, increased amid the accelerated adoption of the digital economy. Meanwhile, South Korea's trade surplus turned into a trade deficit, dragging down its economic performance.Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) Vice President Wang Jiann-chyuan (王健全) told CNA that Taiwan's economic growth rate has been strong over the past years. Wang said that the pandemic has driven telemedicine, online entertainment, and consumer electronics, while the U.S.-China technology war has driven semiconductor orders from Taiwan.Wang said Taiwan is also leveraging its geographical location with its New Southbound Policy. He asserted that Taiwan's epidemic prevention measures have been effective while not negatively impacting Taiwan's manufacturers.As to why South Korea's exports and economic performance have not been commensurate, Wang said that South Korea's semiconductor production is mainly designed for consumer electronics, while Taiwan's chips have a more diversified customer base. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has a dominant market share of high-end semiconductors, while the demand for consumer electronics has declined, impacting South Korea more severely.Wang said in recent years, South Korean firms have also faced increasing competition from Chinese rivals. In addition to semiconductors, South Korean companies face fierce competition from Chinese corporations in other industries such as consumer electronics, home appliances, and mobile phones, greatly hampering exports.",2023/03/08,4514,Business

Global Shrink Bags Market
Shrink Bags Market Overview:

The Global Shrink Bags Market refers to the industry that produces and sells bags that are made of heat-shrinkable plastic materials. These bags are designed to shrink when exposed to heat, conforming tightly to the shape of the product being packaged, providing a secure and tight-fitting seal.

The shrink bags market caters to various industries, including food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and consumer goods. These bags are commonly used to package meat, poultry, seafood, and cheese products, as well as other perishable items that require a longer shelf life.

Some of the key factors driving the growth of the shrink bags market include the increasing demand for convenient and easy-to-use packaging solutions, the growing focus on food safety and hygiene, and the rising popularity of e-commerce and online shopping.

In terms of geography, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing market for shrink bags, owing to the increasing demand for packaged food products and the rising disposable income of consumers in the region. North America and Europe are also significant markets for shrink bags, driven by the growth of the food and beverage industry and the increasing adoption of advanced packaging solutions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829561,Sennheiser Digital 6000 wireless system shines bright during Rihanna’s Super Bowl LVII halftime performance,"In her first live performance in seven years, the star used a Sennheiser microphone in the face of a harsh RF environment 

PHOENIX, US -  Media OutReach - 8 March 2023 - Rihanna delivered the second-most watched halftime show in Super Bowl history on Sunday, exceeding the average viewership of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs football match by 5 million, according to data from Fox. The highly anticipated performance was driven by Sennheiser's Digital 6000 wireless microphone system and a custom chrome SKM 6000 transmitter with an MD 9235 dynamic cardioid microphone capsule. The choice to go with the Sennheiser wireless system may seem like a minor detail, but the sonic integrity of the performance hung in the balance as the State Farm Arena in the greater Phoenix area is technically one of the most challenging environments for coordinating wireless frequencies.        (Photo Credit: imago)     There were over 2000 frequencies coordinated in Phoenix over the Super Bowl weekend as dozens of simultaneous events took place in the area, including the 2023 NFL Honors Awards, various VIP events, outdoor concerts and more. With this, and the ever-shrinking spectrum available for wireless microphone operators, the audio engineers and frequency coordinators for this year's broadcast had their work cut out for them.       (Photo Credit: imago)     ""Phoenix is a challenging city because it is the only one that officially does not have a vacant UHF TV channel. They are all allocated for broadcast, so there is very little spectrum available for wireless mics,"" says Joe Ciaudelli, Director of Spectrum & Innovation at Sennheiser, ""to make matters more complicated, although it is an indoor stadium with a retractable roof, the State Farm Arena does not provide much shielding from outside RF signals, making it vulnerable to interference."" Ciaudelli is an industry veteran and international expert on spectrum and wireless system operations. He contributed the chapter on wireless microphones to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) Handbook and is a private sector adviser in the U.S. delegation to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations' specialized agency on information and communications.       Sennheiser's Director of Spectrum & Innovation, Joe Ciaudelli is an international expert on spectrum and wireless system operations. (Photo Credit: Joe Ciaudelli)     The location and circumstances made the already high-stakes Super Bowl halftime show that much more exacting for the audio professionals involved. ""Thanks to their resourcefulness and diligent planning, the audio engineers and NFL frequency coordinators were able to combat the harsh RF environment this year by leveraging Special Temporary Authorizations (STA) via the FCC, along with some other workarounds,"" recounts Ciaudelli. An STA gives licensed wireless microphone operators temporary access to frequency bands that are not permitted for wireless mics. The engineers also leveraged channels occupied by low power or distant TV stations and used clever placement of directional antennas to further attenuate these unwanted TV signals, before being picked up by the wireless microphone receivers. Without this planning and resourcefulness, the entire broadcast, including Rihanna's performance, would have been at risk of audio dropouts and interference – a massive potential faux pas for her long-awaited showing.   Beyond safeguarding the wireless signal via the STA and directional antennas, the audio team had to be thoughtful with the choice of the wireless microphone system for Rihanna. Not only to ensure her vocals sounded as remarkable as the last time she performed live all those years ago, but also to combat the tough RF environment and establish a reliable wireless connection. Her MD 9235 microphone capsule offered sparkle on her vocals, while the Digital 6000 did the rest. Ciaudelli shares, ""not only is the Digital 6000 with the MD 9235 capsule a great sounding microphone, but it also has such good intermodulation suppression and a clean RF signal. This is one tool that would work in an environment where all others might fail – it is a marvel of engineering from both the RF and audio standpoints. I am not surprised that it was used by the star.""   Ciaudelli continues, ""this year's Super Bowl highlights the challenges of a lack of suitable available spectrum for wireless mics that has led STAs to be a tiresome staple at almost all professional sporting events today. Even though it is called a Special Temporary Authorization, it is becoming so routinely used that they might as well start calling them Standard Temporary Authorizations."" As professional sporting events become more multifaceted and the wireless audio and video channel counts increase, the challenges of the spectrum crunch will only get more difficult to navigate.

Vietnam’s labor ministry expects the outward migration of workers to reach between 110,000 and 120,000 people this year, about 25% of the target so far.Vietnam’s labor ministry stated in February that Vietnamese overseas workers are important resources for the country when they return home, as they improve “industry manners, labor discipline, and become the cultural bridge between Vietnam and the international.” The Ministry also said that the Taiwan labor market provides good income and working conditions for Vietnamese people.Despite Taiwan’s border opening, labor and activist groups have protested the discriminatory entry policies that blue-collar migrant workers face, as they must jump through more hurdles than white-collar foreign workers or tourists. A researcher from Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA) Wu Jing-ru (吳靜如) told Taiwan News in February that unlike others entering Taiwan from the same regions, migrant workers must upload evidence of a suitable quarantine facility and apply for reentry permits.However, the opportunities to earn higher wages in Taiwan still make it an attractive location for Vietnamese workers. Vietnam’s ministry of labor deputy Nguyen Ba Hoan said that higher wages contribute significantly to the country’s income, increase savings, and improve the lives of workers and their families.",2023/03/08,1992,New Immigrants

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829570,Taiwan to ease COVID rules for inbound migrant workers on March 15,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Labor (MOL) on Tuesday (March 7) announced that starting on March 15, COVID regulations will be loosened for migrant workers arriving from overseas, including the easing of testing requirements and expanding locations where self-health monitoring can be conducted.The MOL's Workforce Development Agency (WDA) issued a press release saying that starting on March 15, only incoming migrant workers who show COVID symptoms will undergo rapid antigen testing, while results will no longer need to be uploaded to the WDA's website. Inbound migrant workers will also have more options in terms of self-health monitoring locations and the room regulations for that period will also be eased.In order to utilize Taiwan's ""one-stop service,"" new migrant domestic caregivers should still log into the MOL's Entry And Departure Of The Foreign Labor Airport Care Service website and provide relevant information five days before entry. New industrial migrant workers (including institutional caregivers) must log into the website to arrange to be picked up at the airport three days before entry. Returning migrant workers should also log into the site before arrival.The WDA said starting on March 15, arriving migrant workers can undergo the required seven days of self-health monitoring in places such as their employer's house, worker dormitories, or hotels. There should only be one person per room that ideally has a separate bathroom.However, the WDA explained that if the bathroom and toilet can be adequately cleaned and disinfected after each use, incoming migrant workers can stay in a private room that shares a bathroom with others.In addition, self-health monitoring sites are no longer required to be registered with the central government, nor do they need to be approved by country and city governments.In response to concerns about transportation to self-health monitoring facilities, the WDA said it will loosen the regulations on transporting industrial migrant workers (including institutional caregivers) and migrant workers returning to Taiwan. Beginning March 15, employers, brokers, and other designated personnel will be allowed to pick up migrant workers from the airport and take them to their self-health monitoring accommodations. In addition, newly recruited domestic caregivers will be picked up by designated vehicles and taken to the Migrant Worker One-Stop Service Center.Further details on eased COVID restrictions that go into effect March 15.

No Ukrainian response was immediately made to the claim. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refuted reports of plans to withdraw.After months of fighting in and around Bakhmut, Russian forces are set on capturing the city, which would be their first significant battlefield victory in some six months.Western strategists and officials suggest a Russian occupation of the city would be of more symbolic than strategic value.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, however, said on Tuesday that control of Bakhmut would allow Moscow's forces to mount further attacks deeper inside Ukraine.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, March 8:United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday, where negotiating an extension of the grain export deal between Russia and Ukraine is on the top of his agenda.Guterres arrived from Poland, where he visited on Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his visit.The Black Sea Grain Initiative was brokered by the UN and Turkey last summer to alleviate the impact of the war on global food security. It allows the export of millions of tons of grain and other foods out of Ukraine via three Black Sea ports.Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, the country was a major grain exporter.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the secretary-general will discuss upholding the deal ""in all its aspects and other pertinent issues.""The agreement, signed last July and extended once in November, is due to expire on March 18. Last week, Ukrainian officials urged both the UN and Ankara to seek a renewal.The Kremlin has rejected reports in US media regarding last year's Nord Stream pipeline attacks, saying it was confused as to how US officials could make assumptions about the attacks without investigation.""Obviously, the authors of the attack want to divert attention. Obviously, this is a coordinated stuffing in the media,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the state RIA news agency as saying.Peskov said Nord Stream shareholder countries should insist on an urgent, transparent investigation. He complained that Moscow had yet to gain permission to investigate.""Only a few days ago, we received notes about this from the Danes and Swedes,"" he said. ""This is not just strange, it smells like a monstrous crime.""New intelligence reviewed by US officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, The New York Times reported.There was no evidence that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or his top lieutenants in Ukraine were involved in the operation or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, the newspaper reported, citing US officials.Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Zelenskyy, said that Kyiv was ""absolutely not involved"" in last year's attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines and had no information about what happened.Russia's deputy UN envoy Dmitry Polyanskiy said that a report ""only proves that our initiative on launching an international investigation under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General is very timely.""Russia plans to call a vote in the UN Security Council by the end of March on its draft resolution asking Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish such an inquiry.The defense ministers of the European Union bloc are meeting in Stockholm on Wednesday to discuss a plan to pump €1 billion worth of ammunition to Ukraine.The critical ammunition shortage Kyiv is currently suffering will top Wednesday's agenda. European leaders are trying to restore the thousands of shells fired by Ukrainian forces daily to ward off Russia's offensive.With the eastern city of Bakhmut being the main battlefield at the moment, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has warned that Moscow would have an ""open road"" for offensives deeper into Ukraine should Russia capture the city.rmt/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/08,,

A company spokesperson indicated that sufficient time would be needed should a component need to be excluded from the network.The US had long warned Germany against Huawei's involvement in the country's mobile network.Several countries, including the US and Canada, have already excluded network technology from Huawei and ZTE from their markets.The US has asserted China could use Huawei's 5G technology for espionage.Huawei has rejected the accusations.rs, los/ar (Reuters, dpa)While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829608,"Activists rally, some governments seek change as world marks Women's Day","March 8 (Reuters) - Activists planned rallies and marches to celebrate International Women's Day on Wednesday while governments in several countries promised action to help improve the lot of half the world's population.
Canada repealed historic indecency and anti-abortion laws, Japan said more needed to be done to change attitudes about gender and Ireland announced a referendum in November to remove outmoded references to women in the constitution.
Marches and other events were planned in Paris, Beirut, Baghdad, Karachi, Istanbul and Singapore, among other cities.
International Women's Day has its roots in the U.S. socialist and labour movements of the early 20th century when many women were fighting for better working conditions and the right to vote.
More than a century later, women celebrate their achievements and draw attention to far-from-finished efforts to improve rights.
""We are women, and so many of our rights today are unfulfilled by the government and the country,"" labour activist Yuli Indriani told a rally of about 50 women gathered in heavy rain in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
She also criticised the private sector for shirking their responsibilities to women workers.
Italy's first woman prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, also focused on the role of women in the economy saying state-controlled companies should have at least one female leader.
But Italy's celebrations to mark the day risk being spoiled by a drought that has slashed production of yellow mimosa flowers, traditionally given on the occasion.
In Japan, which ranked 116 out of 146 countries on gender parity in a World Economic Forum global report last year, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference that progress had been made on improving working conditions for women but more had to be done.
""The situation for women, who are trying to balance household and workplace responsibilities, is quite difficult in our country and has been noted as an issue,"" he said. ""Measures to tackle this are still just halfway complete.""
In Russia, where International Women's Day is one of the most celebrated public holidays, the head of its upper house of parliament used the occasion to launch a vehement attack on sexual minorities and liberal values promoted by the West.
""Men and women are the biological, social and cultural backbones of communities,"" Valentina Matviyenko, considered Russia's most powerful woman, wrote in a blog on the Federation Council's web site.
""Therefore, there are no dangerous gender games in our country and never will be.

Wuhan, located on the middle reaches of the Yangtze river, registered temperatures of 26 Celsius on Monday, 12 degrees higher than the long-term early March average, while Beijing and surrounding cities also saw temperatures reach 22-25 Celsius earlier this week.
China experienced months of extreme heat last year, with 267 weather stations measuring record-breaking temperatures in excess of 40 degrees during a 70-day summer drought that hit the entire Yangtze river basin, triggering fires and damaging crops.
The country's weather bureau has already warned that it was facing another year of extreme weather in 2023 as a result of global climate change.
The southwestern province of Yunnan, a major hydropower base, is already in the middle of a prolonged drought forecast to last into April, with average rainfall more than 60% lower than usual since November last year.
The Poyang, China's biggest freshwater lake and a major flood outlet for the Yangtze, has also failed to recover from last year's drought, with water levels on Monday falling again below 7 metres, close to a record low, according to state media.
Chinese weather officials said at a routine monthly press briefing last week that average temperatures for the whole of February were 1.6 degrees Celsius higher than normal, with average rainfall also 3.9% lower than the average.
Changing weather patterns also meant that spring had come early in many regions south of the Yangtze river, in some cases as many as 20 days earlier than normal, said Gao Rong, vice director of the National Meteorological Centre.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829620,S. Korea's trade minister to raise concerns over Chips Act in US meetings,"SEOUL, March 8 (Reuters) - South Korea's trade minister will meet with counterparts in Washington this week to express concerns that the U.S. Chips Act could make the U.S. a less attractive investment destination, its trade ministry said.
During his trip, South Korea's trade minister Ahn Duk-geun plans to meet with senior officials from the U.S. Commerce Department and White House as well as officials from major think tanks to discuss the Chips Act.
The Biden administration last month said it would require companies winning $52.7 billion of available funds from the Chips Act to share excess profits and explain how they plan to provide affordable childcare.
The Chips Act plays a central role in the Biden administration's effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing home, and its success is vital to U.S. ambitions to keep ahead of China in global markets.
While the incentives are crucial for chipmakers's investment decisions, some of the conditions for receiving the subsidies are putting South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) in a difficult position as they decide whether to apply for funding, South Korean government officials said.
""The South Korean government will make it clear that the conditions of the Chips Act could deepen business uncertainties, violate companies' management and technology rights as well as make the United States less attractive as an investment option,"" South Korea's trade ministry said.
Under the Chips Act, companies that accept the incentives are required to share with the U.S. government a portion of their profits that exceed initial projections by an agreed-upon threshold.
Companies winning chips subsidies would be barred from engaging in joint research and technology licensing efforts or expanding semiconductor manufacturing capacity in foreign countries of concern like China for 10 years. Both Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix operate chip factories in China.
Chipmakers are also concerned about requirements to turn over information about profit projections and operations, because they are considered trade secrets, analysts said.SEOUL, March 8 (Reuters) - South Korea's trade minister will meet with counterparts in Washington this week to express concerns that the U.S. Chips Act could make the U.S. a less attractive investment destination, its trade ministry said.During his trip, South Korea's trade minister Ahn Duk-geun plans to meet with senior officials from the U.S. Commerce Department and White House as well as officials from major think tanks to discuss the Chips Act.The Biden administration last month said it would require companies winning $52.7 billion of available funds from the Chips Act to share excess profits and explain how they plan to provide affordable childcare.The Chips Act plays a central role in the Biden administration's effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing home, and its success is vital to U.S. ambitions to keep ahead of China in global markets.While the incentives are crucial for chipmakers's investment decisions, some of the conditions for receiving the subsidies are putting South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) in a difficult position as they decide whether to apply for funding, South Korean government officials said.""The South Korean government will make it clear that the conditions of the Chips Act could deepen business uncertainties, violate companies' management and technology rights as well as make the United States less attractive as an investment option,"" South Korea's trade ministry said.Under the Chips Act, companies that accept the incentives are required to share with the U.S. government a portion of their profits that exceed initial projections by an agreed-upon threshold.Companies winning chips subsidies would be barred from engaging in joint research and technology licensing efforts or expanding semiconductor manufacturing capacity in foreign countries of concern like China for 10 years.
