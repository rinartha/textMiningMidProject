https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820718,Taipei-based Bluerider Art encourages visitors to trust their instincts,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei-based gallery Bluerider Art has launched an exhibition featuring 50 international artists, which is open to the public for free until April 16.

            In 2013, the gallery opened its first store in the capital’s Da'an District. The name of the gallery comes from the ""blue rider” art movement founded by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky in the early 1910s.

            The gallery has opened three stores in Taipei and Shanghai over the past decade. Its fourth location is set to open in London this year (2023), founder Elsa Wang (王薇薇) announced at a press event earlier this month.

            The ongoing retrospective show titled ""Wild Grass"" takes place in Taiwan and China simultaneously. It features 50 international artists’ works, such as minimalist paintings by German artist Adrian Wald, Los Angeles-based Jonathon Paul's life-size lollipop sculptures, and Dylan Martinez's glass water bags.

            A former tech businesswoman, Wang is proud to have represented and worked with most of these artists for a decade or more. She shared that she has a tendency to work with artists who are over 50 years old.

            The reasons are simple. She explained that people at that age are more mature and the price of their art is more stable. “Art has become a part of their life, or we can see that they create works with their lives.”

            In the exhibition, unlike other galleries, Wang and her team display artworks without showing the artists’ names or other information. “Do not let an artist’s gender or nationality get in your way. Try to only focus on art and trust your instincts,” said Wang.

            According to the gallery’s publicist, Vivian Chiu (邱于珊), Marck, Pascal Dombis, and Thierry Feuz, top the price charts. Their per artwork sold from NT$500,000 (US$16,364) to $700,000 at Art Taipei 2022.

            “Wild Grass” was inspired by Lu Xun’s (魯迅) poem, which reflects Wang’s ambition for her business to grow fearlessly like wild grass. The upcoming London site is slated to open in Mayfair around the end of 2023.

Whether it is startups or large companies, it is imperative to identify future challenges in the verticals. And to keep up with these changing Artificial Knee Joint Components market conditions, you need to have game-changing industry data.An artificial knee joint typically consists of three main components:1. Femoral Component: This is the metal component that replaces the end of the thigh bone (femur) that connects to the knee joint. The femoral component is usually made of a combination of metals such as cobalt-chromium and titanium, and it has a shape that mimics the natural shape of the femoral bone.2. Tibial Component: This is the metal and plastic component that replaces the top of the shin bone (tibia) that connects to the knee joint. The tibial component typically consists of a metal tray that is attached to the bone and a plastic insert that fits into the tray. The plastic insert is designed to provide a smooth gliding surface for the femoral component. The tibial component is usually made of a combination of metals such as titanium and cobalt-chromium and high-density polyethylene plastic.3. Patellar Component: This is the plastic component that replaces the surface of the kneecap (patella) that rubs against the femoral component. The patellar component is usually made of high-density polyethylene plastic and has a shape that mimics the natural shape of the patella.In addition to these three main components, some knee replacements may also include other components such as a metal rod that connects the femoral and tibial components or a spacer that is inserted between the femoral and tibial components to help reduce wear and tear.For more information, request a sample report below: https://market.biz/report/global-artificial-knee-joint-components-market-gm/#requestforsample*Note: For higher priority, please use the company email IDMarket.biz offers the latest published report on ‘Global Artificial Knee Joint Components Market Research Report 2023’ which offers key insights and competitive advantage to clients through a detailed report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820755,"Malaysia helps poor, raises taxes for rich in 2023 budget","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia will raise development spending and plans new taxes for the wealthy in a smaller budget plan this year, as the new government seeks to balance between spurring economic growth and reining in the budget deficit. 

            Three months after his election victory, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim unveiled a 386.1 billion ringgit ($87 billion) national budget in Parliament on Friday that focuses on helping people grappling with the rising cost of living amid an economic slowdown.

            Fuel and other subsidies, along with cash aid for the poor, farmers and industries are being retained, and new incentives will aim to tackle youth unemployment and bolster foreign investment. Anwar said the income tax system will also be rejigged to lower taxes for some 2.4 million middle-income earners but raise taxes for those in the high-income group.











            Anwar, who is also finance minister, said the government plans to introduce a luxury goods tax this year and is considering a capital gains tax. The budget also proposed 97 billion ringgit ($21.9 billion) in development spending, up from 71.6 billion ($16.1 billion) last year. 

            But Anwar said the country faced key challenges including a high national debt, global economic slowdown and slow recovery in foreign investment.

            He said Malaysia's economy is forecast to expand at 4.5%, down sharply from 8.7% last year. He said the country needs to improve its public finances, as national debt and liabilities had surged to over 1.5 trillion ringgit ($338 billion), or 80% of gross domestic product. 

            While spending by previous governments rose to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, Anwar said billions of dollars were also lost due to corruption and leakage. He said projects awarded by the previous government without public tenders have been canceled and that new tenders will be called to ensure transparency. His government is aiming to narrow the budget deficit to 5% of GDP this year, from 5.6% last year.

            “A major shift is needed ... a shift to fight corruption that has denied our people opportunities to enjoy a more meaningful life, to good governance in our spending and to socio-economic empowerment,” he said. “We may have different political views, but don't let our differences prevent us from making real changes.""

            Anwar's alliance formed a unity government with other smaller parties after November's election led to a hung Parliament. He faces another test with elections due in six states in the next few months that would determine the strength of his government against a strong Islamic-dominated opposition.KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia will raise development spending and plans new taxes for the wealthy in a smaller budget plan this year, as the new government seeks to balance between spurring economic growth and reining in the budget deficit.Three months after his election victory, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim unveiled a 386.1 billion ringgit ($87 billion) national budget in Parliament on Friday that focuses on helping people grappling with the rising cost of living amid an economic slowdown.Fuel and other subsidies, along with cash aid for the poor, farmers and industries are being retained, and new incentives will aim to tackle youth unemployment and bolster foreign investment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820756,Man United drawn with Real Betis in last 16 of Europa League,"NYON, Switzerland (AP) — Manchester United was paired with Real Betis in the round of 16 of the Europa League on Friday, giving the 2017 champions another Spanish opponent after eliminating Barcelona.

            United will host the fifth-place Spanish team on March 9 in the first leg at Old Trafford, where Barcelona was beaten 2-1 on Thursday to complete a 4-3 aggregate victory.

            “It is a playing team, a skillful team,"" Man United manager Erik ten Hag said of Betis, who his team played in a friendly during the mid-season break for the World Cup. “You know what you get from Spanish football. We also played Real Sociedad this season and so we know (that) only when you play your best, you have a chance to survive.”











            The last Ukrainian team left in this season’s European competitions, Shakhtar Donetsk, was drawn to face Dutch league leader Feyenoord. Shakhtar will have three defenders suspended for the first leg it will host in neighboring Poland because of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine.

            Premier League leader Arsenal will face Sporting Lisbon, with the first leg played in Portugal.

            Arsenal was seeded in the draw because it was among the eight winners of Europa League groups, and those teams play the second leg at home. Unseeded teams hosting the first leg came through the playoff round, which involved Europa League group runners-up and teams which placed third in a Champions League group.

            Juventus was paired with Freiburg and six-time champion Sevilla will be at home first against Fenerbahce. Union Berlin will have a reunion with Union Saint-Gilloise after they also met twice in the group stage.

            Roma, coached by José Mourinho, will play Real Sociedad, while Bayer Leverkusen was paired with Ferencvaros.

            Ferencvaros will host the second leg at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, the stadium that will also stage the Europa League final on May 31.

            In the round of 16 of the third-tier Europa Conference League, Villarreal — a Champions League semifinalist last season — was paired with Anderlecht while Fiorentina will host the first leg against Sivasspor.

            In other matches, West Ham travels to Cyprus for the first leg against AEK Larnaca, Sheriff will host Nice in Moldova, and Lazio is at home first against AZ Alkmaar, potentially on March 7 to avoid a clash at Stadio Olimpico with Roma's game in the Europa League.

            Also, it was: Lech Poznan vs. Djurgarden; Basel vs. Slovan Bratislava; and Gent vs. Istanbul Basaksehir.

            The Europa Conference League final is scheduled for June 7 in Prague.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820757,'People's court' endorses Putin indictment for aggression,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A “people’s court” without legal powers has confirmed an indictment against Russian President Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression in Ukraine and called for his arrest.

            The symbolic decision Friday came on the anniversary of Russia’s illegal invasion of its neighbor that triggered Europe's biggest and deadliest conflict since World War II.

            After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible.”











            The judges, including Stephen Rapp, a U.S. prosecutor who once headed the successful effort to bring former Liberian President Charles Taylor to justice for crimes in Sierra Leone, heard testimony from survivors of Russian attacks in Ukraine and from military experts before issuing their order.

            The ruling comes amid international efforts to establish a tribunal that could prosecute Putin and other Russian leaders for the crime of aggression. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation in Ukraine, but doesn't have jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of aggression.

            The presiding judge at the court, South African Zak Jacoob, said that he hoped the hearings would add to the pressure for a special court.

            ""Hopefully this is a step to prosecution. As I said, we have no legal authority or force, but hopefully we have the authority of moral force and moral persuasion, which would take us somewhere,” he told reporters.

            The people’s court found that evidence presented was strong enough to indict Putin, saying that as head of state he “planned, prepared, initiated and executed — and continues to plan and execute — the Russian Federation’s acts of aggression in Ukraine.""

            Jacoob, called Putin’s justifications for the war “pathetic.” An invitation for Putin or his legal representatives to take part in the hearings went unanswered, prosecutors said.

            “It is an insult to the international community and to the integrity of the world to make the sort of claims that he has made. And I reject them in no uncertain terms,” Jacoob said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820758,Jordan Pickford signs contract extension to stay at Everton,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford signed a contract extension Friday to stay with the Premier League club through June 2027.

            The 28-year-old Pickford joined Everton from Sunderland in the summer of 2017 and has since developed into England's top-choice goalkeeper.

            The 4 1/2-year deal would take Pickford to a decade at the club, but the short-term goal is to push further away from the relegation zone.











            Under new manager Sean Dyche, Everton has won two of its last three games to get out of the drop zone. Aston Villa visits Goodison Park on Saturday.

            “The past few seasons have not been what we wanted but we now have a manager who I believe will point us in the right direction and get us up the table,” Pickford told club media. “It’s definitely my aim to be successful at this club.”

            Pickford has made 50 appearances for England including at two World Cups. He backstopped England's run to the final of the European Championship in 2021.

            Everton director of football Kevin Thelwell called Pickford “one of the best goalkeepers in world football.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820759,"Mercedes, McLaren admit difficulties on Day 2 of F1 testing","SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP) — Max Verstappen is displaying his speed in Formula One testing while Mercedes and McLaren struggle.

            The defending champion wasn't quite the fastest Friday in his Red Bull on the second day of preseason testing — that was Alfa Romeo driver Zhou Guanyu — but the Dutchman was only .04 seconds behind and looked consistent on longer runs simulating a race distance.

            Fernando Alonso was third-fastest to continue an impressive start at Aston Martin, while Carlos Sainz Jr. was sixth and Charles Leclerc was eighth for Ferrari.











            Verstappen took over from teammate Sergio Perez for the Friday afternoon session and racked up 47 more laps to go with the 157 he completed while setting the pace Thursday. Those were the Dutch driver's last testing laps before next week and practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix at the same venue. Perez will be in the car for Saturday's runs.

            A hydraulic failure left George Russell stranded on the track to end an already disappointing day for Mercedes, which struggled to find the right setup and finished the day with Russell 13th-fastest and Hamilton 15th of 17 drivers.

            Russell said earlier in the day that he doubts the team is capable of fighting for the win in next week's opening race. He managed 26 laps Friday before the car lost power and he had to park.

            “We definitely believe eventually we will have a car capable of getting into that fight,” Russell said. “Whether we’re going to have that next weekend in Bahrain I think may be a bit of a stretch.""

            Times set in testing offer only a rough guide to a teams' true speed for the season with the cars often set up in very different ways, sometimes with heavy fuel loads to imitate a full race distance. Title contenders may try to hide their actual pace from rivals, while smaller teams may chase publicity by aiming for fast times over a single lap.

            Even so, McLaren could be facing a difficult start to the season with Lando Norris and rookie teammate Oscar Piastri.

            “We, like everyone, have a lot of development coming, so we are encouraged at what we see around the corner, but I think we will be going into the the first race off of our projected targets,"" McLaren CEO Zak Brown said. ""Hard to really know where that means we’ll all be on the grid.”

            American driver Logan Sargeant had a solid day with 154 laps and the seventh-fastest time as he prepares to make his debut with Williams next week.

            With Lance Stroll still sidelined with a wrist injury from a bicycle accident, Aston Martin will again use Formula Two champion Felipe Drugovich in the third day of testing Saturday. The team hasn't given a timeline for Stroll to return ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

            More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSAKHIR, Bahrain (AP) — Max Verstappen is displaying his speed in Formula One testing while Mercedes and McLaren struggle.The defending champion wasn't quite the fastest Friday in his Red Bull on the second day of preseason testing — that was Alfa Romeo driver Zhou Guanyu — but the Dutchman was only .04 seconds behind and looked consistent on longer runs simulating a race distance.Fernando Alonso was third-fastest to continue an impressive start at Aston Martin, while Carlos Sainz Jr. was sixth and Charles Leclerc was eighth for Ferrari.Verstappen took over from teammate Sergio Perez for the Friday afternoon session and racked up 47 more laps to go with the 157 he completed while setting the pace Thursday. Those were the Dutch driver's last testing laps before next week and practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix at the same venue. Perez will be in the car for Saturday's runs.A hydraulic failure left George Russell stranded on the track to end an already disappointing day for Mercedes, which struggled to find the right setup and finished the day with Russell 13th-fastest and Hamilton 15th of 17 drivers.Russell said earlier in the day that he doubts the team is capable of fighting for the win in next week's opening race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820763,France recall Haouas and Scotland summon Watson in 6 Nations,"PARIS (AP) — Only prop Mohamed Haouas was brought into the France XV to face Scotland at home on Sunday in the Six Nations after the end of its 14-match winning streak.

            Tighthead Uini Atonio was suspended for three weeks following a high tackle on Ireland hooker Rob Herring during France's 32-19 defeat in Dublin two weeks ago.

            Haouas hasn't played for France in a year. He was the starting tighthead in 2020 and 2021 but suffered from indiscipline. Meanwhile, he helped Montpellier win the French Top 14 last season.











            “There was no reason to change the team, other than the suspension of Atonio,” France coach Galthié said on Friday. “(Haouas) already played for us on several occasions. It allows us to maintain a degree of collective experience.”

            France was ragged at times against Ireland, confused at how to develop the possession-based game that Galthié wants. It was too slow in defensive rucks and carelessly gave away penalties. But Galthié felt some of the criticism of his side following the Ireland loss was harsh.

            “Up until the 71st minute we were within six points of them and in a position to win the game,” he said. “We reached our limits but so did Ireland. We weren't able to take some of our chances when we were on top because the Irish stood up to us well.""

            Scrumhalf Baptiste Couilloud and flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert were the only backs on the bench, with Galthié again preferring six forwards.

            Scotland has won its opening two games for the first time since 1996, edging England 29-23 at Twickenham and routing Wales 35-7 at Murrayfield. It is second in the standings to Ireland only on points difference.

            Galthié regards the Scots as genuine title contenders.

            “They are capable, like the Irish, like us and the English, of winning the tournament,” Galthié said.

            Hamish Watson replaced Luke Crosbie at openside flanker as Scotland coach Gregor Townsend also made only one change.

            Watson has been a regular but missed the opening two rounds because he was short of playing time after concussion issues.

            Inspirational fullback Stuart Hogg was forced off early with a head injury against Wales but will start at Stade de France.

            Glasgow scrumhalf Ali Price and Edinburgh lock Sam Skinner made the matchday squad for the first time in this tournament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820765,6 Nations: Watson replaces Crosbie in Scotland team v France,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Hamish Watson replaced Luke Crosbie in Scotland’s only change to its starting lineup for the Six Nations match against defending champion France on Sunday.

            Watson has been a regular starter for Scotland but sat out the opening two matches against Wales and England. He had been short of playing time because of concussion issues.

            Scotland will play in Paris after opening with back-to-back wins for the first time in the Six Nations era. France also made one change for the game against Scotland.











            Scotland coach Gregor Townsend kept faith Friday with the majority of the team that began the 35-7 victory over Wales at Murrayfield, but Crosbie has dropped out of the 23-man squad altogether.

            Stuart Hogg was forced off early with a head injury against Wales but returned to training and retains the No. 15 jersey, with Blair Kinghorn again listed among the substitutes.

            Glasgow scrum-half Ali Price and Edinburgh lock Sam Skinner, who have not been in the matchday 23 for either Six Nations match, are among the replacements.

            Price has been restored to the squad at the expense of fellow Glasgow scrum-half George Horne, who drops out.

            ___

            Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Kyle Steyn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Duhan van der Merwe, Finn Russell, Ben White; Pierre Schoeman, George Turner, Zander Fagerson, Richie Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Jamie Ritchie (captain), Hamish Watson, Matt Fagerson. Reserves: Fraser Brown, Jamie Bhatti, WP Nel, Jonny Gray, Sam Skinner, Jack Dempsey, Ali Price, Blair Kinghorn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820767,South Africa: Fallout over power utility CEO's graft claims,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa’s troubled state-owned power utility Eskom appointed an interim chief executive Friday after a fallout with its outgoing head over a media interview he gave.

            Andre de Ruyter alleged ongoing corruption at the company linked to the ruling party, and said there was a lack of will from government to stop the graft and solve the country's electricity crisis.

            Africa's most developed economy is experiencing its worst rolling power blackouts in 30 years due to frequent breakdowns at Eskom's aging coal-fired power stations. Those problems are largely blamed on years of corruption and mismanagement at the utility under the ruling African National Congress party.











            De Ruyter resigned last year and was scheduled to leave at the end of March. But he was removed from his position immediately after the interview with a private TV station aired on Tuesday night in which he accused the ANC and unnamed government ministers of covering up corruption at Eskom and only being interested in their re-election hopes in 2024.

            “They want what will win them the next election, not what will keep the country going for the next two decades,” de Ruyter said of the ANC.

            De Ruyter said Eskom, which is deep in debt, was losing $50 million a month to corruption. When asked by his interviewer if Eskom is a “feeding trough” for the ANC, de Ruyter replied: “I would say the evidence suggests that it is.”

            The interview led to him being asked to leave immediately and his notice period scrapped. The board appointed its current chief financial officer, Caleb Cassim, to act in the position until a permanent CEO is appointed.

            Allegations of corruption and mismanagement have dogged Eskom for years and were recently laid bare during a judicial commission of inquiry, which implicated senior ANC ministers and former President Jacob Zuma.

            De Ruyter’s allegations come as South Africa's 60 million people have electricity switched off at their homes and businesses for up to eight hours a day in rolling blackouts. There are warnings the power cuts could be increased to 12 hours a day. Eskom has historically supplied more than 80% of the country's electricity.

            Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster to deal with the energy crisis, describing it as an existential threat to the country’s slumping economy. 

            The measure allows the government to cut red tape in procuring additional electricity capacity on an emergency basis and exempt certain essential services like hospitals from power cuts,. Ramaphosa also announced that he would appoint a minister of electricity. 

            In his budget speech this week, the country’s finance minister announced the government would guarantee about $13 billion of Eskom’s total debt of $23 billion.

            The Democratic Alliance, the largest opposition party, described de Ruyter as a “national hero” for speaking out about corruption at Eskom, which has lost billions to graft over the years.

            ANC Secretary General Fikile Mbalula criticized de Ruyter and challenged him to produce proof of his corruption allegations against the party and report it to law enforcement authorities.

            De Ruyter claimed last year that he had survived an attempt on his life when someone slipped cyanide into his coffee a day after he had submitted his resignation as Eskom CEO. He has said that Eskom has become a target for organized crime syndicates as well as corrupt politicians because of the massive amounts of money it receives from government and other sources.JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa’s troubled state-owned power utility Eskom appointed an interim chief executive Friday after a fallout with its outgoing head over a media interview he gave.Andre de Ruyter alleged ongoing corruption at the company linked to the ruling party, and said there was a lack of will from government to stop the graft and solve the country's electricity crisis.Africa's most developed economy is experiencing its worst rolling power blackouts in 30 years due to frequent breakdowns at Eskom's aging coal-fired power stations.

But he was removed from his position immediately after the interview with a private TV station aired on Tuesday night in which he accused the ANC and unnamed government ministers of covering up corruption at Eskom and only being interested in their re-election hopes in 2024.“They want what will win them the next election, not what will keep the country going for the next two decades,” de Ruyter said of the ANC.De Ruyter said Eskom, which is deep in debt, was losing $50 million a month to corruption. When asked by his interviewer if Eskom is a “feeding trough” for the ANC, de Ruyter replied: “I would say the evidence suggests that it is.”The interview led to him being asked to leave immediately and his notice period scrapped. The board appointed its current chief financial officer, Caleb Cassim, to act in the position until a permanent CEO is appointed.Allegations of corruption and mismanagement have dogged Eskom for years and were recently laid bare during a judicial commission of inquiry, which implicated senior ANC ministers and former President Jacob Zuma.De Ruyter’s allegations come as South Africa's 60 million people have electricity switched off at their homes and businesses for up to eight hours a day in rolling blackouts. There are warnings the power cuts could be increased to 12 hours a day. Eskom has historically supplied more than 80% of the country's electricity.Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster to deal with the energy crisis, describing it as an existential threat to the country’s slumping economy.The measure allows the government to cut red tape in procuring additional electricity capacity on an emergency basis and exempt certain essential services like hospitals from power cuts,. Ramaphosa also announced that he would appoint a minister of electricity.In his budget speech this week, the country’s finance minister announced the government would guarantee about $13 billion of Eskom’s total debt of $23 billion.The Democratic Alliance, the largest opposition party, described de Ruyter as a “national hero” for speaking out about corruption at Eskom, which has lost billions to graft over the years.ANC Secretary General Fikile Mbalula criticized de Ruyter and challenged him to produce proof of his corruption allegations against the party and report it to law enforcement authorities.De Ruyter claimed last year that he had survived an attempt on his life when someone slipped cyanide into his coffee a day after he had submitted his resignation as Eskom CEO. He has said that Eskom has become a target for organized crime syndicates as well as corrupt politicians because of the massive amounts of money it receives from government and other sources.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820768,People across the world gather to mark war anniversary,"LISBON, Portugal (AP) — World landmarks were lit up in the colors of Ukraine’s national flag as people across the globe threw their support behind the country Friday on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.

            The Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower and Sydney Opera House gleamed in yellow and blue in solemn remembrance of the outbreak of the war on Feb. 24, 2022.

            The conflict has affected economies worldwide, bringing shortages of energy, grain and fertilizer, and the date drew people to peace rallies and other events in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, as well as Europe.











            Among the memorials, stunts and ceremonies, a wrecked Russian tank was put on display in Berlin, a bloody cake with a skull on top of it was left in a Belgrade street, Ukraine’s flag was held aloft amid tears in the sizzling Bangkok sun, and Japanese monks prayed for the dead.

            A rusting T-72 tank was placed outside the prominent Russian Embassy building on the German capital’s Unter den Linden boulevard.

            The tank was struck in the Kyiv region in the early stages of the war. It was taken to Berlin by a private group, which said that the Ukrainian defense ministry’s Military History Museum had loaned it. Destroyed Russian armor litters parts of Ukraine after months of battlefield setbacks for the Kremlin’s forces.

            “The whole world should see that there are many people in Germany who stand behind Ukraine, so that’s why we’re putting the Russians’ scrap tank in front of their door,” said Wieland Giebel of the Berlin Story group, who was one of the exhibit’s organizers.

            In Serbia, whose government has maintained friendly relations with Russia and has refused to join Western sanctions designed to punish Moscow for its invasion, police moved in to stop a group of anti-war activists from reaching the Russian Embassy in the capital, Belgrade.

            The activists wanted to hand over a demand for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be put on trial for genocide in Ukraine. They left a cake, covered with red icing representing blood and with a skull on top of it, on the pavement near the embassy.

            U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stepped outside his office at No. 10 Downing Street, joining Ukraine’s ambassador and some Ukrainian soldiers being trained in the United Kingdom for a minute’s silence in commemoration of those killed in the fighting.

            King Charles III published a message lauding the “remarkable courage and resilience” of the Ukrainian people.

            A teenage Ukrainian pianist forced to flee her country with her mother when the war broke out gave a solo performance at a shopping mall in the city of Liverpool in northwest England.

            Alisa Bushuieva, 13, wore a traditional Ukrainian floral headband and dress as she played her country’s national anthem.

            At a convention center in Utrecht, Netherlands, about 2,000 Ukrainian refugees gathered to hear by video link a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and in Brussels hundreds waved the Ukrainian flag and chanted “Slava Ukraini!” (Glory to Ukraine).

            In northern Europe, people placed candles on the steps of Helsinki Cathedral at a memorial event for Ukraine war victims, and in southern Europe peace quotations printed on jute bags were displayed in Rome as part of an installation by Italian artist Gianfranco Meggiato entitled “The Meeting: The Symbol of Peace.”

            In Poland, thousands of Poles, Ukrainians and Belarusians gathered before Russia’s embassy in Warsaw to protest. They held national flags and signs with the name of Ukrainians killed in the war written on them.

            Marchers in Bulgaria’s capital of Sofia waved Ukrainian flags and carried banners that read: “Ukraine will win” and “No to Russian terror."" They were joined by some of the 50,000 Ukrainian refugees that found shelter in Bulgaria over the past year.

            Moscow planned no special events for Friday, as most Russians took a nationwide day off amid an extended public holiday. As part of authorities’ relentless effort to prevent any sign of dissent, police in some areas visited activists’ homes to warn them against trying to stage any demonstrations.

            Ukrainians living in Brazil protested outside the Russian Consulate in Sao Paulo, with one sign comparing Putin to Adolf Hitler.

            Ukrainians in Lebanon chanted slogans during a Beirut rally and held up signs saying, “Stand strong with Ukraine” and “No terrorism.” Ukrainians and their supporters also marked the anniversary in Tel Aviv.

            In Georgia, thousands of people marched through the streets of Tbilisi, the country's capital, chanting “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!”

            “I think that Georgians should support Ukraine, because Ukraine is fighting for us, too. Ukraine’s victory means our victory,"" said Tsira Zhvania, a student who joined the rally in Tbilisi on Friday. “Unlike the Georgian government, Georgian people should stand with the people of Ukraine.”

            Dozens of South Koreans and Ukrainian expatriates gathered outside the Russian Embassy in Seoul. They held candles and banners demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.

            About 1,000 people protested in Tokyo’s Hibiya Park, holding banners that said: “Russia, stop invading Ukraine.” Outside the city’s United Nations’ University, demonstrators held a candlelight vigil, and at Zenkoji temple in Nagano in central Japan, about 30 monks prayed for the lives lost in the war.

            People also placed flowers outside the Ukrainian consulate in Bali, Indonesia, in tribute to those killed in the war.

            Ukrainians living in Thailand gathered outside their embassy in Bangkok. About 50 people, many wearing their national colors, sang the national anthem as an embassy official raised the flag. Several wept during a speech by the embassy’s charge d’affaires, in which he urged them to stay strong.

            Iliana Martsenyak, originally from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which has been pummeled by Russian barrages, wiped tears from her eyes as she spoke of how the anniversary made her feel.

            “Honestly, I cannot find any words to describe how me and every single Ukrainian feels today because of this absolutely irrational, cruel and awful war that has been brought to our land,” she said.

            The group marched to a nearby city park, holding Ukrainian flags and protest signs aloft. They stopped at the library of Lumpini park, largely in silence as a mother embraced her young daughter and others stared resolutely into the distance.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820786,"Japan, other G-7 leaders step up Russia sanctions","TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other Group of Seven leaders adopted a set of additional sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine at an online G-7 summit Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the invasion.

            The leaders renewed their commitment to “intensifying our diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort,” and countering the negative impact on the rest of the world, especially the most vulnerable people, they said in a statement, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. 

            The G-7 countries also affirmed their coordinated action to “further counter Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression"" and pledged to prevent Russia from obtaining military equipment and technology. They also called on other countries to stop providing military support to Russia. 











            Kishida, as this year’s G-7 president, also announced Japan will impose additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing the assets of some 120 individuals and organizations and banning the export of drones and other materials that can be used for military purposes. 

            “In order to absolutely not allow one-sided changes to the status quo, we must firmly carry out support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia to regain peace and international order based on the rule of law,"" Kishida told a news conference before hosting a teleconference with other G-7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            “G-7 serves the core of the international commitment to do so,"" he said. 

            At the summit, Kishida planned to discuss the latest developments in the Russian war on Ukraine and how to support Ukraine's recovery and affirm G-7 solidarity for the war-torn country.

            Kishida noted growing concern about China's potential transfer of lethal weapons to Russia, and said that Japan will cooperate with G-7 and other countries to send a “clear message” to third countries to stop supplying weapons to Russia.

            Kishida also expressed “strong concern” about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement Tuesday that he was suspending Moscow's participation in an arms control treaty between Russia and the United States.

            “Russia's nuclear threat is unacceptable, and use of nuclear weapons should never happen,” Kishida, whose electoral constituency is Hiroshima, said at the news conference. “As the world's only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, the 77-year history of non-nuclear weapons use should not be tarnished by Russia.”

            As the world observed the one-year anniversary of Russia's war on Ukraine, about 1,000 people protested Friday night in Tokyo's Hibiya Park, holding banners saying: “Russia, stop invading Ukraine."" Outside of the United Nations' University in Tokyo, demonstrators held a candlelight vigil. And at Zenkoji temple in Nagano in central Japan, about 30 monks prayed for the lives lost in the war.

            Top diplomats from Ukraine, the United States, Britain, Sweden, the EU, Lithuania and Sweden at a joint news conference in Tokyo called for solidarity for Ukraine and condemned Russia. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said Putin is wrong to accuse NATO of expanding eastward. He said the newest NATO members expanded west by their free will because the West has “a pull” of freedom, liberty and respect for individuals.

            Also Friday, nuclear and security experts on a panel at the non-profit Sasakawa Peace Foundation released recommendations for the Kishida government to initiate discussions at the G-7 Hiroshima summit toward establishing a framework to protect nuclear facilities in conflict areas, in response to Russia's repeated attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

            Due to its pacifist principles, Japan's support for Ukraine has been limited to non-combative military equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests and drones, and humanitarian supplies including generators.

            Kishida is the only G-7 leader who has not visited Ukraine. Pressure is mounting at home for Kishida to visit Kyiv before he hosts the G-7 summit in Hiroshima. Asked about a possible visit, Kishida said he is “considering” a visit, taking into consideration ways to ensure safety and secrecy, but nothing official has been decided.

            Japan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine. Japan was quick to react because it fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. 

            Kishida at the online G-7 also explained Japan’s support for Ukraine. That includes a new $5.5 billion in financial aid, which Kishida unveiled Monday, bringing total Japanese support for Ukraine to more than $7 billion.

            Japan has also accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance and support for jobs and education — a rare move for a country that is known for its strict immigration policy.TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other Group of Seven leaders adopted a set of additional sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine at an online G-7 summit Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the invasion.The leaders renewed their commitment to “intensifying our diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort,” and countering the negative impact on the rest of the world, especially the most vulnerable people, they said in a statement, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.The G-7 countries also affirmed their coordinated action to “further counter Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression"" and pledged to prevent Russia from obtaining military equipment and technology. They also called on other countries to stop providing military support to Russia.Kishida, as this year’s G-7 president, also announced Japan will impose additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing the assets of some 120 individuals and organizations and banning the export of drones and other materials that can be used for military purposes.“In order to absolutely not allow one-sided changes to the status quo, we must firmly carry out support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia to regain peace and international order based on the rule of law,"" Kishida told a news conference before hosting a teleconference with other G-7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“G-7 serves the core of the international commitment to do so,"" he said.At the summit, Kishida planned to discuss the latest developments in the Russian war on Ukraine and how to support Ukraine's recovery and affirm G-7 solidarity for the war-torn country.Kishida noted growing concern about China's potential transfer of lethal weapons to Russia, and said that Japan will cooperate with G-7 and other countries to send a “clear message” to third countries to stop supplying weapons to Russia.Kishida also expressed “strong concern” about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement Tuesday that he was suspending Moscow's participation in an arms control treaty between Russia and the United States.“Russia's nuclear threat is unacceptable, and use of nuclear weapons should never happen,” Kishida, whose electoral constituency is Hiroshima, said at the news conference. “As the world's only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, the 77-year history of non-nuclear weapons use should not be tarnished by Russia.”As the world observed the one-year anniversary of Russia's war on Ukraine, about 1,000 people protested Friday night in Tokyo's Hibiya Park, holding banners saying: “Russia, stop invading Ukraine.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820787,Penguin to publish 'classic' Roald Dahl books after backlash,"LONDON (AP) — Publisher Penguin Random House announced Friday it will publish “classic” unexpurgated versions of Roald Dahl’s children’s novels after it received criticism for cuts and rewrites that were intended to make the books suitable for modern readers.

            Along with the new editions, the company said 17 of Dahl’s books would be published in their original form later this year as “The Roald Dahl Classic Collection” so “readers will be free to choose which version of Dahl’s stories they prefer.”

            The move comes after criticism of scores of changes made to “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and other much-loved classics for recent editions published under the company’s Puffin children’s label, in which passages relating to weight, mental health, gender and race were altered.











            Augustus Gloop, Charlie’s gluttonous antagonist in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” — originally published in 1964 — became “enormous” rather than “enormously fat.” In “Witches,” an “old hag” became an “old crow,” and a supernatural female posing as an ordinary woman may be a “top scientist or running a business” instead of a “cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman.” 

            In “Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" the word “black” was removed from a description of the “murderous, brutal-looking” tractors.

            The Roald Dahl Story Company, which controls the rights to the books, said it had worked with Puffin to review and revise the texts because it wanted to ensure that “Dahl’s wonderful stories and characters continue to be enjoyed by all children today.” 

            While tweaking old books for modern sensibilities is not a new phenomenon in publishing, the scale of the edits drew strong criticism from free-speech groups such as writers’ organization PEN America, and from authors including Salman Rushdie.

            Rushdie, who lived under threat of death from Iran's Islamic regime for years because of the alleged blasphemy of his novel “The Satanic Verses,” called the revisions “absurd censorship.”

            Rushdie, who was attacked and seriously injured last year at an event in New York state, tweeted news of Penguin's change of heart on Friday with the words “Penguin Books back down after Roald Dahl backlash!”

            PEN America chief executive Suzanne Nossel wrote on Twitter: ""I applaud Penguin for hearing out critics, taking the time to rethink this, and coming to the right place.”

            Camilla, Britain's queen consort, appeared to offer her view at a literary reception on Thursday. She urged writers to “remain true to your calling, unimpeded by those who may wish to curb the freedom of your expression or impose limits on your imagination.”

            Dahl’s books, with their mischievous children, strange beasts and often beastly adults, have sold more than 300 million copies and continue to be read by children around the world. Their multiple stage and screen adaptations include “Matilda the Musical” and two “Willy Wonka” films based on “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” with a third in the works.

            But Dahl, who died in 1990, is also a controversial figure because of antisemitic comments made throughout his life. His family apologized in 2020.

            In 2021, Dahl's estate sold the rights to the books to Netflix, which plans to produce a new generation of films based on the stories.

            Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin Random House Children’s, said the publisher had “listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl’s books and the very real questions around how stories from another era can be kept relevant for each new generation.”

            “Roald Dahl’s fantastic books are often the first stories young children will read independently, and taking care for the imaginations and fast-developing minds of young readers is both a privilege and a responsibility,"" she said.

            “We also recognize the importance of keeping Dahl’s classic texts in print,"" Dow said. ""By making both Puffin and Penguin versions available, we are offering readers the choice to decide how they experience Roald Dahl’s magical, marvelous stories.”LONDON (AP) — Publisher Penguin Random House announced Friday it will publish “classic” unexpurgated versions of Roald Dahl’s children’s novels after it received criticism for cuts and rewrites that were intended to make the books suitable for modern readers.Along with the new editions, the company said 17 of Dahl’s books would be published in their original form later this year as “The Roald Dahl Classic Collection” so “readers will be free to choose which version of Dahl’s stories they prefer.”The move comes after criticism of scores of changes made to “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and other much-loved classics for recent editions published under the company’s Puffin children’s label, in which passages relating to weight, mental health, gender and race were altered.Augustus Gloop, Charlie’s gluttonous antagonist in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” — originally published in 1964 — became “enormous” rather than “enormously fat.” In “Witches,” an “old hag” became an “old crow,” and a supernatural female posing as an ordinary woman may be a “top scientist or running a business” instead of a “cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman.”In “Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" the word “black” was removed from a description of the “murderous, brutal-looking” tractors.The Roald Dahl Story Company, which controls the rights to the books, said it had worked with Puffin to review and revise the texts because it wanted to ensure that “Dahl’s wonderful stories and characters continue to be enjoyed by all children today.”While tweaking old books for modern sensibilities is not a new phenomenon in publishing, the scale of the edits drew strong criticism from free-speech groups such as writers’ organization PEN America, and from authors including Salman Rushdie.Rushdie, who lived under threat of death from Iran's Islamic regime for years because of the alleged blasphemy of his novel “The Satanic Verses,” called the revisions “absurd censorship.”Rushdie, who was attacked and seriously injured last year at an event in New York state, tweeted news of Penguin's change of heart on Friday with the words “Penguin Books back down after Roald Dahl backlash!”PEN America chief executive Suzanne Nossel wrote on Twitter: ""I applaud Penguin for hearing out critics, taking the time to rethink this, and coming to the right place.”Camilla, Britain's queen consort, appeared to offer her view at a literary reception on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820788,Russian agency also appeals in Valieva Olympic doping case,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — The Russian anti-doping agency has filed an appeal in the case of Kamila Valieva, the Court of Arbitration for sport said Friday, but it has asked for the teenage figure skater to be punished with as little as a reprimand and keep her Olympic gold medal.CAS confirmed registering three separate appeals — from the Russian agency known as RUSADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Skating Union. The appeals could now be combined into a single process to decide a case that overshadowed last year's Beijing Olympics.WADA previously said it was asking CAS to impose a four-year ban. The ISU has requested a punishment at its discretion.“At this time, it is not possible to indicate a time frame for the issuance of the decision,” the court said.The three parties that have made appeals should now have to cooperate in choosing one of the three judges in a typical CAS judging panel. The normal procedure would let Valieva’s legal team choose one judge and the court would appoint someone to chair the panel.RUSADA, WADA and the ISU are challenging a Russian anti-doping tribunal’s decision last year that Valieva bore “no fault or negligence” for the positive test in December 2021 for the heart medication trimetazidine, which is banned in sports. The tribunal disqualified Valieva from the Russian national championships, where she gave the sample, but no other event.Valieva’s positive test was reported only several weeks later during the Beijing Olympics, where she had already helped the Russians take gold in the team event.Still only 15 years old, Valieva was favored to win the women’s individual event in Beijing but, after several days of intense media coverage and an appeal to CAS that let her continue competing, she placed fourth with an error-filled skate.RUSADA acknowledged that Valieva has broken its anti-doping rules and suggested she now face “the appropriate consequences (which may include or be limited to a reprimand),” CAS said in a statement.The Russian agency issued its own statement saying it had not given Valieva any special treatment and defending its application for the sanction to be merely a reprimand.“RUSADA is convinced that there is a degree of fault for the athlete in the breach of the rules but that it is minimal and that a reasonable sanction could be issuing a reprimand,"" the agency said.No medal ceremony for the team event was held in Beijing. The United States team never received their silver medals and could eventually be upgraded to gold.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820789,Nigeria prepares for crucial presidential vote Saturday,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Officials rushed to prepare polling stations Friday, on the eve of Nigeria’s crucial election, amid new concerns of vote buying after police said one lawmaker was arrested with nearly $500,000 in cash and a distribution list.

            In the southeast, fears that separatists may target polling stations prompted election workers in parts of Imo state to abandon their posts, according to Mahmood Yakubu, head of Nigeria’s election commission.

            The last-minute developments came as Nigerians prepare to cast ballots Saturday in both parliamentary and presidential elections. The government indicated Thursday it would not postpone the vote at the last minute as it did in 2019, when the delay was announced the morning of the election. The 2014 vote also was rescheduled for a later date.











            And concerns continued about what impact Nigeria’s current cash shortage would have on voter turnout. While it’s been impossible for many Nigerians to obtain the national currency, naira, police said at least one lawmaker had plenty of U.S. dollars on hand.

            Authorities were interrogating Chinyere Igwe, a member of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, after he was found traveling with the money inside a bag in his car around 2 a.m. along with a distribution list, said Rivers state police spokeswoman Grace Iringe-Koko. It is illegal to move undeclared cash of more than $10,000 in Nigeria.

            Authorities in Kano state, meanwhile, announced the arrests of more than 60 “suspected thugs with dangerous weapons” after supporters of political parties clashed Thursday. Local media reported one person was burned to death in the violence.

            Eighteen candidates are vying for the chance to replace incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, who is stepping down after his second and final term in office.

            Three front-runners have emerged, including the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition party's Atiku Abubakar. Most polls have favored Peter Obi, a third-party hopeful.

            The vote is being carefully watched as Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and one of the continent’s top oil producers. By 2050, the U.N. estimates that Nigeria will tie with the United States as the third most populous nation in the world after India and China.

            The election comes amid a currency shortage in Africa's most populous nation, raising concerns about whether it will affect voter turnout. Authorities announced the switch to a new naira note in November, but the change has led to shortfalls of bank notes nationwide.

            At the same time, there have been doubts about the ability of Nigerian authorities to curb the influence of money in the country’s elections.

            Observer groups have documented political parties making payments ranging from 500 naira ($1.09) to 5,000 naira ($10.90) to people willing to vote for their candidates, a tactic used amid high unemployment and poverty rates in the country.

            “Vote buying remains a major threat to our democracy,” Mahmood Yakubu, the head of Nigeria’s election commission, told reporters Thursday. 

            The use of mobile phones is prohibited at Nigeria’s voting stations, Yakubu said. Authorities introduced the ban to counter voters photographing ballots as evidence in exchange for cash from political parties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820811,"More talent, same exit from Europe for Barcelona","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona’s risky financial decision last year to trade future revenues for much-needed cash to rebuild its squad is so far paying dividends in Spanish competitions.

            But it's a different story on the wider European stage — whether in the elite Champions League or the second-tier Europa League — which remains full of pitfalls for the once dominant Catalan club.

            Barcelona exited the Europa League on Thursday after Manchester United fought back for a 2-1 win and advanced to the round of 16 on a 4-3 aggregate result. 











            That made it two seasons running that Barcelona hasn't come close to fighting for a Europa League title after failing to even advance from the Champions League group stage.

            ""We are missing that little edge and have to learn to compete better in Europe,” Barcelona veteran captain Sergio Busquets said after his team's latest elimination.

            Busquets, a World Cup and three-time Champions League winner, knows the standard required for success. But the magic that made Barcelona an almost untouchable force in Europe had long faded even before Lionel Messi left the club two summers ago, with Barcelona accumulating several painful Champions League eliminations topped by its 8-2 debacle to Bayern Munich in 2020.

            Barcelona is caught in a prolonged crisis of its own making. With an underperforming team and a debt that stood at 1 billion euros ($1 billion) at the start of the season, club president Joan Laporta came to the conclusion that the only way to turn the club's fortunes around was to spend money it did not immediately have. So the club sold off stakes of its future television revenues and other assets to be able to make several signings, including Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, Brazil forward Raphinha and France defender Jules Koundé.

            All three started against United, but the result was another disappointment.

            Barcelona coach Xavi said that perhaps his team could have kept control of the game — after going ahead through Lewandowski’s first-half penalty — if midfielders Pedri (injured) and Gavi (suspended) had been available.

            But Xavi still had Busquets and Netherlands midfielder Frenkie de Jong on the field, and it was his decision to give a rare start in midfield to workman Sergi Roberto, instead of providing more punch to his attack with Ansu Fati or Ferran Torres. When the pair of Spain forwards went on late as substitutes, United already had turned the game around with goals by Fred and Antony.

            Last April, Barcelona was stunned in the Europa League by Frankfurt, whose 3-2 victory at Camp Nou sent the German side through to the semifinals on a 4-3 aggregate score.

            This time, Barcelona is out of European competition in February. The only solace is that they went down to in-form United.

            Barcelona failed to get any win in home-and-away games against Bayern Munich and Inter Milan in their Champions League group, where it finished with seven points from six games.

            “We have faced very strong rivals and we have competed, not like last season when we weren’t able to,” Xavi said after the defeat at Old Trafford. “It just got away from us in the details. We just have to try again next year, learn from our mistakes, be self-critical, and turn our focus to the league and the cup.”

            Not all is lost for Barcelona, though. It has a commanding eight-point lead over Real Madrid in the Spanish league and is set to play its fierce rival in the Copa del Rey semifinals next week. First it visits Almeria in the league on Sunday. Laporta has said that reclaiming the league, which it hasn’t won since 2019, is the top priority.

            But Laporta and his club have more pressing problems. A Spanish state prosecutor is probing Barcelona’s payment of millions of euros over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain. Barcelona says the money was for technical reports on referees and youth players, and denies any attempt to influence referees.

            Even if the official investigation fails to come up with any wrongdoing, the potential reputational damage to Barcelona, and to the legacy of its most glorious era under Messi, may already be beyond repair for some soccer fans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820813,"Germany's BASF to shed 2,600 jobs in cost-cutting drive","BERLIN (AP) — Chemicals maker BASF said Friday that it plans to cut around 2,600 jobs in a cost-cutting drive spurred in part by the impact of high energy prices. The announcement came after charges related to the exit from Russia of the company's gas and oil subsidiary pushed it to a loss in 2022.

            BASF, which is based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, said the cost-cutting program would be implemented this year and next to generate annual savings of more than 500 million euros ($530 million) in the company's service, operating and research and development divisions and corporate headquarters.

            “Globally, the measures are expected to have a net effect on around 2,600 positions; this figure includes the creation of new positions, in particular in hubs,” BASF said in a statement.











            It said that some plants at its sprawling Ludwigshafen site would close, affecting around 700 production jobs. But CEO Martin Brudermüller said the company was “very confident that we will be able to offer most of the affected employees employment in other plants.”

            Those measures are expected to be implemented by the end of 2026, with the aim of reducing fixed costs by more than 200 million euros per year.

            BASF reported a net loss for 2022 of 627 million euros, following a profit of 5.5 billion euros the previous year. The result was pushed down by charges of 6.3 billion euros related largely to the exit from Russia of its Wintershall Dea gas and oil subsidiary and on the unit's gas transportation business.

            Those included a including a complete write-down on the company's participation in Nord Stream AG. Wintershall Dea had a 15.5% stake in the operator of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that runs under the Baltic Sea, which is majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom and hasn't transported gas to Germany since August. The pipeline was damaged in explosions in September that investigators have described as sabotage.

            In announcing the cost-saving drive, Brudermüller complained that “Europe’s competitiveness is increasingly suffering from over-regulation, slow and bureaucratic permitting processes, and in particular, high costs for most production input factors.”

            “All this has already hampered market growth in Europe in comparison with other regions,"" he said. ""High energy prices are now putting an additional burden on profitability and competitiveness in Europe.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820891,10 killed in riots in Indonesia’s restive Papua province,"JAYAPURA, Indonesia (AP) — Ten people were killed and more than 20 others wounded in a riot in Indonesia’s Papua province, police said on Friday.

            The riots began Thursday afternoon in Wamena town in the Jayawijaya district of Papua, the country's easternmost province, amid reports of a child kidnapping.

            Local police who had responded to a report about the kidnapping — which police later said was a hoax — were attacked with rocks and arrows. Officers fired warning shots, hoping the people would disperse, Papua police spokesperson Ignatius Benny Ady Prabowo said in a written statement Friday.











            “The masses, who were increasingly anarchic, did not want to listen to the appeals from the officers. They did not want to disperse when they were given warning shots and even attacked the officers with arrows,” Prabowo said.

            Two civilians died after allegedly being hit by arrows and sharp weapons. At least 20 people were wounded in the riots, including 18 police and military officers.

            Rioters also burned shophouses and other buildings, set up roadblocks and attacked vehicles.

            Prabowo said the situation was now “recovering and under control.”

            Security officers were in the area and leaders pledged to investigate the incident.

            Tensions in the restive region have spiked in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed in clashes.

            
                A pilot from New Zealand was taken hostage by separatist rebels in Papua in early February. The Indonesian military said in a statement that community leaders and religious leaders, along with the regional government, were working to secure the pilot's release.

            Last July, gunmen believed to be separatist rebels killed 10 traders who came from other Indonesian islands and an indigenous Papuan. Rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom accused the victims of being spies for the government.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820893,European committee: Regulators should deny Merck's Lagevrio,"A European medical committee recommends rejection of Merck’s COVID-19 treatment, Lagevrio, casting fresh doubt on a pill that also stirs concern among U.S. regulators.

            A European Medicines Agency committee says marketing authorization for the antiviral pill for use in the European Union should be refused. 

            A statement from the agency says a committee that has been reviewing Merck's application for more than a year concluded that the drug's clinical benefit could not be demonstrated. 











            Merck said Friday that it plans to appeal the recommendation, which came from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.

            The drugmaker noted that more than two dozen countries have already approved or authorized the pill, including the United States. More than 4 million people have been treated with Lagevrio. 

            The United Kingdom became the first country in the world to authorize the drug in November 2021.

            Merck said in a statement that it remains confident that the anti-viral pill ""has an important role to play in the COVID 19 treatment landscape.”

            Lagevrio and Pfizer’s pill treatment, Paxlovid, hit the U.S. market more than a year ago. They offer an easier way than IV medicines to treat patients with early COVID-19 symptoms who are at risk of serious illness.

            Merck’s drug inserts tiny errors into the coronavirus’ genetic code to slow its reproduction. U.S. regulators have said it should be used cautiously.

            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the treatment in late 2021 with restrictions. It cannot be used on patients under age 18. It also isn’t recommended for pregnant women because of the potential for birth defects.

            The agency also has said Merck's drug should be considered for patients “for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.”

            The European Medicines Agency said Merck submitted results from a study involving more than 1,400 unvaccinated adult patients. It also provided data from other studies and real-world use. 

            The agency said in a statement that it wasn't possible to conclude that Lagevrio reduces the risk of hospitalization or death or shortens recovery time or illness in adults at risk of severe complications. 

            
                The FDA has said the drug is effective against the virus, but its advisory panel only narrowly endorsed the treatment. The FDA authorized it in December 2021.

            Lagevrio brought in about $5.7 billion in sales last year for Merck & Co. Inc., which is based in Rahway, New Jersey. Merck makes the treatment with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. 

            For 2023, Merck forecasts about $1 billion in Lagevrio sales.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820894,Cyclone Freddy slams Mozambique with 'dangerous' rainfall,"MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Tropical Cyclone Freddy dumped “dangerous and exceptional rainfall levels” over Mozambique Friday as the long-lasting weather system continued to wreak havoc across southern Africa, the United Nations weather agency said.

            Freddy made landfall in the coastal town of Vilanculos with wind speeds of 113 kilometers (70 miles) and is now classified as an “intense tropical cyclone” after picking up speed over the Mozambique channel.

            The cyclone is projected to weaken as it barrels through southern Africa but still poses serious risk of heavy rainfall to the neighboring nations of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia, Malawi and Botswana, according to the regional weather center in Reunion. 











            “There is a potential risk that months’ worth of rainfall may fall in the space of a few days, causing widespread flooding in an area which already has saturated soils and high river basin levels from unusually heavy seasonal rains,” The U.N. weather agency warned in a statement. 

            Anne-Claire Fontan, a tropical cyclone scientist at the U.N. weather agency, said Mozambique is already reeling from floods and the cyclone will compound an already volatile scenario.

            Freddy had waned slightly when it plowed through Madagascar on Tuesday night, killing at least four people and displacing more than 16,000, before regaining strength over the ocean on Wednesday night and on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820895,Experts say bird flu threat small despite Cambodian fatality,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A top World Health Organization official, reacting to the death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia infected by bird flu, said Friday the recent global spread of the virus and human infections are “worrying.”

            Dr. Sylvie Briand, the WHO’s director for epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said the U.N. agency is “in close communication with the Cambodian authorities to understand more about the outbreak.”

            Speaking ahead of a meeting in Geneva on influenza vaccines, Briand called the global situation concerning the virus ""worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world, and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including humans.”











            “WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries,” she said.

            Independent experts also have expressed concern over a wave of bird flu that has spread through much of the world since late 2021, posing a potential public health risk.

            The Cambodian girl, from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Wednesday at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu, according to Cambodia’s Health Ministry. She had fallen ill on Feb. 16, and when her condition declined she was sent to the hospital with a fever as high as 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) with coughing and throat pain.

            The girl's father tested positive for the virus but has not displayed any major symptoms, health authorities said Friday. 

            Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads between sick poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals, including at a large mink farm in Spain, has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.

            Health Ministry spokesperson Ly Sovann told The Associated Press that the Cambodian father’s case is under investigation, and it was not yet known how he became infected. He has been put in isolation at a local district hospital for monitoring and treatment.

            A ministry team collected samples from 12 people from the dead girl's village known to have had direct contact with her, and laboratory tests confirmed Friday that only her father was infected.

            Health professionals have expressed concern about a wave of bird flu that has spread worldwide in the past year and a half, but consider the current risk to humans to be low.

            “There has been a massive global challenge of wild and domestic birds with the current H5N1 avian influenza virus over the last few months and years, which will have exposed many humans; despite this, what is remarkable is how few people have been infected,"" professor James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at England's University of Cambridge, said in an emailed statement. 

            ""Tragic though this case in Cambodia is, we expect there to be some cases of clinical disease with such a widespread infection. Clearly the virus needs careful monitoring and surveillance to check that it has not mutated or recombined, but the limited numbers of cases of human disease have not increased markedly and this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed,” Wood added.

            According to the World Health Organization, there were 56 bird flu cases in humans in Cambodia from 2003 until 2014, and 37 of them were fatal. Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries, for an overall case fatality rate of 53%. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.

            “Between 2005 and 2020, 246 million poultry died or were culled because of avian influenza,” says the World Organization for Animal Health.

            “Since October 2021, an unprecedented number of outbreaks has been reported in several regions of the world, reaching new geographical areas and causing devastating impacts on animal health and welfare,” the Paris-based agency says on its website. 

            The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees that the current H5N1 outbreak is mostly an animal health issue. 

            “However, people should avoid direct and close contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, and wild animals,"" it warns on its website. “People should not consume uncooked or undercooked poultry or poultry products, including raw eggs. Consuming properly cooked poultry, poultry products, and eggs is safe.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820896,Key US inflation measure surges at fastest rate since June,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose last month at its fastest pace since June, an alarming sign that price pressures remain entrenched in the U.S. economy and could lead the Fed to keep raising interest rates well into this year. 

            Friday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 0.6% from December to January, up sharply from a 0.2% increase from November to December. On a year-over-year basis, prices rose 5.4%, up from a 5.3% annual increase in December.

            Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 0.6% from December, up from a 0.4% rise the previous month. And compared with a year earlier, core inflation was up 4.7% in January, versus a 4.6% year-over-year uptick in December.











            The report also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month.

            January's price data exceeded forecasters' expectations, confounding hopes that inflation was steadily decelerating and that the Fed could relent on its campaign of rate hikes. It follows other recent data that also suggested that the economy remains gripped by inflation despite the Fed's strenuous efforts to tame it.

            Last week, the government issued a separate inflation measure — the consumer price index — which showed that prices surged 0.5% from December to January, much more than the previous month's 0.1% rise. Measured year over year, consumer prices climbed 6.4% in January. That was well below a recent peak of 9.1% in June but still far above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.

            Since March of last year, the Fed has attacked inflation by raising its key interest rate eight times. Yet despite the resulting higher borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, the job market remains surprisingly robust. That is actually a worrisome sign for the Fed because strong demand for workers tends to fuel wage growth and overall inflation. Employers added a sizzling 517,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, its lowest point since 1969.

            “Reaccelerating price pressures, coupled with a still-strong labor market that is restoring incomes and is supporting demand, will keep the Fed on track to hike rates further over coming meetings,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

            The Fed is thought to monitor the inflation gauge that was issued Friday — the personal consumption expenditures price index — even more closely than it does the government’s better-known CPI. 

            Typically, the PCE index shows a lower inflation level than CPI. In part, that’s because rents, which have soared, carry twice the weight in the CPI that they do in the PCE.

            The PCE price index also seeks to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. As a result, it can capture emerging trends — when, for example, consumers shift away from pricey national brands in favor of less expensive store brands.

            The consumer price index showed a worrisome rise from December to January: It jumped 0.5% — five times the November-to-December increase.

            Likewise, the government’s measure of wholesale inflation, which shows price increases before they hit consumers, accelerated 0.7% from December to January after having dropped 0.2% from November to December.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose last month at its fastest pace since June, an alarming sign that price pressures remain entrenched in the U.S. economy and could lead the Fed to keep raising interest rates well into this year.Friday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 0.6% from December to January, up sharply from a 0.2% increase from November to December. On a year-over-year basis, prices rose 5.4%, up from a 5.3% annual increase in December.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 0.6% from December, up from a 0.4% rise the previous month. And compared with a year earlier, core inflation was up 4.7% in January, versus a 4.6% year-over-year uptick in December.The report also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month.January's price data exceeded forecasters' expectations, confounding hopes that inflation was steadily decelerating and that the Fed could relent on its campaign of rate hikes. It follows other recent data that also suggested that the economy remains gripped by inflation despite the Fed's strenuous efforts to tame it.Last week, the government issued a separate inflation measure — the consumer price index — which showed that prices surged 0.5% from December to January, much more than the previous month's 0.1% rise. Measured year over year, consumer prices climbed 6.4% in January. That was well below a recent peak of 9.1% in June but still far above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.Since March of last year, the Fed has attacked inflation by raising its key interest rate eight times. Yet despite the resulting higher borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, the job market remains surprisingly robust.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820897,EU: Freeing ex-senator can help Manila keep trade incentives,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines’ chances of retaining special trading incentives, including slashed tariffs for a wide array of products, would be boosted if it decides to free a long-detained opposition leader and rejoin the International Criminal Court, a group of European parliamentarians said Friday.

            The European Union trade incentives under the so-called Generalized Scheme of Preferences, or GSP Plus, for the Philippines and seven other developing countries are anchored on their adherence to more than two dozen international conventions on human and labor rights, environmental protection and good governance.

            The trading incentives, which the Philippines started to enjoy in 2014, would end in December and the government could reapply within a two-year period to retain them, the European lawmakers said. 











            But the Philippines came under intense EU criticism during former President Rodrigo Duterte’s six-year term, which ended last year, mainly because of the bloody anti-drugs crackdown he oversaw that left more than 6,000 mostly petty suspects dead.

            The killings sparked an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in 2018 but its prosecutor has proceeded to investigate the widespread deaths that occurred in the years when the country was still part of the court based in The Hague.

            European parliamentarians have also repeatedly demanded the release of opposition leader and former senator Leila de Lima, Duterte’s most vocal critic who was arrested and detained in 2017 on drug charges she said were fabricated by Duterte and his officials to stop her from investigating the killings.

            A delegation from the European Parliament’s sub-committee on human rights visited the Philippines from Wednesday to Friday and held talks with the justice secretary and other officials, senators, and human rights and labor activists to discuss rights issues under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June. 

            They visited de Lima on Thursday on the eve of her sixth year in detention and expressed hopes she would at least be released on bail. “I expressed to them my hope and optimism on the prospects of freedom and vindication,” de Lima said in a statement after the visit. 

            In a news conference in Manila, Hannah Neumann, who led the European delegation, said rights conditions were “better than it was under Pres. Duterte” in reply to a question. “There are a lot of announcements that could indeed improve things if they’re implemented.”

            The delegates welcomed in a joint statement Marcos’ “commitment to change the focus of the ‘war on drugs’ away from a punitive approach towards prevention and rehabilitation.” 

            But they said extrajudicial killings have reportedly persisted and underscored the need for all the killings to be investigated and the perpetrators held to account to fight impunity.

            Asked if a decision to release de Lima and rejoin the ICC would boost the Philippines’ chances of continuing to enjoy the EU trading incentives, Neumann said that would be “a strong sign in which direction the country wants to move.”

            “The European Parliament has been quite clear that whoever wants to have preferential access to the European market needs to uphold social standards, human rights standards, environmental standards,” she said. “This is not going to go away.”

            Out of the more than 6,000 police-reported killings under Duterte’s drug crackdown, she said, only 25 cases have been filed and three law enforcers had been convicted nearly nine months into Marcos’ presidency.

            Marcos has also vehemently opposed any future ICC investigations in the Philippines.

            “If you look at the trajectory, this will take physically forever,” Neumann said, adding that “asking the ICC to come in is the perfect way to do it.”

            European officials wanted to know how they can support such a massive investigation and “how we can make, especially witnesses and families of victims, gain confidence that this is done in a proper way that doesn’t lead to more harassments and intimidation by the very same people that have killed their relatives,” Neumann said.

            More than 6,200 products exported by the Philippines are covered by the tax and tariff reduction under the GSP Plus, including crude coconut oil, preserved tuna and pineapple and vacuum cleaners, and more Filipino exporters have sought Europe’s trading incentives in recent years, Philippine trade officials said.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines’ chances of retaining special trading incentives, including slashed tariffs for a wide array of products, would be boosted if it decides to free a long-detained opposition leader and rejoin the International Criminal Court, a group of European parliamentarians said Friday.The European Union trade incentives under the so-called Generalized Scheme of Preferences, or GSP Plus, for the Philippines and seven other developing countries are anchored on their adherence to more than two dozen international conventions on human and labor rights, environmental protection and good governance.The trading incentives, which the Philippines started to enjoy in 2014, would end in December and the government could reapply within a two-year period to retain them, the European lawmakers said.But the Philippines came under intense EU criticism during former President Rodrigo Duterte’s six-year term, which ended last year, mainly because of the bloody anti-drugs crackdown he oversaw that left more than 6,000 mostly petty suspects dead.The killings sparked an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820899,"Biden unveils new Ukraine weapons package, Russia sanctions","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration declared its Ukraine solidarity with fresh action as well as strong words on Friday, piling sweeping new sanctions on Moscow and approving a new $2 billion weapons package to re-arm Kyiv a year after Russia’s invasion. 

            Despite the U.S. and allies’ continued ambitious efforts to bolster the Ukrainians, there are no signs of an endgame in the war, which seems destined to enter an even more complicated phase in the months ahead.

            On the somber anniversary, Biden and fellow leaders from the Group of Seven allies that have been at the forefront of backing Ukraine stayed focused on a unified front.











            “Our solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law,"" the G-7 leaders said in a joint statement after a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            As Ukraine mourned its war dead and vowed it would ultimately emerge victorious, the Pentagon unveiled its latest weapons package. It includes more ammunition, electronic warfare detection equipment and other weapons to counter Russia’s unmanned systems, and several types of drones, including the upgraded Switchblade 600 Kamikaze attack drone.

            The latest aid package uses the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to provide funding for longer-term contracts to buy weapons and equipment. Unlike the presidential drawdown authority that the Pentagon has used repeatedly over the past year to pull weapons from its own stocks and quickly ship them to Ukraine, the USAI-funded equipment could take a year or two to get to the battlefront. As a result, it will do little to help Ukraine prepare for an expected new offensive in the spring.

            “Difficult times may lie ahead, but let us remain clear-eyed about what is at stake in Ukraine,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, “to ensure that a world of rules and rights is not replaced by one of tyranny and turmoil.”

            Biden said in an ABC News interview on Friday that he's not ready to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and allies for jets, but White House officials have pushed back that they are not the weaponry that Ukrainians need in the near term.

            “There is no basis on which there is a rationale, according to our military now to provide F-16s,” Biden said. “I am ruling it out for now.”

            Meanwhile, the White House said that new sanctions hitting over 200 people and entities will “further degrade Russia’s economy and diminish its ability to wage war against Ukraine.” The Biden administration will also further restrict exports to Russia and raise tariffs on some Russian products imported to the U.S.

            ""Now, not only does Ukraine stand, but the global coalition in support of Ukraine is stronger than ever, with the G7 as its anchor,"" Biden said on Twitter following Friday's virtual meeting with Zelenskyy.

            Still, as the conflict enters a second year, there are no indications that President Vladimir Putin will retreat from the conflict. And the avalanche of international sanctions that have been steadily hoisted on Moscow over the past year have yet to deliver the sort of knockout blow to the Russian economy that the White House — and independent economists — predicted at the outset of the war.

            The Russian economy has weathered sanctions better than expected in 2022, in part due to “the slow introduction of commodities sanctions,"" according to a Moody’s Investors Service report on Friday. 

            The Russian economy is expected to weaken in 2023, with GDP shrinking by 3% this year, according to the Moody's projection. The economy shrank 2.2% in 2022, far short of predictions of 15% or more that Biden administration officials had showcased at the start of the war. Export controls and financial sanctions are gradually eroding Russia’s industrial capacity, but oil and other energy exports last year enabled Putin to keep funding the war. 

            White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby acknowledged that Russia's economy was “showing some resilience” but he also said it's not clear that it “can be sustained for the long haul.”

            Of Putin, he said, “He has had to take some drastic measures to prop up his economy, to prop up his currency, including playing pretty aggressively with interest rates for instance.""

            The new sanctions introduced by U.S. Treasury on Friday hit Russian firms, banks, manufacturers and individuals, taking aim at entities that helped Russia evade earlier rounds. Russia’s metals and mining sector are among those targeted in what Treasury called one of the “most significant sanctions actions to date.” 

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, attending meetings in India on Friday with fellow financial chiefs of the Group of 20 leading economies, called out Russian officials in attendance and insisted the world's biggest economies must do more to support Ukraine.

            “I urge the Russian officials here at the G-20 to understand that their continued work for the Kremlin makes them complicit in Putin’s atrocities,” Yellen said. “They bear responsibility for the lives and livelihoods being taken in Ukraine and the harm caused globally.”

            The U.S. State and Commerce departments as well as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative also issued plans Friday to increase pressure on Russia. These steps impose visa restrictions on 1,219 members of the Russian military, increase tariffs on Russian products such as metal, worth roughly $2.8 billion, and add nearly 90 Russian and third-country companies, including from China, to a list of identified sanctions evaders. 

            More than 30 countries representing more than half the world’s economy have already imposed sanctions on Russia, making it the most sanctioned nation in the world. 

            The sanctions have imposed price caps on Russian oil and diesel, frozen Russian Central Bank funds and restricted access to SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions. 

            The U.S. and allies have directly sanctioned roughly 2,500 Russian firms, government officials, oligarchs and their families. The sanctions are depriving them of access to their American bank accounts and financial markets, preventing them from doing business with Americans, traveling to the U.S. and more.

            By Friday afternoon, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, an international standard-setting body on illicit finance, suspended Russia from its membership. The removal occurred for the first time in the body's 34-year history. 

            Britain also announced new sanctions Friday on firms that supply Russia’s battlefield equipment and says it will bar export to Russia of all items it has used in the war, such as aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components of weapons.

            “We don’t think the job is by any means done,"" Britain’s Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said.

(CSE: PHOS) (FSE: KD0) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") dated February 23, 2023 with Prayon SA of Engis, Belgium (""Prayon""), Europe's largest producer of purified phosphoric acid.   In order to accelerate First Phosphate's integration plan for the North American lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery industry, the MOU engages the parties to collaborate towards assessing feasibility and potential partnership in the following areas:        Phosphate Concentrate Production and Offtake           LFP Grade Phosphoric Acid Toll Processing           License for LFP Grade Phosphoric Acid Production Facility           Development of LFP Cathode Active Material Manufacturing Plant     Phosphate Concentrate Production and Offtake   First Phosphate and Prayon have committed to study the potential of a long-term offtake agreement. Prayon requires phosphate concentrate and is interested to purchase concentrate from First Phosphate's eventual mining operations subject to specifications. Such feedstock would be transformed into merchant grade phosphoric acid (MGA) and subsequently into purified phosphoric acid (PPA) at the Prayon plant located in Engis, Belgium.   LFP Grade Phosphoric Acid Toll Processing   First Phosphate and Prayon have agreed to study the potential of a long-term purified phosphoric acid toll processing agreement.   LFP Grade Phosphoric Acid Production Facility   First Phosphate contemplates the development of its own fully dedicated, captive-use LFP battery grade phosphoric acid production facility. First Phosphate and Prayon have agreed to discuss the terms and conditions of a license for Prayon's technological expertise in the manufacture of merchant grade and LFP grade phosphoric acid to permit First Phosphate to establish its own phosphoric acid facilities in Quebec, Canada. The manufacturing methodology would be based on Prayon's most environmentally friendly, safe and solvent-less processing clean technologies that include options for full gypsum recycling.   LFP Cathode Active Material Manufacturing Project   Prayon has familiarity in the production of LFP Cathode Active Material and has expressed interest in collaboration with First Phosphate to study the feasibility of an LFP Cathode Active Material production facility of North American market scope based in Quebec, Canada.   ""The LFP battery already represents a leading globally accepted battery chemistry but still has limited domestic manufacturing supply in Europe and North America. Today's announcement sows the seeds to onshore that production capacity in North America,"" says First Phosphate President Peter Kent. ""Let's not forget that LFP battery technology was originally developed decades ago in a partnership with researchers in Quebec, Canada, the United States and Europe.""   ""We are pleased to co-operate with First Phosphate and to test implement our recognized technologies for the production and treatment of high grade phosphoric acid intended to supply the LFP battery industry in North America,"" said Prayon Chief Technology Officer, Marc Collin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820912,Germany woos India as an ally against Russia,"In 2022, when the UN General Assembly voted to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany, and other Western governments were shocked to see that a number of important states chose to abstain. These included China and India, which together are home to some 2.8 billion people, more than one-third of the world's population.On the first anniversary of the start of the war on February 24, 2023, India again abstained when the General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for Russia's immediate withdrawal. The Indian government under Narendra Modi has made it clear that it does not support sanctions against Russia and will continue to refuse to do so.While the Western alliance expected such a stance from autocratic China, the behavior of democratic India was a major disappointment. The Indian government's course did not only mean that the country was no ally in attempts to put pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin. It also meant that India, which Germany sees as a ""strategic partner"", was on the ""wrong"" side of this elementary question of international law.""While the disappointment of Western interlocutors is perhaps understandable, their surprise is not,"" says Amrita Narlikar, president of the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA) in Hamburg, in an interview with DW. ""Besides its good diplomatic relations with Russia, India's dependence on Russia for military supplies is considerable — it cannot afford to jeopardize this, especially considering the difficult neighborhood it is in. In the short-run at least, India's behavior makes strategic sense.""But what may make strategic sense in the short term could become a problem for India in the longer term, she believes: ""An increasingly weakened Russia is likely to be driven into the arms of China, and thus indirectly, by supporting Russia, India may be strengthening China's hand — and China is not only a competitor and rival but a neighbor with which India has serious border disputes and conflict.""So far, however, there is nothing to indicate that India is about to change its position. In an interview with the news portal ANI this week, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar described India's relations with Russia as ""extraordinarily stable, and that's in the midst of all the global political turmoil.""India also seems to have no plans to use its presidency of the G20, the group of the world's major industrialized and emerging economies, to encourage a debate on new sanctions against Russia. Several Indian government officials made that clear in interviews with the Reuters news agency. India has actually significantly expanded its oil imports from Russia since the war began.Now, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit is an attempt to bring India a bit closer to the West. But the German government does not expect a complete turnaround and has made no plans for a joint declaration on the war in Ukraine to be signed during Scholz's visit. The point is ""that we have to keep promoting our position, our view of this conflict,"" said government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit this week. The goal, he said, was to use arguments to refute narratives from the Russian side.Political scientist Amrita Narlikar sees a lot of room for negotiation, but is skeptical that Scholz will use it, because: ""To bring India a little bit closer to the European position, he would need to have a far better understanding of India's negotiating culture, the constraints that it faces in its region, as well as the hopes and aspirations of its people.""She simply does not see Scholz and his government as being interested in dealing with this in detail. ""Scholz also does not seem to reflect on the mixed signals he is sending to the Global South, including India, via his willingness to keep doing deals with China,"" she added.Just how difficult it is for the German chancellor to win over some of the ""neutral"" countries in the Russia-Ukraine conflict was already evident in Brazil a few weeks ago. Right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro had been voted out of office, and the German chancellor had hoped to be able to sway his successor, the socialist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, to side with the West. But Lula continues to reject sanctions against Russia. Scholz also met with a rebuff from the Brazilian president in response to his request for ammunition supplies for the German Gepard flak tanks delivered to Ukraine.So what would have to happen for Olaf Scholz's visit to India to be a success?Amrita Narlikar sees two main preconditions: Germany and the West as a whole would have to make more of an effort to address the concerns of the Global South and its people as equals. Here, she feels Germany also has a lot of catching up to do: ""Germany could do this very well if it were to improve its knowledge of India's political culture and traditions, and really work with it at an eye-to-eye level as a fellow democracy.""In addition, she said, India must be offered alternatives to its military and economic dependence on authoritarian powers. Unlike France, Germany has been reluctant to cooperate on defense issues, she pointed out. "" The sooner we see a real Zeitenwende from Scholz in this direction,"" Amrita Narlikar said, alluding to Scholz's speech announcing a turning point in world politics three days after the Russian attack on Ukraine, ""the better it will be for India, Germany, and the world of democracies at large.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/24,,

Thank you Senate of Pakistan.""Mohammed Rabbani was accused of organizing travel and funds for senior al-Qaida members, and recruiting his brother into extremist circles.US officials had accused Abdul Rabbani of working for the avowed mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US. He was also accused of operating an al-Qaida safe house in Karachi, Pakistan's largest southern port city.According to his detainee assessment, however, he was not believed to have had ""specific insight into al-Qaida operational plans.""Pakistani authorities arrested the two men in 2002, and were in CIA custody before being transferred to Guantanamo.A US Senate report said Mohammed Rabbani was one of 17 detainees subjected to torture at overseas CIA secret prisons.According to the US Defense Department, the pair were approved for release in 2021.Their release is the latest move toward emptying the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which has had a reputation for severe human rights abuses and inhumane interrogation techniques.Some 32 detainees are still at the military prison — only two of them have been convicted.fb/rt (AP, AFP)",2023/02/24,,

Countries on the grey list face increased monitoring when the country has ""committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframe.""FATF is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It is a global standard bearer of sorts in that it checks and rechecks to see if countries are following basic principles of financial regulatory oversight.The so-called grey listing of a nation on the FATF list can spell doom for a country's economy as it discourages investment, indicates an absence of rule of law and often results in the downgrading of a country's investment grade or rating.The Paris-based organization added South Africa and Nigeria, meaning clients at financial institutions in these countries are also likely to experience increased due diligence checks in international banking and finance.The consequences will also be felt on the state level when it comes time to seek credit or borrow from multilateral organizations and international financial institutions.South Africa's Treasury sought to downplay the impact, arguing the country's grey listing would have a limited consequence on financial stability and the costs of doing business.ar/rt (Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820918,GOP Rep. John James won't seek Michigan's open Senate seat,"DETROIT (AP) — Republican Rep. John James filed paperwork Friday to run for reelection to his Detroit-area House seat, opting against a campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow in 2024.

            James, a 41-year-old first-term representative and rising star in the party, had been considered one of Republicans' most promising potential Senate candidates. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate twice before, losing to Stabenow in 2018 and to Democratic Sen. Gary Peters in 2020.

            Those two statewide bids raised James’ name recognition before he won his House seat in last year's midterms, becoming Michigan’s first Black Republican member of Congress. He has been a frequent guest on conservative media outlets and a strong fundraiser.











            Following an event in Detroit on Friday, James told The Associated Press that his focus on his House district “has been unwavering.”

            Stabenow announced in January that she would not seek a fifth term, raising the stakes of the contest in the presidential battleground state and giving new hopes to Republicans as they try to retake control of the Senate in 2024. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the chamber.

            Nikki Snyder, a Republican State Board of Education member, this month became the first candidate to announce a run for Stabenow's seat, but a high-profile candidate has yet to enter the race.

            On the Democratic side, Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Debbie Dingell, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist have been discussed as potential candidates. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who lost his Republican primary last year after voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump in 2021, is still considering a GOP run for the seat. 

            James' decision to seek reelection thins an already small Republican bench of potential Senate candidates in Michigan after the party suffered sweeping losses in statewide and congressional races in November's midterms. Republicans have taken just one of Michigan’s last 15 Senate races, winning an open seat in 1994.

            James only narrowly won his race last year, defeating Democrat Carl Malinga by fewer than 2,000 votes despite outraising him by nearly $6 million.

            His 10th Congressional District seat, which was recently redrawn to include a chunk of Macomb County and a small portion of Oakland County, is expected to once again be competitive in 2024 and could be critical to Republicans’ chances of maintaining a slim majority in the U.S. House. 

            Michigan Democratic Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement to The Associated Press that the party is “aggressively working to flip the 10th congressional district blue.”

            In his less than two months in Congress, James has been named vice chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment and delivered a prominent speech on the House floor last month to nominate Kevin McCarthy as speaker. 

            Over five generations, James said in the speech, “My family’s gone from slave to the floor of the United States House of Representatives,” now seeing him become the first in his freshman class of lawmakers to address the full House.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820919,Inquiry issues damning report into Dutch gas drilling,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A Dutch parliamentary inquiry released a damning report Friday into the government's handling of lucrative natural gas extraction that caused a string of earthquakes in the northern province of Groningen, saying that authorities put profits before people.

            “The interests of the people of Groningen have been structurally ignored in natural gas extraction in Groningen, with disastrous consequences for the people of Groningen,” the commission said in a statement.

            The conclusions in the nearly 2,000-page report are the latest damaging blow to the credibility of Dutch governments that have been led for more than a decade by Prime Minister Mark Rutte.











            He declined Friday to react to the report's findings, but acknowledged that the conclusions were “hard and painful” and underscore why people in Groningen “are angry and sad and that people feel unsafe and abandoned.”

            Two years ago, Rutte's last ruling coalition resigned over a parliamentary inquiry's report into a scandal over efforts to stamp out child welfare payment fraud that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters. 

            Hans Vijlbrief, the government's minister in charge of mines, said Friday was a day for the people of Groningen and not for political consequences.

            “I, myself, feel shame about what has happened here and that means we have to do something about it,” he told reporters.

            Gas was extracted in Groningen for decades by a consortium including energy giants Shell and ExxonMobil before the Dutch government, spurred into action by the quakes that were shaking homes in the region, took a decision in 2018 to gradually stop pumping gas out of the ground.

            The Dutch state earned 363 billion euros from Groningen gas, the report said. Extraction from the Groningen field — one of the world's largest at 2,800 billion cubic meters — has now all but stopped, with only enough pumped to keep gas installations in the region operational. The field is not expected to re-open even amid the energy worries prompted by Russia's yearlong war in Ukraine.

            Thousands of households are still waiting for their homes to be strengthened after years of shaking damaged buildings. Thousands more are awaiting compensation.

            An organization that represents many of them, Groninger Bodem Beweging, said the inquiry report could be summed up with the words: “Too little, too late,” and called for action from the government.

            The commission said the government and energy companies used what they called “security of supply” as a “smoke screen.”

            It made a string of recommendations, including that the government make the processing of claims for damage easier, ensure enough money is available for compensation and strengthen the role of the country's mining regulator.

            Marjan van Loon, president director of Shell Netherlands, said the report was right to focus on the plight of people in Groningen.

            “Groningen residents bore a large part of the burden of gas production and saw only a small part of the benefits,” she said in a written statement. 

            ""As a company, we have important lessons to learn here. Looking to the future, we believe that things can and must be improved. We are therefore engaged in discussions with the government to find a way to make this happen,” she added.

            ExxonMobil did not immediately react.

            NAM, the Dutch gas drilling company that includes Shell and ExxonMobil, acknowledged in a written statement that it had “played an important role in this crisis.” 

            The company's director, Johan Atema, said “it is clear that we must pay more attention to the society in which we work.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820920,Lebanese banks suspend open-ended strike at PM's request,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s struggling banks on Friday decided to suspend their strike, which started earlier this month, for one week, at the request of caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.

            The Association of Banks in Lebanon did not give further details about the suspension. The strike began on Feb. 7 in protest of a recent court ruling that forced one of the country’s largest banks to pay out two of its depositors their trapped savings in cash. 

            The decision comes as many Lebanese, including civil servants, are expecting to get their monthly pay. Salaries are typically paid out toward the end of the month, through bank accounts. 











            Lebanon’s banks have been hard hit by the country’s historic economic meltdown that began in October 2019 and have since imposed informal capital controls under which depositors have been able to withdraw only small amounts of their savings at an exchange rate far lower than the one used on the market. 

            The economic crisis — rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class — has left more than three quarters of Lebanon’s population of 6 million in poverty. The Lebanese pound has lost 97% of its value against the dollar. 

            The informal capital controls have prompted some overseas depositors, locked out of their savings, to launch lawsuits overseas and in Lebnanon to pressure banks to release their savings in full. In Lebanon, some depositors opted to break into banks, armed, and forced cashiers to hand over their money. Several such armed actions last year prompted the banks to go on strike in September 2022 and close down amid security fears for a week. 

            Earlier this month, Lebanon’s Court of Cassation overturned a 2022 verdict in favor of Fransabank, sued by two depositors demanding their money in cash. The ruling threw out the previous verdict, which allowed the bank to pay them with a check. That would not have allowed them to retrieve their money in full since they would have had to deposit the check in a bank account, where the money would get stuck all over again. 

            In mid-February, angry Lebanese smashed windows and set tires on fire outside two of the country’s biggest banks in the capital, Beirut, as the value of the Lebanese pound hit a new low. 

            Despite the economic meltdown, Lebanese authorities have not implemented reforms demanded by the international community in order to release billions of dollars in loans and grants. The International Monetary Fund has criticized Lebanon for its sluggish progress on the reforms since talks between the government and the IMF began in May 2020.

            At the same time, banks have refused attempts to make their shareholders assume responsibility for the crisis — as envisaged under a proposed economic recovery plan — and have insisted that the government and their own depositors share the biggest burden for the losses.BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s struggling banks on Friday decided to suspend their strike, which started earlier this month, for one week, at the request of caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.The Association of Banks in Lebanon did not give further details about the suspension. The strike began on Feb. 7 in protest of a recent court ruling that forced one of the country’s largest banks to pay out two of its depositors their trapped savings in cash.The decision comes as many Lebanese, including civil servants, are expecting to get their monthly pay. Salaries are typically paid out toward the end of the month, through bank accounts.Lebanon’s banks have been hard hit by the country’s historic economic meltdown that began in October 2019 and have since imposed informal capital controls under which depositors have been able to withdraw only small amounts of their savings at an exchange rate far lower than the one used on the market.The economic crisis — rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class — has left more than three quarters of Lebanon’s population of 6 million in poverty. The Lebanese pound has lost 97% of its value against the dollar.The informal capital controls have prompted some overseas depositors, locked out of their savings, to launch lawsuits overseas and in Lebnanon to pressure banks to release their savings in full.

MILAN, ITALY -  Media OutReach - 24 February 2023 - OPPO, one of the world's leading companies in the field of smart devices, is once again at the center of Milan Fashion Week 2023, one of the most awaited international events in the fashion scene, thanks to the new collaboration with ACT N°1, amongst the most reputable brands supported by the Maison Valentino. Under spotlight, the new OPPO Find N2 Flip symbolizes OPPO's dedication to support young talents in the fashion industry, enhancing its flagship features, embellished by the exclusive ruffle bag created from the designer Luca Lin's iconic tulle.                                 The collaboration was created with the aim of celebrating the perfect union between fashion and technology, attention to detail and product exclusivity. A value that unites the two protagonists of the fashion show and that can be enclosed in OPPO's brand mission, ""Inspiration Ahead"", the continuous effort to improve today's reality that OPPO translates into innovation and beauty of its products, and ACT N°1 through the creation of inclusive models that are always inspired by art.                               In this way, Milan Fashion Week becomes the perfect setting to demonstrate how technology is not only creativity, but also an increasingly fundamental part of the creative process. The essence of OPPO and ACT N°1 is tangible in each of their creations as they concretely translate their values and leave an indelible imprint linked to a strong connection with their own history and at the same time with an eye to the present but especially to the future.                                   ""Fashion is about expressing a style. In our time, fashion needs to open up to different collaborations to create synergies and a storytelling. This collaboration is about the balance between innovation and elegance, free creativity and functionality, interiority and aesthetics, power and lightness."", said  Luca Lin, Cofounder of ACT N°1.   The combination of materials, colors, and design give shape to a unique and functional union: the smartphone's lightweight but premium materials are intertwined with the transparency of handmade tulle, which, in addition of being the iconic and recurring material of the fashion brand, allows you to see the smartphone cover and its innovative vertical screen further embellishing the design. The OPPO Find N2 Flip's sleek and elegant style, delicate camera design, and device body are just some of the features that are highlighted by ACT N°1's craftsmanship. Just like the new OPPO Find N2 Flip, the ruffle bag aims to be practical and functional, without forgetting style and originality.   Technology and fashion evolve in step with the needs of consumers, changing shape and characteristics, researching, and developing a product that meets the real needs of the moment. Therefore, the perfect balance becomes a key element to achieve the best results in terms of quality and satisfaction. OPPO, by creating the Find N2 Flip, has developed the best technologies, creating a premium and high-performance foldable device, without sacrificing aesthetics, a common element with ACT N°1.   ""The technological excellence achieved with the new Find N2 Flip consolidates an important growth path in the flagship category, allowing us to enter the flip market. As a result of our consolidation in co-branding partnerships, the collaboration with ACT N°1 is intended to be the first act of a show that allows us to continue to oversee and strengthen our positioning in the fashion world. Having the opportunity to support new generations of young talents enriches our history and broadens the search for new areas of expansion"" said  Billy Zhang, President of Overseas Sales and Services, OPPO.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820922,Prosecutor: Alex Murdaugh 'fuzzy' about new details of case,"Disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh faced intense questioning about his movements the night his wife and son were killed as the prosecutor challenged inconsistencies in his memory Friday at his double murder trial.

            A day after revealing for the first time that he was at the kennels where his wife and son were shot shortly before they died, Murdaugh returned to the stand in his own defense. During cross-examination, prosecutor Creighton Waters grilled Murdaugh about what he repeatedly called the once-prominent lawyer's “new story” about what happened at the kennels on the evening June 7, 2021.

            Waters asked Murdaugh if he meant what he told the jury Thursday — that he tried to help police find the killers.











            “Other than lying to them about going to the kennels, I was cooperative in every aspect of this investigation,"" Murdaugh said.

            “Very cooperative except maybe the most important fact of all, that you were at the murder scene with the victims just minutes before they died,"" Waters replied.

            For 20 months, Murdaugh insisted that he was never at the kennels. But after more than a year, state agents hacked his son’s iPhone and found a video with Alex Murdaugh’s voice less than five minutes before the victims stopped using their cellphones and prosecutors think they were shot.

            Murdaugh, 54, is charged with murder in the deaths of his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, but has steadfastly denied any involvement. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

            Waters ended his cross-examination by rattling off the names of about four dozen people — starting with Maggie and Paul Murdaugh and running through his family, friends, law partners, clients and police. He asked Alex Murdaugh if he lied to them and Murdaugh agreed on most.

            “And you want this jury to believe a story manufactured to fit the evidence that you brought forth just yesterday after hearing a trial’s worth of testimony?” Waters asked.

            The prosecutor then showed body camera video of the first officer to respond to the shooting. With the bodies of his wife and son visible, Murdaugh said he hadn’t seen them for 45 minutes before he left his home.

            Waters also pushed Murdaugh for more details about what happened during the kennel visit, noting that this was all new to investigators since he only admitted it in court Thursday.

            The timing, including cellphone and car-tracking data, is a key component. The video ended just before 8:46 p.m. and both Paul and Maggie Murdaugh stopped using their cellphones about three minutes later.

            Murdaugh couldn't remember how long he was at the kennels, whether he got blood on his hands pulling a dead chicken from a dog's mouth or the last words he would ever say to his son and his wife.

            “There would have been some exchange,” Murdaugh said.

            Waters said it appeared Murdaugh remembered a lot of specifics when the details were critical, but not when they might get him in trouble.

            “You disagree with my characterization that you have a photographic memory about the details that have to fit now that you know these facts but you're fuzzy about the other stuff that complicates that?"" Waters said.

            For the first time, Murdaugh blamed anger on social media aimed at his son for the killings. Paul Murdaugh had been involved in a boat wreck that killed a teenager and was charged with boating under the influence. He mentioned the boat crash when the first investigators asked if he could think of any suspects.

            Murdaugh said his son was the subject of vile “half-truths, half-reports, half-statements, partial information” online.

            “I believe then and I believe today that the wrong person saw and read that because I can tell you for a fact the person or people who did what I saw on June the 7th — they hated Paul Murdaugh and they had anger in their heart,” Alex Murdaugh said.

            Waters told Murdaugh that explanation defied logic, asking if Murdaugh was telling the jury that his wife and son were killed by random vigilantes who knew “they would be at the kennels alone on June 7, knew that you would not be there, but only between the times of 8:49 and 9:02.”

            “You've got a lot of factors in there, Mr. Waters, all of which I do not agree with, but some of which I do,” Murdaugh said.

            Murdaugh said Friday that after the brief kennel visit, he returned to the family's house about 1,150 feet (350 meters) away on a golf cart, lay down for a few minutes and then got up to get ready to visit his ailing mother about 9:02 p.m., a time verified by step data on his cellphone, which he didn't take to the kennels.

            Waters asked Murdaugh if a flurry of steps and a series of unanswered phone calls he started making to his wife and son at 9:02 p.m., after no activity was detected on his phone for nearly an hour, was a way a lawyer and volunteer prosecutor could begin crafting a story to show he couldn’t be the killer.

            “I never manufactured any alibi in any way shape or form because I did not and would not hurt my wife and my child.”

            Prosecutors have said Murdaugh killed his wife and son to gain sympathy to buy time because his financial misdeeds were about to be discovered. During his testimony, he has admitted to stealing from clients. 

            Murdaugh is charged with about 100 other crimes, ranging from stealing from clients to tax evasion. He is being held without bail on those charges, so even if he is found not guilty of the killings, he will not walk out of court a free man. If convicted of most or all of those financial crimes, Murdaugh would likely spend decades in prison.Disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh faced intense questioning about his movements the night his wife and son were killed as the prosecutor challenged inconsistencies in his memory Friday at his double murder trial.A day after revealing for the first time that he was at the kennels where his wife and son were shot shortly before they died, Murdaugh returned to the stand in his own defense.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820923,3 contenders running to replace Sturgeon as Scottish leader,"LONDON (AP) — Three members of the Scottish parliament will battle to become leader of the governing Scottish National Party, officials said Friday after the deadline for nominations closed.

            Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and lawmaker Ash Regan are running to replace First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. She announced her resignation last week after eight years as leader of Scotland and the pro-independence SNP.

            The party said all three passed the threshold of at least 100 nominations from 20 or more local party branches.











            Voting by party members for the new leader, who will also become first minister, will open March 13, with a winner announced on March 27.

            Forbes was considered the frontrunner, but dented her chances when she said this week that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed. Forbes, who belongs to the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, was not yet a lawmaker when the Scottish Parliament legalized same-sex unions in 2014.

            Several SNP lawmakers withdrew their support from Forbes following her marriage comments, though others praised her for being open about her faith.

            Forbes and Regan both oppose legislation championed by Sturgeon that would make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender.

            The gender recognition bill has been hailed as a landmark by transgender rights activists, but faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers. 

            The party’s next leader will have to decide what to do about the divisive bill, which has been passed by the Scottish parliament but blocked by the U.K. government 

            The winner will take charge of Scotland’s semi-autonomous government and of a party that came to dominate Scottish politics under Sturgeon. But Sturgeon failed in her main goal of taking Scotland and its 5.5 million people out of the United Kingdom, and attempts to secure a new referendum on independence have reached an impasse.

            Scottish people voted to remain in the U.K. in a 2014 referendum that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision. The SNP wants a new vote, but the British government has refused to authorize one, and the U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can’t hold one without London’s consent.LONDON (AP) — Three members of the Scottish parliament will battle to become leader of the governing Scottish National Party, officials said Friday after the deadline for nominations closed.Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and lawmaker Ash Regan are running to replace First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820939,MLB catchers wary of looming robo umps amid rules changes,"Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais spent parts of 11 seasons and nearly 800 games behind home plate as a catcher with four franchises, mostly in the 1990s.

            During that era — one dominated by Hall of Famers Mike Piazza and Ivan Rodriguez — the skills needed at backstop were clearly defined. 

            ""Could you throw guys out, how did you do blocking the ball and could you hit with power?” Servais said. “That’s how the position was evaluated.”











            A generation later, those attributes have been joined by a more subtle but equally significant skill: pitch framing. During baseball's data revolution, the fine art of making borderline pitches look like strikes was found to be a game-changing craft — one that could be as impactful as Piazza's power or Rodriguez's arm.

            The calculus, though, could be about to change, along with an equation that’s included the human element for nearly 150 years.

            While pitch clocks, bigger bases and other rules changes debut this year at the major league level, the Automated Ball-Strike System will receive its biggest experiment yet at Triple-A. ABS will be used four days per week to call every pitch at baseball's highest minor league level. On the other three days, umpires will traditionally call balls and strikes with a challenge system in place — teams will be able to appeal a handful of calls to the so-called robo-zone each game.

            To many, ABS has begun to feel inevitable. Umpires have already agreed to allow it at the major league level when it is ready. Which means that within a season or two, everything around home plate could change.

            “It’s going to be here,” Servais said.

            Others think Major League Baseball, and specifically Commissioner Rob Manfred, don’t recognize how seismically such a shift could alter the sport.

            “I don’t see it happening,” said Yankees All-Star and distinguished pitch-framer Jose Trevino. “I don’t think Manfred has any idea what’s going on whenever he talks about that kind of stuff. He’s obviously never put the gear on, so he doesn’t know.”

            Manfred, who last summer told ESPN that ABS could reach the majors by 2024, has cautioned this spring that the robo-umps remain in “the evaluation phase.” In order to be adopted in the big leagues, ABS would need to be approved by an 11-member competition committee that includes four players.

            “There are issues that are still the topic of really considerable discussion within the ownership group and even more that are going to have to be resolved in the joint committee process with the players,” Manfred said. “The framing issue is one of those. I mean it’s a legitimate concern on the part of at least a subset of players.”

            The subset includes some coaches, too, including New York Yankees director of catching Tanner Swanson — a pioneer of sorts in teaching backstops to steal strikes.

            An appreciation for pitch framing had been under way for nearly a decade when Swanson jumped from college coaching to join the Minnesota Twins organization before the start of the 2018 season. 

            Among his most impactful ideas: If catchers received pitches while down on one knee as opposed to a traditional squat, they'd be better positioned to steal strikes near the bottom of the zone. Within just a couple seasons, the one-knee approach he coached with Minnesota was being used across the majors.

            “When I got into pro ball, I think it really kind of opened the curtain to like, ‘OK, now this is not only extremely valuable, but this is something that we should be prioritizing just in terms of the frequency in which it happens relative to all the other skills.'” Swanson said.

            Swanson preaches subtle movements with the glove on every borderline pitch — just enough trickery to sway even the most well trained umpire. Even if it came at the expense of blocking pitches or throwing out runners, the data showed framing trumped all other skills.

            Swanson has had several notable success, starting with Mitch Garver in Minnesota and most recently Trevino, who was an All-Star and Gold Glove winner last season. Trevino converted 53.8% of non-swinging strikes on the edges of the zone into strikes — best in the majors, according to MLB's Statcast.

            The knee-down catching technique is already being taught to youth catchers on up, and there's now an entire generation of big league catchers trained to put pitch presentation first.

            “Framing’s always been big,"" said Baltimore catcher Adley Rutschman, last year's AL Rookie of the Year runner-up. “Since probably my junior year in high school, it’s been a big point of emphasis. Got to college, same thing, and in the pros, same thing.”

            Robot umpires, of course, can't be fooled. So what happens when framing falls out of focus?

            One name comes to mind for Servais: Piazza.

            “Mike was actually a pretty good receiver. But he could bang it, he could really hit and he just changed the position in my era,” Servais said. “So there’ll be more emphasis put on offense. 

            ""Receiving won’t matter at all. You’ll see guys set up with guys on base in throwing position, their bodies will be halfway turned because it won’t matter. So you’ll teach the position differently.”

            Unless, of course, receiving does still matter. 

            “When you have two alternatives, some of those alternatives are better at addressing issues,” Manfred said. “Obviously, the challenge one reduces dramatically the framing issue for catchers in terms of the value placed on framing. So you know, more to follow on that one, but I think it’s a mistake to automatically assume that ABS is coming on any particular timeframe.”

            Regardless, Swanson believes one-knee down stances are likely here to stay because it takes stress off catchers' bodies and puts them in better position to block pitches, with their body already centered lower to the ground.

            But the valuations and evaluations will change if framing's significance is lessened.

            “I don’t think it’s good for the game at all,” Trevino said. “There’s guys out here that are good defensive catchers for a real long time. Guys that are still in the game that are defensive catchers. I think that takes away from the art of the catcher.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820943,Florida man pleads guilty to supporting IS extremist group,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man accused in 2020 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S. and acquiring an arsenal of weapons has pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State extremist group.

            Mohammed Al-Azhari, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen, also agreed Thursday to accept an 18-year prison sentence during the plea hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Anthony Porcelli in Tampa federal court. A formal sentencing date has not been set.

            Al-Azhari admitted in court papers that he scouted potential terrorism targets in the Tampa Bay area, sought to acquire multiple weapons and pledged an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State. The FBI recorded many conversations between Al-Azhari and confidential or undercover sources in which he discussed avenging imprisoned Islamic State fighters and using violence to oppose U.S. military actions in the Middle East.











            
                An FBI affidavit says Al-Azhari was recorded as expressing admiration for Omar Mateen, the deceased shooter at the Orlando Pulse nightclub massacre in 2016, and even drove there to scope out the location. In a conversation with a confidential informant, the FBI says, Al-Azhari said, “That’s how I want to die, to be honest.”

            The informant then asked how many people Al-Azhari wanted to kill.

            “I don’t want to take four or five, no. I want to take at least 50,” Al-Azhari replied on the recording, according to the affidavit. “You know like, brother Omar Mateen in Orlando did. He took 49 with him.”

            The confidential FBI informant eventually supplied Al-Azhari with a Glock handgun and a silencer as he had requested. He was arrested in May 2020 after taking possession of the weapons. Investigators also seized three firearms, a crossbow, dozens of rounds of ammunition, a stun gun and at least six knives belonging to Al-Azhari. He also sought to buy a fully automatic AK-47-style weapon but was unsuccessful.

            According to the affidavit, Al-Azhari conducted reconnaissance on several potential Tampa Bay targets, including beaches, parks and even the Tampa FBI field office. He also allegedly rehearsed what he would say when carrying out an attack, some of which was intercepted by electronic surveillance.

            “Know America. Today is your emergency. Today we kill from you guys like you killed from us,” he is overheard saying, according to the affidavit. “This is a revenge for Muslims.”

            Alazhari is originally from California but spent much of his life overseas and eventually embraced extremist Islamic ideology, according to the FBI. He was imprisoned for three years in Saudi Arabia after a 2015 conviction involving his advocacy for Jaysh al-Islam, an armed extremist group fighting in the Syrian conflict. 

            In 2018, after serving that sentence, he was deported to the U.S., where the FBI immediately opened a terrorism support investigation.

            One reason the case has taken so long to resolve is that Al-Azhari was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial in January 2022. After treatment at a federal prison medical center in Butner, North Carolina, a judge decided in November that Al-Azhari's competence had been restored.ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820948,Kermit Davis is out as Ole Miss men's basketball coach,"OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi coach Kermit Davis's tenure is over, his team mired in a four-game losing streak and in last place in the Southeastern Conference standings.

            Ole Miss Vice Chancellor for Intercollegiate Athletics Keith Carter said Friday the school and Davis “have mutually agreed to part ways effective immediately.”

            Davis has gone 74-79 in five seasons at Ole Miss, which is 10-18 and 2-13 in SEC games.











            “We thank Coach Davis for his dedication to the Ole Miss basketball program and our student-athletes,” Carter said in a statement. “No one wanted to bring a title home to Mississippi more than him, and we appreciate the passion for that goal that he shared with our team every day.”

            Assistant coach Win Case will serve as acting head coach for the rest of the season.

            Davis began his Ole Miss tenure by leading the Rebels to a 20-13 record and NCAA Tournament berth in the 2018-19 season and earning SEC coach of the year honors. Ole Miss made the NIT in 2021.

            Before Ole Miss, Davis was at Middle Tennessee State, and is still its winningest coach. 

            His Division I career record as a head coach is 477-316, and he led Ole Miss, MTSU and Idaho to NCAA Tournament berths.

            “My family and I are extremely thankful for the opportunity to lead the Ole Miss men’s basketball program the past five years,” Davis said, calling Oxford ""a special place to live and work.”

            Carter said a national search has started. 

            “As we have seen in the past, Ole Miss basketball is capable of competing for and winning championships, and we are determined to find the right leader to help us reach our greatest potential,” he said. “Over the last 15 years, we have invested in the sport as much as any school in the country. 

            “That commitment, the passion of Rebel Nation and the opportunity to be a part of this great university makes our head coaching position a job that will attract top candidates.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820955,"Russians mark Ukraine war anniversary with flowers, arrests","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russians in Moscow and other cities brought flowers to Ukrainian poets and held one-person pickets with antiwar slogans Friday to mark the first anniversary of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 

            Russian media and civil rights groups reported at least a dozen detentions, part of the Kremlin's sweeping crackdown on dissent that has spiked to unprecedented levels since the start of the war. 

            At least eight people were detained in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, according to OVD-Info, a legal aid group that tracks political arrests. They all had brought flowers to the city’s monument to victims of political repression, the group said.











            Online news outlet Sota filmed at least seven people getting detained in St. Petersburg after they brought flowers to a monument for the renowned Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko. Footage posted by the outlet showed a police officer explaining to a couple that they had violated coronavirus restrictions. 

            Sota also reported a person detained in Moscow, where people flocked to the monument of Lesya Ukrainka, another renowned Ukrainian poet, to lay flowers. A contingent of police officers monitored the group but left mostly didn't interrupt. 

            Five people were detained in the Siberian city of Barnaul, according to the Sibir.Realii news outlet, including a man who picketed a central square with a placard reading “Stop being silent.” In another Siberian city, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, a woman was detained for protesting with a banner that read, “We’re mourning. Forgive us, we screwed up our country,” the outlet reported.

            Russians all across the country actively protested against the war in Ukraine during the first week of the invasion. Large rallies quickly fizzled after thousands were detained, but solo pickets -- and detentions -- have persisted throughout the year. 

            Russian authorities have enforced a law enacted soon after the invasion that effectively criminalizes any public expression against what the Kremlin refers to as a “special military operation” in Ukraine. 

            The Russian parliament rubber-stamped a bill that outlawed discrediting the Russian military or spreading false information a week after Moscow's troops rolled into Ukraine. 

            OVD-Info said in a statement Friday that “for 305 out of 365 days of the war, security forces detained people for their anti-war position in various cities of Russia and the annexed Crimea.” 

            As of mid-December, the group had counted 378 people facing criminal prosecution for their antiwar positions in 69 Russian regions and the Crimean Peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. The group also counted more than 5,500 administrative cases on the charge of discrediting the Russian army.TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russians in Moscow and other cities brought flowers to Ukrainian poets and held one-person pickets with antiwar slogans Friday to mark the first anniversary of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Russian media and civil rights groups reported at least a dozen detentions, part of the Kremlin's sweeping crackdown on dissent that has spiked to unprecedented levels since the start of the war.At least eight people were detained in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, according to OVD-Info, a legal aid group that tracks political arrests.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820956,Illinois investigating drugmaker Akorn's abrupt closure,"CHICAGO (AP) — State labor officials are investigating an Illinois-based pharmaceutical company’s decision to abruptly close all of its operations, including its out-of-state locations in New Jersey, New York and Switzerland, and to lay off hundreds of workers with almost no warning.

            Akorn Operating Co., which is based in the northeastern Illinois city of Gurnee, told its 400 workers Wednesday that it planned to file for bankruptcy and that they would be laid off within 24 hours, the Chicago Tribune reported.

            CEO Douglas Boothe told employees in a video that the company's leaders decided on the move after failing to find a buyer for the company.











            “I realize this is a tremendous shock and it will take time to absorb the news and what it means to you, your colleagues and your families,” Boothe said in the video, which was first obtained by the Decatur Herald & Review.

            A spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Labor said Thursday that the agency is investigating the situation because Akorn didn’t file the required 60-day notice of mass layoffs or plant closures until Wednesday. 

            Boothe said in his video that the company notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the closure. The Tribune’s attempts to reach the company Thursday for additional comment were unsuccessful.

            Akorn's Illinois locations include its corporate headquarters in Gurnee as well as manufacturing and research facilities in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills and in Decatur, in central Illinois. The company also has locations in New Jersey, New York and Switzerland.

            The company developed, manufactured and marketed a wide array of branded and generic prescription drugs, including eye drops, injectables, oral liquids, inhalants and nasal sprays, according to its website. It also developed drugs for animals.CHICAGO (AP) — State labor officials are investigating an Illinois-based pharmaceutical company’s decision to abruptly close all of its operations, including its out-of-state locations in New Jersey, New York and Switzerland, and to lay off hundreds of workers with almost no warning.Akorn Operating Co., which is based in the northeastern Illinois city of Gurnee, told its 400 workers Wednesday that it planned to file for bankruptcy and that they would be laid off within 24 hours, the Chicago Tribune reported.CEO Douglas Boothe told employees in a video that the company's leaders decided on the move after failing to find a buyer for the company.“I realize this is a tremendous shock and it will take time to absorb the news and what it means to you, your colleagues and your families,” Boothe said in the video, which was first obtained by the Decatur Herald & Review.A spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Labor said Thursday that the agency is investigating the situation because Akorn didn’t file the required 60-day notice of mass layoffs or plant closures until Wednesday.Boothe said in his video that the company notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the closure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820961,Q&A: Austin Butler on what 'Elvis' taught him about fear,"Austin Butler, you may have heard, has taken a bit of flack for sounding too much like Elvis now that he's no longer, um, Elvis. 

            The 31-year-old breakout star of Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant biopic even had to be defended by fellow Oscar nominee Angela Bassett, who's explained that she, too, had a hard time shaking the Tina Turner vibe after playing her back in 1993.

            In any case, Butler says there’s something far more significant that's remained with him since making “Elvis”: a new relationship with fear. 











            The challenge of playing an icon who's been imitated as often as Presley was so great, he says, that he suffered from “impostor syndrome” and could have been felled by the fear — fear that kept him from sleeping well for two years, he adds — had he not learned to use it as a “compass,"" in his words. Now, he says, he asks himself: “What am I terrified of today?” And then he tries to step toward it, rather than away.

            Butler, whose Golden Globe from January now has to share shelf space with the BAFTA from February, looks like one of the key favorites to add an Oscar to that shelf, come March. He spoke to The Associated Press shortly after winning his Oscar nod, musing about how he tried to approach the role so it felt human and not like “going to a wax museum,” about what he learned personally from the process, and also about the shocking death of Lisa Marie Presley. T he interview has been edited for clarity.

            ___

            AP: It’s been an emotional time for you: Winning a Golden Globe, then the tragic death of Lisa Marie Presley, then the Oscar nomination, all within days. Can you describe that journey?

            BUTLER: I mean, the peaks are so high and the valleys have been so low. For each of these moments I’m just trying to stay as present as I can … I just wish Lisa Marie were here with us to celebrate. At times, in the midst of intense grief and just a shattering loss, it feels sort of bizarre to celebrate. But I also know how much this film meant to Lisa Marie, how much her father’s legacy meant to her. So I feel so proud and humble to be a part of that story. But it puts things in perspective for sure, when you have such intense loss like that.

            AP: Let’s talk about the challenges of the role itself. You had to find a way to avoid mimicking a much-mimicked icon, and to bring humanity and authenticity to it. Can you put into words how you managed that?

            BUTLER: It’s so hard to quantify it, and it’s such a tricky thing to talk about without sounding incredibly pretentious and self-important. There are certain aspects that even I don’t fully understand. Thankfully I had a long time. I had a year and a half before we started filming, and a large chunk of that time was alone in my apartment in Australia during the six months that the film shut down during the pandemic. So it was a lot of just focusing on it every day and trying to get into the life of this man, rather than all the external things.

            Even the way that he moved, it all had to come from his spirit, rather than it ever feeling like choreography. Because there are moments where you want to be meticulous, you know, very specific to how he actually moved in a certain way or how he spoke or whatever that is, but it can’t feel like it’s a recreation — otherwise then you just feel like you’re going to a wax museum or something! So I was very fortunate to be surrounded by amazing people, my amazing movement coach Polly Bennett and dialect coaches and singing coaches and karate instructors. I had so many people around me that that aided me in that process. But it was just a long process of trying to figure it out every day, to feel like a detective.

            AP: After all that, would you say the character has changed you in any permanent way?

            BUTLER: Yeah and in probably more ways than I can even describe or figure out myself. But one of the main things is that it’s altered my relationship with fear, because this was such a daunting undertaking. And there were many moments where I where I felt, you know, where maybe I didn’t believe in myself, I felt impostor syndrome — just a terror that didn’t allow me to sleep for two years. And so now my experience is that when I feel fear like that, I kind of know that it’s not the thing that has to stop you. That you just keep doing the work and you use the fear almost as a compass, to go, “What am I terrified of today?” — and step into that rather than running away from it. I think that that’s probably the biggest thing that’s really stuck with me.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820962,Woman accused of killing ill husband seeks release from jail,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A 76-year-old woman accused of fatally shooting her terminally ill husband in a Florida hospital is asking to be released from jail.

            
                Ellen Gilland was initially charged with first-degree murder in January after police said she shot Jerry Gilland, 77, in a suicide pact that she claimed had been in the work for weeks. However, she could not carry through with turning the gun on herself after shooting her husband in his 11th-floor AdventHealth Daytona Beach hospital room, Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young said at a news conference after the Jan. 21 incident.

            Instead, Gilland engaged in a four-hour standoff with police officers. They eventually used a nonlethal explosive to distract her and take her into custody, Young said. She's been held at the Volusia County Jail since her arrest.











            On Wednesday, Gilland was indicted on lesser charges of assisting self-murder/manslaughter and aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer. Now her lawyers are seeking a bond hearing.

            “None of the charges against Ms. Gilland are capital offenses or offenses punishable by life imprisonment. Therefore, Ms. Gilland is entitled to pretrial release,” attorney Matthew Ferry wrote in a motion filed late Wednesday.

            The motion cites a section of the Florida Constitution which states that anyone charged with a crime is entitled to pretrial release “on reasonable conditions” unless the crime is a capital offense or a crime punishable by life in prison.

            A bond hearing has not been set. Her next scheduled court appearance is a pre-trial hearing March 22.

            The police chief said the couple had decided that if Jerry Gilland’s unnamed illness took a turn for the worse, “he wanted her to end this.”

            Young said her husband had apparently planned to kill himself ""but he didn’t have the strength so she had to carry it out.”

            That's when they decided on “a murder suicide,"" the chief said. “But she decided she couldn’t go through with it.”

            Two hospital workers heard a gunshot from room 1106, and saw Ellen Gilland sitting beside the bed with her husband unresponsive in a pool of blood, a police report said. She pointed the weapon at the pair and told them to leave the room. Another staffer also entered and was told to leave.

            Patients were evacuated from nearby rooms, which Young described as “a logistical nightmare” since most of the patients on the 11th floor were on ventilators.

            Officers lined up in the hallway with guns drawn toward the open door of Gilland's room. They repeatedly yelled, “Drop the gun!” according to video from an officer’s body camera recorded about 10 minutes after the shooting.

            “Tell me what’s going on. We don’t want to hurt you,” one officer called out. Another told a colleague, “Back up. Back up. We got time. We got nothing but time.”

            After setting off the explosive, SWAT team members entered the room and tried to use a stun gun, but it failed to subdue Ellen Gilland. She fired a shot into the ceiling, then dropped the weapon and was taken into custody, the police report said.DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820964,Review: Lucero's new album serves rock 'n' roll comfort food,"Lucero, “Should've Learned by Now"" (Thirty Tigers)

            It would be selling Lucero short to say the Memphis band's new album feels like what you'd take away from a visit to the Lucero store. As in, you know just what you want, you pay your money for it, and you walk away satisfied with another tasty set of rock ‘n’ roll comfort food. 

            “Should've Learned by Now"" is more than that, for sure, but it's that, too. And yet the reason it tastes good is because it comes from a band that has polished its sound over more than two decades but still has too many rough edges to come off as complacent or ordinary.











            Sure, Lucero sounds less like a garage band than it once did. But the serrated edges of Brian Venable’s guitar-playing and the gravel in frontman Ben Nichols’ voice prevent it from slipping into the over-polished category. It also helps that Nichols writes compelling songs and growls them out with energy and conviction. 

            Nichols' Arkansas roots may account for why the band's music tends to land in the alt-country bin, but his songwriting owes more to the Replacements and Tom Petty than anything coming out of Nashville. That's obvious from the first cowbell and electric guitar riff on the opener, “One Last F.U."" It continues into the second cut, “Macon if We Make It,"" a song about a road trip through Georgia during a hurricane that rides the gale-force energy of Venable's electric guitar.

            Other cuts nudge keyboardist Rick Steff to the forefront. “She Leads Me"" and “Raining for Weeks"" both show off a band making the most of each member's ability to drive a song forward.

            Plenty of aging rockers boast enough true believers to sell records and make a living even if they're mailing it in, and Lucero has a dedicated following. But Nichols is too good of a songwriter, and this band is still having too much fun to settle for anything ordinary.

            The new stuff is good enough that the loyal followers will stay, and any newcomers who stray into Lucero's orbit will discover a still-underrated band that just keeps serving up good music.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820968,Newcastle confident in goalkeeper Karius ahead of cup final,"NEWCASTLE, England (AP) — Kieran Trippier has known Loris Karius since their youth days at Manchester City.

            He's not worried about the goalkeeper's state of mind as Newcastle prepares to face Manchester United in the English League Cup final on Sunday.

            “I know what kind of character he is. He’s brave, he’s confident, he’s a very good goalkeeper,” Trippier said at a press conference. “He’ll be mentally ready, he’ll be physically ready, no problem. I’m not worried about that.”











            Karius is set to be thrust back into the spotlight — at Wembley Stadium no less — nearly five years since his last appearance for an English club.

            The German's gaffes — later shown to be concussion related — were costly in Liverpool's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final.

            Karius' potential shot at redemption — manager Eddie Howe hasn't named his starters yet — has come about because Newcastle's top two 'keepers are unavailable.

            Nick Pope is suspended because of a red card, and backup Martin Dubravka is ineligible because he played in the competition for United earlier this season while on loan.

            That leaves the 29-year-old Karius and veteran Mark Gillespie, whose last appearance for Newcastle was in September 2020.

            Karius had gone to Turkish club Besiktas on loan from Liverpool for two seasons after the infamous defeat in Kiev and then played briefly for Union Berlin in 2020-21 before closing out his Liverpool days at the team's training center last season.

            Karius has yet to play a competitive match for Newcastle since signing in the offseason. He impressed in a friendly match against Al Hilal during Newcastle's trip to Saudi Arabia in December.

            “For me it was the first time back on the field after quite a while. It's a good feeling,” he told club media during the trip.

            Howe said he wouldn't select his starting lineup until the end of the week.

            “We’ve all got stuff that has happened in our careers, in our histories, that you learn from and I think he’s no different in that respect,” Howe said this week.

            Team captain Trippier said the Champions League final was “ages ago.”

            “Loris is only looking forward,” the right back said. ""He’s been positive since he’s arrived here. We can’t look at the past, we need to look at now. If Loris is playing, I know he’ll be ready. He has the full support of certainly myself and my teammates.

            “We want to win the cup and bring it back to Newcastle, so everyone will be ready.”

                UN, WEF agenda won’t force people to live in ‘smart cities’
              











            CLAIM: Governments can “forcibly remove” people living on polluted land or water and require them to live in “smart cities” under a plan from the World Economic Forum and United Nations called Agenda 2030.

            THE FACTS: The U.N.’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the World Economic Forum is helping to implement, does not discuss removing people from their homes nor “smart cities.” And neither organization has the ability to grant governments such power. Social media users are falsely claiming that the U.N. plan will give governments the power to uproot people and force them to live in specific cities, with some baselessly tying this supposed scheme to the recent burning of toxic chemicals at the site of a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. “The sickos at the UN/WEF plan to confiscate all polluted land and force the people into smart cities,” one recent tweet reads. “Resist. Make people aware. Wake up!! #Agenda2030.” But Agenda 2030 does nothing of the sort. The plan was adopted in 2015 by the U.N. General Assembly. In 2019, the U.N. and the WEF signed an agreement that outlines ways the organizations can work together in order to more quickly implement Agenda 2030’s goals. The agenda strives for universal peace and prosperity over a 15-year period, with 17 broad goals such as “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” and “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” Multiple goals, including the latter, cite reducing pollution as an aim. But the agenda does not direct nor give governments any new ability to dictate where people live. “It does mention that one of the goals is to reduce the adverse impact of cities on the environment with measures like improving waste management and air quality, but at no point does it talk about removing people from their land even if this is polluted,” Florencia Soto Niño, a U.N. spokesperson, wrote in an email to the AP. Soto Niño also pointed out that the document does not even mention the term “smart cities.” Other U.N.initiatives have used the phrase, but the term is generally just used to refer to cities that utilize technology to improve operations. The term “smart cities” has proliferated recently alongside misinformation about so-called “15-minute cities,” which people have falsely claimed are designed to confine residents to their neighborhoods. Yann Zopf, a World Economic Forum spokesperson, also said in a statement that the aforementioned claims about Agenda 2030 are false.

                Social posts revive false claim about Haley’s name
              

            CLAIM: Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley “changed” her name for political reasons.

            THE FACTS: The former United Nations ambassador has long used her legal middle name, Nikki. She was given the name Nimarata Nikki Randhawa at birth. Haley is her married name. Haley announced her run for president last week, making the former South Carolina governor the first major challenger to former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. In the days following her announcement, social media users amplified a long-circulating falsehood that Haley changed her name in order to appeal to Republican voters. Other posts claimed that Nimarata Randhawa was her “real name,” suggesting Nikki Haley was not. But while Haley’s legal first name is indeed Nimarata, sometimes spelled as Nimrata, her middle name is Nikki — a name that her family called her growing up and that means “little one” in Punjabi, as the AP has reported. Haley’s campaign told the AP in a statement that “Amb. Haley has gone by her middle name Nikki since she was born.” Haley herself addressed claims about her name in a 2018 tweet, writing: “Nikki is my name on my birth certificate. I married a Haley. I was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa and married Michael Haley.” There are records showing that Haley used her middle name long before she entered politics in 2004, when she was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. The Times and Democrat, a local newspaper in South Carolina, reported in September 1984 that “Nikki Randhawa” would play a role in a local production of the musical “Li’l Abner.” The newspaper again identified her using the same name nearly a decade later, in an October 1995 photo spread reporting on her family’s clothing business. Haley and her husband, W. Michael Haley, married the following year, in 1996. In 2003, Haley was identified as “Nikki Randhawa-Haley” while serving on the board of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina, an archived page shows.

                Soros did not endorse DeSantis in 2024 presidential race
              

            CLAIM: George Soros endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election.

            THE FACTS: During a keynote address ahead of last week’s Munich Security Conference, Soros said he hopes for a scenario in which DeSantis runs for and wins the Republican nomination so that former President Donald Trump will run as a third-party candidate, paving the way for “a Democratic landslide.” He did not express personal support for DeSantis as a political candidate. “My hope for 2024 is that Trump and Governor DeSantis of Florida will slug it out for the Republican nomination,” Soros says in the clip. “Trump has turned into a pitiful figure, continually bemoaning his loss in 2020. Big Republican donors are abandoning him in droves. DeSantis is shrewd, ruthless and ambitious. He’s likely to be the Republican candidate.” Posts on Twitter claiming Soros had “endorsed” DeSantis, some of which were shared by prominent Republicans, garnered tens of thousands of likes and shares. But the full version of Soros’ address, which he gave Feb. 16 as part of a speaker series at the Technical University of Munich, makes clear that Soros only hopes DeSantis will be the Republican nominee so that Democrats will have a clear path to victory. After predicting that DeSantis will win the nomination in the clip that was shared widely on social media, the full video shows Soros saying: “This could induce Trump, whose narcissism has turned into a disease, to run as a third-party candidate. That would lead to a Democratic landslide and force the Republican Party to reform itself. But perhaps I may be just a little bit biased.” Laura Silber, a spokesperson for Soros' Open Society Foundations, told the AP that claims alleging Soros endorsed DeSantis are not true. “Mr. Soros predicted that Gov. DeSantis ‘is likely to be the Republican candidate’ for president in 2024 — a prediction, not an endorsement,” she wrote in an email.

                Vinyl chloride draft report didn’t omit info on cancer, children
              

            CLAIM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed information from its toxicological profile for vinyl chloride about how dangerous the gas is in regards to children, drinking water and cancer.

            THE FACTS: While a new toxicological profile released as a draft this month has been reformatted from the prior version, it does not omit such information nor downplay the dangers of vinyl chloride. In the weeks following the Feb. 3 freight train derailment in Ohio that prompted officials to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, a variety of conspiratorial claims about a government document on the gas have spread online. The prior vinyl chloride toxicological profile was released in 2006, and the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry released a draft of an updated edition in February, which some baselessly asserted was suspicious timing. Others went a step further to claim that the new version leaves out unspecified information about how the gas, which is used to make plastic products, impacts children, drinking water and cancer. But a comparison of the new draft with the 2006 version shows that while the new report has been significantly reformatted – with some chapters and subsections changed — both documents contain the same information about children, drinking water and cancer, even if not in the same places. Experts who reviewed the two reports concurred. “It’s just in a different format,” said Stephen Roberts, professor emeritus with the University of Florida and former director of the Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology. “There’s plenty of information in that profile about how dangerous vinyl chloride is. I don’t think that it plays down that aspect at all.” For instance, the new draft omits a two-paragraph subsection titled “How Can Vinyl Chloride Affect Children?” But the new draft doesn’t leave out critical research concerning the dangers of vinyl chloride, and discussion of children’s susceptibility to the toxic effects of vinyl chloride are discussed at length elsewhere in the new draft. Both the new draft and the older version feature subsections devoted to vinyl chloride’s association with cancer, as well as references to the potential for children to be exposed to vinyl chloride through drinking water. “All the information is still in there,” said Michael Kleinman, an adjunct professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of California, Irvine. “They haven’t really changed the final conclusions.” The new draft updates the 2006 version with the latest information published in scientific literature, Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, wrote in an email to the AP. Nordlund said the agency has been working on the update to the vinyl chloride report over the past year and made it available for public comment on Feb. 9, 2023. The process is “not related to the emergent situation in East Palestine,” she wrote.

                Photos, videos of dead birds are unrelated to Ohio derailment
              

            CLAIM: A photo shows birds that “dropped dead” in Kentucky following the Ohio train derailment, and a video shows birds in northern Indiana that also died from the hazardous chemicals released after the derailment.

            THE FACTS: The photo, which shows several birds lying dead on a road, was taken in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 2018 and published in an article by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The video misrepresents a clip of dead birds near New Carlisle, Indiana. Social media posts sharing photos and videos of dead birds in states beyond Ohio are spreading with false claims that the deaths are related to the recent burning of toxic chemicals following the Ohio derailment. A Facebook user shared the photo supposedly showing birds in Kentucky, falsely claiming the incident was related. A reverse image search shows that the photo was featured in an article published by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on April 9, 2018. The photo’s caption states that several dead birds were found near an intersection in downtown Little Rock that month. A local ornithologist told the paper that the birds likely ate fermented berries, which can intoxicate them, causing them to fall and die. Meanwhile, the widely shared video shows a flock of birds hanging side-by-side on a power line upside down, some with their beaks open. More birds can be seen lying on the ground. But the original video appeared on Facebook nearly two weeks before the derailment, making it impossible for the two incidents to be related. Shelly Lister Struss, a resident of Buchanan, Michigan, posted the video on Jan. 22. She confirmed to the AP that she was the one who filmed it, about 2 miles (3 kilometers) outside of the center of New Carlisle, Indiana. While the death of these birds was not due to the derailment, experts were uncertain of the precise cause. Marty Benson, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, told the AP that although the DNR “has not been on the site of this incident,” it is possible the birds “suffered electrocution from a power surge on the line.” Michael Bianski, a spokesperson for Indiana Michigan Power Co., said that a more plausible explanation is a phenomenon called conductor, or line, gallop — the sudden, rapid movement of power lines caused by wind gusts. “This can kill birds perched on power lines as whiplash from the motion can break their necks,” he wrote in an email to the AP.

Haley announced her run for president last week, making the former South Carolina governor the first major challenger to former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. In the days following her announcement, social media users amplified a long-circulating falsehood that Haley changed her name in order to appeal to Republican voters. Other posts claimed that Nimarata Randhawa was her “real name,” suggesting Nikki Haley was not. But while Haley’s legal first name is indeed Nimarata, sometimes spelled as Nimrata, her middle name is Nikki — a name that her family called her growing up and that means “little one” in Punjabi, as the AP has reported. Haley’s campaign told the AP in a statement that “Amb. Haley has gone by her middle name Nikki since she was born.” Haley herself addressed claims about her name in a 2018 tweet, writing: “Nikki is my name on my birth certificate. I married a Haley. I was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa and married Michael Haley.” There are records showing that Haley used her middle name long before she entered politics in 2004, when she was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. The Times and Democrat, a local newspaper in South Carolina, reported in September 1984 that “Nikki Randhawa” would play a role in a local production of the musical “Li’l Abner.” The newspaper again identified her using the same name nearly a decade later, in an October 1995 photo spread reporting on her family’s clothing business. Haley and her husband, W. Michael Haley, married the following year, in 1996. In 2003, Haley was identified as “Nikki Randhawa-Haley” while serving on the board of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina, an archived page shows.— Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in Philadelphia contributed this report.___Soros did not endorse DeSantis in 2024 presidential raceCLAIM: George Soros endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election.THE FACTS: During a keynote address ahead of last week’s Munich Security Conference, Soros said he hopes for a scenario in which DeSantis runs for and wins the Republican nomination so that former President Donald Trump will run as a third-party candidate, paving the way for “a Democratic landslide.” He did not express personal support for DeSantis as a political candidate. “My hope for 2024 is that Trump and Governor DeSantis of Florida will slug it out for the Republican nomination,” Soros says in the clip. “Trump has turned into a pitiful figure, continually bemoaning his loss in 2020. Big Republican donors are abandoning him in droves. DeSantis is shrewd, ruthless and ambitious. He’s likely to be the Republican candidate.” Posts on Twitter claiming Soros had “endorsed” DeSantis, some of which were shared by prominent Republicans, garnered tens of thousands of likes and shares. But the full version of Soros’ address, which he gave Feb. 16 as part of a speaker series at the Technical University of Munich, makes clear that Soros only hopes DeSantis will be the Republican nominee so that Democrats will have a clear path to victory. After predicting that DeSantis will win the nomination in the clip that was shared widely on social media, the full video shows Soros saying: “This could induce Trump, whose narcissism has turned into a disease, to run as a third-party candidate. That would lead to a Democratic landslide and force the Republican Party to reform itself. But perhaps I may be just a little bit biased.” Laura Silber, a spokesperson for Soros' Open Society Foundations, told the AP that claims alleging Soros endorsed DeSantis are not true. “Mr. Soros predicted that Gov. DeSantis ‘is likely to be the Republican candidate’ for president in 2024 — a prediction, not an endorsement,” she wrote in an email.— Melissa Goldin___Vinyl chloride draft report didn’t omit info on cancer, childrenCLAIM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed information from its toxicological profile for vinyl chloride about how dangerous the gas is in regards to children, drinking water and cancer.THE FACTS: While a new toxicological profile released as a draft this month has been reformatted from the prior version, it does not omit such information nor downplay the dangers of vinyl chloride. In the weeks following the Feb. 3 freight train derailment in Ohio that prompted officials to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, a variety of conspiratorial claims about a government document on the gas have spread online. The prior vinyl chloride toxicological profile was released in 2006, and the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry released a draft of an updated edition in February, which some baselessly asserted was suspicious timing. Others went a step further to claim that the new version leaves out unspecified information about how the gas, which is used to make plastic products, impacts children, drinking water and cancer. But a comparison of the new draft with the 2006 version shows that while the new report has been significantly reformatted – with some chapters and subsections changed — both documents contain the same information about children, drinking water and cancer, even if not in the same places. Experts who reviewed the two reports concurred. “It’s just in a different format,” said Stephen Roberts, professor emeritus with the University of Florida and former director of the Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology. “There’s plenty of information in that profile about how dangerous vinyl chloride is. I don’t think that it plays down that aspect at all.” For instance, the new draft omits a two-paragraph subsection titled “How Can Vinyl Chloride Affect Children?” But the new draft doesn’t leave out critical research concerning the dangers of vinyl chloride, and discussion of children’s susceptibility to the toxic effects of vinyl chloride are discussed at length elsewhere in the new draft. Both the new draft and the older version feature subsections devoted to vinyl chloride’s association with cancer, as well as references to the potential for children to be exposed to vinyl chloride through drinking water. “All the information is still in there,” said Michael Kleinman, an adjunct professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of California, Irvine. “They haven’t really changed the final conclusions.” The new draft updates the 2006 version with the latest information published in scientific literature, Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, wrote in an email to the AP. Nordlund said the agency has been working on the update to the vinyl chloride report over the past year and made it available for public comment on Feb. 9, 2023. The process is “not related to the emergent situation in East Palestine,” she wrote.— Associated Press writer Josh Kelety in Phoenix contributed this report.___Photos, videos of dead birds are unrelated to Ohio derailmentCLAIM: A photo shows birds that “dropped dead” in Kentucky following the Ohio train derailment, and a video shows birds in northern Indiana that also died from the hazardous chemicals released after the derailment.THE FACTS: The photo, which shows several birds lying dead on a road, was taken in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 2018 and published in an article by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The video misrepresents a clip of dead birds near New Carlisle, Indiana. Social media posts sharing photos and videos of dead birds in states beyond Ohio are spreading with false claims that the deaths are related to the recent burning of toxic chemicals following the Ohio derailment. A Facebook user shared the photo supposedly showing birds in Kentucky, falsely claiming the incident was related. A reverse image search shows that the photo was featured in an article published by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on April 9, 2018. The photo’s caption states that several dead birds were found near an intersection in downtown Little Rock that month. A local ornithologist told the paper that the birds likely ate fermented berries, which can intoxicate them, causing them to fall and die. Meanwhile, the widely shared video shows a flock of birds hanging side-by-side on a power line upside down, some with their beaks open. More birds can be seen lying on the ground. But the original video appeared on Facebook nearly two weeks before the derailment, making it impossible for the two incidents to be related. Shelly Lister Struss, a resident of Buchanan, Michigan, posted the video on Jan. 22. She confirmed to the AP that she was the one who filmed it, about 2 miles (3 kilometers) outside of the center of New Carlisle, Indiana. While the death of these birds was not due to the derailment, experts were uncertain of the precise cause. Marty Benson, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, told the AP that although the DNR “has not been on the site of this incident,” it is possible the birds “suffered electrocution from a power surge on the line.” Michael Bianski, a spokesperson for Indiana Michigan Power Co., said that a more plausible explanation is a phenomenon called conductor, or line, gallop — the sudden, rapid movement of power lines caused by wind gusts. “This can kill birds perched on power lines as whiplash from the motion can break their necks,” he wrote in an email to the AP.— Associated Press writers Karena Phan in Los Angeles and Ali Swenson and Melissa Goldin in New York contributed to this report.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2023/02/24,,World

The two countries were among 39 UN member states not to endorse a resolution calling for ""just and lasting"" peace.The countries that abstained or voted against the vote were all in Africa, Latin America or Central Asia — where Russia has had increasing influence in recent years.Earlier on Friday, China presented a 12-point peace plan to resolve the war through political means. Ukraine's allies, including NATO and the EU, expressed hesitancy and called out Beijing for its ""no limits partnership"" with Moscow.""China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,'' Zelenskyy said.""But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to,"" he added.The Ukrainian leader said there were points in China's paper that he agreed with ""and there are those that we don't.""""But it's something,"" he added.fb/sms (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820974,Penguin will also publish Roald Dahl originals after spat,"Publisher Puffin UK announced on Friday that it would publish original Roald Dahl texts unedited under its adult Penguin logo, following a week of criticism over edits it had made to the 20th-century author's children's books.""By making both Puffin and Penguin versions available, we are offering readers the choice to decide how they experience Roald Dahl's magical, marvelous stories,"" Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin Random House Children's, said.The originals would be dubbed the ""Roald Dahl Classic Collection"" and published individually, Penguin said. The Welsh-born author with Norwegian parents, whose first big hit was published in 1961, has sold more than 250 million copies worldwide and inspired numerous TV and film adaptations.Renowned author Salman Rushdie, the PEN writers' organization, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and even Queen Consort Camilla had appeared to be among those weighing in on softening Dahl's choice of wording in recent days.Passages relating to weight, mental health, gender and race were altered in several books such as the 1964 release ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""In that, for instance, Augustus Gloop — ""the great big greedy nincompoop"" and chocolate-addicted young boy — was described not as ""enormously fat,"" but instead as ""enormous."" The Oompa-Loompas singing that nincompoop line are now gender neutral, as the ""Cloud-Men"" in ""James and the Giant Peach"" are now ""Cloud-People.""Another descriptor removed was ""ugly;"" Mrs. Twit in ""The Twits"" is now ""beastly.""In a 1983 book, ""The Witches,"" a supernatural woman posing as an ordinary person is said to adopt an appearance that could make her pass for a ""top scientist or running a business,"" rather than a ""cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman.""The alterations come soon after the rights to Dahl's stories were sold to Netflix, with a view to making modern-era renditions of books already tackled by film directors like Steven Spielberg (The BFG) and Tim Burton (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).Although it's not part of his children's fiction, Dahl was also known for antisemitic comments made in later life, first in an interview and then a published article soon before his death in which he said he had ""become an anti-Semite."" The Roald Dahl Story Company apologized for this past in 2020, three decades after his death.British author Salman Rushdie, who lived in hiding for years because of an Iranian fatwa calling for his death over the 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses,"" said Dahl had been a ""self confessed anti-Semite, with pronounced racist leanings, and he joined in the attack on me back in 1989.""Nevertheless, Rushdie wrote on Twitter: ""Roald Dahl was no angel but this is absurd censorship. Puffin Books and the Dahl estate should be ashamed.""British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the books should not be ""airbrushed,"" and Queen Consort Camilla even appeared to obliquely comment on the controversy, telling members of her online book club to ""please remain true to your calling, unimpeded by those who may wish to curb the freedom of your expression or impose limits on your imagination.""A spokeswoman for the French publishers of Dahl's work, Gallimard, told the AFP news agency that ""this rewrite only concerns Britain.""""We have never changed Roald Dahl's writings before, and we had no plans to do so today,"" she said.""We've listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl's books and the very real questions around how stories from another era can be kept relevant for each new generation,"" Francesca Dow of Penguin Random House Children's said on Friday, but added:""As a children's publisher, our role is to share the magic of stories with children with the greatest thought and care. Roald Dahl's fantastic books are often the first stories young children will read independently, and taking care for the imaginations and fast-developing minds of young readers is both a privilege and a responsibility.""Born in 1916, Dahl had fought in World War II as a fighter ace, then worked as a diplomat and intelligence officer after being invalided out of combat. He had lived through post-war rationing in the UK, including with small children, and he lost a young daughter to measles around the most prolific point of his writing career in the 1960s.His stories often reflected these challenges and these conditions, and he would frequently tap into emotions like fear and sadness to connect with children in his texts.Many child protagonists in his stories suffer under cruel foster carers or distant relatives (James and his aunts) or live in extreme poverty (Charlie with his loving family) or are orphans (Sophie in the BFG) or are fighting for survival (Fantastic Mr. Fox and his family).The entire premise of one book, ""George's Marvelous Medicine"" — which admittedly starts with a ""don't try this at home, kids"" disclaimer — is George getting revenge on his wicked grandmother by concocting a cocktail using whatever he can find around the house to create a probably poisonous substitute for her medicine.And in the BFG, for several chapters the only clue readers have that young Sophie being kidnapped is not going to end up with her being eaten by her giant captor is the title of the book.The word ""Dahlesque"" is even in the Oxford English Dictionary, whose definition specifically notes ""his children's works featuring eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and dark humor.""This use of more macabre images, usually with happy endings if you stayed the course, was also noted by some critics.Laura Hackett, deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times newspaper, had called the changes ""botched surgery"" and said she would hold on to her original copies so her children could ""enjoy them in their full, nasty, colorful glory.""msh/sms (AFP, AP)",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820975,US levies fresh sanctions against Russia as EU demurs,"The US announced Friday it was sanctioning hundreds of Russian firms, banks, manufacturers and individuals, specifically targeting entities that helped Russia evade sanctions on the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The metals and mining sector in Russia along with arms dealers, technology enterprises and weapons manufacturers are specifically targeted with those helping being located in countries ranging from the United Arab Emirates to Switzerland.A dozen financial institutions, including Russia's largest non-state public bank, importers of microelectronics and producers of carbon fiber, a key component in defense systems, were all hit with sanctions.Thirty individuals are facing penalties for alleged ties to Russia's sanctions evasion efforts. Among them are Swiss-Italian businessman Walter Moretti and his businesses, Nurmurad Kurbanov, a Russian-Turkmen arms dealer who is alleged to have represented Russian and Belarusian defense firms abroad, and Russian businessman Aleksandr Yevgenyevich Udodov who is the former brother-in-law of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.The US State Department followed on with sanctions against more than 60 senior Russian government officials, including Cabinet ministers and regional leaders, as well as three state enterprises responsible for running Russia's nuclear weapons program.Visa restrictions were also imposed on more than 1,200 members of the Russian military. Olga Skabeyeva, a leading state television propagandist, and Oleg Romanenko, who was put in charge of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant after Russia seized it were also placed on the sanctions list.In a statement, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, ""Our sanctions have had both short-term and long-term impact, seen acutely in Russia's struggle to replenish its weapons and in its isolated economy.""""Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Yellen added.She noted the action was being taken alongside G7 partners with the intention of standing with Ukraine ""for as long as it takes.""Her comments come as she attends a two-day G20 finance ministers meeting in Bengaluru, India.She told Russian officials at meetings Friday that ""their continued work for the Kremlin makes them complicit in Putin's atrocities.""Yellen added, ""They bear responsibility for the lives and livelihoods being taken in Ukraine and the harm caused globally.""The US Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative are also expected to turn up the pressure on Russia Friday to mark the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also suspended Russia's membership Friday.Bruno Le Marie, the French Finance Minister, said at a G20 press conference said that ""our sanctions are strong, they are efficient, they are hitting and reducing all revenues of Russia.""""They are disorganizing Russian industry, undermining war efforts,"" he added.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki criticized the latest proposed EU sanctions as ""too soft, too weak"" while on a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to mark one year since the full-on invasion began.In Kyiv, Morawiecki said, ""We propose that additional people be included.""Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda echoed his concerns.""I always expected stronger sanctions,"" he said. He told reporters he expected the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom to be targeted.Poland is seeking a ban on the importation of the synthetic rubber that is used to make tires from Russia, AFP reported citing diplomatic sources. Italy seeks a lengthy transition period to give its manufacturers more time to find new suppliers.The resulting disagreement has delayed a deal on what Brussels insiders describe as a still very substantial sanctions package, according to AFP.ar/sms (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/24,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820976,China's plan for peace in Ukraine thin on solutions,"During last week's Munich Security Conference (MSC), senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi announced Beijing's peace plan to resolve the war in Ukraine through political means.In a 12-point statement released on Friday morning, the peace initiative includes criticism of unilateral sanctions, calls to resume peace talks and reduce strategic risks associated with nuclear weapons.For a long time, China has been reluctant to take an active role in the conflict, presenting itself as a neutral power and ignoring calls to put pressure on Russia. It is understandable since China is one of the main beneficiaries of the sanctions against Russia. Due to Russia's international isolation, China has gained strong leverage over Russian energy supplies and their prices. In 2022, Chinese exports to Russia increased by 12.8% while imports, including natural resources, grew 43.4%.Nevertheless, the negative impacts of the war are slowly outweighing the short-term gains. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged that China was considering providing Russia with lethal arms. The alleged support to Russia has resulted in tighter export controls and restrictions on investments from the West.Suggestions that what is occurring in Ukraine could be repeated by China with regards to Taiwan is an enduring concern in the West, affecting relations with the US and EU, Beijing's largest trading partners.""Russia has done Beijing very few favors by waking the world up to this threat before Beijing was ever ready to undertake a potential invasion of Taiwan,"" Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on Indo-Pacific defense policy, told DW.Until the release of China's 12-point proposal on the first anniversary of the start of the war, the details of the plan have been kept secret, even from Ukraine and Russia. Wang Yi introduced the key points to the Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Munich. However, neither Kuleba nor the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy saw the text of the proposal.After the conference in Munich, Wang Yi visited Russia and met several top-ranking officials, as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although Wang Yi was in Russia only two days before the release, Moscow reported that there were no talks about the so-called ""Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis.""In the peace initiative, the main focus was on sovereignty and territorial integrity. However, China does not specify how this issue, fundamental to both Russia and Ukraine, should be addressed.""China pays lip service to territorial integrity, but hasn't called on Russia to stop its illegal war of conquest and withdraw its troops,"" Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, told DW.Contrary to many expectations, the plan also did not call to halt arms supplies to Ukraine.The paper highlights dialogue and negotiations as the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis. Currently, the talks between Russia and Ukraine have been reduced to the exchange of prisoners and rare informal contacts.""To be successful, peace mediation needs the willingness of conflicting parties,"" Artyom Lukin, associate professor at Far Eastern Federal University, told DW.""However, there are now few signs that Moscow and Kyiv are interested in reaching a compromise. Moscow is still determined to get hold of the entire Donetsk and Lugansk regions while retaining control over the areas of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions that were taken by Russian forces in 2022. Kyiv sounds determined to push Russia out of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson and perhaps going after Crimea next. It's hard to see how Russia's and Ukraine's positions could be bridged at the moment,"" Lukin said.China's role as a mediator in the conflict seems dubious since it appears not an impartial actor. Over the past year, Beijing has intensified political, military, and economic ties with Moscow. In the 12-point proposal, China once again opposes ""unilateral sanctions unauthorized by the UN Security Council.""Zelenskyy has repeatedly sought to make contact with Chinese President Xi Jinping since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. At the same time, Xi has not met or called the Ukrainian president even once despite regular contact with Putin.""It is foolish to believe that a party that is on the side of one player, namely China on the side of Russia, could play the role of the mediator. The same way Europe couldn't be a mediator because it is firmly on the side of Kyiv,"" Benner from the Global Public Policy Institute explained.China's proposal for peace, to a large extent, looks like a declaration of principles rather than a practical solution.""What struck me, in particular, is the fact that there are no proposals to incentivize or leverage Moscow to change its behavior,"" Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told DW. ""There is no pressure and there is no offer that might benefit Russia should it comply. Just on the language of the statement, it's unclear why there will be incentive for Russia and unclear why there is an incentive for Ukraine if there is no rationale for Russia to stop the invasion in the first instance.""""I think China is doing it solely for public relations reasons,"" Benner continued. ""This so-called peace plan and talking about itself as a mediator is mostly a rhetorical tool that Beijing uses, in the effort to mend fences with Europe and improve relations with the rest of the world, as well as to support the message that the United States is the culprit for the war and that China is actually a force for peace.""Every Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820980,Turkey starts work to build homes in 2 earthquake-hit towns,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish authorities on Friday said preliminary work has started to build housing for people left homeless by the massive earthquake that hit parts of the country and neighboring Syria, killing tens of thousands.

            Murat Kurum, the minister for the environment, urbanization and climate change, said on Twitter that excavations were taking place in the towns of Nurdagi and Islahiye in Gaziantep province, where the government plans to build an initial 855 homes.

            The work comes less than three weeks after the magnitude 7.8 quake struck, killing more than 47,000 people in Turkey and Syria — the vast majority in Turkey. Turkish authorities say some 173,000 buildings, containing around 534,000 apartments or other units, either collapsed or were severely damaged in the Feb. 6 quake and other strong tremors likely linked to it.











            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faces tough elections in either May or June, has promised to reconstruct homes within the year, although critics have warned that moving too fast could just lead to the erection of more sub-standard homes.

            Opposition parties have also held Erdogan’s government — in power for the past two decades — responsible for the extent of the disaster, accusing it of failing to enforce building regulations.

            Experts say many of the toppled structures were built with inferior materials and methods, and often did not comply with government standards.

            On Friday, the United Nations Children’s Fund said more than a million people were staying in temporary accommodation, including gyms, stadiums, hotel and dormitories, with limited access to essential services.

            “The children and families who survived the earthquake now face homelessness, lack of food and water, and temperatures that regularly drop below freezing at night,” said Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia.

            Kurum, the urbanization minister, posted a video of excavators clearing terrain. 

            “All our effort is (geared toward) bringing homes to our citizens as soon as possible,” he wrote. “We immediately got to work in areas where we have signed contracts and completed ground survey work.”

            Earlier on Friday, Erdogan issued a decree which among other things enables individuals, companies or organizations to build homes or offices and donate them to Kurum’s ministry which would then give them to people who lost homes or businesses. 

            Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said late Thursday that 583 contractors or other people suspected of responsibility over buildings that have collapsed were being investigated and 171 have been arrested.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish authorities on Friday said preliminary work has started to build housing for people left homeless by the massive earthquake that hit parts of the country and neighboring Syria, killing tens of thousands.Murat Kurum, the minister for the environment, urbanization and climate change, said on Twitter that excavations were taking place in the towns of Nurdagi and Islahiye in Gaziantep province, where the government plans to build an initial 855 homes.The work comes less than three weeks after the magnitude 7.8 quake struck, killing more than 47,000 people in Turkey and Syria — the vast majority in Turkey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820982,Almiron signs contract extension with Newcastle,"NEWCASTLE, England (AP) — Newcastle forward Miguel Almiron signed a 3 1/2-year contact extension with the Premier League club on Friday.

            The Paraguay international is Newcastle's top scorer this season with 10 goals — the first time he's hit double digits since joining from MLS club Atlanta United in January 2019.

            The 29-year-old Almiron recently made his 150th appearance for fifth-place Newcastle, which will face Manchester United in the English League Cup final on Sunday.











            The club didn't specify when the contract ends.

            Almiron's creativity hasn't always resulted in goals. He scored just once all of last season before bouncing back in a big way this campaign.

            “The truth is that I've worked really hard since I came to Newcastle to improve my level and to be where I am at the moment, and I also thank the staff and my teammates, who have helped me a lot during these four years,” Almiron said in the team's announcement.

            Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said Almiron is “a hugely important part of our squad on and off the pitch.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820984,Judge releases man in 1990 slayings of 2 Michigan hunters,"DETROIT (AP) — A man was released from a Michigan prison Friday after nearly 21 years, freed from a life sentence after state authorities acknowledged that an Ohio serial killer could have been the person who killed two deer hunters in 1990.

            “A state of shock,” Jeff Titus, 71, told The Associated Press moments after walking out of a prison in Coldwater. “Not having handcuffs on or prison blues. I can’t wait to get out and walk in the woods.”

            Titus emerged a few hours after a judge threw out his murder convictions under an agreement between the attorney general’s office and the Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school.











            Titus’ rights were violated at trial in 2002 when his lawyer never was informed that sheriff’s investigators in Kalamazoo County had gathered evidence years earlier against Thomas Dillon, the state's conviction integrity unit said.

            Local prosecutors at the time apparently didn’t know about Dillon, either. Attorney General Dana Nessel acknowledged it was “powerful evidence” that might have prevented Titus from being charged.

            Titus still could face a second trial, though David Moran of the Innocence Clinic suggested that was very unlikely.

            “We believe the case is over,” said Moran, who was present with law students and others when Titus was released.

            Prosecutor Jeff Getting agreed that the evidence was “absolutely powerful” but said he needed more time to decide what is ahead.

            Doug Estes and Jim Bennett were fatally shot near Titus’ rural property in 1990. Titus was cleared as a suspect — he had been hunting deer 27 miles (43 kilometers) away — but murder charges were filed against him 12 years later, after a new team of investigators had reopened the case.

            There was no physical evidence against Titus. Prosecutors portrayed him as a hothead who didn’t like trespassers. 

            In 2018, the Innocence Clinic went to federal court, arguing that Titus' constitutional rights were violated because his trial lawyer was never told about another police theory of how the victims were killed.

            Later, while that appeal was pending, Moran made a stunning discovery in dusty boxes at the sheriff's office: a 30-page file from the original investigation that had referred to an alternate suspect. It was Dillon, a Magnolia, Ohio, man who was never charged.

            Separately, Dillon was making headlines in Ohio with his arrest in 1993. He pleaded guilty to killing five people in that state who had been hunting, fishing or jogging, from 1989 to 1992. He died in 2011.

            The file revealed that a woman and her son, taken to Ohio by investigators, had identified Dillon as the man in a car in a ditch near the Michigan murder scene. The woman also described a car that resembled one owned by Dillon's wife.

            A man who had shared a jail cell with Dillon in 1993 told the FBI that Dillon had referred to killing two people in woods, according to the file.

            Moran said much credit belongs to Jacinda Davis and Susan Simpson. Davis, at the TV network Investigation Discovery, and Simpson, through the podcast “Undisclosed,” had raised doubts about Titus' guilt and questions about Dillon's possible role.

            Moran said their reporting inspired him to go to the sheriff's office where, after six hours, he found the file with “serial killer” written in pencil. Simpson, too, said she saw the file.

            “How that information was not part of the file that was provided to the prosecutor's office before charges were authorized and then the trial happened — I don't know whether or not we'll ever have a good answer,” Getting said.

            Davis and Simpson were at the prison when Titus was released Friday.

            “I've been talking to Jeff on a weekly basis for four years,” Davis said. “To finally meet him in person and give him a hug — you can't put that moment in words.”

            Simpson said her work has played a role in the release of five people from prison. “The next chapter is all theirs to write,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820988,US Navy applies lessons from costly shipbuilding mistakes,"BATH, Maine (AP) — The U.S. Navy appears to have learned from its costly lessons after cramming too much new technology onto warships and speeding them into production as it embarks on building new destroyers, which are the backbone of the fleet.

            Military officials say they’re slowing down the design and purchase of its next-generation destroyers to ensure new technology like powerful lasers and hypersonic missiles are mature before pressing ahead on construction. 

            The Navy has learned “sometimes the hard way, when we move too fast we make big mistakes,” said Adm. Michael Gilday, chief of naval operations.











            “Let’s be deliberate. Let’s not have our eyes become bigger than our stomach and get too far ahead of ourselves,” Gilday said last week at an event for defense industry officials in San Diego.

            The Navy wants to turn the page on recent shipbuilding blunders.

            Several newer combat ships designed for speed are being retired early after being beset by problems. A $13.3 billion aircraft carrier experienced added costs from new catapults that launch airplanes. Workers completed construction of a stealth destroyer before its advanced gun system, already installed, was scrapped.

            For the new ship, the Navy is reducing risk by conducting more land tests and borrowing the radar and targeting system from the latest destroyers that'll soon join the fleet, said Lt. Cmdr. Javan Rasnake, spokesman for the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition. 

            It’s also working with shipbuilders and designers to refine the ship’s blueprint, cost estimates, and workforce and supply forecasts, Rasnake said.

            The Navy still plans to field some new technologies on the destroyer. 

            Last week, it awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.2 billion contract for hypersonic missiles that travel at five times the speed of sound, and can be fired from destroyers. Last summer, it awarded the first design contract for the new ship outfitted with those missiles and lasers powerful enough to shoot down aircraft.

            Matt Caris, a defense analyst with Avascent, said it’s important that the Navy gets it right by balancing the best technology that’s reliable, affordable and attainable.

            “The Navy is trying to thread the needle with some potentially revolutionary capabilities in as low risk and evolutionary process as possible. This was a lesson learned by the Navy’s laundry list of shameful acquisition programs,” he said.

            Some worry about history repeating itself.

            There are new Navy leaders overseeing many programs and “it’s easy to imagine them making similar mistakes again with a new cast of characters,” said Loren Thompson from the Lexington Institute, a security think tank.

            The Navy is in the midst of juggling its priorities as it seeks not just a new destroyer but also a new attack submarine and a replacement for the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet.

            The Navy is in a difficult spot because the Biden administration is not interested in dramatically increasing the military budget, said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. Research and development alone would cost an extra $10 billion to $20 billion for the destroyer, submarine and jet, he said, representing a big chunk of the $220 billion Navy budget.

            A series of speedy, coast-hugging warships embodied shipbuilding mistakes that the Navy is trying to avoid. Critics said early versions were too lightly armored to survive combat. One version of the craft, known as a littoral combat ship, had propulsion problems. Some of the ships broke down and had to be towed. Plans for a submarine detection system were scrapped.

            Combined, the costs of the first ships in that program, the stealthy Zumwalt destroyer and Ford-class aircraft carrier grew by $6.8 billion in today's dollars, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

            “They’ve digested that lesson,” Clark said. “Part of what you’re seeing is a recognition that the underlying technologies are not ready yet. They don’t want to drive the program where the ship starts production before the technology is ready.”

            Gilday, who is the Navy's top officer, said the transition to the new destroyers will likely start in the “2032 time frame."" For now, top Navy leadership want to keep current production lines of destroyers humming until designs are ready.

            That means shipyards in Maine and Mississippi will continue making existing Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. They hold the Navy’s record for longest production run for large surface warships.

            At Maine’s Bath Iron Works, where the first Arleigh Burke was built starting in 1988, shipbuilders are happy to continue building the existing ships while new designs are tested out.

            Charles Krugh, shipyard president, said shipbuilders prefer the approach of taking extra time to make sure the technology and design are right.

            “If we get a fully designed ship, it’s obviously going to make us a whole lot more productive and efficient,” Krugh said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820999,South Africa upsets England to make T20 World Cup final,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South Africa upset England by six runs to reach its first Women's T20 World Cup final on Friday.

            Seamers Ayabonga Khaka and Shabnim Ismail shared seven wickets for the host team and kept a powerful English batting lineup at bay.

            South Africa will face two-time defending champion Australia in Sunday's final and has the chance of doing something the men's national team has never done — win a cricket World Cup, with the added bonus of it being on home soil.











            Khaka took three wickets in the 18th over and finished with 4-29, tearing through England's middle order in those six balls when they looked on course to successfully chase down South Africa's 164-4.

            Ismail had 3-27 and bowled the tense last over, when England still had a chance, needing 13 runs with captain Heather Knight at the wicket on 31 not out. Ismail's third ball of the over angled in at Knight, clipped her on the hip and knocked out her leg stump, effectively sealing it for South Africa.

            England needed to hit two sixes off the last two balls and managed only three more runs to finish on 158-8.

            “It was a great match,” South Africa captain Sune Luus said. “We were in and out of the game and it went in waves. We do have the best bowling in the world but it was against the best batting attack in the world. We kept saying . . . need to be brave and play free cricket.”

            South Africa's players celebrated their comeback, both in the game and in the tournament, by leaping on each other in a team huddle near the middle at Newlands. They surprisingly lost the World Cup opener to Sri Lanka and faced a must-win final group game against Bangladesh to reach the knockout stage.

            England felt more semifinal pain after its last-four game against India at the last World Cup was abandoned because of rain and India went through to the final because of a better record in the group stage.

            England has also lost three finals and its triumph in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2009 remains its last.

            “Gutted,"" England captain Knight said. “Brilliant game of cricket. We did well to take it close. The girls embraced it but it didn’t come off today.”

            South Africa opening batter Tazmin Brits also had a big impact on the game, making 68 from 55 balls and sharing a 96-run opening stand with Laura Wolvaardt (53 from 44), and a quick 46-run partnership with Marizanne Kapp, whose 27 not out from 13 balls led to a solid total.

            England's formidable batting started strongly as openers Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt plundered 53 from the first five overs. 

            Ismail removed Dunkley for 28 and then Alice Capsey for a duck, via a diving one-handed catch by Brits in the outfield. It was one of four catches for Brits.

            England powered on, though, with Nat Sciver-Brunt threatening to hit her team to victory until she holed out on the boundary for 40 from 34 balls, and to another one of Brits' catches.

            Khaka and Ismail then made sure of South Africa's victory.

            Australia is the strong favorite to win the final, having triumphed in five of the seven previous T20 World Cups. Sunday will be Australia's seventh consecutive final.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821000,Child sex abuse lawsuit window again gets Pa. lawmakers' OK,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Victims would be able to sue over otherwise outdated claims of child sexual abuse under two pieces of legislation passed Friday by the Pennsylvania House, but it's unclear whether the state Senate will take them up. 

            The legislation to temporarily waive the statute of limitations for sex abuse crimes had been on the verge of going before voters for the final OK two years ago, when state officials bungled the required advertising of the previous version.

            The House voted Friday 161-40 to send the Senate a constitutional amendment that, if senators go along with it, could go before voters for final approval as soon as November. Separately, they also voted 134-67 to make the change as regular legislation that would take effect immediately if passed by the Senate and signed by the governor.











            It was a major accomplishment for House Speaker Mark Rozzi, a Berks County Democrat elected to preside over the chamber early last month after both Republicans and Democrats could not muster enough support for their first choices, and for Rep. Jim Gregory, a Republican from Blair. Both Rozzi and Gregory have fought for the lawsuit window, and both have talked publicly about being abused as children.

            “I want to tell you that I am sorry and that I pray that you will have what you need to heal,"" Gregory said in remarks aimed at victims before the constitutional amendment vote. ""It should not have taken this long.”

            Political momentum to provide a way for those victims to sue was generated largely by a series of revelations regarding sexual abuse of children in the state by Roman Catholic clergy, but the proposed two-year window would apply to all victims who have not been able to sue under the narrow time limits formerly allowed by state law. 

            Rep. Tim Bonner, a Republican from Mercer and a former prosecutor who handled child molestation cases, said making the legislation retroactive was the right thing to do. He predicted it will be upheld by the courts against legal challenges.

            “Child molesters are like vampires: They just keep coming back to their victims time and time again,” Bonner said. “So many children, so much evil, so many nightmares.”

            It's unclear what will happen to the bills in the Senate, which voted Jan. 11 for the constitutional amendment in a bundle with two other Republican priorities: expanded voter ID requirements and a lower threshold to invalidate state regulations pushed through by a governor's administration. The three constitutional amendments passed the Senate on a nearly party-line vote.

            “It is time to bring closure to the conversation,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, a Republican from Indiana, said during that debate. He said that vote would “be the final time the Senate of Pennsylvania addresses this matter.”

            Rozzi, who has said he was molested by a now-deceased parish priest, said concerns about Senate inaction should not stop the House from passing the proposals.

            “If the Senate’s not going to take it up, we might as well stop half the business we do in the House,"" Rozzi told his colleagues.

            During the Friday debate, some Republicans expressed concern that one or both of the bills are vulnerable to legal challenges. Some focused on a procedural problem: Gregory was listed as a co-sponsor without his knowledge or consent. He stripped his sponsorship from the statute bill but not the constitutional amendment. Some were worried about the fairness and legality of changing the statute of limitations retroactively.

            And there were predictions that lawsuits against public schools will prove costly to taxpayers.

            “I want justice for the victims, but it’s got to fall on the people that committed these crimes,” said Rep. Eric Davanzo, a Republican from Westmoreland.

            Rep. Matt Bradford, a Democrat from Montgomery, brushed off the concerns.

            “We have a path to justice in front of us today. Delayed, yes, but justice today,” Bradford said. “The objections raised are meritless. The need for justice is real, it is upon us.”

            Rep. Napoleon Nelson, another Democrat from Montgomery, said if the courts throw out the legislation, ""then we'll bring it back.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821001,US Court strikes down charter boat tracking rule,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — An appeals court has struck down a federal fisheries management rule requiring operators of privately owned charter boats in the Gulf of Mexico to equip their vessels with tracking devices, a victory for a group of Louisiana and Florida charter operators who challenged the rule in a 2020 lawsuit. 

            Thursday's ruling by a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans reversed a lower court decision upholding the regulation, which had been developed to help regulators keep track of the amount of fish caught on recreational charter vessels.

            Rejecting government arguments, the panel said that tracking devices are not the type of equipment regulators can require on recreational vessels under a federal fishing regulation law passed by Congress — the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 











            And it said regulators, in adopting the rule, failed to adequately consider charter operators' concerns that the regulation may violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. While not ruling on the regulation's constitutionality, the opinion written by Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod said it “very likely violated the Fourth Amendment.”

            Charter operators have complained that the requirement imposed a costly, needless burden on charter operators. Lawyers for the operators say charter operations account for a tiny percentage of fishing done in the Gulf of Mexico.

            Along with Elrod, nominated to the court by President George W. Bush, the case was decided by judges Priscilla Richman, also a George W. Bush nominee; and Andrew Oldham, a nominee of President Donald Trump.

            “The rights of all charter boat fishing businesses in the Gulf of Mexico have been vindicated,"" John J. Vecchione, an attorney with the conservative New Civil Liberties Alliance, said in a news release. The organization had represented charter operators in the lawsuit. 

            Federal fisheries officials declined immediate comment.

(AP) — Miami was placed on probation for one year on Friday after the school and the NCAA said women's basketball coaches inadvertently helped arrange impermissible contact between a booster and two players who signed with the Hurricanes.

            It's first time the NCAA has announced a penalty related to an investigation into name, image and likeness deals — NIL, as they are called.

            The NCAA probed the actions of booster John Ruiz, who has signed several Miami athletes to NIL deals. Among them are women's basketball players Haley and Hanna Cavinder, who transferred to Miami after meeting with Ruiz — though the Cavinders told the NCAA the meeting had nothing to do with their decision to play for the Hurricanes.











            The NCAA and Miami worked through a “negotiated resolution"" to end the saga, but the NCAA wanted the Hurricanes to agree to more sanctions than what were ultimately handed down — saying it was “troubled” by “the absence of a disassociation of the involved booster.” The NCAA said the violation stemmed from Miami coach Katie Meier having helped facilitate a meeting between the Cavinders and Ruiz, unaware that he was a booster.

            “Boosters are involved with prospects and student-athletes in ways the NCAA membership has never seen or encountered,” the NCAA said. “In that way, addressing impermissible booster conduct is critical, and the disassociation penalty presents an effective penalty available to the (committee on infractions).”

            Meier will not have to miss any more games; she served a three-game suspension to start the season in anticipation of the NCAA's ruling.

            The NCAA never named Ruiz in its ruling Friday, but referenced an April 13 tweet posted by a booster that included a photo of him and two recruits. On that date, Ruiz posted a photo of himself with the Cavinder twins after a dinner at his home.

            “These girls decided where to go, no one else did it for them,"" Ruiz tweeted Friday.

            The Cavinders, who have an enormous social media following and several NIL deals, signed their letter of intent about a week after the dinner. They are not subject to any sanctions. Both are in their first season with the Hurricanes after transferring from Fresno State.

            “Although the parties asserted that a disassociation penalty would be inappropriate based on an impermissible meal and an impermissible contact, today’s new NIL-related environment represents a new day,"" the NCAA said.

            Meier said Friday in a statement distributed by the university that she has led programs “with integrity” and has been “a collaborative partner with the NCAA.”

            ""Collegiate athletics is in transformation, and any inadvertent mistake I made was prior to a full understanding of implemented guardrails and the clarification issued by the NCAA in May,” Meier said.

            The NCAA said it started an investigation in May, and interviewed Ruiz in June. But the NCAA cannot order Miami to disassociate itself from Ruiz based on a meeting that occurred before rules were changed last year.

            “The (committee on infractions) will strongly consider disassociation penalties in future cases involving NIL-adjacent conduct,"" the NCAA said.

            Miami agreed to various other minor sanctions, such as a small fine — $5,000, plus 1% of the women’s basketball budget, which the school does not release as a private institution — and a slight reduction in what’s allowed in recruiting.

            “The sanctions that we ultimately agreed to, to bring this to a close, are not (commensurate) with the violation or its intent,"" Miami said in a statement. “Coach Meier is an outstanding coach, role model, teacher ... and we stand fully behind her, her program and our ongoing departmental compliance efforts.”

            The Cavinders became stars of the NIL phenomenon as soon as it became an option for college athletes on July 1, 2021. Boost Mobile signed them immediately, touting that move with a giant advertisement in New York’s Times Square. Many other deals soon followed.

            Meier is Miami's all-time leader in women's basketball wins with 338, not including the three games the Hurricanes won without her this season — the NCAA says those cannot be included in her record. She is a past Associated Press coach of the year and a past USA Basketball coach of the year and is a member of the Miami Sports Hall of Fame and the Hall of Honor at Duke, her alma mater.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821005,Hawks' Young expresses 'love and respect' for fired McMillan,"ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young says he has “nothing but love and respect” for former Atlanta Hawks coach Nate McMillan and expects to have no input in the hiring of McMillan's replacement.

            Young spoke with reporters on Friday for the first time since McMillan was fired on Tuesday with the Hawks in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. Young was not available following Wednesday's practice and was excused from Thursday's practice for personal reasons.

            Young is preparing for his third full-time coach in five seasons. Asked if he is worried another change impacts the perception of his ability to maintain long relationships with coaches, Young said “People are going to say what they’ve got to say.











            “A lot of players have played for a lot of coaches. I don’t look at it like that. I’m not looking at the next coach who comes in here. I’m trying to win a championship, whatever it is, I’m just trying to win.”

            Young, a two-time All-Star, is Atlanta's on-court team leader as the starting point guard while also ranking as the team's top scorer with 26.7 points per game. He dismissed speculation he had a rocky relationship with McMillan.

            “There’s a lot of moments that people really don’t understand that me and him have had and that’s OK,” Young said after Friday morning's practice. “It will get brought up eventually. I know I don’t tell everybody everything. I kind of let y’all make up rumors about certain things about how I am and how my relationship is with certain people. I just play basketball.”

            Young said he has talked with McMillan since the firing and added “It’s not the last time he and I are going to talk.”

            Hawks general manager Landry Fields on Wednesday said speculation that McMillan was hampered by conflicts with Young were unfair to Young. Fields said McMillan's relationship with Young was not a factor in his decision to make a coaching change. 

            Fields said he already has launched his search for McMillan's full-time replacement and said former Utah coach Quin Snyder is a candidate.

            Young said “I don’t care to have any input” in the coaching search.

            “I trust those guys up top,” he said. “Since I’ve been here I’ve always said that. Nothing has changed for me.” 

            Fields said he believed it was time for a new voice on the Hawks bench and said “there was slippage” as the team lost four of six games before the All-Star break.

            Asked if he believes it was time for a new voice, Young said “That’s not up to me.”

            “I don’t know. I think that’s part of it. I think sometimes it’s not always going to be easy. Some conversations are not going to go great. That’s just part of it. Not every situation is easy and nice.” 

            Young participated in Friday's practice and is expected to start in Friday night's game against Cleveland as the Hawks (29-30) hope for a late-season surge under interim coach Joe Prunty.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821007,"The AP Interview: Biden ready to run, US first lady says","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — U.S. first lady Jill Biden gave one of the clearest indications yet that President Joe Biden will run for a second term, telling The Associated Press in an exclusive interview on Friday that there's “pretty much” nothing left to do but figure out the time and place for the announcement.

            Although Biden has long said that it's his intention to seek reelection, he has yet to make it official, and he's struggled to dispel questions about whether he's too old to continue serving as president. Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.

            “How many times does he have to say it for you to believe it?” the first lady said in Nairobi, the second and final stop of her five-day trip to Africa.











            She added, “He says he’s not done. He’s not finished what he’s started. And that’s what’s important.”

            Granddaughter Naomi Biden, who is on the trip, cheered the first lady's comments after the interview. 

            “Preach nana,” she said on Twitter. 

            The president himself was asked about his wife's comments just hours later in an interview with ABC News, and laughed when told of her remarks, adding, ""God love her. Look, I meant what I said, I’ve got other things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.”

            Biden aides have said an announcement is likely to come in April, after the first fundraising quarter ends, which is around the time that President Barack Obama officially launched his reelection campaign.

            The first lady has long been described as a key figure in Biden's orbit as he plans his future. 

            “Because I'm his wife,” she laughed.

            She brushed off the question about whether she has the deciding vote on whether the president runs for reelection. 

            “Of course he'll listen to me, because we're a married couple,"" she said. But, she added later, “he makes up his own mind, believe me.”

            The wide-ranging interview took place on the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Jill Biden recalled her trip into the country last May to meet the besieged country's first lady, Olena Zelenska.

            They visited a school that was being used to help migrants who fled the fighting. Some of the families, Jill Biden said, had hid underground for weeks before making their escape. 

            “We thought then, how long can this go on? And here we are, a year later,” she said. “And look at what the Ukrainian people have done. I mean, they are so strong and resilient, and they are fighting for their country.”

            “We're all hoping that this war is over soon, because we see, every day, the damage, the violence, the horror on our televisions,” the first lady added. “And we just can't believe it.”

            Jill Biden also spoke extensively for the first time about her skin cancer diagnosis, which led doctors to remove multiple basal cell lesions in January. 

            “I thought, oh, it’s just something on my eye, you know,"" she said. ""But then they said, no, we think it’s basal cell.”

            Then doctors checked her chest, she said, and they said “that's definitely basal cell.""

            “So I’m lucky,” the first lady said. ""Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I’m healthy.”

            
                Raising awareness about cancer screening has been a cornerstone of her advocacy efforts for years, even before her son, Beau, died from a brain tumor almost a decade ago. She often says the worst three words anyone can hear are “you have cancer.” 

            When it was her turn to hear a doctor say that, Jill Biden said, “it was a little harder than I thought.”

            Now, she said, she's “extra careful” about sunscreen, especially when she's at the beach, which she described as ""one of my favorite places in the world.""

            Jill Biden is the only first lady to continue her career in addition to her ceremonial duties, teaching writing and English to community college students. At 71 years old, she said she's not ready to think about retirement.

            “I know that I will know when it’s enough,"" she said. ""But it’s not yet.”

            She said she left detailed lesson plans for a substitute teacher while she was on her trip, and she's been texting with students as she was traveling. She plans to be back in the classroom at 8 a.m. on Tuesday morning, after arriving home from Africa around 3 a.m. Monday. 

            Education has been a flashpoint in American politics, especially with conservative activists and politicians trying to limit discussion of race and sexuality in classrooms.

            “I don't believe in banning books,” she said. 

            She added: “I think the teachers and the parents can work together and decide what the kids should be taught.”

            During the interview, Jill Biden reflected on the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter, who recently began home hospice care. The Carter Center, which the former president founded after leaving the White House, was key in helping to eliminate the Guinea worm parasite in African countries. 

            “That's the perfect example,” she said. “He's such a humble man. He didn't go out and shout, 'Look what I've done.' He just did the work.”

            Jill Biden recalled Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, reaching out on the eve of Joe Biden's inauguration two years ago. 

            “They called and said congratulations,"" she said. ""And it meant so much to me and to Joe.”

            She also talked about visiting the Carters at their home in Plains, Georgia, early in Biden's presidency.

            ""It’s not just that here are two presidents. It’s here are two friends,"" she said. ""Actually four friends, who have really supported one another over the years.”

""Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I’m healthy.”Raising awareness about cancer screening has been a cornerstone of her advocacy efforts for years, even before her son, Beau, died from a brain tumor almost a decade ago. She often says the worst three words anyone can hear are “you have cancer.”When it was her turn to hear a doctor say that, Jill Biden said, “it was a little harder than I thought.”Now, she said, she's “extra careful” about sunscreen, especially when she's at the beach, which she described as ""one of my favorite places in the world.""Jill Biden is the only first lady to continue her career in addition to her ceremonial duties, teaching writing and English to community college students. At 71 years old, she said she's not ready to think about retirement.“I know that I will know when it’s enough,"" she said. ""But it’s not yet.”She said she left detailed lesson plans for a substitute teacher while she was on her trip, and she's been texting with students as she was traveling. She plans to be back in the classroom at 8 a.m. on Tuesday morning, after arriving home from Africa around 3 a.m. Monday.Education has been a flashpoint in American politics, especially with conservative activists and politicians trying to limit discussion of race and sexuality in classrooms.“I don't believe in banning books,” she said.She added: “I think the teachers and the parents can work together and decide what the kids should be taught.”During the interview, Jill Biden reflected on the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter, who recently began home hospice care. The Carter Center, which the former president founded after leaving the White House, was key in helping to eliminate the Guinea worm parasite in African countries.“That's the perfect example,” she said. “He's such a humble man. He didn't go out and shout, 'Look what I've done.' He just did the work.”Jill Biden recalled Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, reaching out on the eve of Joe Biden's inauguration two years ago.“They called and said congratulations,"" she said. ""And it meant so much to me and to Joe.”She also talked about visiting the Carters at their home in Plains, Georgia, early in Biden's presidency.""It’s not just that here are two presidents. It’s here are two friends,"" she said. ""Actually four friends, who have really supported one another over the years.”___Associated Press writer Chris Megerian in Washington contributed to this report.___EDITOR'S NOTE — Darlene Superville has covered the White House and first ladies since 2009 and is co-author, with AP Executive Editor Julie Pace, of a 2022 biography of Jill Biden.",2023/02/25,,World

            The No. 119-ranked German began the day with a one-shot lead before his 3-under 69 at DLF Golf and Country Club in New Delhi.

            Paul made four birdies against one bogey to reach 10 under overall.











            India's Angad Cheema was in a four-way tie for second on 5 under overall with Marcel Siem of Germany, Gudmundur Kristjansson of Iceland, and Mikko Korhonen of Finland.

            Honey Baisoya of India and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands were six shots off the lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821009,'Party Down' returns 13 years after being canceled by Starz,"On screen, most of the characters in “ Party Down, ” a cringy comedy about catering staff in Los Angeles, hated their jobs. They could barely get through an event — passing appetizers and slinging drinks to Hollywood's elite — without someone on the staff doing something inappropriate, unsanitary or unprofessional, earning them meaningless demerits, poor reviews and an empty tip jar.

            The cast, including Adam Scott, Ken Marino and Jane Lynch, loved the experience of working together so much that 13 years after the show's cancellation, they would fit time into their schedules to return for a six-episode third season, debuting Friday on Starz. (The first two seasons are streaming on Hulu.)

            “It was just this little show and we didn’t know if anyone would see it, but we didn’t care,"" recalled Scott, who plays Henry Pollard, a retired actor-turned-bartender whose claim to fame is a one-liner in a beer ad (""Are we having fun yet?!"") that no one can forget. “We were making it for ourselves and for each other and just had so much fun.”











            At a time where reboots and revivals of TV shows and movies are all possible, the idea for more “Party Down” has floated for years. One of its creators, Rob Thomas, was an early pioneer of the trend. He launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2013 to raise money for a movie continuation of his other little show that could, “Veronica Mars.”

            In the case of “Party Down,” though, so much time had passed since the series ended that Marino began to accept it wasn't in the cards.

            “Anytime anybody asked me, I would say, ‘Yeah, I think something’s going to happen. I don’t want to jinx it, but I think something’s going to happen,’ said Marino, whose character Ron Donald strives for perfection and customer satisfaction as the team leader of Party Down. “I did that for about eight years and then finally I came to terms. I think I probably looked at myself in the mirror like, ‘It’s not going to happen, Ken.' As soon as I sort of let it go, it came. We got an email, ‘Hey, are you available at the beginning of January 2022 for six weeks,’ I couldn't believe it.'”

            Scott believes there's a sentimental attachment to the characters because 13 years ago they could all relate to their predicament. ""We had been chasing our dream in showbiz. Success was just beyond our reach and (we) kind of maybe grasped it once or twice, but it slipped out. It was just varying degrees of that same story and that same feeling.”

            As the actors themselves have gone on to achieve success and fame (Scott, for example, was nominated for an Emmy last year for “Severance""), the writers knew they couldn't pick up the story immediately where it left off, with the cast a decade older, all working at Party Down and still floundering. 

            “It’s no longer a show exclusively about young people hoping for their big break. It's now people who have lived a lot more life,” said John Enborn, showrunner and a co-executive producer. “We put a lot of creative energy into that space between what your dreams are and what your reality is.”

            Jennifer Garner, Zoë Chao and Tyrel Jackson Williams are new additions. One cast member who wasn't available to return is Lizzie Caplan, who played Casey, an aspiring actor/comedian who had no problem taking phone calls from her agent while on the job and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Scott's character, Henry. The actors say they would make more episodes to work with her again.

            “I know how much she wanted to be there,"" said Starr, who plays Roman DeBeers, an aspiring screenwriter with a chip on his shoulder whose passion is science fiction. ""I hope for a season four, if for no other reason than that we can all properly get back together as the group.”

            The hardest part of their reunion was also the best part — the actors had to deliver lines without laughing. Scott says he's learned to never look Marino in the eyes.

            “I have to look at either the spot between his eyes or just to the right or left of his eyes, because if I lock eyes with him, I will laugh and we will not finish the scene.""On screen, most of the characters in “ Party Down, ” a cringy comedy about catering staff in Los Angeles, hated their jobs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821010,"France captain Renard pulls out of World Cup, others follow","PARIS (AP) — France captain Wendie Renard says she will skip the Women's World Cup this year as she's unhappy with the team's set up and needs “to protect her mental health.”

            Renard is arguably France's greatest women's footballer. She has played 142 internationals, adding 34 goals. Renard has won 15 league titles and eight Champions League trophies with Lyon.

            Following Renard’s decision on Friday, striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto and forward Kadidiatou Diani also announced they were putting their international careers on hold.











            Although Renard stopped short of retiring, she said she no longer felt able to play for the national team.

            “I love France more than anything, I am not perfect, far from it, but I can no longer accept the current system which is far away from the demands required at the highest level,"" Renard wrote on her Instagram page.

            “It's a sad day but a necessary one to protect my mental health. It's with a heavy heart that, with this message, I inform you of my decision to take a step back from the France team. Unfortunately I won't play in the World Cup under these conditions.""

            Renard did not go further into detail, but there have been strong tensions in the France squad for years between the players and coach Corinne Diacre.

            After taking charge in 2017, Diacre stripped Renard of the captain's armband then gave it back to her in 2021.

            
                Katoto posted on Twitter, “I’ve taken the decision to put my international career aside until the necessary changes have been made.”

            
                Diani said on Twitter she will return to the national side only if significant changes are made.

            The French soccer players' union, known as UNFP, called the three players ""extremely brave"" for speaking out, and implored the French Football Federation to implement necessary changes.

            “This cry of alarm must serve as a catalyst, and push the parties concerned to consider the concrete consequences of how far we've fallen behind over the years,” the UNFP said in a statement. 

             The Women's World Cup is from July 20-Aug. 20 in Australia and New Zealand.

            “I said a prayer about 10 minutes before I found him,” Roy Link told Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis in a video the sheriff's office posted on Facebook.

            Some 500 volunteers and scores of law enforcement officers had searched for Joshua “JJ” Rowland since he was reported missing by his parents. Sheriff's officials said the boy left the home in Brooksville while one of his parents was asleep.

            Brooksville is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast.

            The boy was found in the woods a “good distance” from his house, Nienhuis said.

            “The good news is he did not end up in any water, obviously, and he was not abducted,” the sheriff said. “He was found in the woods. He seems to be fine. He’s definitely going to have something to tell his kids and grandkids about.""

            The sheriff said he was overwhelmed by the large number of volunteers who turned out to look for the child.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821013,"Milan fashion celebrates girl power at Gucci, Cormio, Tod's","MILAN (AP) — Designers highlighted female power on the third day of Milan Fashion Week, previewing collections for next fall and winter.

            At Cormio, it was girl power as exemplified by a youth soccer team who lent their field as the runway venue and halted practice to watch. At Andreadamo, the southern Italian designer challenged the myth of Eve as the bringer of original sin. And Gucci constructed a new female archetype during its interim, between creative directors phase.

            Highlights from runway shows on Friday, the third day of mostly womenswear collections:











            GUCCI DRAWS ON PAST AS IT LOOKS AHEAD

            The first post-Alessandro Michele and pre-Sabato De Sarno Gucci womenswear show left the fashion world in a state of suspended animation, wondering where the brand will ultimately go.

            The collection designed by the Gucci team — many of whom have worked for two decades at the house — drew on the heritage they have helped create. The notes cited Tom Ford’s sensual silhouette from the 1990s. There were even signs of Michele’s eccentric flourish, just months after he stepped down.

            But probably most significant at this moment of palette cleansing was a strong tide of Gucci basics, with a pragmatic streak. They included 1990s cut suits with broad shoulders and easy fit trousers or wide-cut jeans with men’s shirting, worn with an ample overcoat and accompanied by a big all-purpose handbag.

            Sheers otherwise dominated the runway, revealing Gucci-branded thongs and fishnet stockings in bright shades through the garments. The looks were for the bold and body-confident as they left little to the imagination. The Gucci team provided many ample furry coats to provide cover to one’s destination.

            Looks were finished with kitten heels, some with furry accents and rounded double-G heels.

            The Italian rock sensation Maneskin, which has frequently been dressed by Gucci, was on hand for the show. Celebrity guests also included actresses Halle Bailey, Julia Garner and Dakota Johnson and singers Beth Ditto and A$AP Rocky, who rocked a skirt. 

            BLACK CARPET AWARDS PROMOTE DIVERSITY

            The first-ever Black Carpet Awards recognized achievements of minorities in Italian society, with the goal of promoting greater diversity and inclusion. 

            Anna Wintour was among the front-row guests, along with the president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, Carlo Capasa. “I am here to support the community her in Milan and hopefully put more of a spotlight on the amazing work that they do,’’ Wintour said on arrival. 

            The awards were organized by Afro Fashion Week Milano founder Michelle Ngonmo and recognized leaders who promote inclusion, diversity and equity through culture, creativity, community, legacy and entrepreneurship, with separate awards in each category chosen by a jury and by a popular vote. 

            Ngonmo said after the ceremony that she felt the award were a sign that “we are starting in a concrete way to move the conversation forward.”

            SUNNEI CROWD SURFING 

            Models on the Sunnei runway did not have trust issues. They simply turned at the end of the raised runway, and fell backward into the crowd of fashionistas, crowd-surfing stadium-style. 

            Don’t expect designers Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina to stage a standard runway show, but rather looks for ways to immerse the crowd in the experience. The referred to the show as “catharsis … a process of purification.’’

            The runway turn, and fall, was enough to take in the looks, which the pair described as “the fruit of months of design and textile research.” 

            Crochet fur in bright colors may have been just enough to cushion any mishap. It appeared as fringe on coats, as eccentric hats, but most fetchingly in a fringy skirt, bandeau top and arm warmer combo. The designers themselves put their faith in the crowd, falling backward into it as a final bow. 

            JIL SANDER POPS MOTIFS

            Designers Luke and Lucie Meier helped get the frenetic fashion crowd into a receptive state for their latest Jil Sander collection with some calming music before their runway show.

            The collection spoke through silhouettes, opening with some leather looks in color blocks seemingly inspired by motorsports with the brand name heat printed in raised letters, and closing with hourglass shaped dresses and jackets. The pair turned out gracefully layered looks with tops, tunics over trousers, and offered seasonal motifs of cherries and wrapped peppermints, which appeared on garments as photo prints. Signature pendants finished the looks. 

            CORMIO PROMOTES GIRL POWER

            Designer Jezabelle Cormio presented a collection that mixes the girlie — ruffles, bows and ribbons — with the athletic, in the form of indoor pitch soccer shoes and soccer ball-shaped bags.

            All of the Cormio brand looks were easy to wear and move in, with manifold layering possibilities, underlining the Gen-Z staple of easy comfort and self-styling.

            Dresses stretched over the form. Knitwear with raised argyle pattern were layered prettily with super-cropped sweaters with ruffled draining. The star was the collection’s motif, seen on stretch dresses and pleated denim mini skirts worn with knee socks — caught somewhere between girlhood and the grownup world. 

            ANDREADAMO SPRINGS FROM ITALY'S SOUTH

            Andrea Adamo is here to say that someone from a small town in the southern Italian region of Calabria can make it on the Milan runway. Even if the fashion world kind of already knew that, from the Versaces.

            In that tradition, he presents power looks for his Andreadamo grand with grommets and leather, tulle and knitwear that swaddle the form.

            Tulle wrapped over knitwear, encasing it mummy like. Grommet-covered nude dresses finished with a mermaid flair. Andamo also puts volumes in big boots that engulf the knees or trailing pant hems.

            The motif of the season is a fig leaf. And a representative “Eve” closed the show in a nude bodysuit with appropriately placed metallic dig leaves. Original sin flouted.

            Adamo said the collection paid homage to his native city, Crotone, and its fragile mountainsides, represented in the earth tone colors. He dedicated it to his seamstress grandmother, who didn't get to see him make it to the big northern fashion city.

            Standing in front of his mood board and eyeing details on each model before the show, Adamo wiped away a tear in her memory.

            “This is a homage to my city to show that even from a small city in the south you can dream,'' he said.

            TOD’S WARMS UP FOR NEXT WINTER

            Fashion met art for Tod’s runway show for next fall and winter, set among the towering re-enforced concrete structures titled “The Seven Heavenly Palaces” by Anselm Kiefer.

            Outerwear is central to the latest collection by creative director Walter Chiapponi, from floor-sweeping parkas to cropped bombers.

            The clean lines in warm monotones put the emphasis on functionality and artisanal detailing: miniskirts were paired with ribbed knit shirts with leather detailing and a close-toe sling-back shoe while dresses cinched at the waist, mimicking a parka, and were worn with Teddy bear ballet flats in shearling. This is an urban wardrobe that translates easily into the office.

            Despite the early morning call, the runway show was a celeb-fueled affair, including an international array of actresses: Kathryn Newton from the U.S., Milly Alcock from Austrialia, Liu Shishi from China and Nana Eikura from Japan, as well as South Korean singer Joy.MILAN (AP) — Designers highlighted female power on the third day of Milan Fashion Week, previewing collections for next fall and winter.At Cormio, it was girl power as exemplified by a youth soccer team who lent their field as the runway venue and halted practice to watch. At Andreadamo, the southern Italian designer challenged the myth of Eve as the bringer of original sin. And Gucci constructed a new female archetype during its interim, between creative directors phase.Highlights from runway shows on Friday, the third day of mostly womenswear collections:GUCCI DRAWS ON PAST AS IT LOOKS AHEADThe first post-Alessandro Michele and pre-Sabato De Sarno Gucci womenswear show left the fashion world in a state of suspended animation, wondering where the brand will ultimately go.The collection designed by the Gucci team — many of whom have worked for two decades at the house — drew on the heritage they have helped create. The notes cited Tom Ford’s sensual silhouette from the 1990s. There were even signs of Michele’s eccentric flourish, just months after he stepped down.But probably most significant at this moment of palette cleansing was a strong tide of Gucci basics, with a pragmatic streak. They included 1990s cut suits with broad shoulders and easy fit trousers or wide-cut jeans with men’s shirting, worn with an ample overcoat and accompanied by a big all-purpose handbag.Sheers otherwise dominated the runway, revealing Gucci-branded thongs and fishnet stockings in bright shades through the garments. The looks were for the bold and body-confident as they left little to the imagination. The Gucci team provided many ample furry coats to provide cover to one’s destination.Looks were finished with kitten heels, some with furry accents and rounded double-G heels.The Italian rock sensation Maneskin, which has frequently been dressed by Gucci, was on hand for the show. Celebrity guests also included actresses Halle Bailey, Julia Garner and Dakota Johnson and singers Beth Ditto and A$AP Rocky, who rocked a skirt.BLACK CARPET AWARDS PROMOTE DIVERSITYThe first-ever Black Carpet Awards recognized achievements of minorities in Italian society, with the goal of promoting greater diversity and inclusion.Anna Wintour was among the front-row guests, along with the president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, Carlo Capasa. “I am here to support the community her in Milan and hopefully put more of a spotlight on the amazing work that they do,’’ Wintour said on arrival.The awards were organized by Afro Fashion Week Milano founder Michelle Ngonmo and recognized leaders who promote inclusion, diversity and equity through culture, creativity, community, legacy and entrepreneurship, with separate awards in each category chosen by a jury and by a popular vote.Ngonmo said after the ceremony that she felt the award were a sign that “we are starting in a concrete way to move the conversation forward.”SUNNEI CROWD SURFINGModels on the Sunnei runway did not have trust issues. They simply turned at the end of the raised runway, and fell backward into the crowd of fashionistas, crowd-surfing stadium-style.Don’t expect designers Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina to stage a standard runway show, but rather looks for ways to immerse the crowd in the experience. The referred to the show as “catharsis … a process of purification.’’The runway turn, and fall, was enough to take in the looks, which the pair described as “the fruit of months of design and textile research.”Crochet fur in bright colors may have been just enough to cushion any mishap. It appeared as fringe on coats, as eccentric hats, but most fetchingly in a fringy skirt, bandeau top and arm warmer combo. The designers themselves put their faith in the crowd, falling backward into it as a final bow.JIL SANDER POPS MOTIFSDesigners Luke and Lucie Meier helped get the frenetic fashion crowd into a receptive state for their latest Jil Sander collection with some calming music before their runway show.The collection spoke through silhouettes, opening with some leather looks in color blocks seemingly inspired by motorsports with the brand name heat printed in raised letters, and closing with hourglass shaped dresses and jackets. The pair turned out gracefully layered looks with tops, tunics over trousers, and offered seasonal motifs of cherries and wrapped peppermints, which appeared on garments as photo prints. Signature pendants finished the looks.CORMIO PROMOTES GIRL POWERDesigner Jezabelle Cormio presented a collection that mixes the girlie — ruffles, bows and ribbons — with the athletic, in the form of indoor pitch soccer shoes and soccer ball-shaped bags.All of the Cormio brand looks were easy to wear and move in, with manifold layering possibilities, underlining the Gen-Z staple of easy comfort and self-styling.Dresses stretched over the form. Knitwear with raised argyle pattern were layered prettily with super-cropped sweaters with ruffled draining. The star was the collection’s motif, seen on stretch dresses and pleated denim mini skirts worn with knee socks — caught somewhere between girlhood and the grownup world.ANDREADAMO SPRINGS FROM ITALY'S SOUTHAndrea Adamo is here to say that someone from a small town in the southern Italian region of Calabria can make it on the Milan runway. Even if the fashion world kind of already knew that, from the Versaces.In that tradition, he presents power looks for his Andreadamo grand with grommets and leather, tulle and knitwear that swaddle the form.Tulle wrapped over knitwear, encasing it mummy like. Grommet-covered nude dresses finished with a mermaid flair. Andamo also puts volumes in big boots that engulf the knees or trailing pant hems.The motif of the season is a fig leaf. And a representative “Eve” closed the show in a nude bodysuit with appropriately placed metallic dig leaves. Original sin flouted.Adamo said the collection paid homage to his native city, Crotone, and its fragile mountainsides, represented in the earth tone colors. He dedicated it to his seamstress grandmother, who didn't get to see him make it to the big northern fashion city.Standing in front of his mood board and eyeing details on each model before the show, Adamo wiped away a tear in her memory.“This is a homage to my city to show that even from a small city in the south you can dream,'' he said.TOD’S WARMS UP FOR NEXT WINTERFashion met art for Tod’s runway show for next fall and winter, set among the towering re-enforced concrete structures titled “The Seven Heavenly Palaces” by Anselm Kiefer.Outerwear is central to the latest collection by creative director Walter Chiapponi, from floor-sweeping parkas to cropped bombers.The clean lines in warm monotones put the emphasis on functionality and artisanal detailing: miniskirts were paired with ribbed knit shirts with leather detailing and a close-toe sling-back shoe while dresses cinched at the waist, mimicking a parka, and were worn with Teddy bear ballet flats in shearling.

But large rallies fizzled out after thousands were detained.Still, single-person protests have continued throughout the year. Ben Hodges, a former commander of US Army Europe, told DW on Friday that it is difficult to estimate how much actual support for the war there is among the Russian public.""We will never know for sure... but I would not mistake a stadium full of people waving Russian flags as strong support,"" Hodges said, adding the best indicator of opposition to the war was that hundreds of thousands of Russian men had fled the country to avoid conscription.SOTA, one of the last remaining independent news outlets in Russia, filmed at least seven people being detained in St. Petersburg for having brought flowers to a monument for renowned Ukrainian writer Taras Shevchenko.The outlet posted a video showing a police officer explaining to a couple that they had violated coronavirus restrictions.OVD-Info reported that at least nine people had been detained in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.SOTA also reported a person detained in Moscow, where people flocked to the monument of famed Ukrainian writer, Leysa Ukrainka.Footage by the outlet showed police officers monitoring but not interrupting the group of people who brought flowers to the monument.Russian opposition outlet Meduza also reported that a young woman had been arrested for holding a sign that read ""I support peace,"" in Korolyov, a city in the Moscow region.The outlet reported that a city councilman of Vyksa had been arrested for protesting with a sign that read ""Peace to Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821016,Remembering George Harrison on his 80th birthday,"A brooder and introvert, George Harrison always seemed to be in the shadows of the alpha males John Lennon and Paul McCartney during his time with The Beatles. Yet he made it onto the Rolling Stone list of the 100 best guitarists of all time at number 11 with his very special slide guitar technique.The musical pioneer's legacy is ""the combination of ritual Indian music with secular western pop music in the sense of a global music without ethnic or religious boundaries,"" Thomas Mania, the curator of the rock'n'pop museum in Gronau, Germany, told DW in 2018.Harrison was born on February 25, 1943, in war-time Liverpool. Growing up in the post-war era, he had a passion for playing guitar. When, in 1958, his school friend McCartney brought him into The Quarrymen — the band that would become The Beatles — he became the youngest band member at just 15. Only four years later, the band conquered Hamburg and then New York.In 1965, an encounter with the Indian musician Ravi Shankar changed Harrison's life. The sitar virtuoso showed him how the then largely unknown instrument in Europe was handled. Harrison used it on several Beatles songs, including ""Norwegian Wood"" or ""Within You Without You,"" kicking off an avalanche of psychedelic rock.At Harrison's prompting, the Beatles were instructed in meditation by the Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Fab Four did not come alone: A​ pack of 800 journalists from all over the world followed them and bore witness as the musicians hopped through monastic gardens in colorful garments and smeared each other with paint. Most of the eponymously named double album, sometimes known as ""The White Album,"" was inspired by these experiences.For his bandmates, the trip to India was a standalone episode, but afterward, Harrison converted to Hinduism. He soon turned away from his guru, because the supposedly abstinent monk was apparently polyamorous and commanded money from his followers.He then discovered the Hare Krishna movement, a religious organization based on Hindu scriptures, later donating a large estate near London to the sect in 1973; Bhaktivedanta Manor became one of the largest Krishna temples in the Western world.After the Beatles separated, Harrison found solo success. His album ""All Things Must Pass"" stormed the charts in the UK and US in 1970, followed by ""Living in the Material World"" in 1972, an album which reflected his religious and philosophical views.Money was never important to Harrison. Despite The Beatles' early access to material comfort, Harrison apparently always felt there was still something missing. Religion filled that void, he once said.Harrison's career was a constant series of ups and downs. He often complained that audiences only wanted to hear him perform songs from The Beatles repertoire, while he wanted to follow his own path.He organized a charity concert for Bangladesh and together with Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and Roy Orbison, formed the supergroup Traveling Wilburys, which played from 1988 to 1990. He also served as a film producer: Without his financial support, the Monty Python classic ""Life of Brian"" would never have been made.And yet he later said, ""I play a bit of guitar, write songs, make some movies, but none of that is really me."" In the last years of his life, spirituality was the only thing to give him meaning.Harrison died of lung cancer on November 29, 2001, at the age of 58 at New York University Hospital.This article has been updated to reflect Harrison's 80th birthday anniversary. It was originally written in German.",2023/02/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821018,White House braces for ruling on abortion pill's fate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is preparing for a worst-case scenario if a conservative federal judge rules in favor of a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to one of the two drugs typically used to induce a medicated abortion. 

            Two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, can be taken by women at home and are used for just over half of U.S. abortions. But that could be quickly changed by a lawsuit filed by an anti-abortion group in Texas that claims the Food and Drug Administration wrongly approved mifepristone for use more than 23 years ago.

            The case is before a federal judge appointed by former President Donald Trump. A ruling in favor of the abortion opponents could immediately shut down the sale of the drug, but women would still have access to medicated abortions with a regimen of misoprostol. 











            Vice President Kamala Harris promised on Friday that the White House would push back on efforts to ban the drug, as she gathered a group of nearly a dozen doctors and abortion rights advocates to discuss a plan for responding to the looming threat to access to medical abortions.

            “There are now partisan and political attacks attempting to question the legitimacy of a group of scientists and doctors who have studied the significance of this drug,” Harris said. “There is now an attempt by politicians to remove it from the ability of doctors to prescribe and the ability of people to receive.” 

            The lawsuit against mifepristone was filed by the Alliance for Defending Freedom, which was also involved in the Mississippi case that led to Roe v. Wade being overturned. It's the latest fallout in the struggle over reproductive care that the Democratic administration must grapple with since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion last year. 

            Harris did not publicly lay out how the administration plans to respond if a ruling that halts the sale of the drug nationwide comes down on Friday. 

            Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, meanwhile, was in California on Friday to meet leaders from Planned Parenthood to talk about access to the abortion drugs. 

            Dr. Kristyn Brandi said she told the vice president Friday that the ruling could trigger widespread confusion over the accessibility of medicated abortion in the U.S. Brandi, who is chair of the Physicians for Reproductive Health, said she already fields calls at her New Jersey clinic from women asking if medicated abortion is legal in the state. 

            “It’s a really important thing to communicate with people: medication abortion is not going away,” Brandi said. 

            She added that Harris expressed support for immediately challenging the ruling if it shuts down access to mifepristone. 

            Clinics and telehealth providers have been preparing for a ruling that shuts down access to mifepristone, ordering more doses of misoprostol so they can offer medication abortions with just that one drug. They will have to change the way they counsel patients, telling them that misoprostol-only abortions are slightly less effective and sometimes more painful than abortions done with both drugs.

            Abortions using both drugs “can be as effective as 98% or more,” while misoprostol-only abortions are up to about 95% effective, Melissa Grant, chief operating officer of the Carafem abortion clinic, told The Associated Press. 

            Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the action of the hormone progesterone, which enables a pregnancy to continue. Misoprostol causes contractions that empty the uterus. Typically, mifepristone is taken by mouth first, followed by misoprostol a day or two later.

            Studies show medication abortions are safe and effective, though with a slightly lower success rate than ones done by procedure in a clinic.

            With the Texas decision pending, a dozen Democratic-controlled states filed their own lawsuit in federal court against the FDA on Thursday in Washington. The lawsuit seeks to make it easier for woman to access the drug and alleges that several FDA requirements for prescribing and dispensing it are “burdensome, harmful and unnecessary.”

            When the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 it placed several safety restrictions on its use, including limiting dispensing to specialty clinics and requiring women to pick up the drug in person. The Biden administration had sought to expand access to medicated abortions in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, with an FDA announcement this year that broadened the pill’s access through retail and mail-order pharmacies. 

            But several limitations remain, such as one that doctors must be specially certified to prescribe the drug.

            Several medical groups have long opposed those requirements, pointing to the low rate of side effects seen with mifepristone compared with other medications that don’t carry any certification requirements.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821021,Rebels capture more ground in Congo as fighting intensifies,"GOMA, Congo (AP) — A rebel group linked with neighboring Rwanda seized more territory Friday, threatening supply routes to the regional capital, as fighting intensified in conflict-ridden east Congo, local residents and aid workers said.

            As M23 rebels captured the village of Mushaki in North Kivu province after more than two days of fighting with government forces and militias, civilians — including refugees from other areas — fled.

            Fighting in eastern Congo has been simmering for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources — while others try to defend their communities. But it spiked in late 2021 when M23, which was largely dormant for nearly a decade, resurfaced and started capturing territory. 











            M23 rose to prominence 10 years ago when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal, which it accuses the Congo government of not implementing.

            The capture of Mushaki threatens to cut off transport into the regional capital Goma, an analyst said. 

            “The main supply routes into Goma look increasingly tenuous and capturing towns on major roads will bring in more tax revenue for M23 helping further offensives,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst for Verisk Maplecroft a risk assessment firm. 

            For months Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 group and powerful voices in the West back that assertion — which Rwanda denies. Earlier this month regional heads of state urged an immediate cease-fire by all parties and sought more troops for a regional force sent to eastern Congo last year.

            But external pressure is yielding little as fighting intensifies and expands with both sides blaming the other. 

            Congo's army is respecting the ceasefire and only responds to attacks when the Rwandan army and M23 try to infiltrate its positions, said Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the army in the east.

            M23 political spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said the rebels are defending themselves against the government and a coalition of armed groups who use attack helicopters and heavy artillery to “bomb indiscriminately heavily populated areas under M23 control.""

            Meanwhile civilians are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Some 5.5 million people are internally displaced in eastern Congo, according to the United Nations, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times. 

            “I had just fled to Karuba, now I’ve run away again. We are under fire here,” Pierre Nsabimana, a Mushaki resident told the Associated Press by phone after fleeing the village.

            Aid groups say villagers can't be used as bargaining chips. 

            “The civilian population is this region (is) exhausted economically and traumatized emotionally. They deserve peace,” said Caitlin Brady, director for Congo at the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Associated Press reporter Sam Mednick contributed from Ouagadougou, Burkina FasoGOMA, Congo (AP) — A rebel group linked with neighboring Rwanda seized more territory Friday, threatening supply routes to the regional capital, as fighting intensified in conflict-ridden east Congo, local residents and aid workers said.As M23 rebels captured the village of Mushaki in North Kivu province after more than two days of fighting with government forces and militias, civilians — including refugees from other areas — fled.Fighting in eastern Congo has been simmering for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources — while others try to defend their communities. But it spiked in late 2021 when M23, which was largely dormant for nearly a decade, resurfaced and started capturing territory.M23 rose to prominence 10 years ago when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal, which it accuses the Congo government of not implementing.The capture of Mushaki threatens to cut off transport into the regional capital Goma, an analyst said.“The main supply routes into Goma look increasingly tenuous and capturing towns on major roads will bring in more tax revenue for M23 helping further offensives,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst for Verisk Maplecroft a risk assessment firm.For months Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 group and powerful voices in the West back that assertion — which Rwanda denies. Earlier this month regional heads of state urged an immediate cease-fire by all parties and sought more troops for a regional force sent to eastern Congo last year.But external pressure is yielding little as fighting intensifies and expands with both sides blaming the other.Congo's army is respecting the ceasefire and only responds to attacks when the Rwandan army and M23 try to infiltrate its positions, said Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the army in the east.M23 political spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said the rebels are defending themselves against the government and a coalition of armed groups who use attack helicopters and heavy artillery to “bomb indiscriminately heavily populated areas under M23 control.""Meanwhile civilians are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Some 5.5 million people are internally displaced in eastern Congo, according to the United Nations, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times.“I had just fled to Karuba, now I’ve run away again. We are under fire here,” Pierre Nsabimana, a Mushaki resident told the Associated Press by phone after fleeing the village.Aid groups say villagers can't be used as bargaining chips.“The civilian population is this region (is) exhausted economically and traumatized emotionally. They deserve peace,” said Caitlin Brady, director for Congo at the Norwegian Refugee Council.————-Malkia reported from Kinshasha, Congo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821022,"New this week: 'True Lies,' Wallen and 'Creed' film fest","Here’s a collection curated by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists of what’s arriving on TV, streaming services and music and video game platforms this week.

            MOVIES

            — With “Creed III” coming to theaters on Friday, Prime Video has you covered for all your Creed and Rocky needs. “Creed” and “Creed II,” along with every Rocky film from No. 1 through “Balboa,” will be available to watch on Prime Video starting Wednesday. You could also do a Sofia Coppola double feature of “The Virgin Suicides” and “Lost in Translation” while trying to decide which Coppola-inspired T-shirt to purchase from Uniqlo’s celebration of the filmmaker (also available next week).











            — Best picture Oscar nominee and Palme d’Or winner “Triangle of Sadness” comes to Hulu on Friday, giving stragglers plenty of time (well, nine days) to watch the riotous and bodily social satire before the Oscars, where it’s also up for best director and best original screenplay. It’s the English-language debut for Swedish director Ruben Östlund who takes a scalpel to the privileged classes on board a luxury yacht, starring Harris Dickinson, Charlbi Dean, Dolly de Leon and Woody Harrelson as a Marxist ship captain. I wrote in my AP review that “The beauty and pleasure of something like “ Triangle of Sadness ” is in the details, like the well-observed and precisely crafted awkwardness over who should pay the restaurant bill, or the rules about who gets to sit in the front row of a fashion show shifting in real time.”

            MUSIC

            — Morgan Wallen is back with new music — a lot of music. “One Thing at a Time” has a whopping 36 songs, including “Man Made a Bar” with Eric Church. His sister, Ashlyne, joins him on “Outlook.” “This record represents the last few years of my life, the highs and the lows,” Wallen says in his announcement. (Some of the lows include facing rebuke for being caught using a racial slur.) Early singles include “You Proof” and “Thought You Should Know.” The album ends with the tune “Dying Man” and the lyrics: “Codeine, it got Elvis/Whiskey, it got Hank/I always thought somethin’ like that/ Might send me on my way.” The album drops Friday.

            — Willie Nelson approaches his 90th birthday later this year with plenty going on — he just won a Grammy for best country album, he’s among the 2023 nominees for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and he has a new album: “I Don’t Know a Thing About Love.” Nelson and his band recorded fresh interpretations of 10 classic compositions penned by the legendary American songwriter Harlan Howard. The songs include “Busted,” the story of a dirt-poor farmer bemoaning his overdue bills, crop failures, and other financial woes while maintaining a sense of hope for the future. 

            — A huge box set celebrating the musical tie between Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello now serves as a memorial to Bacharach, the iconic composer who died earlier this month. “The Songs of Bacharach & Costello” is a comprehensive 45-song set that includes live performances of Bacharach and Costello performing several songs from the album “Painted From Memory” and three rare and unreleased live performances from 1998 and 1999, including a stark and gripping “In The Darkest Place.” The collection will be available in a variety of formats, including streaming starting Friday.

            TELEVISION 

            — Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis never made a sequel to their 1994 action, comedy movie “True Lies,” directed by James Cameron, but CBS has a new TV series with the same title inspired by the film. Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga now co-star as Harry and Helen Tasker. Harry is a secret international spy who pretends to have a career in computers that takes him on the road a lot. On a mission in Paris doubling as a romantic getaway for the couple, Harry’s double life is exposed and she must join the team. “True Lies,” executive produced by Cameron, debuts Wednesday on CBS.

            — “Alaska Daily,” the ABC drama created by ""Spotlight” director and co-writer Tom McCarthy and starring Hilary Swank, returns from hiatus Thursday. The series follows the staff at a struggling Alaska newspaper whose new star reporter, Eileen Fitzgerald, was hired to join an ongoing investigation about murdered Indigenous women. It’s inspired by the decades-old problem of missing and murdered Alaska Native women.

            — Amazon has adapted “Daisy Jones & the Six,” the best-selling novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid into a limited series debuting Friday. Riley Keough and Sam Claflin star as the lead singers of a 1970s rock band who make beautiful music together but behind-the-scenes they’re either at each other’s throats or trying to fight their feelings. The story charts the band’s early days, fame and abrupt breakup with flash forwards to older versions of the characters looking back on the story. Reese Witherspoon’s media company, Hello Sunshine, executive produces.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821024,FDA's tobacco unit pledges reset after criticism,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Food and Drug Administration officials on Friday pledged a reset in the agency’s tobacco program, responding to criticisms that a lack of direction has hampered efforts to regulate cigarettes, vaping devices and related products.

            The head of the agency’s tobacco center promised to deliver a five-year strategic plan by year’s end outlining priorities, including efforts to clean up a sprawling market of largely unauthorized electronic cigarettes. The agency also said it would provide more transparency to companies about its decisions, following the rejection of more than 1 million applications from e-cigarette makers seeking to market their products as alternatives for adult smokers.

            The announcement comes as the tobacco center is besieged by criticism from all sides — including lawmakers, anti-smoking advocates and tobacco companies.











            FDA chief Dr. Robert Califf commissioned separate, external reviews of the agency’s tobacco and food programs last summer, amid controversies in both units.

            The blistering report on the tobacco program, issued in December, described the FDA as “reactive and overwhelmed,” with a demoralized workforce that struggles to oversee both traditional tobacco products and a freewheeling e-cigarette market.

            The report mainly channeled long-standing grievances from groups on opposing sides of the tobacco issue. Public health groups want the FDA to more aggressively police regular cigarettes and flavored e-cigarettes that appeal to teenagers. Tobacco companies complain that the FDA is unwilling to approve new alternative products — including e-cigarettes — that might help adults quit smoking.

            FDA's tobacco chief, Brian King, said Friday that regulators are looking at ways to “better communicate” with companies about how the FDA makes decisions. The agency is also working to streamline the review process, when possible. 

            “Some things will take longer than others, but we're committed to getting everything done that we've outlined as expeditiously as possible,” King said in an interview.

            Vaping industry representatives said they were unimpressed by the FDA update, which they said would continue to result in denials for most vaping products.

            ""While the devil is in the details, nothing in today’s announcement hinted at any material shift in FDA’s perpetual attack on every nicotine-containing product,” said Tony Abboud of the Vapor Technology Association, in an emailed statement.

            The FDA has OK'd a handful of tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes from several large companies. But many industry players are pushing for approval of menthol and other flavors.

            Responding to a recommendation in the December report, King said the FDA would convene a meeting with the Department of Justice on its efforts to crack down on unauthorized e-cigarettes, particularly fruit- and candy-flavored products that are popular among teens.

            The FDA has sent hundreds of warning letters to vape shops and e-cigarette manufacturers in recent years, calling on them to remove products. But the letters are sometimes ignored. King pointed out that the FDA relies on the Justice Department to make decisions about when to bring lawsuits against bad actors.

            In recent months, the FDA and the Justice Department have announced the first lawsuits and fines targeting vape shops and manufacturers selling unauthorized products.

            “Those are the first of their kind and I hope they're a wake-up call to industry that if you are violating the law we are going to use the full portfolio of our enforcement activities to ensure that you comply,” King said.

            The FDA’s tobacco center was created by Congress in 2009 and granted sweeping powers to remake the industry, including banning harmful ingredients from traditional products and authorizing new, less-harmful alternatives.

            But FDA has been stalled by “near constant” litigation, the December report noted.

            Tobacco industry lawsuits have repeatedly blocked FDA actions designed to help smokers quit, including adding graphic warnings to cigarette packs. 

            “Unfortunately, the tobacco industry has fought the agency on many of the science-based actions we’ve taken, putting profits over public health,” King said.

            Meanwhile, lawsuits brought by anti-tobacco groups forced the FDA to speed up its timeline for reviewing more than a million e-cigarette applications from four years to 10 months. The agency has repeatedly pushed back its deadline for completing its review, prompting criticism from parent groups and members of Congress. The agency now says it will take until 2024 to review the remaining products.

            King said the FDA will look at whether changes to the law are needed to help the agency accomplish its work.

            Among other steps, the FDA has repeatedly asked Congress to collect user fees from e-cigarette makers to help hire more staff and fund product reviews. So far, Congress has not granted that request.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821025,Redacted report on Baltimore church sex abuse to be released,"BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered the release of a redacted version of an investigative report detailing sex abuse allegations against more than 150 Roman Catholic priests in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and examining the institution’s response.

            Completed last year by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, the report has not yet been made public because it contains information obtained from church officials via grand jury subpoenas, and such proceedings are confidential in Maryland. 

            But lawyers for the state asked the court for permission to release their findings, and Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Robert Taylor issued his ruling Friday calling for a redacted version to be released in the coming weeks or months. Taylor said he will consider whether the redacted parts should also be released later. 











            According to earlier court filings, the nearly 500-page report identifies 158 priests accused of abusing more than 600 victims over the past 80 years. The attorney general's investigation was launched in 2019.

            In his ruling, Taylor said releasing the report is in the interest of justice, partly because many abusers have avoided criminal charges and other forms of accountability.

            After the victims suffered from “decades of systemic injustice,” he wrote, the “only form of justice that may now be available is a public reckoning.”

            Taylor also said Maryland legislators should be able to consider the report’s contents during the ongoing state legislative session, which ends April 10. Lawmakers are currently considering whether to end the state’s statute of limitations for when civil lawsuits can be filed against institutions related to child sexual abuse. 

            “The need for disclosure outweighs the need for secrecy,” Taylor wrote.

            Currently, victims of child sex abuse in Maryland can’t sue after they turn 38. Other proposals to do away with the age limit have failed to become law in recent years, but the issue has received renewed attention this session.

            Taylor requested a list of people whose identities will be redacted from the report before its release. He gave the attorney general’s office a March 13 deadline, saying the redacted report could be released as soon as he has approved the list. Then, the court will contact everyone on the list, allow them to review certain redactions and finally, consider whether to remove the redactions and release a more complete version of the report. 

            Of the accused priests named in the report, most have been previously publicly identified by the Baltimore Archdiocese, but 43 have not, according to the ruling. They will be among those included on the list, along with others facing accusations of abuse and involvement in subsequent coverups.

            In a response Friday to Taylor’s decision, the attorney general’s office said it was pleased with the ruling and would “move expeditiously to comply with the court’s order and prepare a redacted copy of the report.”BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Friday ordered the release of a redacted version of an investigative report detailing sex abuse allegations against more than 150 Roman Catholic priests in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and examining the institution’s response.Completed last year by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, the report has not yet been made public because it contains information obtained from church officials via grand jury subpoenas, and such proceedings are confidential in Maryland.But lawyers for the state asked the court for permission to release their findings, and Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Robert Taylor issued his ruling Friday calling for a redacted version to be released in the coming weeks or months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821026,Italy's high court upholds tough prison regime for militant,"ROME (AP) — Italy’s high court on Friday reaffirmed a strict prison regime for an Italian left-wing militant whose cause has been taken up by anarchist groups in several countries that have staged attacks on Italian diplomatic missions.

            The Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by lawyers for Alfredo Cospito, who has been on a hunger strike since October to protest the prison regime reserved for terrorists and mafia bosses, according to LaPresse news agency and RAI state television. Cospito, 55, is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting in the leg an energy executive for a state-controlled company and 20 years for a series of dynamite attacks in Italy.

            An appeals court in Turin last spring toughened his prison conditions to include solitary confinement except for one hour a day, and a strict limit on family visits. The regime is imposed on prisoners who are considered to pose a danger even from inside prison.











            After a tribunal reaffirmed the decision in December, there were more than a dozen attacks on Italian diplomatic interests abroad that have been claimed by or linked to anarchist groups acting in solidarity with Cospito. 

            On Thursday, anarchists unfurled a banner down the front of Italy’s Altar of the Nation reading “Italy tortures” and similar banners were unfurled outside the Court of Cassation, amid a heavy police presence, as judges considered their verdict during eight hours of consultation Friday.

            No injuries have been reported in the attacks, which have included torching of cars and vandalism on diplomatic targets in Argentina, Bolivia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Those attacking the consulate in Spain wrote “freedom for Cospito” at the site.

            The Interior Ministry has defended the use of the strict prison regime for Cospito, saying the attacks only reinforce the need for such measures.

            In late January, Cospito was transferred from his prison in Sardinia to a facility in Milan that has a wing for specialized medical care, given the deterioration of his health from the hunger strike.ROME (AP) — Italy’s high court on Friday reaffirmed a strict prison regime for an Italian left-wing militant whose cause has been taken up by anarchist groups in several countries that have staged attacks on Italian diplomatic missions.The Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by lawyers for Alfredo Cospito, who has been on a hunger strike since October to protest the prison regime reserved for terrorists and mafia bosses, according to LaPresse news agency and RAI state television. Cospito, 55, is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting in the leg an energy executive for a state-controlled company and 20 years for a series of dynamite attacks in Italy.An appeals court in Turin last spring toughened his prison conditions to include solitary confinement except for one hour a day, and a strict limit on family visits. The regime is imposed on prisoners who are considered to pose a danger even from inside prison.After a tribunal reaffirmed the decision in December, there were more than a dozen attacks on Italian diplomatic interests abroad that have been claimed by or linked to anarchist groups acting in solidarity with Cospito.On Thursday, anarchists unfurled a banner down the front of Italy’s Altar of the Nation reading “Italy tortures” and similar banners were unfurled outside the Court of Cassation, amid a heavy police presence, as judges considered their verdict during eight hours of consultation Friday.No injuries have been reported in the attacks, which have included torching of cars and vandalism on diplomatic targets in Argentina, Bolivia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821027,Biden to draw health care contrast with GOP in Virginia,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will aim to draw a contrast between his health care priorities and those of congressional Republicans at a Virginia event next week in advance of his 2024 budget proposals.

            Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would use the Virginia Beach event Tuesday to criticize Republicans for demanding concessions for raising the nation's borrowing limit, while tying the GOP to policy proposals that he says would raise health care prices. 

            The event is part of his persistent effort to paint Republicans as extreme as he prepares to mount a reelection bid in 2024.











            Americans “deserve to know what Republicans are looking to cut, given that in countless previous budgets they have repeatedly proposed devastating cuts to essential programs like the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, which are lowering costs for tens of millions of Americans,” Jean-Pierre said.

            Some Republicans have called for repealing Democrats' 2022 climate change and health care bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, that capped insulin costs at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare and instituted measures meant to bring drug prices down. 

            Biden, meanwhile, has promised that his budget, coming early next month, would include plans that would cut the deficit by $2 trillion, though he has yet to reveal the details of the proposal.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will aim to draw a contrast between his health care priorities and those of congressional Republicans at a Virginia event next week in advance of his 2024 budget proposals.Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would use the Virginia Beach event Tuesday to criticize Republicans for demanding concessions for raising the nation's borrowing limit, while tying the GOP to policy proposals that he says would raise health care prices.The event is part of his persistent effort to paint Republicans as extreme as he prepares to mount a reelection bid in 2024.Americans “deserve to know what Republicans are looking to cut, given that in countless previous budgets they have repeatedly proposed devastating cuts to essential programs like the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, which are lowering costs for tens of millions of Americans,” Jean-Pierre said.Some Republicans have called for repealing Democrats' 2022 climate change and health care bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, that capped insulin costs at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare and instituted measures meant to bring drug prices down.Biden, meanwhile, has promised that his budget, coming early next month, would include plans that would cut the deficit by $2 trillion, though he has yet to reveal the details of the proposal.",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821029,"Russia, Ukraine face off at UN with rival tributes to dead","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia and Ukraine faced off at the U.N. Security Council on Friday on the first anniversary of their war, with their confrontation even extending to dueling moments of silence for the dead.

            The showdown began before the session formally started, with Russia’s ambassador demanding to know why Ukraine was ahead of council members on the speakers list. Most dramatically, in the middle of the meeting, the two countries tussled over tributes to the victims of the war. And it culminated with rival views on how to achieve peace.

            Near the beginning, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that, “finally, on this tragic day, when we mourn lives, and destinies broken by Russia, I kindly ask everyone to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the aggression.”











            He rose to his feet. Everyone in the council chamber stood in silence.

            But even in a moment of respect for the war dead, Ukraine and Russia were at odds.

            As soon as Kuleba sat down, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia asked for the floor, saying: “We are getting to our feet to honor the memory of all victims of what has happened in Ukraine starting in 2014 – all of those who perished.”

            Nebenzia’s use of 2014 and double emphasis on the word “all,” were references to Russia’s claims that the conflict with Ukraine began that year after Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from office by mass protests. 

            Russia responded by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and then threw its weight behind an insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine region known as Donbas that continues and which Putin has illegally annexed.

            “All lives are priceless, and that is why we’re rising to honor the memory of them all,” Nebenzia said, referring to Russians, pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east as well as Ukrainians elsewhere in the country.

            Nebenzia and Russian diplomats then rose to their feet, and slowly, apparently after some thought, other members in the council chamber rose until everyone in the chamber was standing silently for about a minute.

            Although Moscow and Kyiv keep precise numbers under wraps, Western estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of killed and wounded on both sides. 

            Nebenzia accused Malta, which holds the council’s rotating presidency, of giving Ukraine preference in choosing it to speak first just because it is “part of your geopolitical project.” 

            He also objected to foreign ministers of 14 European countries on the speakers list along with the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, saying they all have the same EU position “and will bring no added value” to the debate.

            Malta’s Foreign Minister Ian Borg responded that the European ministers flew to New York and asked to speak because “they feel that their countries have been and are still being directly impacted by this war.”

            Kuleba told the council that “Ukraine will resist as it has done so far, and Ukraine will win.” And he declared that Russian President Vladimir “Putin is going to lose much sooner than he thinks.”

            Kuleba then delivered several messages to Russian officials and servicemen: You may think you will get away with what you did but “you will end up on trial.” And if you think Ukraine will get tired of defending itself, “the longer you will keep attacking Ukraine … the more humiliating your defeat will be.”

            Kuleba urged countries everywhere to implement President Volodymry Zelenskyy’s peace plan and the General Assembly resolution adopted Thursday with support from 141 countries demanding that his country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are upheld, as required by the U.N. Charter. The resolution also calls for a cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine.

            In that vote, 11 of the 15 council members supported the resolution, Russia opposed it, and China, Gabon and Mozambique abstained.

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned council members that they “should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting and calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.”

            “If Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends,” Blinken said. “Vladimir Putin started this war. One man can end it.”

            Russia’s Nebenzia countered that what Ukraine and the West want “is a capitulation of Russia and inflicting a strategic defeat of Russia, ideally followed by the disintegration of the country and redrawing the territories in includes.”

            The goal of what Russia calls its special military operation has never been to destroy Ukraine, Nebenzia said, but to have “a friendly neighbor who doesn’t threaten us,” and it is ready to negotiate on how its goals could be implemented.

            U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the many ministers backing Ukraine insisted at the council meeting that the U.N. Charter’s principles guaranteeing Ukraine’s territorial integrity and independence must be the basis of any peace.

            “The guns are talking now,” Guterres said, “but in the end we all know that the path of diplomacy and accountability is the road to a just and sustainable peace -- peace in line with the U.N. Charter and international law.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821030,Rift in Idaho GOP exposed amid multistate water rule lawsuit,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Some top officials in Idaho are raising alarms over the Republican attorney general’s decision not to join a 24-state lawsuit against Biden administration waterway protections that opponents say could impact public and private land across the state.

            Instead, Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador’s office says the state will soon be joining another lawsuit filed in Texas, contending it’s a better fit for the state’s interests. 

            Emails obtained via a public records request hint at a potentially deep rift between Idaho's attorney general and other state GOP leaders, including the governor. 











            Labrador's decision surprised some officials. In January, Idaho Gov. Brad Little led the multistate coalition of Republican governors — from Virginia to Alaska — urging the president not to implement the new federal water rules until the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling on the matter. 

            The new rules define which “waters of the United States” — often called “WOTUS” — qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act. The most recent rule change came in December, when the Biden administration repealed a Trump-era rule and expanded some protections. This meant largely going back to definitions in place prior to 2015, restoring protection to thousands of small streams, wetlands and other waterways.

            And the rules are always contested. Environmental groups push for definitions that would broaden limits on pollution entering waterways. Agriculture groups, developers and other industries lobby for definitions that would reduce federal protections and ease burdens on businesses.

            Once the new rules were finalized, attorneys general in most of same 24 states that signed Little's letter joined together on a lawsuit against the federal government. 

            Labrador was invited to join the suit, but didn’t.

            His office did not inform Little or the leaders of the relevant state agencies that the multistate lawsuit was happening before it was filed without Idaho, according to the requested public documents. State law makes Labrador the attorney of record for most state agencies, and historically the attorney general’s office has consulted with the agencies about potential litigation. 

            “We were not consulted and knew nothing about the lawsuit until after it was filed,” wrote Jess Byrne, the director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, in a Feb. 23 email to the governor's office. Byrne called the situation, “very concerning to say the least.” 

            The governor learned the lawsuit was happening through a press release from Wyoming's governor, Little's spokesperson Emily Callihan told The Associated Press via email. Labrador's office only reached out after the governor's staffers began asking about the suit, she said. 

            “The Governor's Office has requested updates from the Attorney General's Office and will continue to explore all legal options available to Idaho to challenge the federal government's overreach,” Callihan said. “An issue of this magnitude is too important for Idaho not to fight.”

            On Friday, Labrador noted that state attorneys general have been fighting the WOTUS rules since President Obama's administration and said the responsibility for legal action on behalf of Idaho lies with his office.

            “The Attorney General, not state agencies, determines when, how and where the state sues the federal government to protect the sovereignty of Idaho,” Labrador wrote in a prepared statement. “I think the Attorneys General who have been litigating this issue for well over a decade will be surprised to learn their years-long efforts are being led by Brad Little.” 

            There’s no love lost between Little and Labrador, who run in different factions within Idaho’s divided GOP. The attorney general previously sought the governor’s seat, but lost to Little in the 2018 primary. 

            Late Thursday, Labrador’s office told the AP that Little’s office was notified nearly a week ago about Labrador’s plans to join the Texas lawsuit. 

            “After taking a careful look at the two cases,” Labrador’s spokesperson Beth Cahill wrote Thursday, “the AG determined that litigating alongside Texas makes better strategic sense for our state because Idaho’s unique interests and arguments will be front and center.

            The multistate lawsuit is led by West Virginia’s attorney general, who reached out to other states directly. The deadline to reply was Feb. 14, according to West Virginia’s request. The lawsuit was filed Feb. 16 in federal court in North Dakota.

            Meanwhile, the Texas lawsuit was filed Jan. 18. A hearing on a motion to put the federal water rules on hold is scheduled less than three weeks away. 

            During his 2022 campaign for attorney general, Labrador called for faster and more aggressive representation when fighting what he deemed federal overreach on things like the Clean Water Act.

            “This is the federal government encroaching on the people of Idaho, on the sovereignty of the state of Idaho, and he refuses to lend a hand,” Labrador said, referring to the incumbent attorney general, Lawrence Wasden, during a TV debate.

            Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a business-backed appeal from a northern Idaho couple who wanted to build a home close to Priest Lake. The Environmental Protection Agency ordered Chantell and Michael Sackett to stop work on the property in 2007, determining it was part of a wetland and could not be disturbed without a permit. The Supreme Court has not yet issued a ruling.

            When similar multistate lawsuits have been in the works, the Idaho attorney general's office has notified state agencies to see if they want to join, Byrne wrote in an email to the governor's office. That's because the agencies are the “client that would have a substantial interest and legal standing in the matter.""

            “It would have been our recommendation to join the lawsuit had we been given the opportunity,"" Byrne wrote. 

            Chanel Tewalt, the state’s agriculture director, also emailed Byrne and the governor's office this week asking if there were any pending lawsuits.

            “I've had a number of people from industry ask where the State is on pushing back against the final rule,” Tewalt wrote.

            Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson’s spokesperson Nikki Wallace wrote to Little’s office as well on Thursday, saying Simpson was “disappointed to learn that Raul (Labrador) hasn’t filed — he thinks he should be leading the other 24 states, not being the last as Idaho has led this charge for so long.”BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Some top officials in Idaho are raising alarms over the Republican attorney general’s decision not to join a 24-state lawsuit against Biden administration waterway protections that opponents say could impact public and private land across the state.Instead, Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador’s office says the state will soon be joining another lawsuit filed in Texas, contending it’s a better fit for the state’s interests.Emails obtained via a public records request hint at a potentially deep rift between Idaho's attorney general and other state GOP leaders, including the governor.Labrador's decision surprised some officials.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821031,Gareth Edwards' Barbarians jersey sells for world record fee,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — The Barbarians jersey worn by Gareth Edwards in 1973 when he scored one of rugby’s greatest tries was sold for a world-record fee of 240,000 pounds ($286,000) at auction on Friday.

            The black-and white-hooped No. 9 shirt had a pre-sale estimate of 150,000 pounds-200,000 pounds. It was the centerpiece of his jersey collection which went under the hammer of Penarth-based Rogers Jones Auctioneers and Valuers.

            The try Edwards finished against New Zealand was a spectacular seven-man move started by a side-stepping Phil Bennett from deep inside his own half in Cardiff 50 years ago. The Barbarians, a shadow British and Irish Lions side, won 23-11.











            The jersey was kept in a box under a snooker table, having previously been gifted by Edwards to his sons Owen and Rhys.

It was the centerpiece of his jersey collection which went under the hammer of Penarth-based Rogers Jones Auctioneers and Valuers.The try Edwards finished against New Zealand was a spectacular seven-man move started by a side-stepping Phil Bennett from deep inside his own half in Cardiff 50 years ago. The Barbarians, a shadow British and Irish Lions side, won 23-11.The jersey was kept in a box under a snooker table, having previously been gifted by Edwards to his sons Owen and Rhys.The previous world record fee for a rugby jersey was 180,000 pounds in 2015 for the shirt worn by New Zealand captain Dave Gallaher in the famous 1905 test against Wales.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821046,Telecom maker Ericsson to cut 8% of its global workforce,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson said Friday that it's cutting 8% of its global workforce as it looks to reduce costs, the latest in a wave of tech company layoffs.

            The Stockholm-based company, which provides equipment for high-speed 5G wireless networks, said it is expecting to lay off 8,500 employees this year and into 2024 as part of a strategy to reduce its spending by 9 billion Swedish kronor ($857 million) by the end of this year. 

            “Our aim is to manage the process in every country with fairness, respect, professionalism and in line with local labor legislation,"" Ericsson said in a statement.











            The company in December announced its push to slash costs. It said Friday that it expects to see results in the second quarter as it simplifies and becomes more efficient, including cutting back its workforce of about 105,000 people worldwide.

            “We are also working on our service delivery, supply, real estate and IT. We have already started to implement and accelerate various initiatives to help us reach"" the cost-cutting goal, Ericsson said.

            It comes as tech companies ranging from Spotify and Amazon to Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta have each slashed thousands of jobs in recent months. They had gone on hiring sprees over the past several years as demand for their products, software and services surged with millions of people working and studying remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821048,Court proceedings advance in deadly shooting on film set,"A film-industry weapons supervisor made her first formal court appearance Friday on a felony charge in the shooting death of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin on the set of a Western movie.

            Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's attorney said his client will plead not guilty, but the judge did not take that plea during the virtual court proceeding. Instead, the judge issued conditions of release that allow Gutierrez-Reed to keep a gun at home for self-defense. 

            Gutierrez-Reed and Baldwin were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in October 2021.











            Gutierrez-Reed's attorney told the judge his client has received numerous threats and was forced to file for a restraining order against a stalker. He said authorities released documents related to the case and failed to redact identifying information that included phone numbers.

            District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies told the judge she adamantly opposed the request because of Gutierrez-Reed's “sloppy mishandling of firearms and guns” on the set. She suggested Gutierrez-Reed could either move or keep a bat or pepper spray in her house instead.

            Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, Jason Bowles, challenged the district attorney's characterization and disputed the claim about sloppiness.

            “There is no allegation that she is a danger to anyone having a firearm within her home, and it's for self-protection because of actions that the state took in releasing private information. That is the reason for that request,” he said.

            In addition to allowing Gutierrez-Reed to have a gun at home, the judge ordered her not to have any contact with witnesses who might testify as part of the case. 

            A day earlier Baldwin agreed to forgo a hearing to have his rights explained to him and entered a plea of not guilty. 

            The judge allowed Baldwin to have limited contact with potential witnesses in connection with plans to complete the filming of “Rust.” Other provisions included a prohibition on consuming alcohol and against any possession of weapons, including firearms.

            Work on “Rust” was halted with Hutchins’ death. Rust Movie Productions says filming is expected to resume this spring, without the use of real weapons or ammunition.

            Separately Friday, the producers of “Rust” agreed to pay a $100,000 fine in connection with allegations of workplace safety violations, in a proposed settlement agreement with New Mexico occupational safety regulators.

            The proposed settlement reduces the alleged safety violation to the category of “serious,” from “willful-serious,” and states that Rust Movie Productions “did not furnish a place of employment free from hazards in that employees were exposed to being struck by discharged rounds or projectiles when firearms were used on the set of the motion picture production.”

            In April 2020, New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau slapped Rust Movie Productions with a maximum $136,793 fine while distributing a scathing narrative of safety failures in violation of standard industry protocols, including testimony that production managers took limited or no action to address two misfires on set before the fatal shooting.

            The bureau also documented gun-safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.

            Melina Spadone, an attorney for Rust Movie Productions, said Friday in a statement that the settlement would help filmmakers resume work on “Rust.” 

            “Our top priority has always been resuming production and completing this film so we can honor the life and work of Halyna Hutchins,” she said.

            The involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a lead actor and co-producer on “Rust,” and Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armor, are punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine under New Mexico law.

            Prosecutors and defense attorneys are preparing for a likely preliminary hearing within a few months to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.

            Authorities said Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.

            Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas said when the charges were announced that they were “a terrible miscarriage of justice.” He said Baldwin relied on the professionals with whom he worked and “had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun.”

            Bowles had said the charges were the result of “a very flawed investigation and an inaccurate understanding of the full facts.” He said he believed jurors will exonerate his client.

            Prosecutors say assistant director David Halls, who oversaw safety on set, has signed an agreement to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin. 

            A judge is scheduled to consider approval of the plea agreement in March. Halls waived his first appearance in court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821049,Netflix cuts prices in some markets to lure more subscribers,"Netflix is cutting its prices in several of its smaller markets in the latest twist on the video streaming service’s efforts to keep its recently revived subscriber growth rolling amid stiffer competition and inflation pressures that are pushing more households to curb their discretionary spending.

            The lower prices that began to roll out earlier this week affect more than 30 of the roughly 190 countries where Netflix's steaming service is available — an expanse that has enabled the company to attract nearly 231 million subscribers. The areas getting lower prices include Middle East markets in Yemen, Jordan, Libya and Iran; European countries such as Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria, and sub-Saharan African markets.

            Netflix isn't changing its prices in any of its largest markets, including the U.S., where it has been regularly increasing its rates during the past four years to help offset the cost of an programming lineup that includes popular series such as “The Crown"" and “Stranger Things.”











            Although Netflix has established itself as the largest video streaming service, it has been vying for viewers with other deep-pocketed rivals that include Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney Co. at the same time stubbornly high inflation is causing more people to tighten their budgets.

            Those factors contributed to Netflix losing nearly 1.2 million subscribers during the first half of last year, prompting the company to introduce an ad-supported option of its service t hat cost just $7 per month in the U.S. — less than half the price of its most popular plan. That helped Netflix bounce back during the second half of last year when it added 10 million subscribers, a recovery that made its long-time CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings comfortable enough to step down last month.

            In another attempt to gain more subscribers, Netflix has started to crack down on rampant password sharing that has enabled an estimated 100 million people worldwide to free load on its service. Netflix has already clamped down on the practice in Latin America and several other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain earlier this month. New rules governing the use of the same password in multiple households are expected to be imposed in the U.S. by the end of March.

            Netflix's new co-CEO Greg Peters hinted last month during a quarterly conference call that the company was examining ways to attract more subscribers in its smaller markets, although he didn't say anything specifically about using lower prices as a lure. “There’s a bunch of people around the world in countries where we’re not deeply penetrated, and we have more opportunity to go attract them,” Peters said. 

            In that same call, Peters also indicated that Netflix sees little need to drop prices in markets, such as the U.S., where its service already proved its value to long-time subscribers. “We think of ourselves as a non-substitutable good,"" Peters said.

            Even so, Netflix lost 920,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada last year, leaving it with 74.3 million subscribers in that region at the end of December. Despite the subscriber erosion, Netflix's price increases in the U.S and Canada helped boost its revenue in the region by 9% last year to nearly $14.1 billion. The financial gains are becoming more important to Netflix because it is now placing more emphasis on profit growth now that it has become tougher to attract more subscribers.Netflix is cutting its prices in several of its smaller markets in the latest twist on the video streaming service’s efforts to keep its recently revived subscriber growth rolling amid stiffer competition and inflation pressures that are pushing more households to curb their discretionary spending.The lower prices that began to roll out earlier this week affect more than 30 of the roughly 190 countries where Netflix's steaming service is available — an expanse that has enabled the company to attract nearly 231 million subscribers. The areas getting lower prices include Middle East markets in Yemen, Jordan, Libya and Iran; European countries such as Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria, and sub-Saharan African markets.Netflix isn't changing its prices in any of its largest markets, including the U.S., where it has been regularly increasing its rates during the past four years to help offset the cost of an programming lineup that includes popular series such as “The Crown"" and “Stranger Things.”Although Netflix has established itself as the largest video streaming service, it has been vying for viewers with other deep-pocketed rivals that include Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney Co. at the same time stubbornly high inflation is causing more people to tighten their budgets.Those factors contributed to Netflix losing nearly 1.2 million subscribers during the first half of last year, prompting the company to introduce an ad-supported option of its service t hat cost just $7 per month in the U.S. — less than half the price of its most popular plan. That helped Netflix bounce back during the second half of last year when it added 10 million subscribers, a recovery that made its long-time CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings comfortable enough to step down last month.In another attempt to gain more subscribers, Netflix has started to crack down on rampant password sharing that has enabled an estimated 100 million people worldwide to free load on its service. Netflix has already clamped down on the practice in Latin America and several other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain earlier this month. New rules governing the use of the same password in multiple households are expected to be imposed in the U.S. by the end of March.Netflix's new co-CEO Greg Peters hinted last month during a quarterly conference call that the company was examining ways to attract more subscribers in its smaller markets, although he didn't say anything specifically about using lower prices as a lure. “There’s a bunch of people around the world in countries where we’re not deeply penetrated, and we have more opportunity to go attract them,” Peters said.In that same call, Peters also indicated that Netflix sees little need to drop prices in markets, such as the U.S., where its service already proved its value to long-time subscribers. “We think of ourselves as a non-substitutable good,"" Peters said.Even so, Netflix lost 920,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada last year, leaving it with 74.3 million subscribers in that region at the end of December.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821051,Alabama governor says state will resume executions,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Friday that the state is ready to resume executions and “obtain justice” for victims' families after lethal injections were paused for three months for an internal review of the state's death penalty procedures. 

            The governor in November directed the state prison system to undertake a “top-to-bottom” review of death penalty procedures after the state was forced to cancel three lethal injections because of problems with intravenous lines. Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm told Ivey in a letter shared with news outlets that his staff is ready to resume executions after making internal changes related to staffing and equipment. However, critics argued that the review should have been conducted by an outside group instead of the state agency “responsible for botching multiple executions.” 

            The governor's office did not release a detailed report on the review's finding, but shared the letter from the head of the prison system. Hamm said the prison system is adding to its pool of medical professionals, ordered new equipment and has conducted rehearsals. He also noted changes that will give the execution team more time to complete its duties. The Alabama Supreme Court, at Ivey's request, last month issued a ruling that gives the state more time to carry out a death sentence by allowing the warrants that authorize executions to last for longer than 24 hours.











            In a Friday letter to Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, Ivey wrote that it is “time to resume our duty in carrying out lawful death sentences.” Ivey had asked Marshall to stop seeking execution dates until the review was complete. 

            “Far too many Alabama families have waited for far too long — often for decades — to obtain justice for the loss of a loved one and to obtain closure for themselves,"" Ivey said in the letter, which was also released publicly. ""This brief pause in executions was necessary to make sure that we can successfully deliver that justice and that closure.” 

            Marshall on Friday filed a motion with the Alabama Supreme Court seeking an execution date for James Barber, who was sentenced to death for the 2001 beating death of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps. Marshall said his office would be “seeking death warrants for other murderers in short order.” 

            “In Alabama, we recognize that there are crimes so heinous, atrocious and cruel ... that the only just punishment is death,” Marshall said. 

            Ivey rebuffed requests from a group of faith leaders and advocates to follow the example of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and authorize an independent review of the state's execution procedures. Dozens of attorneys sent a letter to Ivey this week seeking an independent review instead of the internal one she authorized. 

            ""Throughout this process, we have argued that it is unreasonable to believe that the agency responsible for botching multiple executions can thoroughly investigate itself and suggest remedies to correct its own behavior,"" JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama said in a statement. 

            Christine Freeman, executive director of the Middle District of Alabama Federal Defender Program, a nonprofit that represents people on death row, said the result of Ivey's review is “disappointing, but sadly not surprising.” 

            “Instead of acting in the measured manner of the governor of Tennessee, by operating in the open with an independent commission, Alabama has once again chosen to pretend that there are no problems and not disclose what ‘review’ actually occurred,” Freeman wrote in an emailed statement.

            Ivey announced a pause on executions in November after a third lethal injection failed. Executioners were unable to get an intravenous line connected to death row inmate Kenneth Eugene Smith within the 100-minute window between the time courts cleared the way and midnight, when the death warrant expired.

            It was the third such instance of the state calling off an execution because of IV line difficulties. The state completed an execution in July after problems establishing an IV line, but an anti-death penalty group has claimed the execution was botched.

            Hamm said the Department of Corrections reviewed its training for staff and medical workers involved in executions and its legal strategy in litigation; and increased the number of medical personnel utilized by the department for executions and the equipment available to assist them. He said the department also conducted rehearsals and reviewed procedures in other states. 

            Hamm said the vetting process for the new medical personnel will begin immediately. His letter did not elaborate on what duties those workers will perform or what additional equipment was ordered. 

            “I am confident that the Department is prepared as possible to resume carrying out executions consistent with the mandates of the Constitution,"" Hamm wrote. “This is true in spite of the fact that death row inmates will continue seeking to evade their lawfully imposed death sentences.”

            The Alabama Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to an email requesting more information. 

            The independent Tennessee review found the state had not complied with its own lethal injection process ever since it was revised in 2018, resulting in several executions that were conducted without proper testing of the drugs used. A review was also conducted in Oklahoma after the 2014 execution of Clayton Lockett where Lockett struggled on a gurney for 43 minutes before he was declared dead. The review was conducted by a separate state agency from the prison system.MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821052,"Northwestern men back on steady footing, eyeing 2nd NCAA run","EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Like a boxer sprawled on the canvas, Northwestern coach Chris Collins seemed like he was ready for the final bell. It turned out he wasn't quite down for the count.

            These days, Collins is on solid footing. And so are the Wildcats.

            “I fight,” Collins said. “I’m a fighter. I always have been. I’m not a quitter in any sense of the imagination. If I put my heart and energy into something, I’m gonna see it through. ... If you get knocked down, get up. Keep fighting until you’ve got no breath left.”











            The Wildcats (20-8, 11-6 Big Ten) are second in the conference and on course for their second NCAA Tournament appearance in seven years, with a shot to break the program record for wins in a season. They knocked off a team ranked No. 1 in the AP poll for the first time, and with the Big Ten Tournament approaching, they're in an unfamiliar position.

            Northwestern, of all teams, has a target on its back.

            It seems almost hard to believe, considering Collins looked like he might get fired a year ago. Northwestern opted instead to bring him back for a 10th season, sticking with the coach who led the Wildcats to their lone NCAA Tournament appearance to date in 2017. The decision seems to be paying off.

            “Coach is a really, really, really good guy and a really good coach,"" said star guard Boo Buie, who is fifth in the Big Ten at 17.6 points per game. ""He kind of gets the short end of the stick because we are Northwestern and it's a little bit harder to have good sports, just as far as the academics go. I don't think the public eye can really see that all the time, but Coach as been with us from the jump.”

            Collins, whose dad Doug played and coached in the NBA, seemed like the perfect fit when he was hired to replace the fired Bill Carmody in 2013.

            Growing up about 10 miles from Welsh Ryan Arena in suburban Northbrook, he was chosen Mr. Basketball in Illinois. He went on to star at Duke and spent 13 years as an assistant under Mike Krzyzewski before taking over at Northwestern.

            Everything seemed to fall into place his first few seasons. And then, it all fell apart.

            Northwestern won 20 games in back-to-back seasons and made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 2017, beating Vanderbilt before losing to Gonzaga. But instead of emerging as a consistent winner, the Wildcats careened off course.

            Northwestern went 60-90 overall and 26-71 in conference play over the next five seasons. The heat on Collins was so high a year ago that Athletic Director Derrick Gragg released a statement in March saying the coach would get at least one more season to turn around his struggling program.

            Now, Northwestern is on course to finish with its highest win percentage since the 1945-46 team went 15-5. The Wildcats also have a shot at the 2016-17 team's record of 24 wins.

            “We're 10 toes behind Coach,” senior Robbie Beran said. “I believe in him. That's why I'm here. He brought me here.”

            Led by one of the Big Ten's best backcourt combos in Buie and Chase Audige, who’s averaging 14.5 points, Collins thought the team had a chance to be better than outsiders expected.

            A strong showing in Cancun in November in which Northwestern beat Liberty and pushed No. 13 Auburn in a one-point loss boosted that belief. So did the way the team responded following a blowout loss to Pittsburgh at home a few days later.

            Northwestern bounced back by winning at No. 20 Michigan State, another signal to Collins that “there's something there.” It's something they have continued to show.

            This month, the Wildcats beat a No. 1 team for the first time when they knocked off Purdue. They then squeezed past Indiana after blowing a 19-point halftime lead, giving them a program record fourth win over a ranked opponent. Northwestern hadn't beaten Top 25 teams in consecutive games since January 2009.

            “We've been through it all,” Beran said. “We've been through the lows. We've been through the highs. We've had our ups and our downs. And now to see this success just kind of motivates us even more.”

            The question is whether Northwestern can sustain it. That obviously didn't happen the last time the Wildcats had a season like this.

            With most of the top players back from the NCAA team, the 2017-18 Wildcats won just 15 games.

            Collins, who has a 153-158 record, said that group lost “a little bit” of its “competitive edge.” He pointed the finger at himself for not doing a better job leading a team facing high expectations.

            “You just hope to get back to a situation like that again and be better — and be better for your guys,"" he said.

            The school announced Friday the football stadium — which seats 85,000-plus — would host a doubleheader on “Volleyball Day in Nebraska” on Aug. 30. The Cornhuskers will play Omaha in a regular-season match, preceded by a Division II exhibition between Wayne State and Nebraska-Kearney.

            The attendance record is 18,755, set when Nebraska played Wisconsin in the 2021 national championship match in Columbus, Ohio. Wisconsin holds the record for largest regular-season crowd, drawing 16,833 for its match against Florida last September.











            Volleyball by far is the most popular women's sport in Nebraska. The Huskers have won five national titles and sold out an NCAA-record 303 consecutive regular-season matches. They averaged 8,190 fans per match last season and have led the nation in attendance every year since 2013. 

            Wayne State and Nebraska-Kearney rank in the top 10 in Division II attendance.

            Of the 14 largest NCAA regular-season crowds, 13 have involved the Huskers.

            “At Nebraska we’re always aiming to dream big and raise the bar, and there can’t be a much bigger way to do that than to play a match outdoors in a 90,000-seat football stadium,"" coach John Cook said. “We’re excited that we’re going to be able to include three other local schools as well to make it a statewide celebration.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821054,Navajo community wins fight to replace crumbling campus,"TO'HAJIILEE, N.M. (AP) — A school tucked into the sandstone cliffs and juniper-dotted mesas of central New Mexico is fortified on one side by a wall of sandbags and an earthen berm. On the other side, melting snow puddles along the edges of classrooms.

            Inside, caulking, paint and metal plates hide the cracks that have formed over decades in the block walls. With each rainstorm, the nearly century-old To'Hajiilee Community School on the fringes of the Navajo Nation sinks further into the ground.

            The layers of bandages won't have to hold much longer. Residents of the small community off Interstate 40 recently learned that after years of raising flags about the school that lies in a floodplain, the latest federal budget included $90 million for a new campus.











            “It’s just unbelievable that we would ever have anything that great happen,” said Paulene Abeyta, a mother and vice president of the school board.

            To'Hajiilee Community School is just one of about 80 schools funded by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education that are in desperate need of repair or replacement. The agency's priorities stretch across the country with schools in Maine, Wisconsin, North Dakota, New Mexico, Arizona and Washington. 

            The price tag tops $6.2 billion, and the wait is long.

            To'Hajiilee would not have been moved up the priority list last year if not for a community campaign driven by stories of flooded classrooms and playgrounds, relentless calls to Washington, D.C., and invitations for decision-makers to see it in person. Otherwise, another decade would have passed and another generation of students would have walked the same halls.

            “When you see the kids here today and the talent and just the excitement, you think about how limitless the opportunities are for kids if they can just focus on becoming the people that they were meant to be and not have to deal with crumbling classrooms,” said U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico. 

            Stansbury joined school officials, students and parents earlier this month to celebrate the funding. While it puts only a small dent in the bureau's backlog, she said it will mark a new era for the Navajo community.

            Officials hope to break ground in about a year. Already, Abeyta charged the students with dreaming big.

            That means softball fields free of prickly weeds, and ant piles, water bottle filling stations, a gym with long bleachers and a big scoreboard, toilets that flush, motion-sensing sinks, well-equipped classrooms for art and woodworking, a music room filled with instruments and a culinary program with big ovens. 

            School administrator Willinda Castillo said community input will be vital to ensuring success. 

            “The school is, I think, the heart of this community,” she said.

            Generations of To'Hajiilee students have learned Navajo history and language in the school. Plaques outside classroom doors display the grade and subjects taught in Navajo, or Diné. Murals adorn hallways and posters remind students and teachers to integrate Diné as often as possible.

            Many of the students at the recent celebration wore traditional clothing while members of the senior class danced and performed a blessing way song. 

            Students erupted with cheers and stomped their feet on the wooden bleachers when school board members talked about the possibilities ahead.

            Abeyta and others shared stories of teachers fleeing to their vehicles to avoid being stranded as floodwaters washed over the school grounds. Other times, classes were canceled as moats formed around portable buildings and parking lots were submerged. Flooding even washed out the bridge leading to the school.

            Castillo checks the forecast daily and adjusts evacuation plans if needed.

            With the backlog of deferred maintenance across the bureau's system ballooning, To'Hajiilee knew pleading from afar wouldn't be enough — they invited former U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland who now heads the Interior Department, members of Congress and top officials from the Bureau of Indian Education to see the school for themselves. 

            “You know, there’s a lot of times when our voices are not heard, and in order for our voices to be heard we just had to take it upon ourselves,” Castillo said. “I think that’s what made the difference.”

            Stansbury and her staff followed a visit last year with countless emails, regular phone calls and conversations with as many congressional leaders as possible. They had a singular plea as Congress finalized the budget in December — funding for To'Hajiilee. Videos of raging flood waters, damaged foundations and cracked walls helped make the case that students and staff weren't safe.

            The To'Hajiilee campus dates to the 1930s, when the first rock-walled classrooms were erected as part of the federal Works Progress Administration. Those buildings are long gone, having been replaced in the 1950s with buildings that were then overhauled in the 1980s. 

            Larry Holman, To'Hajiilee's administrative services specialist, picked up a section of broken bathroom piping that was sitting on a shelf in his office. It was thick with corrosion and had a crack running down one side — more evidence of the condition of plumbing throughout the school.

            The water gets tested every other week, but it's not potable. The school doles out water bottles daily, creating another expense.

            Along with the new school, the community will be tying into the water supply for Albuquerque, which is New Mexico's largest city about 30 miles (48 kilometers) to the east. 

            “It’s not only about building a new place for this community for kids to go to school, but it will be the place where future generations grow up and become who they are. And, you know, a school can literally transform lives,” Stansbury said.

            The congresswoman, who worked in the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration, rallied lawmakers last year to increase the bureau budget for school construction and repairs. Still, the 2023 budget is a fraction of what advocates say is needed to address deficiencies in a school system that serves more than 45,000 Native students in nearly two dozen states.

            The To'Hajiilee Community School has roots as a federal boarding school. The community itself was settled during the Long Walk when thousands of Navajos endured cold, disease and starvation as the U.S. attempted to relocate them to eastern New Mexico. Some residents say the initial inhabitants of this stretch of high desert were a renegade band of sorts that refused to go farther. They called the spot To'Hajiilee, which translates roughly to “drawing water from a well.”

            While the $90 million cost for a new school was unfathomable to second-graders in Adrianne Keene's class who were learning about money, it's not out of line with construction costs for modern education facilities.

            Keene handed out bags of play coins for the class to count. When asked if they wanted to count to $90 million, the students gasped but didn't hesitate to share their ideas about what they wanted at their new school.

            ""Will we get a new playground?” one girl asked.

            “A rollercoaster!” a boy said.TO'HAJIILEE, N.M. (AP) — A school tucked into the sandstone cliffs and juniper-dotted mesas of central New Mexico is fortified on one side by a wall of sandbags and an earthen berm. On the other side, melting snow puddles along the edges of classrooms.Inside, caulking, paint and metal plates hide the cracks that have formed over decades in the block walls. With each rainstorm, the nearly century-old To'Hajiilee Community School on the fringes of the Navajo Nation sinks further into the ground.The layers of bandages won't have to hold much longer. Residents of the small community off Interstate 40 recently learned that after years of raising flags about the school that lies in a floodplain, the latest federal budget included $90 million for a new campus.“It’s just unbelievable that we would ever have anything that great happen,” said Paulene Abeyta, a mother and vice president of the school board.To'Hajiilee Community School is just one of about 80 schools funded by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education that are in desperate need of repair or replacement. The agency's priorities stretch across the country with schools in Maine, Wisconsin, North Dakota, New Mexico, Arizona and Washington.The price tag tops $6.2 billion, and the wait is long.To'Hajiilee would not have been moved up the priority list last year if not for a community campaign driven by stories of flooded classrooms and playgrounds, relentless calls to Washington, D.C., and invitations for decision-makers to see it in person. Otherwise, another decade would have passed and another generation of students would have walked the same halls.“When you see the kids here today and the talent and just the excitement, you think about how limitless the opportunities are for kids if they can just focus on becoming the people that they were meant to be and not have to deal with crumbling classrooms,” said U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico.Stansbury joined school officials, students and parents earlier this month to celebrate the funding.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821055,UN condemns new surge of gang violence in central Haiti,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A powerful gang has taken over numerous communities in central Haiti in recent weeks, killing at least 69 people and forcing authorities to abandon several police stations, the United Nations said Friday.

            An additional 83 people have been injured amid a surge in violence reported in the Artibonite Valley that officials blame on a local gang called “Baz Gran Grif,” which roughly translates into “Big Claw.”

            The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti known as BINUH said the gang has “established a climate of terror, characterized by looting, assassinations, kidnappings, destruction, extortion, hijacking of goods and trucks and acts of rape on young girls and women.”











            BINUH said it is “alarmed by the speed with which the gang has extended its activities to new areas, and by the fleeing of police in multiple communities.”

            The gang is accused of killing seven officers with Haiti’s National Police in a single day in late January as part of continuing attacks that have forced one hospital that serves some 700,000 people in the region to suspend all services a week ago. Schools also remain closed, while commercial activity and public transportation have slowed, the U.N. said.

            Gang activity had been largely confined to Port-au-Prince, with gangs controlling an estimated 60% of the capital, but they have become increasingly powerful and violent elsewhere.

            U.N. officials said that thousands of people in the central communities of Liancourt, Verrettes, Petite Rivière de l ’Artibonite and Estère have fled to other neighborhoods to escape the ongoing violence.

            “This cycle of violence absolutely must be stopped,” BINUH said. “We urge the authorities to do everything to protect the inhabitants of the region as well as their property.”

            The increase in violence in Haiti’s central region comes as Prime Minister Ariel Henry continues to plead for the deployment of foreign troops, a request first made in October. The international community has instead opted to impose sanctions and send military equipment and other resources.

            Last month, U.N. officials reiterated that gang violence in Haiti has reached a level not seen in decades, and that gangs have grown more powerful since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A powerful gang has taken over numerous communities in central Haiti in recent weeks, killing at least 69 people and forcing authorities to abandon several police stations, the United Nations said Friday.An additional 83 people have been injured amid a surge in violence reported in the Artibonite Valley that officials blame on a local gang called “Baz Gran Grif,” which roughly translates into “Big Claw.”The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti known as BINUH said the gang has “established a climate of terror, characterized by looting, assassinations, kidnappings, destruction, extortion, hijacking of goods and trucks and acts of rape on young girls and women.”BINUH said it is “alarmed by the speed with which the gang has extended its activities to new areas, and by the fleeing of police in multiple communities.”The gang is accused of killing seven officers with Haiti’s National Police in a single day in late January as part of continuing attacks that have forced one hospital that serves some 700,000 people in the region to suspend all services a week ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821056,Yemen: Separatists object to leader's delaying their cause,"CAIRO (AP) — Yemen’s southern separatists on Friday slammed statements by their ally, the head of Yemen's presidential council, in which he said that now is not the right time to discuss southern independence. 

            The comments come as Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition fighting for Yemen’s internationally recognized government that includes the separatists, and their rivals the Houthi rebels are in back-channel talks on the country's wider war. 

            In a statement, the Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of heavily armed and well-financed militias propped up by the United Arab Emirates, said that the comments, “showed a lack of seriousness.""











            It was in response to an interview published on Thursday in the London-based newspaper “Asharq Al-Awsat,"" in which the head of Yemen's Presidential Council Rashid al-Alami said “talking about a solution at this time might not be appropriate,"" in reference to the issue of southern separatism. 

            The council's statement said the ""southern issue cannot be allowed to be moved or delayed,” it said, adding that it would be in violation of previous agreements between the country's internationally recognized government and the council. 

            Reports of revived communications between Yemen's warring sides in the Gulf Arab country of Oman, a traditional mediator in the Middle East, surfaced earlier this year. 

            The separatists, represented by Yemen’s Southern Transitional Council, are an umbrella group of heavily armed and well-financed militias propped up by the United Arab Emirates. Though the UAE is officially part of the Saudi-led coalition, its support for the separatists has threatened the alliance. The separatists enjoy loyalty through much of southern Yemen, and have repeatedly pushed to break up Yemen into two countries, as it was between 1967 and 1990.

            Yemen’s war began in 2014 when the Houthis swept down from their northern stronghold and seized the capital, Sanaa, along with much of the country's north. In response, the Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.

            Al-Alami, a Saudi ally and currently on a diplomatic tour of Europe, became head of Yemen's presidential council last April. He told Asharq Al-Awsat that while he supports Saudi Arabia taking the lead as mediator in the Omani-brokered dialogue, any final peace agreement must be between the internationally recognized government and the Houthi rebels. 

            Yemen's war has killed more than 150,000 people, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, including over 15,000 civilians, and has become a proxy war in the region. It has also spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, pushing the Mideast’s poorest nation into near famine.CAIRO (AP) — Yemen’s southern separatists on Friday slammed statements by their ally, the head of Yemen's presidential council, in which he said that now is not the right time to discuss southern independence.The comments come as Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition fighting for Yemen’s internationally recognized government that includes the separatists, and their rivals the Houthi rebels are in back-channel talks on the country's wider war.In a statement, the Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of heavily armed and well-financed militias propped up by the United Arab Emirates, said that the comments, “showed a lack of seriousness.""It was in response to an interview published on Thursday in the London-based newspaper “Asharq Al-Awsat,"" in which the head of Yemen's Presidential Council Rashid al-Alami said “talking about a solution at this time might not be appropriate,"" in reference to the issue of southern separatism.The council's statement said the ""southern issue cannot be allowed to be moved or delayed,” it said, adding that it would be in violation of previous agreements between the country's internationally recognized government and the council.Reports of revived communications between Yemen's warring sides in the Gulf Arab country of Oman, a traditional mediator in the Middle East, surfaced earlier this year.The separatists, represented by Yemen’s Southern Transitional Council, are an umbrella group of heavily armed and well-financed militias propped up by the United Arab Emirates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821057,Drone strike in Syria kills 2 al-Qaida-linked operatives,"BEIRUT (AP) — A drone strike believed to have been carried out by the U.S.-led coalition in northwestern Syria on Friday killed two operatives with an al-Qaida-linked group, Syrian opposition activists said. 

            The two militants were killed while riding a motorcycle near the northern village of Qah, close to the Turkish border, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, and several other activist collectives.

            There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military. The strike was the latest in a series of attacks over the past years targeting al-Qaida-linked militants in northwestern Syria.











            The opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, said its members extinguished a fire caused by the drone strike, adding that two “unknown persons"" were killed.

            The Observatory said the two were members of Horas al-Din, which is Arabic for “Guardians of Religion.” The group includes hardcore al-Qaida members who broke away from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest insurgent group in Idlib province. Idlib is the last major rebel enclave in war-torn Syria. 

            The Observatory also said that one of the two killed men was an Iraqi citizen.

            In June last year, a drone strike by the U.S.-led coalition in Idlib province killed Abu Hamzah al Yemeni. a senior member of Horas al-Din. 

            In 2017, a U.S. airstrike killed a former aide to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida’s second in command in Syria, Abu al-Kheir al-Masri.

            The former top U.S. envoy to the coalition battling the Islamic State group, Brett McGurk, said at the time when he was in the post that Idlib is the largest al-Qaida haven since bin Laden’s days in Afghanistan.BEIRUT (AP) — A drone strike believed to have been carried out by the U.S.-led coalition in northwestern Syria on Friday killed two operatives with an al-Qaida-linked group, Syrian opposition activists said.The two militants were killed while riding a motorcycle near the northern village of Qah, close to the Turkish border, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, and several other activist collectives.There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821060,"Met Opera scraps set from Russia, builds own for `Lohengrin'","NEW YORK (AP) — Günther Groissböck was about to walk onstage at Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre for the first act of a new “Lohengrin” production last winter when his wife, Isabel, texted that she and their 12-year-old daughter were about to take off on a flight home to Milan.

            “Then she texted me back and said, no, the pilot just announced we are not allowed anymore to enter European airspace,” the Austrian bass recalled. “And then they were trapped because they only had the one entry visa.”

            
                On Feb, 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine 13 hours before the opening performance of François Girard’s staging of the Wagner opera — a production that starts the second half of the Metropolitan Opera’s season on Sunday. The war quickly impacted the cast and audience at the Bolshoi, a short walk from the Kremlin. And would lead the Met to scrap using the Russian set and build a duplicate.











            “Something happened in the theater that night that was incredible — the energy on stage and in the house. At first I thought I had some responsibility in that, and I thought it was like a success,” Girard recalled this week. “But then I think a large part of that energy was a protestation to across the street.”

            Groissböck’s family eventually got home via Istanbul, and Girard left Moscow a day earlier than scheduled.

            Met general manager Peter Gelb had attended the final dress rehearsal in Moscow because the staging was planned as a coproduction of the companies.

            “When I returned to New York and the invasion had begun, I immediately made the decision to sever ties with any official Russian institution or artist associated with (Vladimir) Putin,” Gelb said.

            At a cost of more than $1 million, the Met had another set built by Bay Productions in Cardiff, Wales, and costumes constructed in New York and Hong Kong. Because of the change, technical rehearsals were postponed from August to February.

            Girard is directing his third Wagner opera at the Met, following an acclaimed “Parsifal” in 2013 and a “Der Fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman)” that received mixed reviews in 2020,

            “Lohengrin” is the Met’s most-seen Wagner opera with 717 performances. A minimalist staging by Robert Wilson featuring bars of light premiered in 1998 and replaced an August Everding version dating to 1976. Wilson's staging was revived just twice and was given only 19 total performances, the last in 2006.

            Met music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts a cast this weekend that includes tenor Piotr Beczala in the title role, Groissböck (King Heinrich), bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin (Telramund) and sopranos Tamara Wilson (Elsa) and Christine Goerke (Ortrud),

            ""Lohengrin’ is maybe Wagner’s first attempt at the magic, the ethereal, the celestial, dare I say dreamy music. That is apparent right away from the prelude,” Nézet-Séguin said. “There is an otherworldly quality in both scores. However, `Lohengrin,′ also because probably being earlier than ‘Parsifal,’ also is a confluence of some bel canto.”

            Girard stages the opera in post-apocalyptic times, the prelude accompanied by the moon projected orbiting the earth and then exploding.

            Lohengrin arrives with a projected swan image in the heavens and is wearing the same white dress shirt and dark trousers of the knights in Girard’s “Parsifal” production, signifying he was sent to Brabant by his father, the grail king. Otherworldly power is evident in the first-act sword fight with Telramund, which Lohengrin wins using mental powers rather than a physical weapon.

            Innovative hooded robes designed by Tim Yip, an Academy Award winner for art and set decoration of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” enable the chorus and dancers to change colors. Inside the black cotton outer coat are three silk double-layers that represent which faction the chorus is singing about: green for King Heinrich and royal authority; red for the primitive civilization of Telramund and Ortrud; and white for Lohengrin, Elsa and purity. 

            Chorus members change colors with magnets at hand level.

            “Every costume you have has to fit perfectly,” Yip said. “The hand has to be just there, not like other costumes where you can have a little height adjustment.”

            There are 10 performances through April 1, and the March 18 matinee will be simulcast worldwide.

            Girard is staying in New York to direct the U.S. premiere of Yasushi Inoue’s “The Hunting Gun” at the Baryshnikov Arts Center starting March 16 and then a revival of “Dutchman” at the Met opening May 30. 

            “This music is written for extraterrestrials. It’s not written for human beings,” Girard said. “The more I do Wagner, the more difficult it is for me to even consider going anywhere else in the repertoire.”NEW YORK (AP) — Günther Groissböck was about to walk onstage at Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre for the first act of a new “Lohengrin” production last winter when his wife, Isabel, texted that she and their 12-year-old daughter were about to take off on a flight home to Milan.“Then she texted me back and said, no, the pilot just announced we are not allowed anymore to enter European airspace,” the Austrian bass recalled. “And then they were trapped because they only had the one entry visa.”On Feb, 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine 13 hours before the opening performance of François Girard’s staging of the Wagner opera — a production that starts the second half of the Metropolitan Opera’s season on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821061,Florida man gets 7 years for $2.6M COVID-19 relief fraud,"FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has been sentenced to seven years and three months in federal prison for stealing more than $2.6 million in COVID-19 relief funds.

            Daniel Joseph Tisone, 35, of Naples, was sentenced Tuesday in Fort Myers federal court, court documents show. He pleaded guilty last August to wire fraud, bank fraud, illegal monetary transaction and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.

            “Daniel Joseph Tisone seriously abused three federal programs that used taxpayers’ money to aid struggling small businesses through the pandemic,"" Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery Brian Miller said in a statement. “SIGPR is glad to have played a significant role teaming with other law enforcement agencies and the United States Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. Tisone accountable.”











            Tisone submitted false and fraudulent applications to the Small Business Administration and banks seeking several different kinds of loans between March 2020 and April 2021, according to the documents. Prosecutors said the applications contained false information about Tisone's criminal history, average monthly payroll, number of employees and gross revenues. Tisone also submitted false payroll and tax documents, as well as a fake commercial lease, investigators said.

            Tisone received one Main Street Lending Program loan, four Economic Injury Disaster Loans and five Paycheck Protection Program loans, totaling more than $2.6 million, authorities said. He allegedly used the money to buy two homes in Naples, stocks and investment securities, a 2019 Tiara 34LS boat, a 4.02-carat engagement ring and ammunition. As part of his plea agreement, Tisone must pay back the money and forfeit the homes, boat and ring.

            The Paycheck Protection Program involves billions of dollars in forgivable small-business loans for Americans struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The money must be used to pay employees, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. It is part of the coronavirus relief package that became federal law in 2020.

            The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is designed to provide economic relief to small businesses that are experiencing a temporary loss of revenue. The Main Street Lending Program was designed to provide support to small and medium-size businesses and their employees across the United States during the pandemic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821062,"ACLU, Missouri library groups sue over new school book law","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and two state library associations are suing over a new state law that bans sexually explicit material from schools, saying it violates the rights of librarians and students. 

            The lawsuit filed Thursday contends that the Republican-backed law, which took effect in August, has caused Missouri school districts to remove hundreds of books from their shelves.

            The ACLU, the Missouri Association of School Librarians and the Missouri Library Association are asking the Circuit Court in Kansas City to find the law unconstitutional or clarify how and when it applies. 











            The law was passed as challenges to the content of library books — both in schools and public libraries — have increased across the country over the last two years.

            Missouri's Republican secretary of state, Jay Ashcroft, has proposed a rule that would block public funding for libraries that make “inappropriate” books available to minors. The proposal has been widely condemned by librarians and free speech advocates.

            In the latest lawsuit, the ACLU sued Jean Peters Baker in her role as the Jackson County prosecutor and on behalf of all county prosecutors in Missouri.

            Michael Mansur, a spokesman for Baker's office, said Friday that they had not seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment. 

            Librarians and other school officials face up to a year in jail or a $2,000 fine for violating the policy, which makes it a crime to provide minors with sexually explicit visual material. Exceptions are provided for works of art, science classes and other educational courses.

            The lawsuit also contends that librarians and others could violate the law regardless of whether the material is provided inside or outside of a school building or school hours.

            As of November, about 300 titles had been banned from school libraries across the state, according to the lawsuit. Many of those books were written by or about minority or LGBTQ individuals, but they also include graphic novels, human anatomy books and Holocaust history books.

            The law endangers not only school librarians but public and academic librarians who work with K-12 schools, Joe Kohlburn of the Missouri Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee said in a statement.

            “Librarians have been undermined politically in this state for long enough, and the fear of prosecution is an ongoing issue for keeping qualified professionals in Missouri, as well as bringing new people into the profession,” he said. 

            The ACLU argues that the law violates educators' due process rights because it is unconstitutionally vague and allows government overreach. It also argues that the suit violates students' First Amendment rights. 

            The lawsuit notes that federal and state law already prohibits providing obscene and pornographic materials to minors, and that school boards approve procedures for choosing appropriate library materials.

            “Extreme politicians in Jefferson City are using the government-knows-best model for legislation — in this case telling parents what their children can and can’t read at school and, in some cases, at home, while imposing criminal penalties on those who might disagree,” said Gillian Wilcox, deputy director for litigation for the ACLU of Missouri. 

            Melissa Corey, president of the Missouri Association of School Librarians, said one of the group's major concerns is not only removing books currently on the shelves, but the potential for “a chilling effect” on what books are purchased in the future.KANSAS CITY, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821063,"Moroccan singer convicted of rape in Paris, gets 6-year term","PARIS (AP) — A court in Paris convicted Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred of rape and assault charges Friday and sentenced him to six years in prison. 

            The 37-year-old Lamjarred, who is famous on the Arab pop music scene, had been trial on charges of aggravated rape and assault since Monday. 

            A six-member jury and three magistrates spent seven hours deliberating before the singer was found guilty of raping a French woman at a luxury hotel on the Champs-Elysees in October 2016 while he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. 











            Lamjarred denied the allegations of rape and assault. He acknowledged on the first day of the trial that he “occasionally” used alcohol and drugs at the time but said he had since stopped.

            Lamjarred told the presiding magistrate Friday that he “absolutely did not do what I am accused of,” according to reports in French media. 

            Jean-Marc Descoubes, the victim's lawyer, told reporters at the start of the trial that his client was undergoing treatment but remained strong despite the trauma she sustained. 

            The woman, who was 20 years old at the time, said she met Lamjarred at a Paris nightclub and accompanied him to his hotel, according to a document summarizing the conclusions of the investigation.. 

            She said he hit her several times as she tried to push him back before he raped her, the document said. She managed to leave the room, and hotel staff reported seeing her crying and in distress.

            Lamjarred is one of the Arab world's most popular artists. His music video “Lm3allem” has more than 1 billion views on his YouTube channel, where he has more than 14 million subscribers.

            King Mohammed VI awarded him Morocco’s highest national honor in 2015.

            Lamjarred has also been charged with the aggravated rape of a woman in August 2018 at a nightclub in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera. A trial date has not been set. 

            Feminist activists in North Africa and the Middle East have in recent years led a campaign against Lamjarred as part of the #MeToo movement, leading some of his shows to be canceled in Egypt and elsewhere.PARIS (AP) — A court in Paris convicted Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred of rape and assault charges Friday and sentenced him to six years in prison.The 37-year-old Lamjarred, who is famous on the Arab pop music scene, had been trial on charges of aggravated rape and assault since Monday.A six-member jury and three magistrates spent seven hours deliberating before the singer was found guilty of raping a French woman at a luxury hotel on the Champs-Elysees in October 2016 while he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.Lamjarred denied the allegations of rape and assault.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821064,Nikki Haley keeping early 2024 fundraising numbers quiet,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had a busy first week as an official 2024 presidential candidate, announcing in her native state, then hustling to early voting New Hampshire and Iowa and going on a media blitz.

            But as fundraising starts to build for the potential GOP field, she’s running into a possible home state conflict: donors waiting for the anticipated entrance of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Both Republicans are popular among the state's voters, and some previous Haley donors have said they’re waiting to see if Scott — stockpiling cash that he could ultimately transfer into a presidential bid — enters the race. 

            For now, Haley, who also served as United Nations ambassador during the Trump administration, hasn't revealed how much money she's taken in since her Feb. 15 launch. Her campaign told The Associated Press it was “enormously pleased with our initial fundraising"" but would wait until a April 15 deadline to report a figure for the full first quarter.











            That’s raising some eyebrows. Campaigns typically use their first receipts as bragging points to show their candidates' strength. This year, in what is expected to be a crowded GOP field, donors are looking closely at initial fundraising to assess staying power amid a fierce competition for cash.

            Former President Donald Trump, the first announced GOP presidential candidate in the 2024 race, entered the campaign with tens of millions of dollars in the bank but hasn't released numbers since the end of last year. According to federal filings, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee — the primary fundraising vehicle for his campaign and his leadership PAC — had more than $3.5 million on hand. Make America Great Again Inc., a super PAC that supports Trump, had $54 million in its coffers.

            In the 2020 presidential campaign, several in the broad Democratic field released fundraising for their first 24 hours as candidates. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised nearly $6 million in his first 24 hours, a sum eclipsed a few months later by former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s $6.1 million. Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris took in $1.5 million on her first day.

            Ken Christensen, CEO of Washington-based The Politics Company Inc., a Democratic messaging and fundraising firm, said there are reasons a candidate would want to keep initial fundraising numbers quiet before the Federal Election Commission deadline.

            “Maybe they are simply not raising impressive numbers,” Christensen said. “Or they simply want to pull in as much money as possible before the next FEC reporting period, trying to build a big number for the next FEC report.”

            Typical of all campaigns, Haley has been pursuing donations with phone calls and supporter gatherings, as well as text and email lists.

            Shortly after her announcement, she had the kind of viral moment a Republican can only dream about: a CNN host saying that, as a 51-year-old woman, she was “past her prime” — a comment off which she immediately began fundraising.

            Within hours of the remark by Don Lemon during a discussion of Haley's call for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75, she emailed a fundraising appeal to supporters, decrying him as a “CNN liberal” and including a link to the video clip.

            Days later, she followed up with text and email alerts to supporters, advertising drink koozies with the message, “Past my prime? Hold my beer"" — free with $3 shipping fees.

            Through a political action committee created two years before her presidential campaign, Haley took in more than $17 million, according to federal records, nearly $15 million of which went to operating expenses, like consultant services, staff payroll and rent. About half a million was transferred to other candidates for last year's midterm elections, leaving her PAC with about $2 million at the end of last year.

            What about Scott?

            Running last fall in what he’s said would be his final Senate campaign, Scott raised $43 million, ending the year with nearly $22 million on hand.

            That leftover cash could be transferred to another federal campaign. Additionally, Opportunity Matters Fund, a pro-Scott super PAC, spent more than $20 million to help Republicans in 2022 elections, ending the year with more than $13 million. Tech billionaire has Larry Ellison donated at least $30 million to the organization since 2021, according to federal filings.

            “I think Tim is really good at raising money,” said Chad Walldorf, a Charleston businessman and longtime supporter of both Haley and Scott. “He spends his money wisely, in a way that allows him to have a large political war chest.”

            Donors in South Carolina and beyond may have a difficult time deciding whether to back Haley or Scott, Walldorf said. He said he'll back Scott if he runs.

            “It is a tough choice for a lot of South Carolina Republicans to make between two very well liked South Carolina political figures,” said Walldorf, Haley’s appointee to lead South Carolina’s Board of Economic Advisors. “It’s a very difficult choice to have two people that I consider friends, both of whom I think would be wonderful presidents.”

            Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAPCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had a busy first week as an official 2024 presidential candidate, announcing in her native state, then hustling to early voting New Hampshire and Iowa and going on a media blitz.But as fundraising starts to build for the potential GOP field, she’s running into a possible home state conflict: donors waiting for the anticipated entrance of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Both Republicans are popular among the state's voters, and some previous Haley donors have said they’re waiting to see if Scott — stockpiling cash that he could ultimately transfer into a presidential bid — enters the race.For now, Haley, who also served as United Nations ambassador during the Trump administration, hasn't revealed how much money she's taken in since her Feb. 15 launch. Her campaign told The Associated Press it was “enormously pleased with our initial fundraising"" but would wait until a April 15 deadline to report a figure for the full first quarter.That’s raising some eyebrows. Campaigns typically use their first receipts as bragging points to show their candidates' strength. This year, in what is expected to be a crowded GOP field, donors are looking closely at initial fundraising to assess staying power amid a fierce competition for cash.Former President Donald Trump, the first announced GOP presidential candidate in the 2024 race, entered the campaign with tens of millions of dollars in the bank but hasn't released numbers since the end of last year. According to federal filings, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee — the primary fundraising vehicle for his campaign and his leadership PAC — had more than $3.5 million on hand. Make America Great Again Inc., a super PAC that supports Trump, had $54 million in its coffers.In the 2020 presidential campaign, several in the broad Democratic field released fundraising for their first 24 hours as candidates. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised nearly $6 million in his first 24 hours, a sum eclipsed a few months later by former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s $6.1 million. Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris took in $1.5 million on her first day.Ken Christensen, CEO of Washington-based The Politics Company Inc., a Democratic messaging and fundraising firm, said there are reasons a candidate would want to keep initial fundraising numbers quiet before the Federal Election Commission deadline.“Maybe they are simply not raising impressive numbers,” Christensen said. “Or they simply want to pull in as much money as possible before the next FEC reporting period, trying to build a big number for the next FEC report.”Typical of all campaigns, Haley has been pursuing donations with phone calls and supporter gatherings, as well as text and email lists.Shortly after her announcement, she had the kind of viral moment a Republican can only dream about: a CNN host saying that, as a 51-year-old woman, she was “past her prime” — a comment off which she immediately began fundraising.Within hours of the remark by Don Lemon during a discussion of Haley's call for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75, she emailed a fundraising appeal to supporters, decrying him as a “CNN liberal” and including a link to the video clip.Days later, she followed up with text and email alerts to supporters, advertising drink koozies with the message, “Past my prime?

(AP) — The union for Major League Soccer players criticized FIFA, its rules-making body and the league for failing to allow trials of temporary substitutes to replace players suspected of sustaining concussions.

            The International Football Association Board said Jan. 18 that no consensus was reached on the proposal for trials by MLS and England's Premier League. The IFAB includes four representatives from FIFA and one each from the governing bodies of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

            “FIFA and IFAB’s shortsighted, misguided decision demonstrates once again their failure to prioritize player health and safety in our sport,” the Major League Soccer Players Association said in a statement Friday. “Their refusal to act provides yet another example of global soccer’s broken governance structure.”











            The union maintained current rules “do not provide sufficient time for the proper assessment of players for potential concussions.”

            “Players too often remain in games with head injuries,"" the MLSPA said. ""Medical professionals also agree that the solution to this problem is to provide for temporary concussion substitutes to allow players to be properly evaluated.""

            MLS starts its season Saturday, and the union said the league should have adopted a trial without the IFAB's approval.

            “The league’s lack of courage leaves us with an outdated model that fails to protect players from further injury and allows tradition to triumph over science,” the union said. “It is incumbent upon federations and leagues such as the USSF and MLS to choose for themselves that the time for change is now. Instead, FIFA, IFAB, the USSF and MLS are knowingly putting players at substantial risk. They each deserve to be held accountable.”

            MLS Commissioner Don Garber said Wednesday the league was powerless to act without IFAB approval. He maintained the league was willing to innovate and cited adoption of video review in 2017 as an example.

            “I get it. The global game has got to have the same rules and it's not as easy for us just to introduce on our own,” he said. “We want them to do it. We'll be the first league to say we'll do it, like we tested VAR, the first league to do that, and now that's obviously embraced throughout the sporting world. But I'm optimistic and hope.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821068,Did dioxins spread after the Ohio train derailment?,"After a catastrophic 38-train car derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, some officials are raising concerns about a type of toxic substance that tends to stay in the environment.

            Last week, Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance, the U.S. senators from Ohio, sent a letter to the state’s environmental protection agency expressing concern that dioxins may have been released when some of the chemicals in the damaged railcars were deliberately burned for safety reasons. They joined residents of the small Midwestern town and environmentalists from around the U.S. calling for state and federal environmental agencies to test the soil around the site where the tanker cars tipped over. 

            A look at dioxins, their potential harms and whether they may have been created by burning the vinyl chloride that was on the Norfolk Southern train:











            HIGHLY TOXIC, PERSISENT COMPOUNDS

            Dioxins refer to a group of toxic chemical compounds that can persist in the environment for long periods of time, according to the World Health Organization.

            They are created through combustion and attach to dust particles, which is how they begin to circulate through an ecosystem. 

            Residents near the burn could have been exposed to dioxins in the air that landed on their skin or were breathed into their lungs, said Frederick Guengerich, a toxicologist at Vanderbilt University.

            Skin exposure to high concentrations can cause what’s known as chloracne — an intense skin inflammation, Guengerich said. 

            But the main pathway that dioxin gets into human bodies is not directly through something burning like the contents of the East Palestine tanker cars. It’s through consumption of meat, dairy, fish and shellfish that have become contaminated. That contamination takes time.

            “That’s why it’s important for the authorities to investigate this site now,” said Ted Schettler, a physician with a public health degree who directs the Science and Environmental Health Network, a coalition of environmental organizations. “Because it’s important to determine the extent to which dioxins are present in the soil and the surrounding area.”

            DOES BURNING VINYL CHLORIDE CREATE DIOXINS?

            Linda Birnbaum, a leading dioxins researcher, toxicologist and former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, said that burning vinyl chloride does create dioxins. Other experts agreed the accident could have created them. 

            The “tremendous black plume” seen at East Palestine suggests the combustion process left lots of complex carbon compounds behind, said Murray McBride, a Cornell University soil and crop scientist.

            McBride said it will be hard to say for sure whether these compounds were released until testing is done where the train cars derailed. 

            Which is likely why residents, politicians, environmentalists and public health professionals are all calling for state and federal environmental agencies to conduct testing at the derailment site.

            ROUTES TO THE ENVIRONMENT 

            There is already some level of dioxins in the environment — they can be created by certain industrial processes, or even by people burning trash in their backyards, McBride said.

            Once they are released, dioxins can stick around in soil for decades. They can contaminate plants including crops. They accumulate up the food chain in oils and other fats.

            In East Palestine, it's possible that soot particles from the plume carried dioxins onto nearby farms, where they could stick to the soil, McBride said.

            “If you have grazing animals out there in the field, they will pick up some of the dioxins from soil particles,” he said. “And so some of that gets into their bodies, and then that accumulates in fat tissue.”

            Eventually, those dioxins could make their way up the food chain to human consumers. Bioaccumulation means that more dioxin can get into humans than what's found in the environment after the crash.

            “(Animals) don't metabolize and get rid of dioxins like we do other chemicals,"" Schettler said, and it's stored in the fat of animals that humans eat, like fish, and builds up over time, making the health effects worse.

            SHOULD RESIDENTS BE CONCERNED?

            Birnbaum and Schettler agreed that residents have reason for concern about dioxins from this accident.

            Even though they are present in small amounts from other sources, the large amount of vinyl chloride burned off from the train cars could create more than usual, McBride said.

            “That’s my concern, that there could be an unusual concentration,” he said. “But again, I’m waiting to see if these soils are analyzed.”

            It takes between 7 and 11 years for the chemical to start to break down in the body of a person or animal. And dioxins have been linked with cancer, developmental problems in children and reproductive issues and infertility in adults, according to the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. 

            Still, Guengerich thought that other potential health risks from the derailment — like the concern that exposure to the vinyl chloride itself could cause cancer — may be more pressing than the possible dioxins: “I wouldn't put it at the highest level on my list,” he said.

            Dr. Maureen Lichtveld, dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, agreed that vinyl chloride should be of more concern than dioxins for the public and said that even the mental health of a community rocked by the catastrophic derailment should be a higher public health priority than dioxin exposure.

            As with many environmental exposures, it would be hard to prove any dioxin present came from the derailment. “I think that it would be virtually impossible .... to attribute any presence of dioxin to this particular burn,"" she said.

            But most experts thought it was important to test the soils for dioxins — even though that process can be difficult and costly.

            The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group. The AP is solely responsible for all content.After a catastrophic 38-train car derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, some officials are raising concerns about a type of toxic substance that tends to stay in the environment.Last week, Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance, the U.S. senators from Ohio, sent a letter to the state’s environmental protection agency expressing concern that dioxins may have been released when some of the chemicals in the damaged railcars were deliberately burned for safety reasons. They joined residents of the small Midwestern town and environmentalists from around the U.S. calling for state and federal environmental agencies to test the soil around the site where the tanker cars tipped over.A look at dioxins, their potential harms and whether they may have been created by burning the vinyl chloride that was on the Norfolk Southern train:HIGHLY TOXIC, PERSISENT COMPOUNDSDioxins refer to a group of toxic chemical compounds that can persist in the environment for long periods of time, according to the World Health Organization.They are created through combustion and attach to dust particles, which is how they begin to circulate through an ecosystem.Residents near the burn could have been exposed to dioxins in the air that landed on their skin or were breathed into their lungs, said Frederick Guengerich, a toxicologist at Vanderbilt University.Skin exposure to high concentrations can cause what’s known as chloracne — an intense skin inflammation, Guengerich said.But the main pathway that dioxin gets into human bodies is not directly through something burning like the contents of the East Palestine tanker cars. It’s through consumption of meat, dairy, fish and shellfish that have become contaminated. That contamination takes time.“That’s why it’s important for the authorities to investigate this site now,” said Ted Schettler, a physician with a public health degree who directs the Science and Environmental Health Network, a coalition of environmental organizations. “Because it’s important to determine the extent to which dioxins are present in the soil and the surrounding area.”DOES BURNING VINYL CHLORIDE CREATE DIOXINS?Linda Birnbaum, a leading dioxins researcher, toxicologist and former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, said that burning vinyl chloride does create dioxins. Other experts agreed the accident could have created them.The “tremendous black plume” seen at East Palestine suggests the combustion process left lots of complex carbon compounds behind, said Murray McBride, a Cornell University soil and crop scientist.McBride said it will be hard to say for sure whether these compounds were released until testing is done where the train cars derailed.Which is likely why residents, politicians, environmentalists and public health professionals are all calling for state and federal environmental agencies to conduct testing at the derailment site.ROUTES TO THE ENVIRONMENTThere is already some level of dioxins in the environment — they can be created by certain industrial processes, or even by people burning trash in their backyards, McBride said.Once they are released, dioxins can stick around in soil for decades. They can contaminate plants including crops. They accumulate up the food chain in oils and other fats.In East Palestine, it's possible that soot particles from the plume carried dioxins onto nearby farms, where they could stick to the soil, McBride said.“If you have grazing animals out there in the field, they will pick up some of the dioxins from soil particles,” he said. “And so some of that gets into their bodies, and then that accumulates in fat tissue.”Eventually, those dioxins could make their way up the food chain to human consumers. Bioaccumulation means that more dioxin can get into humans than what's found in the environment after the crash.“(Animals) don't metabolize and get rid of dioxins like we do other chemicals,"" Schettler said, and it's stored in the fat of animals that humans eat, like fish, and builds up over time, making the health effects worse.SHOULD RESIDENTS BE CONCERNED?Birnbaum and Schettler agreed that residents have reason for concern about dioxins from this accident.Even though they are present in small amounts from other sources, the large amount of vinyl chloride burned off from the train cars could create more than usual, McBride said.“That’s my concern, that there could be an unusual concentration,” he said. “But again, I’m waiting to see if these soils are analyzed.”It takes between 7 and 11 years for the chemical to start to break down in the body of a person or animal. And dioxins have been linked with cancer, developmental problems in children and reproductive issues and infertility in adults, according to the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.Still, Guengerich thought that other potential health risks from the derailment — like the concern that exposure to the vinyl chloride itself could cause cancer — may be more pressing than the possible dioxins: “I wouldn't put it at the highest level on my list,” he said.Dr. Maureen Lichtveld, dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, agreed that vinyl chloride should be of more concern than dioxins for the public and said that even the mental health of a community rocked by the catastrophic derailment should be a higher public health priority than dioxin exposure.As with many environmental exposures, it would be hard to prove any dioxin present came from the derailment. “I think that it would be virtually impossible .... to attribute any presence of dioxin to this particular burn,"" she said.But most experts thought it was important to test the soils for dioxins — even though that process can be difficult and costly.“The conditions are absolutely right for dioxins to have been formed,"" Schettler said. ""It’s going to be terribly important to determine that from a public health perspective, and to reassure the community.”___Follow Maddie Burakoff and Drew Costley on Twitter: @maddieburakoff and @drewcostley.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

            That meant Ansu will likely be unavailable for the Spanish league game at Almeria on Sunday, when Barcelona tries to protect its eight-point lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821071,Russian delegates defiant at hostile OSCE assembly meeting,"VIENNA, Austria (AP) — A contentious Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe parliamentary meeting ended Friday with condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — as Russian delegates accused the West of preventing dialogue by arming Kyiv.

            The Parliamentary Assembly of the 57-nation OSCE brought together lawmakers from member countries — including Russia — to discuss security and human rights issues at its annual winter gathering, which coincided with the anniversary of the invasion.

            Ukraine and Lithuania boycotted the meeting in Vienna due to the presence of six Russian delegates, who were given visas by Austria despite being under European Union and United States sanctions.











            “We think it is immoral to sit in the same hall with war criminals who openly support the genocide of Ukraine,” Yevheniia Kravchuk, a Ukrainian lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told The Associated Press in Vienna.

            Kravchuk said Russia had “violated every single letter” of the OSCE’s founding document and should be suspended from the organization.

            Russian delegates told reporters in Vienna that their country was crucial to the work of OSCE, which was created during the Cold War and helped to ease tensions between East and West by providing a platform for dialogue.

            “Addressing the problems of European security without the biggest country in Europe is not possible,” said Deputy Duma Chairman Pyotr Tolstoy, the head of the Russian delegation.

            He accused the West of preventing dialogue by backing Ukraine on the battlefield and questioned whether Russia should continue to pay its annual contribution to OSCE.

            Vladimir Dzhabarov, the deputy head of the Russian delegation, noted that Russia was a founding member of the organization. 

            “They will not be able to put us outside the door,” he said, adding that if Russia were isolated, a new organization for security in Europe would have to be established.

            The controversy over Russia’s participation overshadowed the two-day meeting and underlined the OSCE’s paralysis since the start of the war.

            The Russian delegation was seated with Belarusian lawmakers in the last row of the meeting room inside Austria’s former imperial palace, the Hofburg, which was decorated with Ukrainian ribbons and banners. Many western delegates were dressed in the blue and yellow of Ukraine's flag.

            As Russian participants spoke during the session, some delegates walked out or waved Ukrainian flags.

            In a statement at the end of the meeting, the assembly’s president, vice-presidents and other officials denounced “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as constituting clear, gross, and uncorrected violations"" of its OSCE commitments.

            Assembly President Margareta Cederfelt said she felt sympathy for “the fact that some members find it unbearable to sit in the same room as the aggressors.”

            Austria’s government said that as the OSCE host nation it is legally obliged to grant visas to representatives from all member states – even those under international sanctions.

            The OSCE has a wide-ranging mission including conflict prevention, human rights, election observation and arms control. The parliamentary assembly is a separate body of the organization.

            The OSCE’s work has ground to a halt in the past year, with Russia blocking all major decisions, including the adoption of the budget and refusing to agree to Lithuania assuming the group’s rotating chairmanship in 2024.

            Russia has also used its veto to block the extension of the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, the OSCE’s flagship operation in Ukraine which had been engaged in monitoring the fragile ceasefire in the east of the country before the full-scale invasion last year.

            Ukraine wants to change the Parliamentary Assembly’s rules so that any OSCE member that starts a war against another can be suspended.

            Kravchuk, the Ukrainian lawmaker, said the existing rules were set up during a time when “all countries respected the borders and the sovereignty of other nations and did not come with jets and tanks to take away their state.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821075,"E-bike batteries blamed for 22 NYC fires, 2 deaths this year","NEW YORK (AP) — Lithium ion batteries used to power electric bicycles and scooters have already sparked 22 fires that caused 36 injuries and two deaths in New York City this year, four times the number of fires linked to the batteries by this time last year, officials said Friday.

            Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said Mayor Eric Adams' administration is “coming at this problem from every single angle,” including working with the City Council and the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission on additional regulations for the batteries and educating the public on their proper use and storage.

            “These are incredibly dangerous devices, and we must make sure that members of the community are handling them properly and using them safely,” Kavanagh said at a briefing on public safety.











            Many of the fires blamed on the batteries have been caused by malfunctioning devices left to charge overnight and placed in a hallway or near a door where they can trap people inside a burning apartment.

            Three children and an adult were injured this month when a charging battery started a fire in their upper Manhattan apartment at 1:30 a.m., officials said.

            Fire Department Chief of Operations John Esposito said after the Feb. 5 blaze that when the battery overheated and sparked a fire, ""it blocked the egress out of the apartment, trapping the family.”

            Kavanagh said the e-bike batteries “present often an immediate inability to exit one’s room or one’s apartment or one’s home. So it’s really critical that we work with all our partners up here in government around enforcement, around education, around combating the hazards that these present to citizens and first responders.”NEW YORK (AP) — Lithium ion batteries used to power electric bicycles and scooters have already sparked 22 fires that caused 36 injuries and two deaths in New York City this year, four times the number of fires linked to the batteries by this time last year, officials said Friday.Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said Mayor Eric Adams' administration is “coming at this problem from every single angle,” including working with the City Council and the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission on additional regulations for the batteries and educating the public on their proper use and storage.“These are incredibly dangerous devices, and we must make sure that members of the community are handling them properly and using them safely,” Kavanagh said at a briefing on public safety.Many of the fires blamed on the batteries have been caused by malfunctioning devices left to charge overnight and placed in a hallway or near a door where they can trap people inside a burning apartment.Three children and an adult were injured this month when a charging battery started a fire in their upper Manhattan apartment at 1:30 a.m., officials said.Fire Department Chief of Operations John Esposito said after the Feb. 5 blaze that when the battery overheated and sparked a fire, ""it blocked the egress out of the apartment, trapping the family.”Kavanagh said the e-bike batteries “present often an immediate inability to exit one’s room or one’s apartment or one’s home.

            The league and the teams said later Friday that the match has been rescheduled for July 4.

            Southern California has been pounded by heavy rain and wind. It could also be hit with as much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow in the higher elevations.











            The game was expected to possibly break the league's single-game attendance mark of 73,019 that was set last season when Charlotte FC hosted its first match against the Galaxy. 

            The rivalry known as El Trafico was also the signature match on the first day of the new season. 

            A match between the Portland Timbers and Sporting Kansas City that had also been scheduled for Saturday was moved to Monday because of the weather.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821078,US judge won't block huge lithium mine on Nevada-Oregon line,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A federal judge has sided again with the Biden administration and a Canadian-based mining company in a high-stakes legal battle with environmentalists and tribal leaders trying to block a huge lithium mine in Nevada near the Oregon line.

            U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno denied the opponents' request Friday for an emergency injunction to prohibit work at the largest known lithium deposit in the nation until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals can hear their latest appeal. 

            Her ruling clears the way for Lithium Americas' subsidiary Lithium Nevada to begin construction as early as next week at the mine they say would speed production of raw materials for electric vehicle batteries critical to combatting climate change.











            Opponents say the mine would destroy key wildlife habitat and sacred cultural treasures, harm groundwater and pollute the air.

            The conflict is driven largely by what Du described Friday as “tension” between environmental and economic trade-offs associated with efforts to speed the transition from fossil fuels emitting greenhouse gases to cleaner, renewable energy sources. It also wades into evolving legal interpretations of the reach of a 150-year-old mining law that could eventually prove more onerous to mining companies.

            Her new ruling marks the third time in two years she has refused to grant injunctions sought by the conservationists, Native American tribes and a Nevada rancher who lives near the mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of Reno.

            Opponents argued in their request for an emergency court order last week that without it, the developer would begin to rip up a high-desert sea of sagebrush that holds some of the most critical habitat still intact for the dwindling sage grouse in the West.

            Du said she denied the latest request because she concluded the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on an appeal challenging her Feb. 6 ruling that found the Bureau of Land Management complied with federal law — with one exception — when it approved plans for the Thacker Pass mine in January 2021.

            Du said in Friday’s 11-page ruling that she understood when she issued her decision earlier this month that it meant “Lithium Nevada could start construction on the project, and thus disrupt the sagebrush ecosystem within the project area.”

            “The court indeed expects that Lithium Nevada unfortunately will soon begin ripping out sage brush that will not grow back for a very long time,” she wrote.

            Du said the government and Lithium Nevada argue that the project will “on balance, be environmentally beneficial because the lithium produced from the mine will enable various clean technologies.”

            “And there is, if nothing else, a tension between the macro environmental benefit that could result from the project and the micro (relatively speaking) environmental harm that will likely flow from"" allowing the mine to go forward, she said. “This court does not resolve that tension here.”

            The environmentalists' latest challenge centered on the reach of mining rights claimed under the 1872 Mining Law to neighboring lands where a developer plans to dispose of waste rock and tailings — in this case, 1,300 acres (526 hectares) where waste would be dumped from an open pit mine as deep as the length of a football field.

            Last year, in a potentially precedent-settling ruling, the 9th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that voided the Forest Service's approval of Rosemont Copper's mine in Arizona because the service failed to establish — or even consider — whether the company had valid rights where the waste dump was planned.

            Both the service and the Bureau of Land Management long have maintained the same mining rights automatically extend to such lands.

            Du said in her Feb. 6 ruling she was adopting the 9th Circuit's new standard, but instead of vacating BLM's approval of the Thacker Pass mine, she directed the agency to go back and determine whether such rights exist on the neighboring land.

            Opponents of the mine said that instead of allowing BLM to revisit that matter and “fix its error,” she should have ordered a “wholesale re-evaluation” of the entire mining project.

            Because the company has no rights to dump waste on the neighboring lands, BLM “approved what is now essentially half a mine,” they said in their final brief filed Thursday.

            Without an injunction, Lithium Nevada “will consider itself free to blast and excavate the mine pit, construct the sulfuric acid processing plant and build other facilities on thousands of acres of public land, to produce waste rock and tailings with nowhere to legally put them,” they said.

            Du said Friday she allowed BLM to revisit the matter partly because the 9th Circuit's latest interpretation of the law came more than a year after the agency approved the Thacker Pass mine, and partly because of the “serious possibility that BLM could fix its error.”RENO, Nev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821080,"British Airways, Iberia parent swings to full-year profit","LONDON (AP) — The parent of British Airways reported its first full-year profit since the start of the pandemic as COVID-19 travel restrictions were eased and said it continues to see strong bookings for leisure travel. 

            International Consolidated Airlines Group, which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Vueling and Irish carrier Aer Lingus, said Friday that it expects adjusted profit to grow this year after a weak first quarter.

            CEO Luis Gallego said that although bookings are strong so far in 2023, business travel still lags behind leisure travel, which contributes to the company's outlook for a first-quarter operating loss of about 200 million euros ($211 million).











            Still, IAG forecast full-year operating profit — which excludes certain costs — to be between 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to 2.3 billion euros ($2.4 billion), up from 1.26 billion ($1.33 billion) in 2022.

            The recovery at the Anglo-Spanish company follows similar upbeat reports from other airlines including Air France-KLM that have seen their fortunes improve on strong travel demand coming out of the worst part of the pandemic. 

            IAG said it earned an after-tax profit of 232 million euros ($245 million) in the fourth quarter and 431 million euros ($455 million) for the full year. Analysts expected full-year earnings of 397 million euros ($419 million), according to a FactSet survey. The company lost 2.93 billion euros ($3.09 billion) in 2021.

            Full-year revenue nearly tripled, to more than 23 billion euros ($24.3 billion). 

            The company's airlines were back to about 87% of pre-pandemic flying by the end of last year. The drop was sharpest at British Airways, partly because of traffic limits at London's Heathrow Airport, which struggled to cope with rising demand.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821095,Penguins GM Hextall understands anger amid calls for firing,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Ron Hextall grew accustomed to being booed long ago during his lengthy playing career. He's not going to let growing frustration from Pittsburgh's fan base sway him from how he goes about doing his job.

            Chants of “Fire Hextall” erupted several times inside PPG Paints Arena on Thursday night as the Penguins were in the midst of getting blown out 7-2 by the Edmonton Oilers. Pittsburgh's fourth straight loss dropped the Penguins to 10th in the Eastern Conference with less than two months to go in the regular season.

            “We have high expectations and we haven’t met them,” Hextall said Friday. ""People pay good money to come to the rink and they have the right to chant and say whatever they choose. It’s not going to affect anything I do ... Criticism is part of the business.”











            Hextall reiterated that he plans to approach next week's trade deadline looking for deals that could improve the Penguins both this season and in the future. Translation: He's looking for players whose contract extends beyond this season and he's reluctant to part with draft picks to do it.

            “We are going to do everything we can to improve the team,” Hextall said. ""We’re not looking to spend big assets on rentals. If we’re going to spend, it’s going to help us this year and in years to come.”

            The Penguins have made the playoffs 16 straight years, the longest active streak in major North American professional sports. They have been erratic for most of this season and are just 9-12-5 since Dec. 18.

            “The hardest thing with our team right now is probably the volatility,” Hextall said. “It’s a tough one quite frankly to put a finger on. ... We’ve showed we’re capable of being a very good team.”

            Just not consistently. The Penguins were booed repeatedly Thursday. Even longtime captain Sidney Crosby wasn't immune as a sellout crowd roared in dismay after he opted not to shoot from in close during a power play in the second period.

            Crosby shrugged off the angst afterward, saying simply “It was a tough night for everybody.”

            Forward Kasperi Kapanen perhaps most of all. The game could be his last in Pittsburgh after the team placed him on waivers Friday, in part to clear salary cap space for defenseman Jan Rutta, who could return to the lineup Saturday in St. Louis.

            Kapanen, signed to a two-year deal with an average annual value of $3.2 million, has seven goals and 13 assists in 43 games for the Penguins. His struggles have been symbolic of a team that has had trouble generating offense outside of the top two lines anchored by Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.

            “I think he can be a productive player, unfortunately, it hasn’t worked here,” Hextall said of Kapanen. ""Tough decisions have to be made along the way and that’s what this was with Kap.”

If we’re going to spend, it’s going to help us this year and in years to come.”The Penguins have made the playoffs 16 straight years, the longest active streak in major North American professional sports. They have been erratic for most of this season and are just 9-12-5 since Dec. 18.“The hardest thing with our team right now is probably the volatility,” Hextall said. “It’s a tough one quite frankly to put a finger on. ... We’ve showed we’re capable of being a very good team.”Just not consistently. The Penguins were booed repeatedly Thursday. Even longtime captain Sidney Crosby wasn't immune as a sellout crowd roared in dismay after he opted not to shoot from in close during a power play in the second period.Crosby shrugged off the angst afterward, saying simply “It was a tough night for everybody.”Forward Kasperi Kapanen perhaps most of all. The game could be his last in Pittsburgh after the team placed him on waivers Friday, in part to clear salary cap space for defenseman Jan Rutta, who could return to the lineup Saturday in St. Louis.Kapanen, signed to a two-year deal with an average annual value of $3.2 million, has seven goals and 13 assists in 43 games for the Penguins. His struggles have been symbolic of a team that has had trouble generating offense outside of the top two lines anchored by Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.“I think he can be a productive player, unfortunately, it hasn’t worked here,” Hextall said of Kapanen.

            Beathard spent the last two seasons as Trevor Lawrence's backup. He played in six games, with most of the work coming in mop-up duty. He's 2-10 as an NFL starter, with all 12 starts coming during his three seasons with San Francisco.

            The grandson of longtime NFL general manager Bobby Beathard signed a two-year, $5 million deal with Jacksonville in March 2021 — a month before the Jaguars chose Lawrence with the No. 1 overall pick.











            Beathard has completed 300 of 510 passes for 3,537 yards, with 18 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He was a third-round draft pick by the 49ers in 2017.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821097,Bill signed for West Virginia renewable energy battery plant,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia's governor on Friday signed a bill that gives $105 million in state funding for a renewable energy battery plant in a former steel town.

            Gov. Jim Justice signed the bill at the site of Form Energy's planned manufacturing facility in the Northern Panhandle community of Weirton. The 55-acre plant will produce iron-air batteries and is anticipated to create at least 750 jobs in a $760 million investment.

            “It will transform this community in every positive way you can imagine,"" Justice said.











            The state's total commitment for the project is $290 million, including $75 million already invested in purchasing the property and to start infrastructure work. 

            Weirton Steel, which operated a nearly 800-acre property along the Ohio River in the town of about 19,000 residents, employed about 13,000 workers around the start of World War II. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2003.

            “We are honored to pick up the legacy of this historic location and carry forward the tradition on manufacturing on this phenomenal site,"" Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said. “The model of the town of Weirton is success and unity, and that’s how we see this project going forward. We’re committed to the long haul.”

            It’s the first full-scale plant for Massachusetts-based Form Energy, whose pilot manufacturing facility is about an hour away from Weirton in southwestern Pennsylvania.

            Jaramillo has said Form Energy focuses on energy storage technology and manufacturing. It has developed a battery whose active components are iron, water and air and is capable of storing electricity for 100 hours. Jaramillo led automaker Tesla ’s powertrain business development program until 2016.

            Over the next decade, the company’s goal for the battery is to unlock demand for multiday energy storage for the U.S. power grid.

            Form Energy is expected to begin construction this year, with the manufacturing of battery systems set to start in 2024. The company has several prominent investors, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and it has stated opposition to fossil fuels. 

            It's another representation of the ongoing shift in coal-rich West Virginia as state leaders seek businesses that use cleaner forms of energy while preserving the state’s roots. In the past year, the state has seen several major announcements for alternative energy projects, including green battery plants and a Warren Buffett-backed industrial park powered by renewable energy.

            West Virginia has lost thousands of coal mining jobs over the past decade as companies and utilities explore using other energy sources such as natural gas, solar and wind.

            ENGLAND

            Arsenal will try to bolster its lead of the Premier League when it visits Leicester. Key midfielder Thomas Partey could return for Arsenal, which has a two-point gap and a game in hand on Manchester City. Second-placed City plays at relegation-threatened Bournemouth. Leeds is just one point above last-placed Southampton. Saints visit Elland Road after beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last week. Aston Villa visits Everton. West Ham hosts Nottingham Forest. In the nightcap, Liverpool will try to bounce back from a stunning 5-2 loss at home to Real Madrid in the Champions League when it takes on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.











            SPAIN

            Real Madrid hosts Atletico Madrid needing to win the capital derby to ensure it keeps Barcelona in striking distance and its league title defense alive. Barcelona leads the defending champion by eight points and visits modest Almeria on Sunday. Atletico is out of title contention but fighting for a top-four finish to keep its Champions League spot. Atletico has not won at the Santiago Bernabéu since 2016. Its last loss there came a month ago in the Copa del Rey. Third-placed Real Sociedad will be hoping to either move closer to Real or further from Atletico with a win at a struggling Valencia that has lost five in a row to slide into the drop zone. Rayo Vallecano aims to continue its surprisingly strong campaign when it visits a Cadiz in need of a point to escape the relegation one. Mallorca also visits Espanyol with coach Javier Aguirre facing one of his former teams.

            ITALY

            Runaway league leader Napoli can extend its advantage to 18 points with a win at Empoli, which needs a result to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight. Napoli is on a six-match winning streak in all competitions and has conceded just one goal in those matches. Moreover, league leading scorer Victor Osimhen has 10 in his past nine matches for Napoli. Empoli is winless in its past four Serie A matches to leave it 11 points above the bottom three. Lecce is just a point behind Empoli and is full of confidence after holding Roma to a draw and beating Atalanta in its last two matches. Lecce hosts Sassuolo, which is just seven points above the drop zone. 

            GERMANY

            Borussia Dortmund can go top of the Bundesliga with a win over struggling Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich's poor start to 2023 has allowed Dortmund to close the gap and it's only behind Bayern on goal difference. American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo has lost both of his first two games at Hoffenheim, which is without a win since October. Leipzig hosts Eintracht Frankfurt in a meeting of teams who are still fighting in the Champions League and in a tight battle to qualify for next season's competition. Wolfsburg is without a win in five games before it plays Cologne. In games that could be key to the relegation fight, Schalke plays Stuttgart, Werder Bremen hosts Bochum and Hertha Berlin takes on Augsburg.

            FRANCE

            After losing its grip on second place following a shaky run of form, Lens needs to put a run of wins together to get back in the hunt for an automatic Champions League spot next season. Victory at Montpellier will lift northern side Lens over Monaco and into third place. But Montpellier has improved since coach Michel Der Zakarian returned to take charge again and the southern side seeks a third straight win. In the other game, rock-bottom Angers is on a 16-game winless streak as it hosts Lyon.

            The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection is working with state and local agencies to collect and analyze samples of the dust-like substance, which was reported in the state’s Eastern Panhandle, about 100 miles west of Washington, D.C., according to a statement issued Friday.

            The agency began investigating after residents reported seeing the substance across multiple counties late Thursday night. 











            Social media users posted about seeing the powder in the air and on cars on Friday in West Virginia, northern Virginia and Maryland.

            A state lab in West Virginia will test the dust to determine if it's related to recent dust storms in the Midwest, the Department of Environmental Protection statement said.

            The Maryland Department of the Environment acknowledged the reports in a statement, saying the likely explanation was dust from Texas and New Mexico. The agency said a shift in wind has since brought clean air from Canada, and that monitoring systems on Friday recorded good air quality.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821103,N. Carolina magnate accused of scheme to skim company funds,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina business magnate has been indicted again on federal criminal charges, this time on accusations that he conspired to skim large amounts of money from his insurance companies, then lied about it to regulators to hide the scheme with two co-conspirators. 

            A 13-count grand jury indictment in Charlotte was filed Thursday against Greg E. Lindberg of Durham, whom federal prosecutors allege has defrauded thousands of policyholders, news outlets reported. 

            “The indictment reveals a carefully orchestrated scheme that relied on a web of complex financial investments and transactions designed to evade regulators, disguise the financial health of Lindberg’s insurance companies, and conceal the alleged purpose of the scheme: Lindberg’s personal gain,” western North Carolina U.S. Attorney Dena King said after the indictment was made public Friday. 











            The counts include wire fraud, conspiracy, money-laundering conspiracy, making false insurance business statements to regulators and making false entries about insurance business finances.

            Lindberg, 53, already is facing in the fall a retrial on federal charges accusing him of attempting to bribe North Carolina's insurance commissioner to secure preferential regulatory treatment for his insurance business. Before the 2019 indictment on these charges, Lindberg had given millions of dollars to North Carolina candidate and party committees and independent expenditure groups. 

            An appeals court last June overturned those 2020 corruption-related convictions, and soon after he was released from an Alabama prison where he had been serving a seven-year sentence. With the latest indictment, an arrest warrant was issued Thursday for Lindberg. 

            A Lindberg spokesperson called the latest charges “piling on” by the government because it has a weak case against Lindberg at retrial. An appeals court panel ruled the trial judge erred by giving jurors in Lindberg’s trial misleading instructions before they began deliberations. 

            According to prosecutors and the latest indictment, Lindberg and others agreed from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 to defraud insurance companies, other third parties and policyholders. In 2017-18 Lindberg and his co-conspirators used loans and related transactions to skim “hundreds of millions of dollars” from his insurance companies to buy and operate other Lindberg firms, the indictment alleges. 

            Lindberg deceived the state Insurance Department and other regulators and improperly used insurance company funds for his personal benefit, the government alleges. Lindberg allegedly personally benefited by using company funds to finance “his lavish lifestyle” through real estate purchases and forgiving over $125 million in loans from his affiliated companies to himself, according to a U.S. Justice Department release. 

            Lindberg spokesperson Susan Estrich said the “the latest charges stem from the government’s spending over five years going through over 7 million documents on literally thousands of complicated financial transactions involving over 900 companies and handpicking alleged technical violations which have not caused any loss to policyholders in North Carolina or any other state for that matter.”

            Estrich also provided a statement from Lindberg, who said: “I invested over $500 million in my insurance companies. I never took a penny of dividends. The allegation that I somehow defrauded them while investing $500 million in them and taking no dividends is entirely absurd.”

            Last August, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Lindberg, an associate and their investment advisory firm of defrauding clients out of over $75 million through complex schemes involving undisclosed transactions. 

            And in December, that associate – identified as Christopher Herwig – pleaded guilty in Charlotte federal courts to conspiracy to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned. 

            Herwig is identified as one of the two co-conspirators in this week’s indictment of Lindberg. The other alleged co-conspirator — identified as Devin Solow — had been formally accused by federal prosecutors of conspiracy in a bill of information unsealed last month. But Solow's attorney and King's office also wrote that the government and Solow had entered a deferred prosecution agreement whereby the bill would be dismissed in five years if Solow complies with the agreement, which includes promising to cooperate with prosecutors.CHARLOTTE, N.C.

With the latest indictment, an arrest warrant was issued Thursday for Lindberg.A Lindberg spokesperson called the latest charges “piling on” by the government because it has a weak case against Lindberg at retrial. An appeals court panel ruled the trial judge erred by giving jurors in Lindberg’s trial misleading instructions before they began deliberations.According to prosecutors and the latest indictment, Lindberg and others agreed from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 to defraud insurance companies, other third parties and policyholders. In 2017-18 Lindberg and his co-conspirators used loans and related transactions to skim “hundreds of millions of dollars” from his insurance companies to buy and operate other Lindberg firms, the indictment alleges.Lindberg deceived the state Insurance Department and other regulators and improperly used insurance company funds for his personal benefit, the government alleges. Lindberg allegedly personally benefited by using company funds to finance “his lavish lifestyle” through real estate purchases and forgiving over $125 million in loans from his affiliated companies to himself, according to a U.S. Justice Department release.Lindberg spokesperson Susan Estrich said the “the latest charges stem from the government’s spending over five years going through over 7 million documents on literally thousands of complicated financial transactions involving over 900 companies and handpicking alleged technical violations which have not caused any loss to policyholders in North Carolina or any other state for that matter.”Estrich also provided a statement from Lindberg, who said: “I invested over $500 million in my insurance companies. I never took a penny of dividends. The allegation that I somehow defrauded them while investing $500 million in them and taking no dividends is entirely absurd.”Last August, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Lindberg, an associate and their investment advisory firm of defrauding clients out of over $75 million through complex schemes involving undisclosed transactions.And in December, that associate – identified as Christopher Herwig – pleaded guilty in Charlotte federal courts to conspiracy to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned.Herwig is identified as one of the two co-conspirators in this week’s indictment of Lindberg. The other alleged co-conspirator — identified as Devin Solow — had been formally accused by federal prosecutors of conspiracy in a bill of information unsealed last month. But Solow's attorney and King's office also wrote that the government and Solow had entered a deferred prosecution agreement whereby the bill would be dismissed in five years if Solow complies with the agreement, which includes promising to cooperate with prosecutors.",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821104,Panthers' Knight to get care from player assistance program,"NEW YORK (AP) — Florida Panthers goaltender Spencer Knight is out indefinitely while he receives care from the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program.

            The league and Players’ Association announced Knight’s absence Friday.

            Knight will continue to be paid while receiving treatment. He can return to the team once he is cleared for on-ice competition by program administrators.











            The 21-year-old from Connecticut was sent to the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League earlier this week in a salary cap-related transaction to clear salary cap space for the season debut of forward Anthony Duclair, who is coming back from tearing an Achilles tendon.

            Knight is in his second full season in the NHL, sharing responsibilities in net with veteran goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. He has started in 19 games and appeared in 21, going 9-8-3 with a 3.18 goals-against average and .901 save percentage.

            The NHL and NHLPA started the player assistance program in 1996, giving players access to a confidential phone line and counselors in each city in the league. The jointly funded group assists players and their families with mental health, substance abuse and other matters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821107,Panel: Military needs gun safety measures to limit suicides,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department should implement a series of gun safety measures to reduce suicides in the force, an independent committee recommended Friday, calling for waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and ammunition by service members on military property.

            The panel said the department should also raise the minimum age for service members to buy guns and ammunition to 25, and should also require anyone living in military housing to register all privately owned firearms. In addition, the panel said the department should restrict the possession and storage of privately owned firearms in military barracks and dorms.

            The report reflects increasing concerns about suicides in the military, despite more than a decade of programs and other efforts to prevent them and spur greater intervention by commanders, friends and family members. But gun safety and control measures are likely to face resistance, particularly in Congress, where such legislation has struggled in recent years.











            The committee released its findings in a report Friday, saying the Pentagon needs to improve and modernize its suicide prevention training, and take steps to address risk factors such as alcohol use, in order to address recurring spikes in suicides.

            “Despite considerable investment in suicide prevention strategies, DOD (the Defense Department) has shown an increasing trend over a 15-year period in suicide rates,” said Jerry Reed, a consultant for the panel. 

            The report said the military infrastructure and other systems have not kept up with the changes in technology. All of that, it said, increases stress and the risks of suicide.

            Confirming findings in annual suicide reports, the panel noted that about 66% of all active-duty military suicides —- and more than 70% of those by National Guard and Reserve members — are done with firearms. It said reducing access to guns could prevent some deaths.

            Craig Bryan, a clinical psychologist and member of the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee, said the department should slow down troops' access to guns — specifically those bought in stores on bases — so people under stress can survive periods of high risk. 

            He likened the expanded gun safety measures to requirements that the department puts on motorcycle usage — such as mandated helmets — that are often more strict than some state laws. Asked how likely such changes would be, Bryan said he believes troops are more receptive to such limits than civilians may be.

            “My sense is that so many of us who have served have lost friends to suicide. And so many of those suicides involve firearms, that we recognize that there is a connection between the two,"" said Bryan. “Many of us are tired of our friends and loved ones dying and we recognize that we have to absolutely take on this issue.”

            He said the choice of age 25 was driven by historical patterns and data, which showed that half of all military suicides happened between the ages of 21 and 25, and that the use of guns for suicides by service members — particularly men — increased after the age of 21.

            The panel also concluded that alcohol use and financial problems are often connected to suicides. As a result, it recommended the department fix pay systems to avoid delays, and address excessive alcohol use.

            The commission also said the department's “complex and rigid hierarchical structure” impedes its ability to do effective suicide prevention. 

            Suicides across the active-duty U.S. military decreased a bit during the 18 months from 2021 through June 2022, driven by sharp drops in the Air Force and Marine Corps last year and a similar decline among Army soldiers during the first six months of this year, according to a Pentagon report. 

            But those numbers show a dramatic reversal of what has been a fairly steady increase in recent years.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department should implement a series of gun safety measures to reduce suicides in the force, an independent committee recommended Friday, calling for waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and ammunition by service members on military property.The panel said the department should also raise the minimum age for service members to buy guns and ammunition to 25, and should also require anyone living in military housing to register all privately owned firearms.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821108,"Alcaraz and Norrie into Rio semis, eye 2nd final in 2 weeks","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A rematch is in sight for Carlos Alcaraz and Cameron Norrie in the Rio Open final.

            Both advanced to the semifinals of the clay-court tournament on Friday and could repeat last weekend's Argentina Open decider, which the Spaniard won.

            Defending Rio Open champion Alcaraz beat Dusan Lajovic 6-4, 7-6 (0). He will take on Nicolas Jarry, who topped Sebastian Baez 6-3, 7-6 (3).











            The Chilean was suspended for doping for 11 months in 2020 and is trying climb back in the rankings since February of last year. His best ranking was No. 38, but today he is now No. 139.

            Once again, the 19-year-old Alcaraz did not play his best tennis in Brazil, as in his first two matches, but still prevailed. Unforced errors, difficulties with the first service and less energy than the usual were evident throughout the Spaniard's match against Lajovic.

            Alcaraz, who won last year's U.S. Open for his first major, is playing his second tournament since a right leg injury that sidelined him for four months.

            Alcaraz and Jarry have never played each other in a tour match.

            “I feel I am at a great level physically, I am playing tough, demanding matches day after day,” Alcaraz said. “Last year I was at a great level, winning here, Miami, other tournaments. I can still improve what I am doing now, obviously.”

            Second-seeded Norrie overcame Bolivia's Hugo Dellien 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. The British player will next take on Bernabe Zapata Miralles, who beat Spanish compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.

            “I had a very slow start, I didn't make a lot of returns, which is pretty unlike me,” Norrie said. “I was fortunate to stay patient.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821110,University to raze house where Idaho students were killed,"MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) — The house where four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death in November will be demolished, school officials said Friday. 

            The owner of the home in Moscow offered to give it to the university and the school accepted, University President Scott Green said in a memo to students and employees.

            “This is a healing step and removes the physical structure where the crime that shook our community was committed,” Green wrote.











            No timeline has set for the demolition, but university spokesperson Jodi Walker told the Idaho Statesman that the goal is to have the house knocked down by the end of the semester.

            “We’re just working through the processes that it takes to do such a thing,” Walker said. “But from the university standpoint, and in talking with the families, the sooner, the better.” 

            Walker also said the university is working with students and other community members to create a plan for the property’s future development that would honor the slain students: seniors Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, junior Xana Kernodle, 20, and freshman Ethan Chapin, 20. 

            The victims' bodies were found on Nov. 13 at the rental home, which is across the street from the university campus.

            South Korea winger Lee Jae-Sung scored in the 25th minute to put the home side ahead and Denmark forward Marcus Ingvartsen struck early in the second period.

            Lee then set up the imposing Ajorque, who joined from French club Strasbourg and showed a deft touch to guide home the ball into the bottom right corner from inside the left of the penalty area in the 71st.











            The 17-year-old Weiper rose well to head home deep into injury time.

            Ninth-placed Mönchengladbach was coming off a morale-boosting 3-2 win over defending champion Bayern Munich last week. 

            Despite the resounding defeat, 3,500 traveling fans applauded their team when the players saluted them at the final whistle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821112,Teen faces murder charge in shooting during Texas mall melee,"A 16-year-old boy who fatally shot a 17-year-old boy and wounded two others during a fight between two groups at a mall in El Paso, Texas, faces a murder charge and three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, police said Friday.

            The suspect himself was shot and wounded by an armed bystander as he ran from the Feb. 15 melee at Cielo Vista Mall, according to authorities. Police said the suspect, who has been referred to the juvenile probation department, was released from the hospital Wednesday.

            Police said the suspect used a handgun that had been reported stolen.











            The suspect allegedly opened fire after a confrontation between the two groups escalated into a physical fight. Police said he fatally shot 17-year-old Angeles Zaragoza and wounded the other 17-year-old boy, as well as a 20-year-old man who was part of his own group.

            He then allegedly ran toward the bystander and others while pointing his gun in their direction, and was shot by the bystander. 

            The bystander and an off-duty officer working security for a store helped render aid to the suspect and the others who were wounded, police said.

            Police said the three counts of aggravated assault are related to the two who were wounded and an 18-year-old woman who was not hurt. The juvenile allegedly pointed the gun at her. 

            Police said in the immediate aftermath of the shooting that two people were taken into custody. On Friday they clarified that those two were the juvenile suspect and the wounded 20-year-old, but the investigation determined the latter was not criminally involved and he was not expected to be charged.

            As of Friday, only one person wounded in the incident remained hospitalized. A spokesman for University Medical Center of El Paso said that patient was in stable condition.

            The shooting happened in a busy shopping area and across a large parking lot from the Walmart where 23 people were killed in a racist attack targeting Hispanic people in 2019. 

            El Paso, with a largely Latino population of about 700,000 people, sits on the border with Mexico, which residents of both countries cross frequently.

            The game under investigation was Levante’s 8-0 victory at lower-tier Huracán Melilla on Dec. 2, 2021. The game was in Melilla, one of Spain’s two north African exclaves.

            Police said the six people detained were all Spaniards. They gave no other information on their identities.











            Authorities took notice of the game after numerous bets were made in Melilla both online and at betting parlors, police said.

            Following Thursday's announcement by police that they were investigating the game, Huracán issued a statement saying it would fully collaborate with authorities and it would take immediate action against any employee, player or club executive implicated in any match-fix.

            Levante also said on Thursday in a statement that it had nothing to do with the allegations.

            Levante is a second-division club but was in the top league at the time. Huracán is in the fifth tier of Spanish soccer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821115,Patrick Kane trade talk swirls as Rangers play waiting game,"Trading for Vladimir Tarasenko looked to be the New York Rangers' big move in their attempt to take a big stride in becoming a Stanley Cup contender.

            With the NHL trade deadline now less than a full week away, players are waiting for the next skate to drop on another seismic acquisition.

            Speculation about the Rangers acquiring three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Kane from the Chicago Blackhawks has been building. And while agent Pat Brisson said Friday there's nothing new on Kane's status, the prospect of adding more talent for a deep playoff run is causing a mix of distraction and excitement around the Rangers.











            “You hear stuff, but you just try to focus on the team and the game and what we got going on each day,"" defenseman Ryan Lindgren said. “We proved that we can be a good team this year. Obviously it’s always exciting when you add guys and some really good players.”

            Even if some of the external chatter is seeping into New York's play — like a 4-1 loss at Detroit on Thursday night — trading for players sure beats selling at the deadline like the team had done in previous years before making the playoffs last season. 

            The Rangers shifted into win-soon mode in the spring of 2021. They signed gritty winger Barclay Goodrow and made other moves to inch closer to contention. They acquired a handful of players at the deadline last year and are in that same sort of spot now, giving general manager Chris Drury more reason to trade picks and prospects for immediate help.

            “As players, you work hard and you work to put yourself in a position come deadline time that you’re a spot where you’re heading for the top,” said Goodrow, who was a major deadline addition for the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 before they won consecutive Stanley Cup titles. “We’ve done that: We’ve followed up our season last year with another good one this year.""

            The Rangers sent a 2023 first-round pick, a conditional 2024 fourth, depth forward Sammy Blais and minor leaguer Hunter Skinner to St. Louis for Tarasenko on Feb. 9. But they still have another first-rounder this year thanks to a trade last summer with Dallas and — with some help — maybe just enough salary cap space to also add Kane.

            As Hart Levine of PuckPedia, a site that tracks NHL contracts and the cap, points out: New York would need to clear forwards Vitali Kravtsov and Jake Leschyshyn off the roster to fit Kane in, as long as a third team is willing to get involved to make the money work, as the Minnesota Wild have done twice this month.

            Not coincidentally, the Rangers scratched Kravtsov and Leschyshyn on Thursday for “roster management.” Neither player practiced Friday, and coach Gerard Gallant was all too happy to play coy.

            “What’s the word we used, ‘roster management?’” Gallant said. “Nothing changed today. Nothing changed.”

            Kane, who has seven goals and three assists in his last four games, also was held out of practice. The Blackhawks said it was for “maintenance,” and coach Luke Richardson called the forward “a little sore.”

            “He's going hard right now and he's feeling it,” Richardson said. “So I think it's just smart, he doesn't need to practice every day at this point in his career.”

            While Chicago is finishing another losing season, no one with New York is shying away from the expectation of repeating last year's trip to the Eastern Conference final, if not improving on it, and with that comes uncertainty around the trade deadline.

            “Management’s on the same page, coaches are on the same page and the players are on the same page: We think we’re one of those teams that has a chance to legitimately win,” Gallant said. “You’re trying to make your team better every day, and that’s what management does. It’s going to be over in a week’s time, but you just got to focus on playing the games.""

(AP) — Tennessee suspended baseball coach Tony Vitello on Friday for the Volunteers' weekend series with Dayton while university officials, Vitello and the NCAA handle a violation in the program. 

            Officials announced the suspension right before the Volunteers (3-2), ranked as high as No. 3 in one major poll, opened a three-game set with Dayton. Josh Elander is replacing Vitello as acting head coach, and the university said in a statement an update will be provided Monday. 

            “Coach Vitello has acknowledged his mistake and accepted full responsibility,” Tennessee said in the statement. “We appreciate his cooperation in the process and his dedication to do right by the student-athletes in the Tennessee baseball program.”











            Tennessee cited NCAA bylaws for preventing any further details being released. But shortstop Maui Ahuna has yet to be cleared to play for Tennessee after transferring to the school last June. 

            Ahuna was an All-Big 12 player at Kansas who batted .396 with eight homers and 48 RBIs. The Vols were the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament last year only to lose to Notre Dame in the Super Regional. 

            Vitello was suspended last season for four games by the NCAA for chest-bumping umpire Jeffrey Macias during a confrontation in a game against Alabama. Vitello teamed up with a fraternity to raise money for the Wounded Warriors Project with a chest bump for a $2 donation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821119,Man United's 'too small' Martinez has silenced his critics,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It took only two games for some to question whether Lisandro Martinez could make it at Manchester United.

            In a matter of months, however, the World Cup winner from Argentina has established himself as a bedrock of United’s four-pronged trophy challenge and become one of the most dominant defenders in the English Premier League.

            “In the beginning, in Argentina, it was the same (to doubt),” Martinez said. “But it’s normal because, in football, it’s not normal to play as a center back with my height.”











            At 5-foot-9 (1.75 meters), he was dismissed as too small to play center back in the league and United’s shocking 4-0 loss to Brentford in August was evidence to some that he was out of his depth.

            Jamie Carragher, a former Liverpool center back who is a television commentator, described the Argentine’s height as a “huge problem” for United manager Erik ten Hag.

            “I can’t control that. It’s just an opinion,” Martinez said. “I understand when people say that, they show me who they are. It’s not my problem.”

            United paid almost $58 million to sign Martinez from Ajax last year, after Ten Hag identified him as a key part of his rebuild at Old Trafford. The pair worked together for three years at the Dutch club and Martinez’s ability to play out from the back with his left foot was considered vital to the new manager’s plans.

            Focus, however, was on his height, rather than his ball skills after United's back-to-back losses in the opening two games of the league, including the humiliation at Brentford.

            Martinez was not only a target for opposition players, but critics as well.

            “It was tough, for sure, because it was not the start that we wanted,” he said. “It was hard, the result, the way that we lose, the attitude was really bad.

            “The team, we changed directly the mentality. It was like, OK, we are in the ground, but now we have to prove, to fight again. Sometimes it is good to see the bad things and then you have to change on the pitch.”

            Few would have expected United to still be in contention on four fronts after such a troubled start.

            On Thursday, United knocked out Barcelona from the Europa League with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. On Sunday, the team can win the first trophy of the season when it plays Newcastle in the English League Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

            A Premier League title challenge is also on for third-placed United, and the team is in the FA Cup fifth round.

            While Ten Hag values Martinez’s technical qualities, his fighting spirit has seen him become a favorite among fans.

            “Argentine players are always like this, we are passionate,” Martinez said. “Football for us is like everything so that is why we always give everything of us. As a kid, I remember when I was really young, like four or five years old, I start to fight and I start to cry when I lose, so it is something we have in the blood, we have in the heart. It’s our culture.”

            NEW YORK (AP) — Can the Federal Reserve keep raising interest rates and defeat the nation’s worst bout of inflation in 40 years without causing a recession? Not according to a new research paper that concludes that such an “immaculate disinflation” has never happened before. The paper was produced by a group of leading economists, and two Fed officials addressed its conclusions in their own remarks Friday. When inflation soars, as it has for the past two years, the Fed typically responds by raising interest rates, often aggressively, to try to cool the economy and slow price increases. The Fed’s higher rates, in turn, make mortgages, auto loans, credit card borrowing, and business lending more expensive.

            Key US inflation measure surges at fastest rate since June

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose last month at its fastest pace since June, an alarming sign that price pressures remain entrenched in the U.S. economy and could lead the Fed to keep raising interest rates well into this year. Consumer prices rose 0.6% from December to January, up sharply from a 0.2% increase from November to December. On a year-over-year basis, prices rose 5.4%, up from a 5.3% annual increase in December. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 0.6% from December, up from a 0.4% rise the previous month.

            Biden unveils new Ukraine weapons package, Russia sanctions

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is declaring its solidarity with Ukraine by piling sweeping new sanctions on Moscow and approving a fresh $2 billion weapons package for Kyiv. The U.S. action aims to fortify Ukraine a year after Russia’s invasion. New sanctions introduced by U.S. Treasury on Friday hit Russian firms, banks, manufacturers and individuals, taking aim at entities that helped Russia evade earlier rounds. Russia’s metals and mining sector is among those targeted, in what Treasury calls one of the “most significant sanctions actions to date.” However, despite the U.S. and allies’ continued ambitious efforts to bolster Kyiv, there are no signs of an endgame in the war, which seems destined to enter an even more complicated phased.

            Stocks drop, send Wall Street to its worst week of the year

            NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks sank on Wall Street and closed out their worst week since early December. The S&P 500 fell 1.1% Friday to cap its third straight loss. Treasury yields rose sharply. Stocks have dropped through February as reports on inflation, the job market and spending by shoppers have come in hotter than expected. That’s forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will have to take interest rates. The latest reminder came Friday when the measure of inflation preferred by the Fed came in higher than expected. Higher rates pressure the economy and investment prices.

            Netflix cuts prices in some markets to lure more subscribers

            Netflix is cutting its prices in several of its smaller markets. It’s the latest twist on the video streaming service’s efforts to keep its recently revived subscriber growth rolling amid stiffer competition and inflation pressures that are pushing more households to curb their discretionary spending. The lower prices that began to roll out earlier this week affect more than 30 of the roughly 190 countries where Netflix’s steaming service is available. Netflix isn’t changing its prices in any of its largest markets, including the U.S. That means most of Netflix’s 231 million subscribers won’t be affected by the price cuts.

            US judge won’t block huge lithium mine on Nevada-Oregon line

            RENO, Nev. (AP) — A federal judge has sided with the Biden administration and a mining company in a fight with environmentalists and tribal leaders trying to block a huge lithium mine in Nevada near the Oregon line. The judge in Reno denied the opponents’ request Friday for an emergency injunction to prohibit any work at the largest known U.S. lithium deposit until an appellate court can hear their latest appeal. Her ruling clears the way for construction to begin next week at the mine backers say would speed production of raw materials for electric vehicle batteries critical to combatting climate change. Opponents say it would destroy key wildlife habitat and sacred cultural treasures.

            Telecom maker Ericsson to cut 8% of its global workforce

            STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson has announced it’s cutting 8% of its global workforce as it looks to reduce costs. The job losses are the latest in a wave of tech company layoffs. The Stockholm-based company provides equipment for high-speed 5G wireless networks. It says it is expecting to lay off 8,500 employees this year and into 2024 as part of its strategy to reduce its costs by 9 billion Swedish kronor, or about $900 million, by the end of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821121,Lightning's Cernak suspended 2 games for elbowing Okposo,"NEW YORK (AP) — Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak has been suspended for two games for elbowing Buffalo Sabres captain Kyle Okposo in the head.

            The NHL’s department of player safety announced the suspension Friday, a day after Cernak struck Okposo with his left elbow during Tampa Bay's 6-5 overtime loss. The play took place late in the third period, and no penalty was called.

            In a video explaining the suspension, the league said Cernak extended his elbow to make sure he did not miss the hit and that the onus was on him to deliver a clean hit instead.











            Cernak will miss games this weekend at Detroit and Pittsburgh. The suspension will cost him $31,892, which goes to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.

            It’s the second time Cernak has been suspended two games for elbowing a Sabres player. He was assessed the same punishment for an incident with Buffalo defenseman Rasmus Dahlin in November 2019.

            Cernak, 25, is averaging over 19 minutes of ice time this season for Tampa Bay. The 6-foot-4 Slovak was a key defender on the Lightning's championship teams in 2020 and 2021 and helped them reach the final last season.

            Brest led after eight minutes when Lille defender Tiago Djalo scored an own goal off his thigh following a cross.

            Defender Bafodé Diakité headed in the equalizer on the hour from Kosovo winger Edon Zhegrova's cross.











            The winner came in the 81st from another defender when Brazilian center back Alexsandro headed in from an Angel Gomes corner.

            Lille, which lost at PSG 4-3 after Lionel Messi scored from a free kick deep in injury time, is one point ahead of Rennes in sixth spot.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821123,Last-place Elche falls apart in 3-2 loss to Real Betis,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Elche’s disheartened fans were dealt another blow after the Spanish league’s bottom team squandered a two-goal lead, had two players sent off, and conceded a stoppage-time penalty to lose to Real Betis 3-2 on Friday.

            A penalty converted by Fidel Chaves and a goal by Lucas Boyé had Elche well ahead after only eight minutes and eyeing what would have been just its second win in 23 league games.

            But Elche fell apart once again after defender Lisandro Magallán was issued a direct red card for fouling Nabil Fekir with only the goalkeeper to beat. That left the hosts undermanned from the 57th minute.











            Manuel Pellegrini sent on striker Borja Iglesias and left back Juan Miranda to spark his attack at halftime and they came through.

            After Elche went down to 10 men, Iglesias pulled one back in the 65th from the penalty spot when Ayoze Pérez was fouled by José Morente.

            Miranda leveled three minutes later with a cross that hit the far post to beat goalkeeper Édgar Badía.

            Badía appeared to have salvaged a point for Elche in the 88th when he saved another penalty taken by Iglesias after Enzo Roco touched the ball with his hand.

            But another handball by Roco that earned him an expulsion for a second booking let Willian José go to the spot and rifle home the winner five minutes into injury time.

            The crushing outcome came one week after a 10-man Elche conceded a stoppage-time goal to lose to Espanyol 1-0 also at its Martínez Valero Stadium.

            Elche coach Pablo Machín – and his players – complained about the expulsions and the penalties, while thanking his team’s supporters.

            “We did lots of things well, and my team showed it has character, talent and soul,” Machín said. “The 20,000 fans who supported us today, beyond the result, can value our effort.”

            Elche remained in last place at 13 points from safety. Fifth-placed Betis closed to within one point of Atletico Madrid in fourth.

            Earlier this month, a catastrophic 38-train car derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, prompted evacuations when toxic chemicals were burned after being released from five derailed tanker rail cars that were in danger of exploding.

            Under Biden's order, teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Emergency Management Agency will visit homes beginning Saturday. Workers will ask how residents are doing, see what they need and connect them with appropriate resources from government and nonprofit organizations, the White House said.

            Biden directed employees to get to as many homes as possible by Monday. Officials said the immediate goal was to visit at least 400. The president said he currently has no plans to personally visit Ohio.

            Meanwhile, the controversy spread far beyond the little Ohio town. Officials in Texas and Michigan expressed concern about contaminated wastewater and soil being transported to their states for disposal.

            Biden's order came as House Republicans opened an investigation into the Feb. 3 derailment, blaming Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for what they contend was a delayed response to the fiery wreck. The focus on DOT came even though the EPA took charge of the federal response this week and ordered Norfolk Southern railway to pay for the cleanup and chemical release.

            Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, became the latest lawmaker to jump into what has become a political proxy war as each party lays into the other after the derailment and chemical leak that led to evacuation of the small Ohio community. 

            “Despite the U.S. Department of Transportation’s responsibility to ensure safe and reliable transport in the United States, you ignored the catastrophe for over a week,” the Kentucky Republican said in a letter to Buttigieg. “The American people deserve answers as to what caused the derailment, and DOT needs to provide an explanation for its leadership’s apathy in the face of this emergency.” 

            A preliminary report released Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board stated that the crew operating the Norfolk Southern freight train didn’t get much warning before dozens of cars went off the tracks and there is no indication that crew members did anything wrong. 

            Republicans are framing the incident as a moral failing at the hands of the Biden administration, noting Buttigieg's failure to visit the site until nearly three weeks after the wreck. Democrats point to rollbacks former President Donald Trump made during his term that weakened rail and environmental regulations. EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited the site last week and again on Tuesday.

            Biden on Friday rejected the notion that his administration hasn’t been present in providing assistance. 

            “We were there two hours after the train went down. Two hours,'' Biden said at the White House. “I’ve spoken with every single major figure in both Pennsylvania and in Ohio. And so the idea that we’re not engaged is simply not there.”

            A timeline given out by the White House Friday said DOT provided ""initial incident notification'' to members of the Ohio congressional delegation and relevant committees on Saturday, Feb. 4, less than a day after the derailment.

            That same day, EPA deployed real-time air monitoring instruments in 12 locations surrounding the wreck site and in the neighboring community, the White House said. 

            White House staffers reached out to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s office on Sunday, Feb. 5 to offer additional federal assistance, the White House said in its most detailed account of the initial federal response to the wreck, which has led to round-the-clock news stories.

            The Oversight letter requests documents and communications concerning when DOT leaders learned of the derailment and whether they received any guidance about what the public response should be, as well any recent changes to agency train maintenance and procedures.

            A day earlier, Buttigieg made his first visit to the crash site and hit back at Trump, who had visited the day before and criticized the federal response.

            Buttigieg told reporters that if the former president — and current Republican presidential candidate — felt strongly about increased rail safety efforts, “one thing he could do is express support for reversing the deregulation that happened on his watch.”

            On Friday, Buttigieg chided Comer for referring in his letter to “DOT's National Transportation Safety Board,” saying he was “alarmed to learn” the committee chairman “thinks that the NTSB is part of our Department. NTSB is independent (and with good reason). Still, of course, we will fully review this and respond appropriately.”

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre excoriated “political stunts that we’re seeing from the other side.""

            Norfolk Southern said the NTSB report showed the train's heat detectors worked as intended and the crew operated “within the company’s rules.” Nevertheless, the company said it would “need to learn as much as we can from this event” and “develop practices and invest in technologies that could help prevent an incident like this in the future.”

            The freight cars that derailed on the East Palestine outskirts, near the Pennsylvania state line, included 11 carrying hazardous materials. Residents evacuated as fears grew about a potential explosion of smoldering wreckage.

            Worried about an uncontrolled blast, officials released and burned toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke into the sky. That left people questioning potential health effects, though authorities maintained they were doing their best to protect people.

            “This incident is an environmental and public health emergency that now threatens Americans across state lines,” Comer and nearly two dozen Republicans said in their letter to Buttigieg. 

            Environmental controversy extended more than 1,000 miles to Texas, where a Harris County official raised questions about the transportation and disposal of toxic wastewater that was moved to a Houston suburb from the site of the Ohio derailment. 

            County Judge Lina Hidalgo said a half-million gallons of wastewater from the site had been delivered to Deer Park, Texas, with 1.5 million more gallons set to arrive. The wastewater has been delivered to Texas Molecular, which injects hazardous waste into the ground for disposal.

            Contaminated soil from the site will be moved by truck to a disposal site near Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ohio Gov. DeWine's office said, prompting a complaint from Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich.

            “We were not given a heads up on this reported action,'' said Dingell, who represents the area. She said she would contact DeWine's office as well as federal and Ohio officials and Norfolk Southern “to understand what is being shipped ... and how we ensure the safety of all Michigan residents.''

            Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this story.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Friday directed federal agencies to go door-to-door in East Palestine, Ohio, to check on families affected by the toxic train derailment that has morphed into a heated political controversy.Under Biden's order, teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Emergency Management Agency will visit homes beginning Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821132,"LIV Golf, PGA Tour spar over testimony from Saudi officials","A federal judge declined Friday to postpone the trial date in LIV Golf's antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, even while conceding that might be inevitable if LIV owner Saudi Arabia appeals a ruling that officials with its sovereign wealth fund be required to testify.

            Friday's case management hearing in the Northern District of California capped off a flurry of filings in the last week over the PGA Tour alleging the Public Investment Fund and its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, were more than just investors in the rival league.

            Saudi Arabia's PIF holds some $600 billion in oil profits and other assets, making it one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. The PIF owns 93% of LIV Golf, according to court documents.











            U.S. Magistrate Susan van Keulen ruled last week that the PIF and al-Rumayyan were not exempt from providing testimony and documents under the Foreign Service Immunity Act because of an exception for commercial activity.

            Saudi Arabia, through its attorney, filed a separate letter with U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman on Thursday, arguing that the magistrate's order has “broad implications for Saudi Arabia beyond the instant case” and that it would file a friend-of-court appeal.

            A lawyer for the PIF indicated an appeal to the Ninth Circuit was ready to be filed as early as Friday.

            Saudi Arabia’s leaders, in a lawsuit between their golf circuit and the rival PGA Tour, maintain their high standing in the oil kingdom’s government makes them legally immune from most actions by U.S. courts.

            Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last year successfully used an argument of sovereign immunity to escape a civil lawsuit in Saudi officials’ 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

            The PIF and al-Rumayyan contend that enforcing subpoenas in the U.S. would force them to violate Saudi law against disclosure of confidential information.

            The PGA Tour, meanwhile, filed a motion on the magistrate's order arguing depositions of the PIF and al-Rumayyan should not take place in Saudi Arabia.

            “The Tour and its American counsel should not have to run the risk that they might be harassed or detained because something they say in a deposition is perceived as critical of the Saudi government; nor should they have to censor themselves in the course of conducting Court-ordered discovery,” the motion said. 

            Earlier this week, Freeman — who is overseeing the case — allowed the PIF and its governor to be added as defendants to the PGA Tour's counterclaim in the lawsuit.

            In the amended counterclaim with the Saudis listed as defendants, the PGA Tour refers to Greg Norman as the “nominal CEO” of the LIV Golf circuit, while al-Rumayyan calls all the shots.

            The tour alleges the PIF governor functions as LIV's chief executive, ""receiving regular reports from Norman, approving LIV’s budget, making key strategic decisions, participating in player recruitment in the United States, and micro-managing LIV’s day-to-day operations both while in the United States and from abroad.

            “And even once contracts are signed and debts accrued, PIF holds the purse strings: none of LIV’s partners or golfers gets paid until PIF and Mr. Al-Rumayyan agree to distribute the money.”

            John Quinn, a lawyer for the PIF and three players who remain as defendants, described the PIF's relationship as “what you'd expect from a new investor in a startup.""

            Freeman wasn't swayed.

            “Based on everything I've read ... he is in up to his eyeballs in everything that LIV has done,” Freeman said during the hearing. “He's intricately involved, and I think it's ludicrous to suggest otherwise.”

            But she also said there was no need for the PGA Tour to delay the discovery process while waiting to first get testimony — if allowed — from the Saudis. Freeman said the tour and its attorney can always conduct interviews again if new information arises.

            LIV Golf attorneys claim the tour wants to delay the trial — tentatively set for January 2024 — to keep LIV golfers off the PGA Tour. Nine LIV players initially sued the PGA Tour after they were banned from competing in its events. The tour requires players to get permission to play in conflicting tournaments.

            The Saudi-funded league offered signing fees reported to be upward of $100 million to players like Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka, who compete for $25 million in prize money at each of its 13 tournaments.

            The first LIV event of the season began Friday in Mexico. The 48-man field has 37 players who were PGA Tour members. All have been suspended by the tour, and now only have access to the major championships if they are eligible.

            Quinn argued the window for a player to compete at his best is small.

            Freeman scheduled another meeting for April, when the deadline for discovery has passed.

            “I'm concerned that everyone is dragging their feet on both sides,” she said.

            However, she noted the Saudis can appeal to the Ninth Circuit, which would leave little choice but to delay the trial. The deadline for summary judgment motions is August.

            Freeman said she has 400 cases before her and already is setting some of those cases for trial in August 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821134,Pence urges Ukraine support as GOP hopefuls split on US aid,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence said Friday the U.S. should step up support for Ukraine, marking the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion with calls for more and faster military aid that put him out of step with some of his likely 2024 presidential rivals. 

            “Make no mistake: This is not America’s war. But if we falter in our commitment to providing the support to the people of Ukraine to defend their freedom, our sons and daughters may soon be called upon to defend ours,"" Pence told an audience at the The University of Texas at Austin. “If we surrender to the siren song of those in this country who argue that America has no interest in freedom’s cause, history teaches we may soon send our own into harm’s way to defend our freedom and the freedom of nations in our alliance.”

            Pence, who is is widely expected to launch a bid for the White House in the coming months, also threw a dig at some in the GOP who have sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the war that has upended the lives of millions.











            “While some in my party have taken a somewhat different view, let me be clear: There can be no room in the leadership of the Republican Party for apologists for Putin. There can only be room for champions of freedom,” Pence said.

            Pence used a similar line in October after former President Donald Trump, Pence's former boss and potential primary rival, was criticized for calling Putin “savvy” and “smart” in the early stages of the invasion.

            The speech highlighted the growing divide between declared and likely Republican presidential candidates on a slate of issues, from Ukraine to abortion to whether reforms to Social Security and Medicare should be on the table.

            Trump, who launched his campaign in November, has repeatedly called for an end to hostilities in Ukraine and claimed that, if he were to return to the White House, he could end Europe’s biggest war since WWII ""within 24 hours.”

            Trump, in an interview with conservative commentator Glenn Beck Friday morning, complained about U.S. spending on military assistance and warned, “We’re going to end up in World War III.""

            “Now you have to get people in a room, you have to knock heads, you have to get it done,"" he said, suggesting both sides would have to make concessions after Russia's unprovoked invasion. “So that would mean saying things to Putin and saying things to Zelenskyy that they’re not going to want to hear and getting 'em into a room and getting it done.""

            
                Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another potential contender, was viewed as a foreign policy hawk who embraced tough rhetoric against Putin while he served in Congress. But he has increasingly adopted a similar tone as he courts Trump’s populist base ahead of a likely 2024 presidential run.

            “I don’t think it’s in our interest to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea,” DeSantis said on Fox News this week as he downplayed the Russian threat.

            “It’s important to point out the fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all of that and steamrolling that is not even coming close to happening. I think they’ve shown themselves to be a third-rate military power,” he said. “I don’t think that they are the same threat to our country — even though they’re hostile — I don’t think they’re on the same level as a China.”

            Pence reached out to the university Monday afternoon, after DeSantis’s appearance on “Fox and Friends.”

            DeSantis' and Trump's positions stand in sharp contrast to Nikki Haley, who served two years as Trump’s United Nations ambassador and launched her campaign for the White House earlier this month.

            Haley has called for the U.S. to be more proactive in its assistance to Ukraine, tweeting in November 2021 — ahead of Russia’s invasion — that “Our friend and ally Ukraine is crying out for help as Russia amasses nearly 100,000 troops at their border.""

            After the invasion, she appeared frequently on Fox News, accusing the Biden administration of failing to take the threat seriously. Since then, she has paired her criticism of Russia’s military action with arguments in favor of support for Israel.

            “We’ll stand with our allies — from Israel to Ukraine — and stand up to our enemies — in Iran and Russia,” she said during her campaign launch speech in Charleston, South Carolina, last week.

            During a subsequent campaign swing to New Hampshire, Haley called the invasion “a war on freedom."" She said winning it didn’t mean sending U.S. troops or that “we write checks,” calling instead for more military support for Ukrainian forces.

            In his Friday speech, Pence said there was “increased urgency” for nations to continue providing military equipment to Ukraine. “The fastest path to peace is to help Ukraine win the war,"" he said.

            “Time is of the essence. We need to provide tanks and resources in months, not years to the people of Ukraine so they can defend their country,” he said.

            The speech comes as Pence, who served in Congress and as Indiana governor before joining Trump's 2016 campaign, has been staking out policy positions ahead of an expected presidential run. 

            Looking to appeal to conservatives in early-voting states like Iowa, he has been highlighting his fierce opposition to abortion rights and launching initiatives opposed to gender-affirming policies at public schools and ESG, an investment movement that considers environmental, social and corporate governance issues when deciding where to invest pension and other public funds.

            Pence also said this week that reforms to Social Security and Medicare have to be put “on the table in the long term,"" suggesting ideas like raising the retirement age or encouraging personal savings accounts for younger Americans to keep the programs solvent.

            That stands in sharp contrast to Trump, who has warned his party against touching entitlement programs in an effort to avoid alienating voters.

            “Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security,” he said in a recent video, part of a series he has released outlining his stances on issues ranging from crime to energy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821135,Galthié backs France to rebounce against Scots in 6 Nations,"PARIS (AP) — Fabien Galthié listened to the criticism of his defending champion France side following their defeat to Ireland in the last round of the Six Nations.

            They made one less line break and yet scored only one try and gave up four in Dublin, their ball retention was poor in conceding 14 turnovers, their ruck clearance was slower, and they beat 38 Irish defenders but had to make 235 tackles and ran out of puff.

            “We listen to what’s being said and the media gossip. We’re totally aware of it,” Galthié said this week. “It helps us to improve.”











            With hopes of a second straight Grand Slam gone and having conceded the inside track to the title to Ireland, France finally came home to face unbeaten Scotland on Sunday swirling in questions.

            But Galthié suppressed them by staying faithful.

            Aside from one suspension-enforced forward change, the bashed-up Tricolores from the Dublin bruising will line up against the slick Scots at Stade de France.

            Why wouldn't Galthié be loyal?

            The consistency shown since he took charge led to a perfect 2022 and a record 14-game winning run which accounted for every other side in the top 10.

            “Over the past four years we've always tried to be coherent, to have a clear vision,” Galthié said. “Our team has won 80% of its matches. The players have proved, against different opponents, that they can rise to any challenge.”

            He also defended his decision not to give linchpin and captain Antoine Dupont a breather.

            France's new possession game is still a work in progress, with a view to winning the Rugby World Cup in eight months. Dupont's halves partnership with Romain Ntamack is fundamental to that goal, meaning Galthié doesn't plan on rotating as much as last year.

            “Antoine played two (tests) in November and two in this tournament, and if everything goes well he'll play seven up to the World Cup. Is that too many? I'll let you judge,” Galthié said. “He's our captain and considered one of the best in the world. Having our best players on the field is the basis of our selection.”

            Even though Scotland won 29-23 in England and trounced Wales 35-7, Galthié sees no reason for doubt. His only change was Mohamed Haouas at prop in place of Uini Atonio, who is serving a three-week suspension for high-tackling Ireland hooker Rob Herring.

            During the unbeaten run in 2022, France dominated rucks but also operated in an opportunist, counterattacking style.

            The new approach is not clicking, yet.

            France was ragged at times against Ireland, sometimes caught in two minds at how to execute the game plan, too slow in the defensive rucks, and carelessly gave penalties away, like they did in the scrappy opening win against Italy.

            Still, Galthié felt the criticism was harsh.

            “Up until the 71st minute we were within six points (of Ireland) and in a position to win the game,” he said. “We weren’t able to take some of our chances when we were on top because the Irish stood up to us well.”

            Scotland is in Paris in high spirits after taking maximum points against England and Wales and wins from its opening two matches for the first time in 27 years.

            The Scots ended their France bogey in 2021, winning in Paris for the first time since it was the Five Nations. But that was partly offset when they were blown away by France at Murrayfield a year ago, when playmaker Finn Russell was criticized for a lukewarm effort.

            Russell is back to his best, leading Scotland in style, and on good terms again with coach Gregor Townsend.

            “This year we’ve been a lot clearer on how we want to attack,"" Russell told the BBC. ""Me and Gregor are working really closely.”

            Russell has been playing for Racing 92 in Paris since 2018 and is set to move to Bath at the end of the season. His insight into France makes him wary of Scottish fans who are already looking forward to facing Ireland at Murrayfield.

            “It’s funny when you chat to someone from Scotland and they say, ‘The Ireland game is going to be massive.’ I’m thinking, ‘Yeah but we’ve still got France!'"" Russell said. ""We can’t get ahead of ourselves.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821136,Nursing home chief acquitted in patients' hurricane deaths,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A judge acquitted on Friday a Florida nursing home administrator accused of causing the overheating deaths of nine patients after Hurricane Irma in 2017, saying that his employees had provided care and prosecutors had not proven he should have known their lives were in danger. 

            Circuit Judge John J. Murphy III dismissed the charges against Jorge Carballo during the third week of his trial, days before it was expected to go to jury. He had faced nine counts of manslaughter, which could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years. 

            Carballo, 65, was operating the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills in September 2017 when the storm knocked out power to the 150-bed facility’s air conditioning. Temperatures rose inside the building over two-plus days before the patients started dying. 











            Carballo's attorney David Frankel had argued that prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that their client had acted with reckless disregard for human life or had demonstrated conscious indifference to his patients' safety, two necessary components for conviction. 

            Prosecutors during their case had “failed to present any substantial proof ... to establish that the conditions at the nursing home from Sunday September 10th until the early morning hours of the 13th were such that it was foreseeable to the Defendant that the residents were in danger of death or great bodily harm,” Frankel argued in his motion for dismissal. 

            Murphy agreed, saying there is “undisputed evidence” that Carballo's employees had tried to provide care to the patients. Judges have the ability to unilaterally acquit defendants if they believe prosecutors haven't met their burden of proof. 

            The Broward County State Attorney's Office said they will file a motion on Monday requesting that Murphy reconsider his decision. Among their arguments was that Carballo failed to order the patients evacuated to Memorial Regional Hospital, a large facility directly across the street that still had its air conditioning. 

            The deceased patients, ranging in age from 57 to 99, had body temperatures of up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), paramedics reported.

            A state report said that before the storm hit on Sept. 10, 2017, Carballo and his staff made appropriate preparations. They purchased extra food and water and fuel for the generator.

            Administrators also participated in statewide conference calls with regulators, including one where then-Gov. Rick Scott said nursing homes should call his cellphone for help.

            After the air conditioner failed, Carballo and his facility manager contacted Florida Power & Light seeking restoration. When that didn’t work, they called Scott’s cellphone and county and city officials. No help came. 

            Fire officials, responding to the deaths, ordered the facility evacuated on the morning of Sept. 13. A few hours later, FPL arrived to make the repair, which took less than 30 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821137,New Mexico governor pans Forest Service amid wild cow fight,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s governor has stepped into the fight over how federal land managers are eradicating wild cows in the Gila Wilderness. 

            Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a statement Friday saying she was disappointed by what she described as the U.S. Forest Service’s lack of meaningful, long-term engagement with stakeholders on a controversial issue.

            The Forest Service is currently conducting an aerial shooting operation to kill as many as 150 “unauthorized” cows in a vast area of steep rugged valleys and mountainsides blanketed with trees. 











            The operation has been the source of legal wrangling and protests by the agricultural community in southwestern New Mexico. 

            Federal officials and environmentalists contend the animals are trampling stream banks and damaging habitat for other species. Ranchers argue the operation amounts to animal cruelty and that the cows could have been rounded up and removed instead of letting their carcasses rot in the wilderness. 

            A federal judge cleared the way for the operation Wednesday when he denied a request by ranchers for a delay.

            The governor said she has shared her concerns with federal officials and asked them to do better.

            “Whether debating prescribed burns or wildlife management, it is imperative that New Mexicans who live and work in and near impacted areas are allowed the time to be meaningfully involved in these decisions,” Lujan Grisham said. “When that does not occur, it fosters a continued climate of distrust and hinders progress toward our shared goals of a healthy environment and a thriving rural economy.""

            ""As it stands, they are failing New Mexicans,” she said. 

            The Forest Service said Friday it shares the governor's values when it comes to conservation and public engagement and will remain committed to transparency.

            Agency spokesperson Ivan Diego Knudsen said there have been extensive discussions with stakeholders over the past several years and the agency has tried to address concerns. He said those discussions with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, the New Mexico Livestock Board and the ranching community will continue. 

            “Our hope is to work with cattle producers so that we can achieve more effective operations than have occurred in the past,” Knudsen said in a statement.

            The agency said it supports “an integrated approach that may include both gathers and aerial removals to best meet our shared vision” for the wilderness area. 

            Ranchers in court documents had argued that the agency was skipping the steps of rounding up the cattle and impounding them, opting instead for the last resort of gunning them down. Their attorney said in court that the operation had the potential to result in an estimated 65 tons (59 metric tons) of dead animals being left in the wilderness for months until they decompose or are eaten by scavengers.

            The Gila National Forest issued its final decision to gun down the wayward cattle last week amid pressure from environmental groups that have raised concerns about unchecked grazing in sensitive areas.

            Todd Schulke, co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity, said his group believes the Forest Service has done its best to address the damage done by feral cattle in the least impactful way possible.

            The cattle in question are the descendants of cows that legally grazed the area in the 1970s before the owner went out of business. Federal officials have made several attempts over the last couple of decades to remove the animals, including a similar shooting operation in 2022 that took out 65 cows in two days. 

            The Forest Service said it would release results early next week once the operation is concluded.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821139,Padres slugger Machado draws first pitch clock violation,"Tick, tock, Manny Machado. Better watch that pitch clock.

            Baseball’s new timing device made its big league debut Friday during a limited schedule of spring training openers and wouldn’t you know it, it was Machado, the San Diego Padres’ All-Star slugger, not a pitcher, who was called for the first violation.

            Machado found out the hard way that the pitch clock works both ways. He wasn’t fully in the batter’s box and facing Seattle Mariners left-hander Robbie Ray as the 15-second clock wound under 8 seconds in the bottom of the first inning in Peoria, Arizona. Umpire Ryan Blakney called time and signaled strike one against Machado, who finished second in last season’s NL MVP race.











            Machado was hardly fazed. He singled on a 2-1 pitch and then collected another single his second time up.

            Machado, who batted between fellow superstars Xander Bogaerts and Juan Soto, laughed about it afterward. 

            “Going into the record books, at least. That’s a good one. Not bad,"" Machado said. “I might just be 0-1 if I can get two hits every game.”

            If Major League Baseball was looking for immediate results from the new rules designed to improve pace of play, including the pitch clock, it got them. The Mariners won 3-2 in 2 hours, 29 minutes, which is fast for any game, spring or regular season. In nearby Surprise, the Kansas City Royals beat the Texas Rangers 6-5 in 2:33.

            Padres manager Bob Melvin said he walked over to MLB officials Morgan Sword and Mike Hill afterward and said: “If this is going to be the pace of these games, I’m OK with it.”

            The game ""felt really fast at the beginning. Guys were looking at the clock, Manny makes history with the first infraction in major league history, another feather in his cap,” Melvin quipped. ""During the course of this game we acclimated a little bit. So far, so good.”

            With the pitch clock, players will have 30 seconds to resume play between batters. Between pitches, pitchers have 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 seconds if there is a baserunner. The pitcher must start his delivery before the clock expires. After a pitch, the clock starts again when the pitcher has the ball back, the catcher and batter are in the circle around home plate, and play is otherwise ready to resume.

            Batters must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with at least 8 seconds on the clock. Batters can call time once per plate appearance, stopping the countdown.

            When a pitcher doesn’t throw a pitch in time, the penalty is an automatic ball. When a batter isn’t ready in time, it’s an automatic strike.

            “That time came by quick,"" Machado said. “It’s definitely something we’re going to have to get used to. It kind of takes away your routine, being up there and zoning in before the pitch. The umpire gave me a little warning — ‘Hey, you got two seconds’ — but I was already late when I got in there.”

            “You got 30 seconds and you got to be ready by eight. Forget about walk-up songs for real,"" he added with a laugh. “It’s going to be interesting. I always tap the umpire for respect. Those things will start going out of the way.”

            Batters can't leave the box between pitches, “which I don't mind,” Machado added. “You can just keep a foot in the box and gather yourself again.”

            “Getting to the box is where it’s going to speed up guys,"" Machado said. ""Even pitchers, if you’re down 2-0 how are you going to catch a break and lock yourself back in without getting penalized? It’s the same thing going up there when you’re hitting.

            ""It’s going to be an interesting year. It’s going to be fun. Who knows where this leads? There’s going to be a lot of strategy that goes into this.”

            Machado will play for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic, which won't have a pitch clock. 

            “I’m going to take my time,"" he said. 

            Padres starter Nick Martinez added that the clock will make things ""a little tricky. Got to find some areas that I can save some time so I can get some time when I need it.”

            Martinez said the clock will affect how pitches are called. 

            “Today the way to alleviate the pressure was having the PitchCom with me,” he said. “For the majority of the time (Luis Campusano) was calling the game but if I had a pitch that kind of stood out for me I just pressed it. I didn’t wait for him to call it, I was like ‘I want this one.’ I did it a few times. There are times when I like to slow the game down, so that’ll be interesting.""

            Melvin said pitchers and batters will have to adjust as spring training moves along, especially those who go to the WBC and then return to MLB's new rules. 

            “The one thing, guys are going to get a little bit tired working at this pace,"" Melvin said. ""Whether it’s starters, relievers throwing a lot of pitches, there’s going to be an endurance factor with this as well.”

            RANGERS-ROYALS

            Texas left-hander John King was called for a pitch clock violation in the bottom of the fifth, changing the count from 1-2 to 2-2. Umpire supervisor Mike Everitt was in the press box watching to see how the umpires were implementing the new rules as well as how the clock operators were doing. “That is a big job,” Everitt said.

            MORE PITCH CLOCK MUSINGS

            New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he’s looking forward to the pitch clock when the Bronx Bombers open their spring schedule Saturday against the Philadelphia Phillies in Clearwater, Florida. The Yankees have had Triple-A umpires working the plate during simulated games.

            “I think these last few days, grateful for the umpires that have come out here and helped us out in that regard,"" he said. ""I think it has been really valuable. It’s sparked more conversation around it, but now to get to start applying it in games obviously will serve us well. It’s important to get going.”

            BIGGER BASES

            Machado said the new bases, which are now 18-square inches, up from 15 inches, ""weren't too bad. I like the big base. They've got to be a little more consistent with how they were last year, the firmness, the grip of it. I definitely like the new ones with the bigger size.”

(AP) — At age 9, T'yonna Major excelled at her school work and in gymnastics, shown flexing her arms after competitions with newly won medals around her neck in photos her proud dad posted on social media.

            “She was a light to everyone that knew her,” the girl's father, Tokiyo Major, posted on the fundraising site GoFundMe, where he has asked for donations to help pay for his daughter's funeral. “She was everything to us.”

            T'yonna was killed Wednesday when a gunman barged into her home outside Orlando and shot the third-grader and her mother, who survived the attack. The Orange County sheriff said the same assailant killed two other people in the Pine Hills area — a TV journalist shot in a vehicle outside and a 38-year-old woman slain hours earlier in the same neighborhood. 











            Sheriff John Mina said the victims appear to have been killed at random.

            Grieving families and friends of the victims are still trying to come to terms with the bloody rampage. A least two vigils in their memory were planned Friday evening. 

            Julie Schroeder, who has has worked with T'yonna's father for nearly a decade, described the girl's family as loving and close. She described T'yonna as precocious, with grades at the top of her class and reading two grade levels above her age group, as well as affectionate and polite.

            “She loved deeply when you’re around her,"" Schroeder told WESH-TV. ""She always hugged you and she always referred to you as Mr. and Mrs. because respect was very big in their family.”

            Her father wrote that T'yonna was also an “amazing gymnast,” often referred to by her coaches as “the next Gabby Douglas.”

            Authorities arrested 19-year-old Keith Melvin Moses at the scene and charged him with murder. The public defender's office for Orange and Osceola counties, which is representing Moses, has declined to comment.

            The first victim, 38-year-old Natacha Augustin, was killed late Wednesday morning. A man who identified himself as Moses' cousin told investigators that he was driving around with Augustin when he spotted Moses and offered him a ride, according to an arrest affidavit. 

            The witness, whose name was redacted from the affidavit, said Moses climbed into the backseat behind Augustin, who was fatally shot about 30 seconds later before Moses fled on foot. 

            Hours later, news crews at the scene of the shooting included Spectrum News 13 reporter Dylan Lyons and photographer Jesse Walden. They found themselves caught in a another round of gunshots, which the sheriff said were also fired by Moses when he returned five hours after the first shooting.

            Lyons, 24, was killed by gunfire while sitting inside an unmarked news vehicle. Walden was wounded and taken to a hospital. 

            “You’re losing a friend,” Walden said of Lyons from his hospital bed. “You’re not losing an acquaintance or just coworker — it’s someone that made working fun.”

            Walden said he and Lyons both started working a the TV around the same time last year and regularly covered stories together on the night shift. He told Spectrum News 13 that Lyons was a “very, very wholesome person” with a great sense of humor.

            “He had a very strong sense of justice,” Walden said. “He would really want everyone to follow the rules when it came to people of power.”

            Authorities said the gunman then walked into T'yonna's home nearby, shooting the girl and her mother. Mina said that when deputies wrestled Moses to the ground outside and arrested him, the suspect had a semiautomatic handgun that was still hot from being fired.ORLANDO, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821144,Cowboys name Brian Schottenheimer offensive coordinator,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Brian Schottenheimer is taking over as offensive coordinator for Dallas, with the Cowboys still planning on coach Mike McCarthy taking on play-calling duties.

            Schottenheimer's move from consultant to Kellen Moore's replacement was announced Friday along with the rest of the changes to McCarthy's staff.

            The 49-year-old Schottenheimer joined the Dallas staff last season after a season as passing game coordinator in Jacksonville that followed a three-year stint as the offensive coordinator for Russell Wilson in Seattle.











            Moore and the Cowboys agreed to part ways in January, a week quarterback Dak Prescott and the offense struggled in a 19-12 divisional round loss to San Francisco. A day after that move, Moore was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers.

            Schottenheimer is the son of the late Marty Schottenheimer, who gave McCarthy his first NFL job on the elder Schottenheimer's Kansas City staff in 1993. 

            Seahawks coach Pete Carroll cited philosophical differences when firing the younger Schottenheimer after the 2020 season. 

            Wilson threw 40 touchdown passes for the highest-scoring team in franchise history, but the offense regressed in the second half of the season. Similar to the Cowboys this past season, Seattle's offense was considered one of the issues in a 30-20 playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

            The Cowboys are promoting Scott Tolzien to quarterbacks coach after three seasons as an offensive assistant. He replaces Doug Nussmeier. Tolzien played seven NFL seasons, including stints as the backup to Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and Andrew Luck in Indianapolis.

            Jeff Blasko is moving from assistant offensive line coach to running backs coach while Mike Solari takes over the offensive line, replacing Joe Philbin.

            Pablo Sarabia gave Wolves the opener in the first half at Craven Cottage but Solomon came on to score his third goal in three games. He hit the winner at Brighton last weekend and also netted against Nottingham Forest.

            Wolves secured an important point to stay above the relegation zone against high-flying Fulham, which has lost only twice since the World Cup break.











            Wolves capitalized on an uncharacteristically flat Fulham start when Raul Jimenez knocked the ball down in the box to Sarabia, who had time to fire past Bernd Leno for his first goal for the club.

            Wolves suffered a blow when Matheus Cunha was carried off on a stretcher early in the second half following an innocuous challenge.

            Fulham was still struggling to impose itself when it equalized shortly after the hour mark. Halftime substitute Solomon picked up the ball at the edge of the box and expertly curled past Jose Sa and into the far corner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821149,"Suh leads, Kirk fires a 62 in 2nd round of Honda Classic","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — There have been about 7,200 rounds played at the Honda Classic since it moved to PGA National 17 years ago.

            Only two of those were better than the one turned in Friday by Chris Kirk.

            Kirk shot an 8-under 62 in the second round, moving him to 9 under for the week and one shot behind Justin Suh (64) at the tournament’s midway point. Kirk had an eagle and six birdies, hitting 16 greens and taking advantage of no wind blowing in the morning — very rare for PGA National.











            “Usually we’re playing for 15-, 20-plus yards of hurt going into the wind shots, and 15, 20 yards of help on downwind shots,” Kirk said. “It’s really difficult to get those just right when it’s really windy. But today there was hardly a breath most of the round, and so it became a little bit more target practice.”

            Suh had four consecutive birdies on holes 8 through 11, rolling in putts from 5, 15, 25 and 30 feet in that span, to post a 36-hole total of 10-under 130.

            “I think we’ve been trending in the right direction,” Suh said. “Every week I’ve been improving and just certain spots, and I think it’s gratifying just to see the progressive work pay off.”

            There was no shortage of players taking dead aim. Ryan Gerard (63) and Ben Taylor (65) were tied for third at 8 under. Ben Martin (64), Eric Cole (66) and Brice Garnett (64) were all another shot back.

            “Anything around here around that par or below, you can’t be too upset about,” said U.S. Ryder Cup captain Zach Johnson, who celebrated his 47th birthday with a 67 to get to 5 under for the week.

            Gerard was a Monday qualifier. This is only his second PGA Tour event as a pro, and his first made cut.

            “I wouldn’t want to be doing anything else,"" Gerard said. “This is my dream ever since I was a little kid, just playing PGA Tour events. I’m still on the road there, not officially made it yet, but I just really enjoy playing golf. I love everything about it. I love the competition. I love challenging myself. I love playing against the best players and seeing how I stack up.""

            Shane Lowry shot his second consecutive 68, highlighted by a 57-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th — his ball staying on-line even after rolling over another player's coin on its way to the hole.

            Two players on the cut line couldn’t finish the final hole of their second rounds Friday evening because of darkness. Brett Drewitt had 112 yards remaining after two shots on the par-5 18th; Pierceson Coody did not play the par-4 9th.

            Both returned at 6:50 a.m. Saturday, played for seven minutes, made par and made the cut. They started their third round together in a twosome 33 minutes later at 7:30; the other 78 players who made the cut went off Saturday in threesomes.

            DIVOTS: The only sub-62 rounds at the Honda since it moved to PGA National came from Brian Harman (2012) and Matt Jones (2021). Tiger Woods had a final-round 62 in 2012 at PGA National and finished tied for second, two shots back of Rory McIlroy. ... Kyle Stanley hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th into the water, took a drop, then holed out with a wedge from 95 yards for par. ... Jhonattan Vegas tapped in for birdie on 18 and made the cut on the number at 1-over 141. ... Defending champion Sepp Straka had two birdies and 16 pars Friday. He’s 3 under. ... Joseph Bramlett and Billy Horschel both shot 65 on Thursday to be in a tie for the lead; both shot 73 on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821150,"James Abourezk, 1st Arab American US senator, dies at 92","SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — James Abourezk, a South Dakota Democrat who grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, became the first Arab American U.S. senator and was known for his quick wit as he advocated for populist causes, died Friday. He was 92.

            Abourezk died at his home in Sioux Falls on his birthday after entering hospice care earlier this week, his son Charles Abourezk said. While in hospice, James Abourezk was surrounded by his wife Sanaa Abourezk and other family members. 

            Abourezk represented South Dakota for single terms in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate during the 1970s, where he exemplified a brand of Democratic politician known as Prairie Populist. He fought passionately — and with humor — for those he felt were the downtrodden: farmers, consumers and Native American people.











            Abourezk was the first chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and successfully pressed for the American Indian Policy Review Commission. It produced a comprehensive review of federal policy with American Indian tribes and sparked the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Indian Child Welfare Act — a landmark piece of legislation meant to cut down on the alarming rate at which Native American children were taken from their homes and placed with white families.

            When the American Indian Movement seized and occupied Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973 to protest the federal government’s treatment of Native American tribes, Abourezk and fellow South Dakota Democrat Sen. George McGovern traveled to Wounded Knee to negotiate with activists in a standoff with federal law enforcement.

            Abourezk also mounted an unsuccessful effort against natural gas de-regulation that raised prices for consumers and became an outspoken critic of U.S. policy in the Middle East. He declined to run for reelection in 1978.

            “He was courageous, he was outspoken,” said Tom Daschle, the former Senate Democratic leader who started his political career as an aide to Abourezk. He added: “I give him great credit for his advocacy of human rights, especially of the need to recognize the Arab American community in the United States. He was a lone voice for many years.""

            U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said on Twitter that Abourezk was a “true public servant"" who left his mark as he advocated for tribes in the state.

            Abourezk's causes often ran afoul of Washington’s political establishment. He jabbed back with banter.

            “He was a great storyteller; he had great humor; he was quick-witted and people loved to be around him,” Daschle said.

            In Abourezk’s 1989 memoir, he wrote of the Senate: “Where else are your doors opened for you, is your travel all over the world provided free of charge, can you meet with world leaders who would otherwise never let you into their countries, have your bad jokes laughed at and your boring speeches applauded? It’s the ultimate place to have one’s ego massaged, over and over.”

            The trappings of the Senate were another world from Abourezk’s rough-and-tumble childhood on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, where his Lebanese parents had immigrated and ran a general store. 

            He told colorful tales in his memoir of adolescent adventure: He learned to shoot pool at a local saloon called the Bloody Bucket; drove his father’s car backward to reverse the mileage put on the odometer from an unauthorized, 17-mile trip to see a girlfriend; and challenged a group of school bullies to a fight to distract them from picking on another student.

            He didn’t win the fight, Abourezk wrote in his memoir, “Advise and Dissent.” But the bullies left him and the other student alone: “It turned out no one was anxious to tangle with even a sure loser.”

            Abourezk served four years in the U.S. Navy following World War II. Upon returning to South Dakota, he married his first wife, Mary Ann Houlton, and had three children: Charles, Nikki and Paul. He worked a series of jobs, including as a rancher, blackjack dealer and judo instructor, and then earned a degree in civil engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines.

            His job as a civil engineer took him to California, then back to South Dakota, where he worked on the Minuteman missile silos in the western part of the state. He attended law school and opened a solo practice in Rapid City.

            Abourezk ran for South Dakota attorney general in 1968 and lost. But he remained undeterred from entering politics and narrowly won a U.S. House seat in 1970. Two years later, he jumped to the Senate. During his term there, he was a seatmate to both former Sens. Joe Biden and Edward Kennedy.

            He led a delegation from South Dakota, including members of the University of South Dakota basketball team, to Cuba for a game with the Cuban national basketball team. During the trip, he met with Fidel Castro. 

            Abourezk also became an outspoken critic of Israel and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East after touring the region and visiting his parents’ hometown in Lebanon as a senator. The position lost him many political allies, and he decided to retire from the Senate after a single term.

            Abourezk returned to practicing law in Washington and founded the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, where he passionately and colorfully denounced Israeli aggressions in the Middle East. He divorced his first wife in 1980.

            Abourezk married Margaret Bethea in 1982. They later divorced. 

            He set up a law practice in Rapid City where he specialized in American Indian law, but also remained active in advocacy on international policy.

            At an embassy event in Washington, he met Sanaa Abourezk, a restauranteur. They were married in 1991, and several years later moved to Sioux Falls where she opened an award-winning restaurant.

            In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Charles Abourezk, Nikki Pipe On Head, Paul Abourezk and Alya Abourezk; step-daughter, Chelsea Machado; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — James Abourezk, a South Dakota Democrat who grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, became the first Arab American U.S. senator and was known for his quick wit as he advocated for populist causes, died Friday. He was 92.Abourezk died at his home in Sioux Falls on his birthday after entering hospice care earlier this week, his son Charles Abourezk said. While in hospice, James Abourezk was surrounded by his wife Sanaa Abourezk and other family members.Abourezk represented South Dakota for single terms in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate during the 1970s, where he exemplified a brand of Democratic politician known as Prairie Populist. He fought passionately — and with humor — for those he felt were the downtrodden: farmers, consumers and Native American people.Abourezk was the first chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and successfully pressed for the American Indian Policy Review Commission. It produced a comprehensive review of federal policy with American Indian tribes and sparked the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Indian Child Welfare Act — a landmark piece of legislation meant to cut down on the alarming rate at which Native American children were taken from their homes and placed with white families.When the American Indian Movement seized and occupied Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973 to protest the federal government’s treatment of Native American tribes, Abourezk and fellow South Dakota Democrat Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821164,'Did they shoot him?' Family of man killed by deputy sues,"DENVER (AP) — The family of a man who was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy outside a Colorado middle school while students were being picked up alleges in a wrongful death lawsuit that deputies unnecessarily escalated a situation that should have been handled nonviolently.

            The encounter occurred Feb. 22, 2022, in Pueblo West, an unincorporated community near the city of Pueblo, after a person in the parking lot called authorities to report that a man briefly got inside another vehicle. 

            One of the attorneys for the family of Richard Ward said in the lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court that Ward, 32, was picking up his younger brother from middle school with his mother and her boyfriend when he stepped out of the car to take a “brief walk.” 











            Attorneys said that after his walk, he mistook a similar-looking SUV for his mother’s vehicle, opened the door and got inside. Ward apologized to the driver and then returned to his mother’s vehicle, according to the lawsuit.

            A few minutes later, Pueblo County sheriff’s deputy Charles McWhorter arrived on a report of a man opening car doors at the school and questioned Ward. At one point during the conversation, Ward took what the lawsuit described as a pill for his anxiety because he gets nervous around police, prompting McWhorter to drag him out of the vehicle.

            According to the lawsuit, Ward was shot three times in the chest during the struggle, and McWhorter and another deputy did not administer first aid or other life-saving measures. Ward died at the scene. 

            “It is really just an outrageous example of how policing these days is aggressive and militarized,” attorney Darold Killmer said.

            The lawsuit names Pueblo County, several sheriff’s deputies and a sergeant. Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Gail Perez said she could not comment on pending litigation. 

            Body camera video shows Ward resisting before he is shot and then lying on his back, breathing heavily as his mother and her boyfriend ask, “Did they shoot him?”

            The lawsuit claims the deputies could have ordered Ward to spit the pill out and step out of the vehicle, but they “consistently escalated the situation” and wrongly believed more force was warranted.

            “They did not so much as place pressure on his wounds, check for a pulse, or even attempt to speak to Mr. Ward. ... All the while, passing middle school students observed the gory scene,"" the complaint reads.

            According to a conversation captured on a body camera, McWhorter told fellow officers that he pulled Ward out of the car after he was “acting real crazy” and then put something in his mouth and reached into his pocket.

            McWhorter said that while he and Ward were wrestling on the ground, Ward head-butted him right before he shot him. 

            Killmer said what should have been a routine encounter between a citizen and law enforcement went from “0 to 100” apparently because McWhorter seemed to be upset that Ward took the pill he found while searching his pockets for his identification, maybe because he thought it was an illegal drug.

            Killmer noted that McWorther was awarded a Purple Heart medal last week for injuries he sustained during the encounter, which he believes was an attempt by the county to cover up the deputy’s misconduct. He said the county knew the lawsuit was coming after both sides failed to reach an agreement to avoid one.DENVER (AP) — The family of a man who was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy outside a Colorado middle school while students were being picked up alleges in a wrongful death lawsuit that deputies unnecessarily escalated a situation that should have been handled nonviolently.The encounter occurred Feb. 22, 2022, in Pueblo West, an unincorporated community near the city of Pueblo, after a person in the parking lot called authorities to report that a man briefly got inside another vehicle.One of the attorneys for the family of Richard Ward said in the lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court that Ward, 32, was picking up his younger brother from middle school with his mother and her boyfriend when he stepped out of the car to take a “brief walk.”Attorneys said that after his walk, he mistook a similar-looking SUV for his mother’s vehicle, opened the door and got inside.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821165,No indictment for Dallas officer accused of misconduct,"DALLAS (AP) — A grand jury on Friday declined to indict a Dallas homicide detective whose investigation led to a fellow officer being arrested on capital murder charges before a judge said the case lacked probable cause.

            The Dallas County grand jury had considered two charges of tampering with records and one count of perjury against Esteban Montenegro.

            Montenegro's investigation had led to Bryan Riser being arrested in March 2021, accused of ordering two killings in 2017. Riser, a 13-year veteran of the department at the time, was fired after his arrest.











            But about a month later, a judge ordered Riser's release from jail after prosecutors said at a hearing that they didn't have enough evidence to move forward with the case.

            During that hearing, which was held to decide if the case against Riser should go forward to a grand jury, Montenegro admitted to a problem with a statement in the police affidavit that led to Riser’s arrest. He said a claim that cellphone records placed Riser at or near where the victims were killed was “an error on my part.”

            Dallas police later filed cases with prosecutors accusing Montenegro of tampering with records and perjuring himself in the investigation.

            Montenegro's attorney, Messina Madson, said they were “pleased the grand jury did the right thing.” She said Montenegro is “an innocent man and an excellent detective, who was doing his job and protecting the people of Dallas.”

            Kaufman County District Attorney Erleigh Wiley was assigned the case against Montenegro after the Dallas County district attorney recused his office. Wiley said Friday that her office had spent hundreds of hours preparing the case. She said the grand jury was “very engaging,” and she respected its decision.

            Montenegro was placed on administrative leave in December 2021. Dallas police said Friday that Montenegro remained on administrative leave, and that an Internal Affairs Division administrative investigation will resume.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821166,Authorities: Key Hezbollah financier arrested in Bucharest,"NEW YORK (AP) — A Lebanese and Belgian citizen considered a key financier of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah was arrested Friday in Bucharest, Romania's capital, federal authorities said.

            
                Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, 58, who was labeled a “global terrorist” by the United States in 2018 when $10 million was offered for information about his whereabouts, has funneled millions of dollars to Hezbollah over the years, authorities said.

            U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn said the extradition of Bazzi and Lebanese citizen Talal Chahine, 78, was sought on charges contained in an indictment returned last month in Brooklyn federal court.











            “Mohammad Bazzi thought that he could secretly move hundreds of thousands of dollars from the United States to Lebanon without detection by law enforcement,” Peace said in a release. “Today’s arrest proves that Bazzi was wrong.”

            Charges lodged against Bazzi and Chahine included conspiracy to cause U.S. individuals to conduct unlawful transactions with a global terrorist and money laundering conspiracy. It was unclear who will represent the men when they arrive in the United States.

            Daniel J. Kafafian, acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New Jersey, said the defendants “attempted to provide continued financial assistance to Hezbollah, a foreign terrorist organization responsible for death and destruction.”

            Romanian law enforcement authorities took Bazzi into custody after he arrived in Bucharest on Friday, according to the release announcing his arrest. 

            Authorities said Bazzi and Chahine conspired to force or induce an individual in the U.S. to liquidate their interests in some real estate assets in Michigan and covertly transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds out of the U.S. to Bazzi and Chahine in Lebanon.

            The men were caught on recorded conversations proposing numerous ways to conceal from U.S. law enforcement officials that Bazzi was the source and destination of the proceeds of the sale and that the men were involved, authorities said.NEW YORK (AP) — A Lebanese and Belgian citizen considered a key financier of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah was arrested Friday in Bucharest, Romania's capital, federal authorities said.Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, 58, who was labeled a “global terrorist” by the United States in 2018 when $10 million was offered for information about his whereabouts, has funneled millions of dollars to Hezbollah over the years, authorities said.U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn said the extradition of Bazzi and Lebanese citizen Talal Chahine, 78, was sought on charges contained in an indictment returned last month in Brooklyn federal court.“Mohammad Bazzi thought that he could secretly move hundreds of thousands of dollars from the United States to Lebanon without detection by law enforcement,” Peace said in a release. “Today’s arrest proves that Bazzi was wrong.”Charges lodged against Bazzi and Chahine included conspiracy to cause U.S. individuals to conduct unlawful transactions with a global terrorist and money laundering conspiracy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821170,Bucks' Antetokounmpo leaves game vs. Heat with knee injury,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo left late in the first quarter of the Bucks' game against the Miami Heat on Friday night after the Bucks said he knocked knees with an opponent.

            Antetokounmpo, who withstood a wrist injury to start the game, was on the court late in the first quarter when he passed the ball and immediately started motioning to the bench. The Bucks called a timeout with 1:13 left in the period to allow Antetokounmpo to leave the game and head to the locker room.

            Bucks officials announced early in the second quarter that the two-time MVP wouldn't return to the game because of what they said was a right knee issue. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said after the Bucks' 128-99 victory that he wasn't sure exactly when it happened.











            Antetokounmpo had four points, four rebounds and four assists in six minutes.

            “I haven’t gotten the full breakdown, but I’m pretty sure either on a drive or on a screen or something like that, he knocked knees with somebody and just wasn’t able to return,"" Budenholzer said.

            Budenholzer had no update on Antetokounmpo's situation beyond that.

            Antetokounmpo has missed a total of 11 games at various points this season due to a sore left knee. He was in the starting lineup just four days after traveling to New York to have his right wrist examined.

            Antetokounmpo sprained the wrist Feb. 16 as the Bucks won 120-100 at Chicago in their last game before the All-Star break. He played only 20 seconds in Sunday’s All-Star Game while having the wrist wrapped.

            But the two-time MVP didn’t have the wrist taped as he worked out Friday before the Bucks’ game with the Miami Heat. The wrist also wasn't taped when he opened the game.

            Before the game, Budenholzer described Antetokounmpo’s rapid progress over the last week as “unbelievable.”

            Antetokounmpo ranks third in the NBA in scoring (31.8) and second in rebounding (12.2).

            Milwaukee also had Bobby Portis returning from a month-long absence and Jae Crowder making his 2022-23 debut as the Bucks chased their 13th consecutive victory.

            Portis, who has been dealing with a sprained medial collateral ligament, was playing for the first time since Jan. 23.

            The Bucks acquired Crowder at the trade deadline from the Brooklyn Nets, who had gotten him from Phoenix as part of the trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Suns. Crowder hadn’t been playing for Phoenix all season as the Suns attempted to work out a trade. 

            Cody Zeller and Kevin Love played for Miami. The Heat signed both veterans on Monday.

            The Bucks didn’t have Pat Connaughton (sore left calf) or Wesley Matthews (strained right calf).

The wrist also wasn't taped when he opened the game.Before the game, Budenholzer described Antetokounmpo’s rapid progress over the last week as “unbelievable.”Antetokounmpo ranks third in the NBA in scoring (31.8) and second in rebounding (12.2).Milwaukee also had Bobby Portis returning from a month-long absence and Jae Crowder making his 2022-23 debut as the Bucks chased their 13th consecutive victory.Portis, who has been dealing with a sprained medial collateral ligament, was playing for the first time since Jan. 23.The Bucks acquired Crowder at the trade deadline from the Brooklyn Nets, who had gotten him from Phoenix as part of the trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Suns. Crowder hadn’t been playing for Phoenix all season as the Suns attempted to work out a trade.Cody Zeller and Kevin Love played for Miami.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821171,West Virginians clash over religious freedom bill at hearing,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Some people said West Virginia needs a law to codify the right of residents to challenge government regulations that interfere with their religious beliefs because of growing threats to their constitutional freedoms.

            Others who spoke during a public hearing at the state Capitol Friday said they are worried the proposal advancing in the Legislature will be used as a tool to discriminate against LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups. 

            “Exercising your religion does not mean discriminating or condemning people because they do not have same beliefs as you,” said Jessica Eplin, who said she is worried about how the proposed law could affect her as an atheist and her child, who is transgender. 











            The bill, which passed the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week and is now before the full House of Delegates, would require a government entity to have a compelling reason to burden someone’s constitutional right to freedom of religion and to meet its goals in the least restrictive way possible.

            A similar bill failed in 2016 after lawmakers voiced concerns about how it could affect LGBTQ residents. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch Carmichael wiped away tears on the Senate floor as he spoke in support of Democratic-proposed amendment that would bar the legislation from being used to discriminate against LGBTQ people.

            The bill also dictates that the proposed law could not be used to permit access to abortion, which was banned by West Virginia lawmakers last year. The provision was included as abortion rights groups are challenging abortion bans in some states by arguing the bans — supported by certain religious principles — violate the religious rights of people with different beliefs.

            Republican sponsors say the bill has good intentions. Del. Chris Pritt of Kanawha County, who is a Christian, said the bill would make West Virginia attractive to economic development. He said it's not just about protecting Christians, but religious minorities in the state, too. 

            But Catherine Jones, a gay woman, said the bill would do nothing but “legalize discrimination against already marginalized communities.” She said she fears the bill could allow businesses to challenge city ordinances prohibiting discrimination in housing or employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 

            “I should not be afraid of not being served at a restaurant because I have a different relationship than you do,” she told lawmakers. “This bill will do nothing but spread hate and violence across our state."" 

            At least 23 other states have religious freedom restoration acts. The laws are similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.

            Eli Baumwell, advocacy director and the Interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia, said the 1993 federal law was designed to designed to protect people, especially religious minorities, from laws that affected their ability to engage in personal practices of their faith. 

            “Unfortunately, people have seized upon a good idea and turn it a shield into a sword,” said Baumwell, who spoke in opposition to the bill. ""RFRAs today are promoted by organizations and ideologies and aren’t concerned about individual religious observances. They’re focused on circumventing laws that require fair and equal treatment.""

            People who spoke in support of the bill said they were concerned about the government imposing vaccination requirements against people's religious beliefs and restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic that limited in-person worship in states across the U.S. 

            Monica Ballard Booth said she supports the bill because she wants to see equal protection for people of all faiths. “Since some have questioned why this was necessary, I’ll tell you why it’s necessary: Christians are the most persecuted group in the world,” she said. 

            Pastor Bo Burgess of West Virginia Baptists for Biblical Values said he doesn't believe the bill could be used to discriminate against anyone — it's about protecting people from discrimination, she said.

            “This legislation doesn’t allow me or a business to go around and attack other people groups,"" he said. ""There’s no people group language in the bill.”

            Baptist Pastor Dan Stevens of Wood County said people like him want the same benefits of equal protection as people who oppose the bill.

            “We live out our firmly held religious beliefs and convictions about marriage, the family, human sexuality, the value of human life from conception to the grave without fear,"" he said. “This bill designed not as a tool of discrimination used by people of faith but to protect the people of faith against discrimination for those who are opposed to our beliefs and our lifestyle.”CHARLESTON, W.Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821172,England dominates New Zealand in rain-affected second test,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — For the second day in a row rain came to New Zealand’s rescue in the second cricket test, saving it from an even greater mauling by England.

            On the first day the rain came after only 65 overs when England already was 315-3. With Harry Brook making 186 and Joe Root an unbeaten 153 in a 302-run partnership, England was able to declare its first innings at 435-8.

            And when the rain came again on Saturday not long after tea, New Zealand was 138-7, still 297 behind. Tom Blundell was 25 and Tim Southee on 23.











            James Anderson with 3-37 and Jack Leach with 3-45 wrecked the New Zealand first innings and sent the home team to the locker room in a light shower, welcoming the chance of a reprieve.

            Brook dominated New Zealand on the first day and was 184 — his highest test score and fourth century in five tests — when the rain came on the first day. Root was 101.

            Brook faced only seven balls Saturday before he was out for 186 but Root turned his 29th century into the 13th score of his career in excess of 150. From the start of the day, England appeared to be racing towards a declaration and it came this time after 87 overs.

            “I certainly felt I found a way to manage the situation throughout this game,” Root said. “At the time I did it was great to be able to just calm things down and wrestle a bit of momentum back in our favor.

            “When you’re batting at the other end to Brook at the minute he’s making your life a lot easier. It was quite nice to bounce off him and we restore that calmness in the dressing room. A partnership like that is always going to set things up nicely.”

            James Anderson once again took apart the New Zealand top order as he or Stuart Broad had done in England's win in the first test at Mount Maunganui. He dismissed Devon Conway (0) with only the fifth ball of the New Zealand innings, then had Kane Williamson (4) and Will Young (2).

            New Zealand’s recovery was led by Tom Latham who made 35 and raised the total to 60-4 before he swept at Leach and was caught at slip by Root as the ball grazed the top of his glove.

            Leach then removed Henry Nicholls (30) and Daryl Mitchell (13) to reassert England’s superiority. Southee and Blundell helped a little to steady New Zealand before the rain came.

            The New Zealand bowlers also enjoyed a little success early on the second day and with the older ball, though England always was hurrying to a declaration.

            That rain which fell lightly throughout the night appeared to have freshened the Basin Reserve pitch and there was movement for the seamers and turn for spinner Michael Bracewell even before New Zealand took the second new ball after 80 overs.

            Brooks’ forceful innings came to an end in an ironic manner. He played rare straight-bat defense at a ball from Matt Henry but made such sweet contact that the ball carried back to the bowler who made a juggled catch.

            Ben Foakes dismissal was also ungainly. The England wicketkeeper attempted to flick a ball from Bracewell down the leg side but lost his balance, toppled forward and was stumped by his opposite Tom Blundell.

            Ben Stokes stepped outside leg stump to thrash a ball from Neil Wagner through the covers but only managed to spoon it to the substitute fielder Scott Kuggeleijn. Ollie Robinson also fell to Henry who ended with 4-100.

            The world’s best test bowler, Anderson, didn’t take long to add to his haul of 7-54 from the first test, dismissing Conway in his first over.

            The ball passed the outside edge of Conway’s bat without making much of a sound. But Foakes and the slip field went up and convinced Stokes to review the not out decision. Replays clearly showed a faint edge.

            Williamson who has been chronically out of form dangled his bat at a ball from Anderson which was wide of off stump and going away, presenting an easy catch to Foakes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821175,"Taiwanese determined to fight for country, new research shows","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A clear majority of Taiwanese are prepared to fight for their country in the event of war, new research shows.The findings contradict an oft-repeated narrative peddling the line that Taiwanese are unwilling or unable to defend themselves against attack. The subtext here is that Taiwan intends to rely on the U.S. and its allies to do so instead.This “free ride” claim is not borne out by the data unearthed by Josh Wenger, an American postdoctoral research associate at the Academia Sinica Institute of Sociology, where he is part of a project studying Taiwan's civil-military relations. In fact, Taiwan is, historically, among the most willing of nations to defend itself, according to his as-yet-unpublished paper, Taiwanese Public Opinion on Defense Issues.The “willingness to fight for country” in Taiwan is consistently “above 60% and bipartisan,” among the highest in global polls since the mid-1990s, Wenger tells Taiwan News. His evidence is primarily based on five major surveys from 1995 to the present day.One graph (33) looks at “willingness to protect your country,” and is divided into four time periods. Taiwan is compared to five other “select developed democracies”: South Korea, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the U.S.Taiwan stands at the top of the index in every case, with nearly 80% willing to fight in the latest survey, 2017-2022, while South Korea is second. From 1995-2022, Australia was generally third, followed by the U.S., with Germany and finally Japan least likely to go to war in defense of the motherland.Graph 33. (Josh Wenger, All graphs) 

Graph 34.Graph 36.Graph 35.Related findings are the will to fight was “not affected significantly by the Ukraine War or military exercises after (U.S. House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi visit,” according to Wenger’s research (graph 34). Also, this willingness was not “significantly impacted by how war starts” — meaning respondents were not concerned by whether the cause was a declaration of independence on behalf of Taiwan’s leadership, or was unprovoked and started by China.Here, Wenger also references a Taiwan Foundation of Democracy poll in December 2022 about the will to fight if China makes an unprovoked attack (70%), or Taiwan declares independence (63%).Given the choice, in 2022, a record-high 28% of Taiwan’s population said they would join the Army if there was a need (graph 36). This response followed an “open question” that asked, “What action would you take if there’s a war.”Furthermore, Taiwanese believe their compatriots, or fellow citizens, would also resist China if it attacked (graph 35). Between 2002-2020, the percentage of resistors in the event of a Chinese invasion was considered to be in the range of 52% to 72%, mostly hovering around the mid-60s.These findings contradict naysayers like Daniel Davis, a former U.S. lieutenant colonel and author of “The Eleventh Hour in 2020 America.” He wrote in a 19FortyFive column: “There is no justification for sending American men and women to die on the seas and in the air around Taiwan when the citizens of Taiwan are themselves cool to the idea of dying for their own country.”Such assertions frequently underline the importance of Taiwan adopting a “porcupine strategy” of asymmetric defense, meaning it needs to hold out as long and as strongly as possible before U.S. forces arrive to save the day. It is a position that is also discussed by writers such as the Rand Corporation’s Raymond Kuo, who instead point to the role of Washington and its policy of “strategic ambiguity” as a reason for Taiwan doubting U.S. intentions.Graph 26.Graph 25.Josh Wenger (graph 26) provides evidence for the view that Taiwanese generally doubt the U.S. will become directly involved in a war with China if it invades Taiwan. Most Taiwanese believe the U.S. will only provide weapons, and not send troops – though this latter figure does rise significantly from 19.3% to 33.8% if Taiwan maintains the status quo and does not declare independence.“Taiwanese are definitely skeptical about security guarantees and the confidence of U.S. military intervention,” Wenger comments, pointing to a graph that gives an idea of how the U.S. decision not to support Ukraine with boots on the ground led to significant concern of a similar reaction if there was a Taiwan-China conflict (graph 25). Confidence in U.S. military intervention went down to a historic low of 40% after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and subsequent U.S. inaction.“Those who believe the U.S. will come to Taiwan’s defense will also want stronger self-defense and to invest in their defense,” Wenger observes. “I have found some evidence of a correlation between U.S. support and investing in defense.”This upends the perception that Taiwanese are counting on the U.S. to come to their defense without being prepared to make a similar sacrifice, making it an issue for Washington rather than Taipei.“It poses an interesting argument, which is whether U.S. ambiguity encourages free riding,” Wenger continues. His answer appears to be yes, even as the majority of Taiwanese continue to be willing to fight on, regardless of the U.S. position.The four main findings in Wenger’s illuminating and sometimes surprising paper can be summarized as:Graph 14.Graph 20.Returning to figures like Daniel Davis, who pour scorn on Taiwan’s willingness to fight, confidence in the military, and willingness to invest in defense, the facts largely undermine these views.Confidence in the military declined after 1995 but rebounds during the presidency of Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Currently, it stands at 63.2%, higher than Germany or South Korea, but less than Australia and the U.S., with Japan top (graph 14).However, while the willingness to invest in defense has only risen since 2019, after a long-term focus on economic growth in the noughties (graph 20), Wenger describes opinion as “divided,” mostly along party lines.This is not to say that Taiwan is perfectly prepared vis-a-vis potential conflict: “If you look at that question about what would people do if there was a war, that is very troubling to me. In European countries, people would go to the civil defense center. Here, too many people don’t know, or go with the flow.”“Some say they want to fight, but how do you prepare for that moment?” Wenger adds. “I think the government has a responsibility to prepare the population for this, and it's civic groups that are doing this at the moment. I would also advocate improving civil defense preparedness education.”Wenger acknowledges his research findings reflect national political biases. This means DPP supporters are generally more willing to fight, while KMT supporters are more distrusting of the Tsai administration and its institutions, such as the military, and have less confidence in Taiwan’s warfighting capabilities.He then adds the caveat that survey results could be skewed by the way questions were framed, or because of social desirability bias, meaning people may give replies they think society wants to hear, and don’t want to sound cowardly or unpatriotic.“Even so, taking into account 10% social desirability bias still leaves about 60% willing to fight,” Wenger says.",2023/02/25,2293,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821184,California serial killer suspected of slaying cellmate,"DELANO, Calif. (AP) — Convicted serial killer Ramon Escobar is suspected of killing his new cellmate Friday at a central California prison, authorities said.

            Escobar, 51, shared a cell at North Kern State Prison in Delano with Juan Villanueva, whose death is being investigated as a homicide, said a statement from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

            Villanueva, 53, was found unresponsive shortly before 9 a.m. and despite lifesaving efforts was pronounced dead a short time later at a prison treatment facility, the agency said.











            Villanueva was serving a life sentence with a chance of parole for the aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14 in Los Angeles County. 

            Escobar is suspected of killing Villanueva and has been placed in restricted housing pending an investigation, the agency said.

            The Kern County coroner will determine the official cause of death, authorities said. Other details weren’t immediately provided.

            Escobar was serving a life sentence without chance of parole after pleading guilty last year to killing five men and injuring seven others. He also pleaded guilty to killing his aunt and uncle in Houston, Texas, in 2018.

            Prosecutors said Escobar fled Texas after killing his relatives and was homeless when he began attacking people in Los Angeles and Santa Monica over the course of about two weeks in September 2018.

            Prosecutors said Escobar bludgeoned victims with bolt cutters or a baseball bat as they lay sleeping on streets or the beach. All but one were homeless.

            Escobar arrived in prison custody last December. Villanueva arrived on Feb. 2, officials said.

             Both men were housed in the Reception Center, which processes prisoners admitted from counties throughout California.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821185,Feds seek to limit telehealth prescriptions for some drugs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration moved Friday to require patients see a doctor in person before getting attention deficit disorder medication or addictive painkillers, toughening access to the drugs against the backdrop of a deepening opioid crisis.

            The proposal could overhaul the way millions of Americans get some prescriptions after three years of relying on telehealth for doctor’s appointments by computer or phone during the pandemic.

            The Drug Enforcement Administration said late Friday it plans to reinstate once longstanding federal requirements for powerful drugs that were waived once COVID-19 hit, enabling doctors to write millions of prescriptions for drugs such as OxyContin or Adderall without ever meeting patients in person. 











            Patients will need to see a doctor in person at least once to get an initial prescription for drugs that the federal government says have the the most potential to be abused — Vicodin, OxyContin, Adderall and Ritalin, for example. Refills could be prescribed over telehealth appointments.

            The agency will also clamp down on how doctors can prescribe other, less addictive drugs to patients they've never physically met. Substances like codeine, taken to alleviate pain or coughing, Xanax, used to treat anxiety, Ambien, a sleep aid, and buprenorphine, a narcotic used to treat opioid addiction, can be prescribed over telehealth for an initial 30-day dose. Patients would need to see a doctor at least once in person to get a refill. 

            Patients will still be able to get common prescriptions like antibiotics, skin creams, birth control and insulin prescribed through telehealth visits. 

            The new rule seeks to keep expanded access to telehealth that's important for patients like those in rural areas while also balancing safety, an approach DEA Administrator Anne Milgram referred to as “expansion of telemedicine with guardrails.”

            The ease with each Americans have accessed certain medications during the pandemic has helped many get needed treatment, but concerns have also mounted that some companies may take advantage of the lax rules and be overprescribing medications to people who don’t need them, said David Herzberg, a historian of drugs at the University of Buffalo.

            “Both sides of this tension have really good points,” said Herzberg. “You don’t want barriers in the way of getting people prescriptions they need. But anytime you remove those barriers it’s also an opportunity for profit seekers to exploit the lax rules and sell the medicines to people who may not need them.” 

            U.S. overdose deaths hit a record in 2021, about three-quarters of those from opioids during a crisis that was first spun into the making by drug makers, pharmacies and doctors that pushed the drugs to patients decades ago. But the grim toll from synthetic opioids like fentanyl far outstripped deaths related to prescription drugs that year, according to Centers for Disease Control Data. Fentanyl is increasingly appearing on the illicit market, pressed into fake prescription pills or mixed into other drugs.

            The proposed rules deliver a major blow to a booming telehealth industry, with tech startups launching in recent years to treat and prescribe medications for mental health or attention deficit disorders. The industry has largely benefitted from the reprieve on in-person visits for drugs brought on by the pandemic, although some national retailers stopped filling drug orders generated by some telehealth apps over the last year. 

            The DEA has grown increasingly concerned over the last two years that some of those startup telehealth companies are improperly prescribing addictive substances like opioids or attention deficit disorder medication, putting patients in danger, a DEA official told The Associated Press on Friday. 

            The official said the agency plans to have the new rule in place before the COVID-19 public health emergency expires on May 11, which will effectively end the loosened rules. That could mean people who may seeking treatment from a doctor who is hundreds of miles away need to start developing plans for in-person visits with their doctors now, pointed out Boston-based attorney Jeremy Sherer, who represents telehealth companies. Patients will have six months to visit their doctor in person when the regulation is enacted. 

            “Providers and their patients need to know what that treatment is going to look like moving forward and whether, once the public health emergency ends in May, if they’re going to need to figure out a way to have a visit in person before continuing treatment, and that can be a real challenge,"" he said. 

            Many states have already moved to restore limitations for telehealth care across state lines.

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs promoted Matt Nagy to offensive coordinator to replace the departed Eric Bieniemy on Friday, giving him the job he held before departing Andy Reid's staff for an opportunity as the head coach in Chicago.

            Nagy spent two seasons directing the Chiefs' offense with Alex Smith at quarterback.

He returned to the Chiefs as their quarterbacks coach.

            Bieniemy had been the Chiefs' offensive coordinator the past five seasons, but was passed over numerous times for head coachings jobs. The perception has been that Reid had the majority of the say in Kansas City's offense. 











            Partly in response to that, Bieniemy left Kansas City after its win over the Eagles in the Super Bowl to take the offensive coordinator job in Washington, where he will have more responsibility and call the offensive plays.

            Casey was 5 under through 10 holes before he lost ground with a double bogey on the par-4 second hole. He responded with a hat trick of birdies to close out his round on the El Camaleon golf course at the resort south of Cancun.

            Kokrak played bogey-free, chipping in for one birdie and holing a couple of lengthy putts.











            They were two shots clear of Peter Uihlein, Talor Gooch and Carlos Ortiz, one of two Mexican players who are part of the 48-man LIV roster.

            Mayakoba previously hosted a PGA Tour event in the fall from 2007 until November, when the resort moved over to LIV Golf. 

            Dustin Johnson, who won the points list and its $18 million bonus last year while leading his 4Aces to the team title, was slowed by consecutive bogeys in the middle of his round. He was part of the group at 68.

            Casey plays for the Crushers, and three of their four scores added to 10-under par for a three-shot advantage over Johnson's squad and the Smash team that is captained by Brooks Koepka.

            LIV caused a major disruption in golf last year by spending some $2 billion in bonus money to attract big names. The PGA Tour suspended those players, leading to a lawsuit.

            The four-month offseason brought some additional players, though the highest-ranked of the lot was Thomas Pieters at No. 35 in the world. The Belgian said he only joined when a spot became open because Hudson Swafford is having hip surgery and will be out for the remainder of the season.

            Pieters opened with a 76. None of the newcomers were among 17 players who broke par. Danny Lee had a 71.

            Phil Mickelson had three straight birdies early in his round but had to settle for a 72.

            The 54-hole event with a shotgun start will be on linear television for the first time Saturday as part of its broadcast partnership with The CW Network.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821189,"After Michigan storm, customers wait - and wait - for power","BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Frustration and anger are mounting among some Michigan utility customers who still were waiting for power to be restored after a massive ice storm this week damaged electricity lines, and the governor called Friday for more accountability on repair efforts by the state's two largest utilities.

            More than 600,000 customers of Detroit-based DTE Energy lost power when the storm plowed Wednesday into southeastern Michigan, while Jackson-based Consumers Energy said about 237,000 of its customers lost electricity.

            “Something went boom outside the house and the lights flickered and went out” on Wednesday, said Debbie Fisher of Detroit. “I said, ‘Here we go again.’ It happens every two or three years.” 











            On Friday afternoon, Fisher and her 47-year-old son finally checked into a warming center on Detroit’s eastside. “I’m taking it as a lesson learned. Life is like that and you have to roll with the punches,” Fisher said.

            DTE Energy said more than half of its customers who lost power should have it back by Friday night. The utility has about 2.3 million electricity customers in southeastern Michigan.

            Temperatures in the Detroit area were expected to drop into the high teens Friday night and early Saturday morning.

            “We’ve not had an ice storm in the last 50 years that has impacted our infrastructure like this,” said Trevor Lauer, president of DTE Electric. A December 2013 storm knocked out power to nearly 600,000 homes and businesses in Michigan.

            DTE Energy Chair and Chief Executive Jerry Norcia said the utility has spent billions of dollars working to prepare the power grid for severe weather events, including trimming 5,000 to 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers) of trees each year to prevent branches from falling onto power lines.

            “Over the last five years, we’ve invested approximately $7 billion into our grid,” he said. “And over the next five years, we plan to put $9 billion of investment into our grid.”

            “So, we have a lot in front of us to prepare for the future as these weather patterns continue to become more intense and more violent and create damage to our equipment,” Norcia said.

            Service to about 90,000 Consumers Energy customers had been restored by late Friday, according to the utility. Consumers Energy supplies electricity to 1.8 million homes and businesses, largely outside of metropolitan Detroit.

            “It is certainly frustrating when there are an increasing number of extreme events that drive significant outages,” spokesman Brian Wheeler told The Associated Press in an email. He said the utility is carrying out a five-year, $5.4 billion plan to build a stronger, smarter power grid that reduces the number and length of outages.

            Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she’s been in contact with leadership at both utilities.

            “But this is the culmination of old infrastructure and climate events that are happening with greater ferocity and greater frequency,” said Whitmer, a Democrat. “It is frustrating that we are here again. I know that residents are frustrated. I know they’re making progress. But we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got accountability here and that we can move faster as these climate events happen more and more often.”

            To Benjamin Saltsman of Bloomfield Township, northwest of Detroit, outages of this kind no longer are a surprise. They're almost expected: Saltsman said he usually loses power about twice a year.

            Electricity at Saltsman’s home went out about 5:45 a.m. Thursday. It was still out Friday afternoon. Saltsman said he rented the last portable generator available at a local home supply store and is using it to run one of two furnaces in his home as well as the refrigerator.

            “I’ve been complaining to DTE and Michigan’s power commission about this for a long time,” Saltsman said. “I think, really, the power lines belong underground. We keep hearing it’s prohibitively expensive. But at the same time, I’ve seen a lot of people who’ve installed generators. They are really shifting the burden on the homeowner.”

            Calling DTE Energy provides no relief, according to Angela Marin, 73, of Novi. The power at Marin’s condominium northwest of Detroit has been out since Wednesday. She packed up about nine bags of food and took it to a relative’s home.

            “I go on the app and it says, ‘We know your power’s out and it will be back on Sunday,’"" she said. “That’s like four days! I don’t know if the pipes are going to freeze. It’s just awful. It happens constantly.”

            Anita Hoffman Ehrenfried fared better than many others. The electricity in her Bloomfield Township condo went out about 1 a.m. Wednesday, but was back on by the middle of that afternoon. She did spend time in her car warming up and charging her cellphone.

            “This was the most excited I’ve ever been with DTE,” she said of her short restoration time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821190,"In Berger's world, No. 2 Hoosiers have more work to finish","BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Grace Berger became an instant Indiana favorite thanks to a gritty playing style and an endearing personality.

            Her accomplishments prove she's one of the top players on perhaps the Hoosiers' best team.

            
                No. 2 Indiana clinched its first Big Ten regular-season title in 40 years and earned one first-place vote in this week's Top 25. But Berger insists this is no time to take a victory lap. In Berger's world, there’s always more work — much more.











            “Obviously, it’s a cool moment,” a wistful coach Teri Moren said when asked to describe the net-cutting ceremony after last Sunday's victory over rival Purdue. “Grace Berger, she continues to tell us we haven’t done anything yet and that goes through my mind, right? I told her when she came off the floor, ‘We haven’t completed the task yet, but we have secured the championship.’""

            Even if the unflappable guard didn't immediately acknowledge the significance of the 83-60 win over the Boilermakers.

            Teammates and coaches insist this is no act and have the stories to prove it.

            When Berger opted to return for one more season, she asked a teammate to inform Moren. When she made her final departure in her last regular-season home game, she was so focused she needed a reminder about the title-winning scenario. And when asked whether the new championship attire fit, she joked the hat was a little big.

            Berger has never found any goal too large to pursue.

            It explains why the Kentucky 2018 Miss Basketball Award finalist and 2018 Louisville Courier-Journal Female Athlete of the Year bypassed the opportunity to join stronger, more established programs such as her hometown Cardinals, her home-state Wildcats or Michigan to play between those borders at Indiana.

            Even then, Berger knew Moren was building something she wanted to be part of. Now, everyone is reaping the rewards, thanks in large part to the 6-foot guard that has given her heart and soul to the program she loves.

            Berger's value cannot be underestimated by those inside or outside the program.

            “Three's no one more heady on a basketball court than Grace Berger,” Purdue coach Katie Gearlds said in offering the kind of complement any basketball player would embrace.

            Sydney Parrish, Indiana's 2020 Miss Basketball, also learned about Berger's presence after transferring home from Oregon.

            “ She means everything to this program,” Parrish said. “People give a lot of credit to other people, but a lot of it goes to Grace and coach Moren and Mackenzie (Holmes). They built this program. You can credit some of the newer girls, but they're the ones who did this. They built it from the bottom, a program that wasn't much at the start.""

            While Berger credits others for helping the Hoosiers' steady ascent — those who came before her arrival and those who followed her to Bloomington — few have a stronger legacy.

            She enters Sunday's game at No. 6 Iowa ranked ninth on the Hoosiers' career scoring list with 1,763 points and second in assists (545).

            She's a three-time first team all-conference selection, a two-time member of the conference's all-academic team, a 2022 Big Ten Distinguished Scholar and a 2022 all-tournament team selection. In fact, Indiana's only loss this season came at Michigan State when Berger was out with what some initially feared might be a season-ending knee injury. She missed eight games.

            Berger takes more pride in other defining moments like breaking the school's attendance record four times this season and producing the first home sellout in program history.

            Or matching the school record with a 15th consecutive victory in front of another sellout crowd this Sunday at Iowa (22-6, 14-3) and possibly locking up Indiana's first No. 1 NCAA Tournament with ESPN's Gameday crew in town. Indiana (26-1, 16-1) claimed its first outright title when the Hawkeyes were routed Tuesday night at No. 7 Maryland.

            Berger's goals probably don't end there.

            Though she's kept her aspirations relatively private, Berger & Co. are already fielding questions about a first Final Four trip and even adding a sixth national championship banner to the Assembly Hall collection. The men's team has won five titles.

            Until then, Berger will continue pushing her teammates to cast aside the current accomplishments and focus instead on what can be added next.

(AP) — Grace Berger became an instant Indiana favorite thanks to a gritty playing style and an endearing personality.Her accomplishments prove she's one of the top players on perhaps the Hoosiers' best team.No. 2 Indiana clinched its first Big Ten regular-season title in 40 years and earned one first-place vote in this week's Top 25. But Berger insists this is no time to take a victory lap. In Berger's world, there’s always more work — much more.“Obviously, it’s a cool moment,” a wistful coach Teri Moren said when asked to describe the net-cutting ceremony after last Sunday's victory over rival Purdue. “Grace Berger, she continues to tell us we haven’t done anything yet and that goes through my mind, right? I told her when she came off the floor, ‘We haven’t completed the task yet, but we have secured the championship.’""Even if the unflappable guard didn't immediately acknowledge the significance of the 83-60 win over the Boilermakers.Teammates and coaches insist this is no act and have the stories to prove it.When Berger opted to return for one more season, she asked a teammate to inform Moren. When she made her final departure in her last regular-season home game, she was so focused she needed a reminder about the title-winning scenario. And when asked whether the new championship attire fit, she joked the hat was a little big.Berger has never found any goal too large to pursue.It explains why the Kentucky 2018 Miss Basketball Award finalist and 2018 Louisville Courier-Journal Female Athlete of the Year bypassed the opportunity to join stronger, more established programs such as her hometown Cardinals, her home-state Wildcats or Michigan to play between those borders at Indiana.Even then, Berger knew Moren was building something she wanted to be part of. Now, everyone is reaping the rewards, thanks in large part to the 6-foot guard that has given her heart and soul to the program she loves.Berger's value cannot be underestimated by those inside or outside the program.“Three's no one more heady on a basketball court than Grace Berger,” Purdue coach Katie Gearlds said in offering the kind of complement any basketball player would embrace.Sydney Parrish, Indiana's 2020 Miss Basketball, also learned about Berger's presence after transferring home from Oregon.“ She means everything to this program,” Parrish said. “People give a lot of credit to other people, but a lot of it goes to Grace and coach Moren and Mackenzie (Holmes). They built this program. You can credit some of the newer girls, but they're the ones who did this. They built it from the bottom, a program that wasn't much at the start.""While Berger credits others for helping the Hoosiers' steady ascent — those who came before her arrival and those who followed her to Bloomington — few have a stronger legacy.She enters Sunday's game at No. 6 Iowa ranked ninth on the Hoosiers' career scoring list with 1,763 points and second in assists (545).She's a three-time first team all-conference selection, a two-time member of the conference's all-academic team, a 2022 Big Ten Distinguished Scholar and a 2022 all-tournament team selection. In fact, Indiana's only loss this season came at Michigan State when Berger was out with what some initially feared might be a season-ending knee injury. She missed eight games.Berger takes more pride in other defining moments like breaking the school's attendance record four times this season and producing the first home sellout in program history.Or matching the school record with a 15th consecutive victory in front of another sellout crowd this Sunday at Iowa (22-6, 14-3) and possibly locking up Indiana's first No. 1 NCAA Tournament with ESPN's Gameday crew in town. Indiana (26-1, 16-1) claimed its first outright title when the Hawkeyes were routed Tuesday night at No. 7 Maryland.Berger's goals probably don't end there.Though she's kept her aspirations relatively private, Berger & Co. are already fielding questions about a first Final Four trip and even adding a sixth national championship banner to the Assembly Hall collection. The men's team has won five titles.Until then, Berger will continue pushing her teammates to cast aside the current accomplishments and focus instead on what can be added next.“It’s really special,” she said Sunday when asked about the conference crown. “But I came back to do more than win the regular season. We still realize that a lot of our goals are ahead of us. We’ll enjoy this one today, but we still have a lot more work to do.” ___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821196,Former US national security advisor urges more support for Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. should do more to support Taiwan militarily and politically, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post.

            “I think the time for strategic ambiguity over Taiwan has gone,” Bolton said. He suggested the U.S. allow navy ships to port in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung and deploy more troops to train their Taiwanese counterparts.

            Bolton said there is a lot more to be done ""not simply in increasing Taiwan's military capabilities but also showing increased American support.” In the long term, the U.S. should recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, he said, adding he had made the same proposal in 2000.

            Bolton also recommended the U.S. “integrate” Taiwan into more multilateral defense organizations in the Indo-Pacific region, with Japan, South Korea, Australia and others. “The more Taiwan is linked in with others who worry about China's belligerence, the greater the chance that we can deter any Chinese menace toward Taiwan,” he said.











            The former U.S. official said he believes the recent decision to send 100 to 200 soldiers to Taiwan “was a correct decision.” However, there is a lot more Washington can do, given China’s hostile rhetoric and military buildup, he said.

            Additionally, Bolton said there is public support amongst Americans to defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack.

            “If you explain to the American people the threats we face, the threats our allies face, the threats those represent to the way we live here at home and that steps need to be taken, not out of acts of charity or humanitarianism but for cold, hard American national security interest, I think the American people will respond to it,” he said.
Bolton added that U.S. leaders have not been willing to discuss “the reality and the outside world to the people,” which leads to the public denying the threats exist. He urged politicians “to pick up their socks here and be clearer with the American people.”

            As of Sep. 22, 2022, there were around 39 troops and Department of Defense personnel stationed in Taiwan, according to the latest DMDC report. Over the years, the number of U.S. troops in Taiwan has fluctuated, but usually totals around a dozen or so.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. should do more to support Taiwan militarily and politically, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post.“I think the time for strategic ambiguity over Taiwan has gone,” Bolton said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821200,"Trial looms in case of boy's death at remote, armed compound","SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Three defendants from an extended family arrested in a 2018 law enforcement raid on a ramshackle desert encampment rejected compromise offers from prosecutors to resolve kidnapping, terrorism and weapons charges in proceedings Friday at U.S. District Court in Albuquerque. 

            The U.S. government's case against sisters Hujrah and Subhannah Wahhaj, along with Subhannah's husband Lucas Morton, will proceed toward a likely trial scheduled for September after the defendants affirmed their rejection of confidential offers to plead guilty in return for specific sanctions.

            U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura Fashing asked each one a series of questions to verify that they had reviewed and understood the plea offers and consequences of rejecting them and proceeding toward trial. 











            “Did anybody threaten you or force you to take the position that you did not want to accept the government’s plea offer?” Fashing asked.

            “No. ... It was my decision,” Hujrah Wahhaj said.

            Plea offers are still in limbo for two additional defendants in the case. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj is expected to reject a plea offer but did not attend Friday's hearing because of health issues.

            Jany Leveille has agreed to accept a potential prison sentence of 12-15 years with the dismissal of kidnapping and terrorism-related charges — but prosecutors may withdraw the offer based on responses from other defendants, under terms of a “global” plea proposal. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque declined to comment further Friday.

            The five defendants were arrested in August 2018 as state agents searched for a sickly 3-year-old who had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. Sheriff’s deputies and state agents initially found 11 hungry children and a small arsenal of ammunition and guns on a remote compound in Taos County, New Mexico. After days of searching, the deputies and agents recovered the decomposed remains of the 3-year-old in an underground tunnel.

            Authorities have said the deceased child, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, suffered from untreated disabilities as father Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and Leveille performed daily prayer rituals over him — even as he cried and foamed at the mouth. Authorities also said Leveille believed medication suppressed the group’s Muslim beliefs.

            Forensic specialists determined the child died several months prior to the recovery of his body.

            Kidnapping charges have not been filed against Siraj Ibn Wahhaj in the alleged abduction of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj because they are father and son.

            Leveille is accused of flouting prohibitions on firearms possession and transportation based on her status as a Haitian national without legal standing in the U.S. after she overstayed a visa without seeking renewal. Convictions also could result in her removal from the U.S.

            An initial grand jury indictment alleged Leveille and her partner instructed people at the compound to be prepared to engage in jihad and die as martyrs and that one more relative was invited to bring money and firearms.

            All five defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to each other as potential terrorists by crossing state lines with firearms and training at the New Mexico compound.

            Defense attorneys have said their clients would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim.

            Morton is acting as his own legal counsel after declining his right to a public attorney.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821201,"No. 7 Terrapins win 6th straight, down No. 16 Buckeyes 76-74","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Abby Meyers matched her season high by scoring 24 points and No. 7 Maryland finished the regular season on a six-game winning streak with a 76-74 victory over No. 16 Ohio State on Friday night.

            Lavender Briggs’ 3-pointer was part of an 8-0 run midway through the fourth quarter that gave the Terrapins (24-5, 15-3 Big Ten) a 73-69 lead.

            Maryland then held off a late push from Ohio State (23-6, 12-6), which tied it at 73 with over three minutes left.











            Meyers made a layup with 2:45 remaining to help Maryland regain the lead — an advantage the Terrapins wouldn’t relinquish as both teams went scoreless for the next two-plus minutes. Meyers missed a free throw, but made her second to make it a 76-74 lead with 11 seconds left.

            Rikki Harris missed a pair of free throws with 10 seconds to go and the Buckeyes’ final shot went in after the buzzer had already signaled the finish.

            “We practice all the time, 5 seconds left, this is where we get back to our fundamentals,” said Meyers, who tied a season high with 11 field goals and added six rebounds and three steals. “Switching defense, high hands, don’t foul, make them make the really great play. We were able to win by a little bit and that’s all that matters.”

            Meyers felt she was playing in the most fun game of her basketball career when she headed to Maryland's sideline with her legs aching. 

            “Five seconds left and they had it out of bounds, and I come running and both my calves are just cramping,” Meyers said.

            Cramps subdued, Meyers and the Terrapins had other plans as they beat Ohio State for the second time this season.

            Brinae Alexander and Diamond Miller added 16 points apiece for the Terrapins, who had already earned a double bye in next week’s Big Ten Tournament.

            “That felt like a game that you would see in (the) postseason here in March,” Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. “The mentality of being able to make one more play and just so many elements there of like Ohio State wanting redemption in our game and the emotions of that and being senior night. 

            ""But I just thought just getting one more stop, and just you’ve seen how much we’ve grown as a team.”

            Cotie McMahon led the Buckeyes with 20 points, while Taylor Mikesell added 18, Taylor Thierry 16 and Rebeka Mikulasikova 13.

            The Terrapins, who led 38-33 at the break, shot 52% in the first half to Ohio State’s 48%.

            “I thought both teams played really hard and competed at a high level,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “I’m disappointed for our team that when you put that much into it and our competitive spirit was terrific, our togetherness, all the intangibles were great. They just made one more play than we did.”

            THE FINAL SEQUENCE

            Thierry missed the final jump shot that counted and McMahon tipped it in after the buzzer and review, and the Terrapins’ defense hung on just long enough to secure their seventh win against ranked teams this season.

            “I think it’s obviously hard anytime you’re on the road, and they really started driving us and drawing a lot of fouls,” Frese said. “They’ve gained so much confidence defensively because when we needed to get some of those late game stops, we were able to get it.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Maryland: After holding the country’s top scoring offense to 68 points in their win Tuesday over Iowa, the Terrapins defense had few answers for Ohio State. They allowed the Buckeyes to shoot 46% from the field, but kept them scoreless long enough to claim the win.

            Ohio State: The Buckeyes will enter the conference tournament having lost one of their final three. They closed the regular season 4-6 in their final 10 games after starting the season 19-0, a program record.

            UP NEXT

            Maryland: Meyers and the Terrapins will have either the No. 2 or 3 seed in the Big Ten Tournament.

            Ohio State: The Buckeyes will have the No. 4 seed and a double bye in the conference tournament, which begins Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821226,"City, family reach $2M settlement in fatal police shooting","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A South Florida city has reached a $2 million settlement with the family of a Black motorist who was fatally shot by a police officer after his vehicle broke down on an interstate off-ramp more than seven years ago. 

            The city of Palm Beach Gardens released a statement saying it had reached a settlement Thursday through mediation with the family of Corey Jones. The settlement is for the full amount covered by the city’s insurance policy, which the insurance carrier has offered to pay since 2016, according to the city's statement.

            Fired Palm Beach Gardens Officer Nouman Raja was convicted of manslaughter and attempted murder in 2019 and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the October 2015 killing of Jones. Raja was the first Florida law enforcement agent in nearly 30 years to be convicted and sentenced for an on-duty killing.











            Prosecutors contended Raja escalated what should have been a routine interaction into a deadly confrontation with Jones, a 31-year-old housing inspector and part-time drummer.

            Raja, of Asian descent, was in plain clothes for a Palm Beach Gardens auto burglary investigation team when he spotted Jones’ SUV at 3:15 a.m. on Oct. 18, 2015. Jones was headed home from a nightclub performance by his reggae band when his vehicle stalled on a dark Interstate 95 off-ramp. He had a concealed carry weapons permit and carried a handgun, purchased days earlier to protect his $10,000 drum set, which was in the SUV.

            Raja, wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a baseball cap, drove an unmarked van the wrong way up an off-ramp within feet of the SUV. Prosecutors said Raja never identified himself as an officer and acted so aggressively that Jones must have thought he was about to be carjacked or killed. Raja’s supervisor testified the officer had been told to don a police vest if he approached a civilian. He didn’t, nor did he pull his badge.

            Raja had told investigators he fired after Jones pulled a gun on him, but an audiotape of their encounter led prosecutors and jurors to believe Raja instigated their altercation.PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.

Raja was the first Florida law enforcement agent in nearly 30 years to be convicted and sentenced for an on-duty killing.Prosecutors contended Raja escalated what should have been a routine interaction into a deadly confrontation with Jones, a 31-year-old housing inspector and part-time drummer.Raja, of Asian descent, was in plain clothes for a Palm Beach Gardens auto burglary investigation team when he spotted Jones’ SUV at 3:15 a.m. on Oct. 18, 2015. Jones was headed home from a nightclub performance by his reggae band when his vehicle stalled on a dark Interstate 95 off-ramp. He had a concealed carry weapons permit and carried a handgun, purchased days earlier to protect his $10,000 drum set, which was in the SUV.Raja, wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a baseball cap, drove an unmarked van the wrong way up an off-ramp within feet of the SUV. Prosecutors said Raja never identified himself as an officer and acted so aggressively that Jones must have thought he was about to be carjacked or killed. Raja’s supervisor testified the officer had been told to don a police vest if he approached a civilian. He didn’t, nor did he pull his badge.Raja had told investigators he fired after Jones pulled a gun on him, but an audiotape of their encounter led prosecutors and jurors to believe Raja instigated their altercation.",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821243,FDA authorizes combination flu-COVID test for home use,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first combination test for flu and C OVID-19 that can be used at home, giving consumers an easy way to determine if a runny nose is caused by either disease.

            The Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home test, which can be purchased without a prescription, uses self-collected nasal swab samples and delivers results in about 30 minutes, the agency said. 

            While at-home COVID tests are readily available, this is the first home test for influenza A and B, commonly known as the flu. The test was granted an emergency use authorization, which facilitates the availability of “medical countermeasures” during public health emergencies.











            Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, called the authorization “a major milestone in bringing greater consumer access to diagnostic tests that can be performed entirely at home.”

            The agency said the test is for individuals “with signs and symptoms consistent with a respiratory tract infection"" and said it can be used on children as young as 2, with adults collecting the samples.

            It recommends that tests be reported to healthcare providers and cautions that there is a risk of false positive and negative results. “Individuals who test negative and continue to experience symptoms of fever, cough and-or shortness of breath may still have a respiratory infection and should seek follow-up care with their healthcare provider,” the agency said.

            Citing the impact of COVID and RSV, another respiratory infection, the FDA said it “recognizes the benefits that home testing can provide” and would work to increase the number of tests available.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first combination test for flu and C OVID-19 that can be used at home, giving consumers an easy way to determine if a runny nose is caused by either disease.The Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home test, which can be purchased without a prescription, uses self-collected nasal swab samples and delivers results in about 30 minutes, the agency said.While at-home COVID tests are readily available, this is the first home test for influenza A and B, commonly known as the flu.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821244,Brockovich warns Ohio town of dangers after train crash,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Worried residents packed a high school auditorium Friday as activist Erin Brockovich and attorneys warned of long-term health and environmental dangers from chemicals released after a fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

            Brooke Hofmeister, a mother of two young children, said she feared for their health and felt worse than before about the situation after hearing the presentation.

            “The truth is pretty scary,"" the 29-year-old said.











            She and her husband, Cory Hofmeister, said they didn't feel safe in their hometown and were uncertain about whether to remain, echoing concerns raised by many who attended the two-hour session. It was sponsored by East Palestine Justice, a group formed by Brockovich, lawyers and scientific and medical experts.

            No one was injured when 38 Norfolk Southern cars derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of town Feb. 3. As fears grew about a potential explosion, officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast had the area evacuated and opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke billowing into the sky again. 

            More than 2,000 people registered to attend the meeting Friday, with the crowd spilling into the school gymnasium. Brockovich, who gained fame and was portrayed in a film for battling Pacific Gas & Electric Co. over groundwater contamination in Hinkley, California, told the audience to fight for recognition and trust their instincts.

            “You want to be heard, but you're going to be told it's safe, you're going to be told not to worry,” Brockovich said. “That's just rubbish, because you're going to worry. Communities want to be seen and heard.”

            Health and environmental risks will remain for years, she said.

            “Don’t expect somebody to give you the answers. Unfortunately, this is not a quick fix. This is going to be a long game.""

            Brockovich and her associates are among a number of legal teams that have come to the area offering to talk with residents about potential litigation over the derailment. Several lawsuits already have been filed.

            Federal and state officials have repeatedly said it’s safe for evacuated residents to return to the area and that air testing in the town and inside hundreds of homes hasn’t detected any concerning levels of contaminants from the fires and burned chemicals. The state says the local municipal drinking water system is safe, and bottled water is available while testing is conducted for those with private wells.

            Despite those assurances and a bevy of news conferences and politician visits -- including this week from top officials in the Biden administration and former President Donald Trump -- many residents still express a sense of mistrust or have lingering questions about what they have been exposed to and how it will impact the future of their families and their communities.

            At Friday night's meeting, attorney Mikal Watts urged people to get their blood and urine tested promptly, saying the results could help establish whether they have been exposed to dangerous substances and could be helpful if they take legal action.

            “The court of public opinion and a court of law are different,” he said. “We need evidence.”

            The Hofmeisters were among local residents who said afterward they intended to be tested.

            Greg McCormick, 40, a lifelong East Palestine resident who was among those evacuated after the train, said he would consider testing.

            “I'm just lost, like everyone else here,” he said. “We don't know where we're going, what we're doing. ... We're about to lose our Mayberry, but we're sure as hell going to fight for it.”EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Worried residents packed a high school auditorium Friday as activist Erin Brockovich and attorneys warned of long-term health and environmental dangers from chemicals released after a fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.Brooke Hofmeister, a mother of two young children, said she feared for their health and felt worse than before about the situation after hearing the presentation.“The truth is pretty scary,"" the 29-year-old said.She and her husband, Cory Hofmeister, said they didn't feel safe in their hometown and were uncertain about whether to remain, echoing concerns raised by many who attended the two-hour session.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821245,Tempers flare at finish as No. 16 Xavier routs Seton Hall,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Souley Boum and Colby Jones gave No. 16 Xavier a much-needed victory in a game that ended ugly.

            Boum scored 23 points, Jones had 19 and the two combined on a decisive run early in the second half in leading the Musketeers to an 82-60 win over Seton Hall on Friday night.

            With a few seconds remaining, players from both teams came together in front of the scorer's table after Boum and Seton Hall freshman guard Jaquan Sanders started jawing. Coaches and teammates did their best to separate the two, but for a moment it appeared things would escalate.











            Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway was unhappy about a 3-pointer Boum attempted with Xavier ahead 82-57 with 22 seconds to play. Holloway waved his arms and would not shake hands with Xavier coach Sean Miller after the game.

            Boum and Sanders were given technical fouls. Seton Hall forward KC Ndefo, who had fouled out, was ejected for leaving the bench.

            Boum said Pirates players were acting tough in the closing seconds and his team was not going to stand for it.

            “Just two teams getting after it,” Boum said after Xavier (21-8, 13-5 Big East) won for the second time in five games. “Those (guys) act like they're tough and all that. But I’m not going for that. This team is not going for that. We’re not going to let nobody punk us on or off the court.”

            Miller said he didn't know what happened at the end and he was just happy to get a win. He downplayed the Holloway brushoff.

            ""I don’t have problems with any coaches,” Miller said.

            Holloway apologized for the way the game ended.

            “That should never happen. As the head coach, I take full responsibility for that. My guys gotta do better, I gotta do better, it will never happen again,"" Holloway said, adding his team got beat in all phases and no one played well enough to be interviewed.

            Adam Kunkel added 13 points for the Musketeers, who played without second-leading scorer and top rebounder Zach Freemantle for the seventh straight game.

            Freemantle is making progress and Miller hopes he will be ready for the Big East Tournament.

            Dre Davis scored 13 points off the bench to lead Seton Hall (16-13, 9-9). Sanders equaled his career high with 11. The Pirates played without point guard Kadary Richmond, sidelined by a back injury.

            After both teams struggled for the opening eight minutes, Xavier took the lead for good with a 24-7 spurt. Kunkel ignited the surge with a desperation 3-pointer as the shot clock expired and Boum added eight of his 13 first-half points and three assists.

            Trailing 40-21 at halftime, Seton Hall threatened to make it a game in the opening minutes of the second half by starting with a 12-1 run to pull to 41-33 on Femi Odukale's basket inside. 

            Boum hit a 3 to start the decisive Xavier spurt and Jones followed with a three-point play and two free throws in helping the Musketeers open a 53-33 lead. It only got worse for the Pirates after that.

            “We had an answer,” Boum said. “We ain’t got time to give a team momentum like that. That first four minutes was 12-1. We can’t do that, especially on the path that we are on. But I’m glad we handled it. We bounced back, we took the punches and we did what we’re supposed to.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Xavier: The Musketeers broke a three-way tie for second place in the Big East, moving a half-game ahead of Creighton and Providence. With two regular-season games remaining, they are 1 1/2 behind Marquette, which has three games left. Xavier has clearly done enough to make the NCAA Tournament, but the team needs Freemantle back. Seton Hall made its brief comeback when it got the ball inside.

            Seton Hall: The sixth-place Pirates have lost four of five, putting their NCAA Tournament hopes in serious jeopardy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821248,"MOFA affirms South Korea's support for peace, stability in Taiwan Strait","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Taiwan expressed its appreciation on Friday (Feb. 24) for South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin's recent statement in support of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

            Park told CNN that “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it’s indispensable for the security and prosperity of the region as a whole.” He said South Korea is against any unilateral changes to the regional status quo by force.

            “So in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens in the Taiwan Strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.” he said.

            Since the U.S.-South Korea 2021 joint statement, the South Korean government has publicly mentioned the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in many instances, MOFA said in a statement.











            In August, South Korea and many other like-minded nations emphasized peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in response to China’s large-scale live-fire military exercises around Taiwan following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, per MOFA.

            At the 17th East Asia Summit in November, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and South Korean President Yoon reiterated that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait “is an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community.”

            Later that month, Yoon said that he is “firmly opposed to any attempt to change the status quo unilaterally,"" in an interview with Reuters.

            Both Taiwan and South Korea are important members of the Indo-Pacific community and they are also threatened by dictatorships with use of force, MOFA said.

            “At a time when authoritarian countries are openly challenging the international order and undermining regional peace and stability, Taiwan is willing to work closely with like-minded countries to jointly defend the rules-based international order, resist the coercion of authoritarian systems, and maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula, and the Indo-Pacific region,” it added.

            In December, South Korea’s Taiwan-Korean parliamentary friendship group visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). When China’s embassy in South Korea protested, the delegation leader, Deputy Speaker Cho Kyoung-tae, took to Facebook and said China’s protest was not the action of a normal country.

            He called Beijing's accusations “authoritative and irresponsible” and said “China should not worry about foreign countries' diplomacy. I'd rather solve the North Korean nuclear problem.”

            The South Korean foreign ministry appointed former Korean Security Agency of Trade and Industry President Lee Eun-ho as the new representative to Taiwan, who arrived on Feb. 20. He replaced Representative Chung Byung-won, who had held the post since December 2021.

            The change comes after President Yoon Suk-yeol took office in May.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Taiwan expressed its appreciation on Friday (Feb. 24) for South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin's recent statement in support of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.Park told CNN that “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it’s indispensable for the security and prosperity of the region as a whole.” He said South Korea is against any unilateral changes to the regional status quo by force.“So in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens in the Taiwan Strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.” he said.Since the U.S.-South Korea 2021 joint statement, the South Korean government has publicly mentioned the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in many instances, MOFA said in a statement.In August, South Korea and many other like-minded nations emphasized peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in response to China’s large-scale live-fire military exercises around Taiwan following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, per MOFA.At the 17th East Asia Summit in November, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and South Korean President Yoon reiterated that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait “is an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community.”Later that month, Yoon said that he is “firmly opposed to any attempt to change the status quo unilaterally,"" in an interview with Reuters.Both Taiwan and South Korea are important members of the Indo-Pacific community and they are also threatened by dictatorships with use of force, MOFA said.“At a time when authoritarian countries are openly challenging the international order and undermining regional peace and stability, Taiwan is willing to work closely with like-minded countries to jointly defend the rules-based international order, resist the coercion of authoritarian systems, and maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula, and the Indo-Pacific region,” it added.In December, South Korea’s Taiwan-Korean parliamentary friendship group visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821257,"Ylonen, Allen lead Canadiens over Flyers 5-2","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jesse Ylonen had a goal and an assist for his first career multipoint game, Jake Allen made 24 saves and the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-2 on Friday night.

            Chris Tierney, David Savard, Josh Anderson and Nick Suzuki also scored for Montreal, which followed up Tuesday’s impressive win over New Jersey with another solid performance.

            “It was one of our best games of the year,” Anderson said. “We were really balanced tonight and it showed. When everybody’s in the right spot, it’s easy to play like that. It just looked like everybody was connected.”











            Owen Tippett and Ivan Provorov scored for Philadelphia, which has lost seven of nine since the All-Star break. Carter Hart made 26 saves.

            The game pitted two of the Eastern Conference’s worst teams, but the Canadiens looked like Stanley Cup contenders against Philadelphia.

            “As a group, we were sluggish,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said.

            Montreal skated circles around the Flyers in a dominating first period that ended with the home team being booed off the ice. The rest of the game pretty much followed that pattern.

            “I think we were very organized for the whole game,” Ylonen said. “We played a very mature game, and even when we got the lead, we still kept doing the same thing, keeping it simple. So I think it was very good.”

            The Canadiens peppered Hart during a power play early in the first, with Philadelphia’s goalie making strong saves on slap shots from Mike Hoffman and Rafael Harvey-Pinard to keep the game scoreless. But Montreal kept up the pressure and netted a pair of goals in the final 2:10 of the period to go in front 2-0.

            Savard opened the scoring by shooting under Hart’s right arm from close range after a pretty chip pass from Hoffman set him up perfectly. Tierney gave the Canadiens a two-goal lead with 5 seconds left in the first. Michael Pezzetta won a battle behind the net and fed the puck in front to a wide-open Pezzetta.

            “That’s a kick in the teeth,” Tortorella said.

            Suzuki scored the only goal of the second on a power play for his team-leading 45th point. Montreal got the man-advantage when the Flyers’ Wade Allison received an instigation minor and 10-minute misconduct in addition to a fighting major for his scrap with Alex Belzile. It took just 19 seconds for the Canadiens to take advantage when Suzuki’s pass to the front of the net deflected off defenseman Provorov’s stick and high over Hart.

            “We made plays that were there,” Anderson said. “We didn’t really force much. And we still played a smart game, too, when we needed to get it in and forecheck.”

            Tippett gave the Flyers some life with a wrister that whizzed past Allen just 9 seconds into the third, but Ylonen answered with his first of the season on a deflection 6½ minutes into the period.

            The Canadiens pulled within two points of the Flyers, who have 56. Only Columbus, with 41 points, has less in the conference.

            “I just think we were off tonight,” Philadelphia’s Scott Laughton said. “That wasn’t how we play. They played with the puck. We watched. Didn’t move our feet. They made us pay.”

            NOTES: Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Brandon Graham pounded the drum the home club uses to get the fans cheering at the start of the contest. ... Philadelphia leading scorer Travis Konecny (upper body) missed his second straight game. ... Montreal forwards Joel Armia and Kirby Dach both sat out with illnesses. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821258,Kings use 3-goal second period to power past Islanders 3-2,"NEW YORK (AP) — Phillip Danault, Arthur Kaliyev and Gabriel Vilardi scored in the second period and the Los Angeles Kings ended a two-game skid by defeating the New York Islanders 3-2 on Friday night.

            Jonathan Quick made 16 saves for his 370th career victory, moving into 19th place on the NHL’s all-time list. Quick also surpassed Tom Barrasso for the third-most wins by a U.S.-born goaltender, trailing only John Vanbiesbrouck (374) and Ryan Miller (391).

            “I immediately think of all the great teams I’ve been a part of,” Quick said. “Teammates, coaches — everyone had some influence on those wins. ... The guys that are at the top of the list were unbelievable goaltenders for a long time, just to kind of be in a category with them is an honor and humbling.”











            Noah Dobson and Adam Pelech scored, and Ilya Sorokin finished with 25 saves but the Islanders' two-game winning streak ended as they fight for a playoff spot in a tightly contested Eastern Conference wild-card race.

            The Kings scored their three goals in a span of 5:34 to take a 3-0 lead.

            “We started to shoot the puck,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said, citing that as a key reason the game tilted in Los Angeles’ direction. 

            “The shot pulls people out of position,"" he added. ""I didn’t think we did enough of that in the third period. We held onto pucks, killed time, played on the outside, but there’s still opportunities to go to the goaltenders' pads and we didn’t do it. But that was the momentum swing early in the game.”

            Danault opened the scoring when he put home a rebound at 6:40 of the second frame after Viktor Arvidsson hammered a slap shot that Sorokin failed to swallow up. Mikey Anderson also assisted on the play.

            Los Angeles took advantage of Sebastian Aho's neutral zone miscue to double its lead 1:25 after Danault's goal. Rasmus Kupari gained control of the puck misplayed by Aho and beautifully fed Kaliyev for the easy one-time finish.

            “There are games when if you make a mistake, it ends up in the back of your net,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “It’s that simple, and that’s what happened tonight on a couple of occasions.”

            Vilardi notched his 18th of the season at 12:14 to cap the Kings’ assertive stretch. The 23-year-old forward launched a one-timer that sailed past the blocker of Sorokin.

            Dobson helped the Islanders trim their deficit to two when he tallied a power-play goal at 16:34 of the second. On the previous shift, Kyle Palmieri’s individual effort allowed the Islanders to maintain possession in the offensive zone and eventually led to Sean Walker's penalty.

            The Kings outshot the Islanders 24-13 through the first 40 minutes.

            Pelech pulled the Islanders to within one goal when he tossed a backhand shot to the top of the crease that deflected off Kings defenseman Matt Roy and past Quick at 15:23 of the third period. Matt Martin extended his point streak to four games with an assist on the play.

            “I thought we played better tonight with a lead,"" Danault said. “We were playing on our toes more than our heels.”

            The teams will meet again in Southern California on March 14 to close out their season series.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821259,Body of 1 Washington state avalanche victim recovered,"LEAVENWORTH, Wash. (AP) — The body of one of three climbers killed in an avalanche on Washington state’s Colchuck Peak last weekend was recovered Friday, authorities said.

            The body of 54-year-old Seong Cho, a Korean citizen residing in West Hartford, Connecticut, was recovered from the base of Colchuck Peak, the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.

            Friday was the first day weather conditions allowed a Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office helicopter rescue team to operate. The team found Cho’s body under a thin layer of snow at the GPS coordinates provided by a member of the climbing party, the post said. The body was turned over to the Chelan County Coroner’s Office. 











            The crew made additional search attempts for the remaining two climbers — Jeannie Lee, a 60-year-old woman from New York, and Yun Park, a 66-year-old man from New Jersey — but they were not located, authorities said.

            Part of the search included the use of a RECCO device mounted on a cable under the helicopter, which can detect chips sewn into some outdoor gear and help provide the location of someone buried under avalanche debris. 

            Ground teams will not be deployed to the area until conditions are safe, sheriff's officials said.

            Avalanche experts tried to reach the scene on Wednesday, but failed to make it all the way due to the risk of further slides. They said at least 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow had fallen in the area. It was too cloudy Thursday for the sheriff’s office to send a helicopter to the site, authorities said.

            The climbers were killed Sunday as they ascended a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653-meter) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Seattle. Another member of their party was caught up in the slide, but had minor injuries and was able to hike back down.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821261,Nylander scores in overtime as Maple Leafs beat Wild 2-1,"TORONTO (AP) — William Nylander scored 1:05 into overtime, and the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Minnesota Wild 2-1 on Friday night.

            David Kampf also scored for Toronto (36-15-8), and Ilya Samsonov made 24 saves. Nylander added an assist to give him 70 points on the season.

            The Maple Leafs improved to 6-8 in OT this season after starting an ugly 1-6. That forced coach Sheldon Keefe to tweak his approach in 3-on-3 by putting a defensive forward out to take the initial faceoff.











            “Overtime was an issue for us,” Keefe said. “We changed our strategy a little bit in terms of how we started, how we deploy the guys. The luck has gone our way a little bit in terms of getting us more time with the puck.

            “It’s given more opportunities for players like Will to make plays like that.”

            Minnesota (32-21-6) had won four in a row, including a 2-0 victory at Columbus on Thursday. Brandon Duhaime scored for the Wild, and Filip Gustavsson made 22 stops.

            “We liked everything about our game tonight — except missing one point,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said.

            The Leafs are set to head out on a five-game road trip that includes their annual swing through Western Canada. They won’t play again at Scotiabank Arena again until March 11.

            “We’re going to be in a lot of those games down the stretch and in the playoffs,” Toronto defenseman Mark Giordano said of Friday’s razor-thin margin. “You gotta take what’s there and not force it, not get frustrated.”

            Nylander stripped Frederick Gaudreau off the puck in the Minnesota zone and then dangled around Wild forward Matt Boldy before beating Gustavsson for his 33rd goal of the season.

            “I knew there was a forward there,” Nylander said. “Just tried to take it to the net. I saw that he was kind of flat-footed.

            “It was gonna be hard if I came with some speed.”

            The Wild opened the scoring on a strange first-period sequence. Duhaime’s centering pass went off Toronto’s Calle Jarnkrok and sneaked by Samsonov for his seventh.

            The Leafs responded before the period was over. Kampf got his sixth from in tight off a Nylander setup from behind the net.

            Playing their first game against an opponent in a postseason spot at the start of play since Feb. 1 against Boston, the Leafs got a power play in the second, but came up empty.

            The Leafs’ fifth-ranked man advantage got another opportunity with under eight minutes left in the third, but Gustavsson stopped a Nylander one-timer.

            The Wild then got their first power play with less than four minutes remaining in regulation, only to have Samsonov and Toronto’s penalty killers hold firm.

            MURRAY POISED TO RETURN

            Keefe said before the game that goaltender Matt Murray (ankle) is expected to join the team at practice Saturday. The 28-year-old Murray hasn’t played since getting pulled Jan. 17 after allowing four goals on eight shots in a 5-4 overtime victory against Florida.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTORONTO (AP) — William Nylander scored 1:05 into overtime, and the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Minnesota Wild 2-1 on Friday night.David Kampf also scored for Toronto (36-15-8), and Ilya Samsonov made 24 saves. Nylander added an assist to give him 70 points on the season.The Maple Leafs improved to 6-8 in OT this season after starting an ugly 1-6. That forced coach Sheldon Keefe to tweak his approach in 3-on-3 by putting a defensive forward out to take the initial faceoff.“Overtime was an issue for us,” Keefe said. “We changed our strategy a little bit in terms of how we started, how we deploy the guys. The luck has gone our way a little bit in terms of getting us more time with the puck.“It’s given more opportunities for players like Will to make plays like that.”Minnesota (32-21-6) had won four in a row, including a 2-0 victory at Columbus on Thursday. Brandon Duhaime scored for the Wild, and Filip Gustavsson made 22 stops.“We liked everything about our game tonight — except missing one point,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said.The Leafs are set to head out on a five-game road trip that includes their annual swing through Western Canada.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821263,Randle scores 46 as Knicks rally past Wizards 115-109,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Julius Randle answered Kristaps Porzingis' early flurry, and by the time the New York standout was done, he'd matched his career high in scoring.

            Randle also led the Knicks to an impressive comeback victory.

            Randle finished with 46 points, and New York rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Washington Wizards 115-109 on Friday night.











            “Just came out aggressive,” Randle said. “That time of the year, got to lock in.” 

            Jalen Brunson broke a 109-all tie with a bank shot in traffic with 42.1 seconds remaining, and the Knicks held on from there in a pulsating matchup between two teams coming out of the All-Star break in the thick of Eastern Conference playoff race — but in far different positions.

            The Knicks, who are trying to finish high enough to avoid the play-in round, now lead Miami by 1 1/2 games for sixth place. The 10th-place Wizards would make the play-in if the season ended now, but their lead over Chicago fell to 1 1/2 games.

            Bradley Beal tied the game for Washington with a 3-pointer with 59.5 seconds remaining. Then Brunson drove into the lane, picked up his dribble and appeared to be stuck amid a group of players when he was able to flip the ball up off the glass and in.

            “That was a big win for us,” Randle said. “We needed this, especially coming off the break. We know they're a team that gets off to fast starts, so they did that and we responded.”

            Porzingis missed a 3-pointer at the other end, and Randle found Mitchell Robinson for a layup that pushed New York's lead to four with 11.2 seconds to go. Then Washington's Kyle Kuzma stepped out of bounds while receiving an inbound pass, essentially sealing his team's chances.

            “They ramped up their defense a little bit,” Washington's Monte Morris said. “Julius was balling. Feel like we could have gave him a couple more different looks at times. Just hitting him more, doubling him more a little bit. Any player in the league get it going like that, it's hard to put out the fire.”

            Porzingis and Kuzma scored 23 points apiece. Porzingis made all five of his 3-point attempts on his way to a 19-point first quarter, then didn't attempt another shot until the fourth.

            “They amped up the pressure, they started switching earlier with the pick-and-pops,” Porzingis said. “We have seen that before, of course, especially when we get going early in the game. I feel like we went away a little bit from that maybe two-man game with Brad.” 

            BIG RALLY

            The Wizards led 57-38 in the second quarter, but New York came charging back behind Randle, whose dunk started a 12-2 run by the Knicks to close the half. Randle scored 11 points during that stretch, and Washington was up only 64-60 after two quarters.

            “Once we got lost in the game and started getting some stops and the rebounding was good, and then the movement without the ball,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We got some easy buckets and then that got us going.”

            Randle previously scored 46 points on March 7, 2022, at Sacramento.

            TIP-INS

            Knicks: Randle went 7 of 14 from 3-point range. ... Immanuel Quickley scored 16 points and RJ Barrett had 14. ... Robinson (right thumb) played for the first time since Jan. 18. He had 10 points and 12 rebounds.

            Wizards: Beal scored 16 points and Delon Wright added 15.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821265,"Hawks pull away in 1st half, rout Cavaliers 136-119","ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Hawks returned from the All-Star break — and a coaching change — refreshed and motivated.

            The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing on the second night of a back-to-back, couldn't match Atlanta's energy and drive.

            Trae Young scored 34 points and the Hawks beat the Cavaliers 136-119 on Friday night in their first game under interim coach Joe Prunty.











            Dejounte Murray had 15 of his 25 points in Atlanta’s high-scoring second period.

            Darius Garland led the Cavaliers, who suffered their third straight loss, with 33 points. Donovan Mitchell had 19.

            The Hawks played their first game since coach Nate McMillan was fired on Tuesday. The team had three practices, including a shootaround session on Friday morning, under Prunty, who had been McMillan's lead assistant.

            “Each night is a new experience, understanding a team that is fresh and newly motivated,” said Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who said that created a challenge for his players “being prepared to match that, and I don't think we matched that enough. ... We didn't put up much resistance, especially in the first half.""

            The Cavaliers lost to Denver 115-109 on Thursday night.

            General manager Landry Fields said Wednesday that former Utah coach Quin Snyder is a candidate to replace McMillan. Snyder could be hired to take over the team this season.

            Atlanta held its big lead of 32 points for the last time at 103-71 late in the third quarter before Cleveland pulled to within 13 points at 108-95 in the final period. Atlanta then reclaimed its momentum.

            Murray missed his first five shots before making his next seven in the second period. The Hawks’ 49 points in the period were their most in any quarter this season. They led 81-57 at halftime, setting another season-high mark for points in an opening half.

            “I think we were pushing the ball and playing fast and getting some 3s and getting some stops, too,” Young said. “It was a big effort tonight on the defensive end, for sure.”

            Prunty said he worried his players would be rusty after the break and said “I was really impressed with our guys and how we started the game.”

            BEY IMPRESSES

            Saddiq Bey, acquired by Atlanta from Detroit on Feb. 9 as part of a three-team trade with Golden State, had 19 points while starting at power forward as a fill-in. John Collins (concussion protocol) did not play. The 6-foot-8 Bey, listed as a guard-forward, is thought to be best suited to play small forward but showed his versatility while filling in for Collins at power forward.

            ROAD WOES

            The Cavaliers, fourth in the Eastern Conference at 38-25, have good motivation to earn home-court advantage in the postseason. They fell to only 13-18 in road games to offset their 25-7 mark at home.

Donovan Mitchell had 19.The Hawks played their first game since coach Nate McMillan was fired on Tuesday. The team had three practices, including a shootaround session on Friday morning, under Prunty, who had been McMillan's lead assistant.“Each night is a new experience, understanding a team that is fresh and newly motivated,” said Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who said that created a challenge for his players “being prepared to match that, and I don't think we matched that enough. ... We didn't put up much resistance, especially in the first half.""The Cavaliers lost to Denver 115-109 on Thursday night.General manager Landry Fields said Wednesday that former Utah coach Quin Snyder is a candidate to replace McMillan. Snyder could be hired to take over the team this season.Atlanta held its big lead of 32 points for the last time at 103-71 late in the third quarter before Cleveland pulled to within 13 points at 108-95 in the final period. Atlanta then reclaimed its momentum.Murray missed his first five shots before making his next seven in the second period. The Hawks’ 49 points in the period were their most in any quarter this season. They led 81-57 at halftime, setting another season-high mark for points in an opening half.“I think we were pushing the ball and playing fast and getting some 3s and getting some stops, too,” Young said. “It was a big effort tonight on the defensive end, for sure.”Prunty said he worried his players would be rusty after the break and said “I was really impressed with our guys and how we started the game.”BEY IMPRESSESSaddiq Bey, acquired by Atlanta from Detroit on Feb. 9 as part of a three-team trade with Golden State, had 19 points while starting at power forward as a fill-in. John Collins (concussion protocol) did not play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821267,Giannis exits early with knee issue; Bucks rip Heat 128-99,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Milwaukee Bucks sure didn’t let Giannis Antetokounmpo’s early exit bother them Friday night as they rolled to their most-lopsided victory of the season.

            Now they wait to learn whether they might have to continue playing without the two-time MVP 

            Antetokounmpo left late in the first quarter with a right knee issue to spoil his rapid recovery from a sprained wrist, but the Bucks still trounced the Miami Heat 128-99 for their 13th consecutive triumph.











            “I haven’t gotten the full breakdown, but I’m pretty sure either on a a drive or on a screen or something like that, he knocked knees with somebody and just wasn’t able to return,"" said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, who had no update beyond that.

            Antetokounmpo was in the starting lineup just four days after heading to New York to have his right wrist examined. 

            “Sometimes you have to stop him from himself, being able to calm down and maybe even not play a couple of games, knowing that we’re No. 2 (in the East), knowing that we’re all right,"" said Jrue Holiday, who had 24 points. ""I know he doesn’t like it. He tries to play every single game, which I completely understand. I feel like I’m the same way.”

            Antetokounmpo was on the floor late in the first quarter when the two-time MVP passed the ball and immediately motioned to the bench as the Bucks called a timeout to enable him to head to the locker room.

            He had four points, four rebounds and four assists in just six minutes.

            The Bucks still had no trouble extending the longest winning streak in the NBA this season. The Bucks pulled ahead for good four minutes into the game and rolled to their most lopsided victory of the season.

            “It didn't slow them down one bit when Giannis went out,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “They just put it in overdrive.”

            Holiday shot 5 of 9 from 3-point range, had seven assists and five rebounds. He drew perhaps his biggest ovation of the night when the scoreboard video caught him joining the crowd singalong to the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” during a timeout late in the fourth quarter. 

            “That's a classic song,” Holiday said. “And we were winning. So good vibes.”

            Bobby Portis had 18 points and 11 rebounds in his return from a sprained right medial collateral ligament that caused him to miss 11 games. Brook Lopez had 17 points, Grayson Allen 16 and Khris Middleton 12.

            “It was fun just to be out there, fun just to play the game I love to play,” Portis said.

            Jimmy Butler scored 23, Bam Adebayo 18, Tyler Herro 14 and Caleb Martin 13 for the Heat, who shot just 9 of 40 on 3-point attempts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821272,Turkey begins to rebuild for 1.5 million left homeless by earthquakes,"ANTAKYA/ANKARA, Turkey, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Turkey has begun work to rebuild homes following this month's devastating earthquakes, a government official said on Friday, as the combined death toll in Turkey and Syria surpassed 50,000.More than 160,000 buildings containing 520,000 apartments collapsed or were severely damaged in the Feb. 6 earthquakes that killed tens of thousands in Turkey and neighbouring Syria.The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) announced the death toll in Turkey due to earthquakes rose to 44,218 on Friday night.With Syria's latest announced death toll of 5,914, the combined death toll in the two countries rose to above 50,000.Facing an election within months, President Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to rebuild homes within a year, although experts have said the authorities should put safety before speed. Some buildings that were meant to withstand tremors crumbled in the latest earthquakes.""For several projects, tenders and contracts have been done. The process is moving very fast,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding there would be no compromise on safety.Authorities say tents have been dispatched for the many who are homeless, but people have reported trouble accessing them.""I have eight children. We are living in a tent. There is water on top (of the tent) and the ground is damp. We are asking for more tents and they don't give them to us,"" Melek, 67, who was waiting in a line to collect aid outside a high school in the town of Hassa.The school was being used as an aid distribution center by a group of volunteers called Interrail Turkey. One volunteer, Sumeyye Karabocek, said the shortage of tents remained the biggest problem.HALF A MILLION NEW HOMES NEEDEDErdogan's government has endured a wave of criticism over both its response to the devastation and what many Turks say were years of non-enforcement of construction quality control.The Turkish government's initial plan now is to build 200,000 apartments and 70,000 village houses at a cost of at least $15 billion, he said. U.S. bank JPMorgan had estimated rebuilding houses and infrastructure will cost $25 billion.The UNDP said it estimated that the destruction has left 1.5 million people homeless, with 500,000 new homes needed.It said it had requested $113.5 million from the $1 billion in funds appealed for by the United Nations last week, adding that it would focus this money on clearing away mountains of rubble.The UNDP estimates that the disaster had produced between 116 million and 210 million tons of rubble, compared with 13 million tons of rubble after the earthquake in northwest Turkey in 1999.Turkey also issued new regulations under which companies and charitiescan build homes and workplaces to donate to the urbanisation ministry for people in need.Many survivors have left the region of southern Turkey that was hit by the quake or have been settled in tents, container homes and other government-sponsored accommodation.In Antakya, Saeed Sleiman Ertoglu, 56, loaded up what remained of his stock from his waterpipe shop that was not damaged.""The glassware was very beautiful, more than usual, but then we had this (earthquake), and it all got ruined,"" he said, after his home and shop survived the first tremors but not the later one. He estimated that just 5% of his merchandise survived.""What can we do?,"" he said. ""This is an act of God, and God’s will always bears gifts.""",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821273,Meta heats up Big Tech's AI arms race with new language model,"Feb 24 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it was releasing to researchers a new large language model, the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, heating up an AI arms race as Big Tech companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and impress investors.
The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to trumpet their own offerings.
Meta's LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, will be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society, and academia, it said in a blog.
Large language models mine vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content. They can answer questions, for instance, with sentences that can read as though written by humans.
The model, which Meta said requires ""far less"" computing power than previous offerings, is trained on 20 languages with a focus on those with Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.
""Meta's announcement today appears to be a step in testing their generative AI capabilities so they can implement them into their products in the future,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.
""Generative AI is a new application of AI that Meta has less experience with, but is clearly important for the future of their business.""
AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, whose slowing growth has prompted widespread layoffs and a cutback on experimental bets.
Meta said LLaMA could outperform competitors that examine more parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account.
Specifically, it said a version of LLaMA with 13 billion parameters can outperform GPT-3, a recent predecessor to the model on which ChatGPT is built.
It described its 65-billion-parameter LLaMA model as ""competitive"" with Google's Chinchilla70B and PaLM-540B, which are even larger than the model that Google used to show off its Bard chat-powered search.
A Meta spokeswoman attributed the performance to a larger quantity of ""cleaner"" data and ""architectural improvements"" in the model that enhanced training stability.
Meta in May last year released large language model OPT-175B, also aimed at researchers, which formed the basis of a new iteration of its chatbot BlenderBot.
It later introduced a model called Galactica, which could write scientific articles and solve math problems, but quickly pulled down the demo after it generated authoritative-sounding false responses.Feb 24 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it was releasing to researchers a new large language model, the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, heating up an AI arms race as Big Tech companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and impress investors.The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to trumpet their own offerings.Meta's LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, will be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society, and academia, it said in a blog.Large language models mine vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content.

            Terrence Ross made a 3-pointer at the third quarter buzzer to put the Suns up 94-87. Phoenix led the rest of the way and Booker’s 3-pointer with two minutes left gave the Suns an 11-point lead. It also gave the three-time All-Star 1,052 career 3-pointers, which set a franchise record.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821288,"Anderson makes 53 saves, Skinner powers Sabres past Panthers","SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Jeff Skinner scored twice and Craig Anderson made 53 saves against his former team to lead the Buffalo Sabres to a 3-1 win over the Florida Panthers on Friday night. 

            The 41-year-old Anderson spent three seasons with the Panthers (2006-09) and still maintains a home a few miles north of their arena. He helped Buffalo get to 64 points and pull into a three-way tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with Detroit and Florida. 

            The Sabres have not been to the Stanley Cup playoffs since 2011 — the longest drought in the NHL. 











            “The mind just shut off and you worry about the next shot,’’ said Anderson, who made 26 saves in the third period. 

            “Whatever the shot clock got to, it got to. That is about as good a game as I have played in a while. I was good mentally as in being sharp and in the moment. And that is tough to do. This was a night where I did.”

            Buffalo also got a power-play goal from Alex Tuch, and Tage Thompson had three assists. 

            Carter Verhaeghe scored his 31st of the season for the Panthers — who were playing without their two top centers in Aleksander Barkov and Sam Bennett due to injuries. Sergei Bobrovsky made 32 saves in the loss.

            Buffalo, coming off an overtime win at Tampa Bay on Thursday night, took the lead at 3:51 of the second period when Skinner found himself alone at the right side of the net and scored on a pass from Thompson. 

            The Sabres made it 2-0 on Tuch’s goal, which came two minutes after Buffalo had a goal taken off the board due to video review showing Tuch was offside.

            Florida finally got one past Anderson at 8:24 of the third period as Verhaeghe took a cross-ice pass from Anthony Duclair and fired a shot from the right circle. 

            “This was a huge home game and it is really disappointing to have the first two periods like that,’’ Verhaeghe said. “We’re in a playoff push and there is nothing we can do about it now. We have to be ready moving forward.” 

            Skinner got his second of the night and 24th of the season about two minutes later to give his team some breathing room again with a tough-angle shot from the goal line to beat Bobrovsky. 

            “I was pretty upset with them a couple games ago in between periods and said the only thing that matters now is grit and compete and pride,’’ Buffalo coach Don Granato said. “They take that to heart. This is a team with a lot of love for each other and what they’re doing and where we’re at in our community in Buffalo and they’ll fight for it. It’s nice to see.”

            NOTES: For the first time this season, the Panthers had Duclair in their lineup. He had been out since having Achilles tendon surgery in July. … With Barkov and Bennett out, Florida recalled Grigori Denisenko and Zac Dalpe from its AHL team in Charlotte. Denisenko had been sent to Charlotte on Wednesday to help clear cap space for Duclair. … Florida goalie Spencer Knight will be away from the team for an undetermined amount of time after entering the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program. … The Panthers also placed Givani Smith on long-term injured reserve after he was struck in the face by a puck Monday against Anaheim. … The Sabres made Rasmus Asplund, Jacob Bryson and Eric Comrie healthy scratches.

This is a team with a lot of love for each other and what they’re doing and where we’re at in our community in Buffalo and they’ll fight for it. It’s nice to see.”NOTES: For the first time this season, the Panthers had Duclair in their lineup. He had been out since having Achilles tendon surgery in July. … With Barkov and Bennett out, Florida recalled Grigori Denisenko and Zac Dalpe from its AHL team in Charlotte. Denisenko had been sent to Charlotte on Wednesday to help clear cap space for Duclair. … Florida goalie Spencer Knight will be away from the team for an undetermined amount of time after entering the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program. … The Panthers also placed Givani Smith on long-term injured reserve after he was struck in the face by a puck Monday against Anaheim. … The Sabres made Rasmus Asplund, Jacob Bryson and Eric Comrie healthy scratches.UP NEXTSabres: Host the Washington Capitals on Sunday afternoon.Panthers: Visit the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821290,Peru withdraws ambassador from Mexico amid dispute,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peruvian President Dina Boluarte announced on Friday the withdrawal of her country's ambassador to Mexico in response to criticism from Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, whom she reproached for hurting ties in order to “privilege ideological affinities.”

            In his regular morning press conference, Mexico's president said he had seen polls “where the spurious president (Boluarte) has 15% acceptance and 85% disapprove of her.” 

            He also said that members of Peru's Parliament have even less approval. “They have 90% of the rejection and even so they rule with bayonets and with repression, force.” 











            Later Friday, Boluarte rejected López Obrador's comments “on the internal affairs of Peru and the unacceptable questions that he repeatedly formulates about the constitutional and democratic origin of my government.”

            With the ambassador’s withdrawal, diplomatic relations between Peru and Mexico “formally remain at the level of charge d’affaires,” the president said in a statement at the presidential palace in Lima.

            Dina Boluarte took office on Dec. 7 after then-president Pedro Castillo was ousted by Parliament and jailed after trying to dissolve Congress to avoid a vote on his removal from office. 

            Since then, there have been almost three months of protests that have left 60 dead, 48 of them due to direct clashes with the police. One policeman was burned to death in a patrol car.

            The 41-year-old Anderson spent three seasons with the Panthers (2006-09) and still maintains a home a few miles north of their arena. He helped Buffalo get to 64 points and pull into a three-way tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with Detroit and Florida.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821311,LaMelo Ball helps Hornets beat Timberwolves 121-113,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — LaMelo Ball had 32 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and the dagger 3-pointer down the stretch to lead the Charlotte Hornets past the Minnesota Timberwolves 121-113 on Friday night.

            Gordon Hayward added a season-high 27 points and 13 rebounds and P.J. Washington had in 20 points for the Hornets. They won their third straight overall and stopped a seven-game road skid, handing the Timberwolves yet another setback against an opponent buried in the standings.

            “We’ve got a whole lot of talent on the team. Everybody can score. Everybody can shoot,” said Ball, who bested Minnesota All-Star Anthony Edwards in this battle of two of the top three picks in the 2020 draft. Edwards had 29 points and eight rebounds, bringing the Wolves to life in the fourth quarter and on the verge of avoiding a second damaging loss to the lottery-bound Hornets.











            But after Edwards hit a spin-dribble jumper on Ball for a 104-102 lead with 6:41 left, Ball answered with a step-back 3-pointer to put Charlotte back in front.

            Hayward's tip-in with 2:11 remaining gave the Hornets a 112-109 advantage. With 1:21 to go, Hayward passed up his own shot in the paint and dished to the top of the key for Ball's fifth 3-pointer of the game and a 117-111 lead.

            “He certainly isn’t afraid of any moment. It’s been fun to watch him develop over these last three years,” Hayward said.

            Rudy Gobert had 17 points and 10 rebounds, Mike Conley scored 15 points and Nickiel Alexander-Walker added 13 points for the Wolves, who were lacking focus and foul-happy on defense and watched the Hornets go 25 for 28 from the free-throw line.

            “We’re capable of doing it. That’s why it’s more disappointing than anything,"" Conley said. “We’ve just got to stop gambling, stop reaching, stop giving them opportunities at the free-throw line.”

            Kelly Oubre Jr. returned for the Hornets from a 24-game absence with his recovery from left hand surgery complete. Oubre, one of three 20-points-per-game scorers on the squad, had eight points in 23 minutes off the bench.

            “We had some timely buckets for sure,” Hayward said, “but more than anything we got the stops when we needed them, which has kind of been a problem for us all year.”

            Same for the Wolves, who had a lot more riding on this. They emerged from their break in seventh place in the Western Conference, with just two fewer wins than the fourth-place Clippers and only two fewer losses than the 13th-place Lakers in this absurdly crowded race for the playoffs. 

            The Wolves have only seven of their last 20 games at home, the fewest left in the league, with a daunting majority of their remaining schedule against teams currently above the postseason cut. That might not hurt them, though. They're 5-8 against the five worst teams in the NBA: Houston, San Antonio, Detroit, Charlotte and Orlando. 

            The Hornets, who beat the Wolves 110-108 at home on Nov. 25, shot 56% from the field in the first half for a 72-64 lead.

            “Defense, I think that’s the main thing we need to be able to bank on,” Edwards said. ""Every night we need to know that our defense is going to be there.”

            TOWNS STILL DOWN

            Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns was sidelined for the 41st straight game with a calf strain, an injury that still lacks a clear timetable for his return. 

            “He’s definitely in the final stages. He’s itching to play,"" coach Chris Finch said. ""I don’t think that it’s a question of anything like going off path right now.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821314,"LaVine, DeRozan lead Bulls to 131-87 rout of Nets","CHICAGO (AP) — Zach LaVine scored 32 points on 12-of-17 shooting and the Chicago Bulls drubbed the Brooklyn Nets 131-87 on Friday night to snap a six-game skid.

            Chicago held Brooklyn to a season low in points; its previous worst was 92 in a loss to Boston in December. The Nets lost by their biggest margin this season, one point worse than a defeat by the Celtics on Feb. 1.

            Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond each had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls. All-Star DeMar DeRozan and Patrick Williams each scored 17 points.











            The Bulls, who moved within 1 1/2 games of 10th place and the final play-in spot in Eastern Conference, stormed ahead early and never slowed down.

            “I think that's what we have to do from here on out and throw everything at these last 22 games because we understand where we are,"" LaVine said. “We have to put that type of energy into it.”

            The Bulls opened a 101-51 lead early in the fourth quarter.

            “I thought collectively as a group, the group was pretty connected on both ends with the way they played,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said.

            Cam Thomas came off the bench to lead the Nets with 22 points. Seth Curry had 19 and Mikal Bridges scored 13.

            Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Spencer Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith are trying to integrate as starters for the Nets, who acquired them earlier this month in the trades of All-Stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

            “We really have to be the hardest-playing team in the NBA,” Brooklyn coach Jacque Vaughn said. “When we don't, this can happen.

            “I'm going to continue to challenge our guys that this is unacceptable as a group. I want them to own it and respond.”

            The Bulls scored the first 11 points, built a 34-point lead at the half and thoroughly dominated the sloppy and cold-shooting Nets in the first game for both teams since the All-Star break.

            ""I thought our effort to get out there and contest and challenge shots and try to make it difficult was good,"" Donovan said. “I thought the group that started the game was really good.”

            The Bulls outshot the Nets 56.8% to 37% from the floor, dominated in the paint and out-rebounded them 57-31. Brooklyn, which has lost three of four, committed 13 turnovers and Chicago had six steals to fuel a wave of fast breaks.

            DeRozan started after missing last two games with right quadriceps strain and was able to rest down the stretch. He scored eight points for Team Giannis in the All-Star Game last Sunday.

            The Bulls led 63-29 in at the half, holding Brooklyn to its lowest output in a half this season and its worst-scoring quarter, 11 points in the second.

            BEVERLEY COMES HOME

            Veteran point guard Patrick Beverley scored eight points in his Bulls debut. The Chicago native was signed on Tuesday to help solidify the position with Lonzo Ball out for the season because of lingering discomfort in his surgically repaired left knee, and Donovan chose to start him.

            “I thought maybe we needed a different energy, try to switch things up,” Donovan said. “I thought our team needed a jolt, so to speak.”

            Beverley is a three-time All-NBA Defensive Team selection. He averaged 6.4 points in 45 games for the Lakers this season before getting dealt to Orlando, which waived him.

            VAUGHN IN CHARGE

            It was Vaughn’s first game since the team gave him a multi-year contract extension on Tuesday. He took over early this season after the Nets fired Steve Nash.

            TIP-INS

            Nets: G Ben Simmons missed the game and will sit out at least one more with left knee soreness. Simmons had practiced the last two days, but Vaughn said the team decided to put him “in a strengthening phase” to avoid a reoccurrence.

            Bulls: G Goran Dragic sat out his third game with a left knee injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821326,"N. Korea food shortage worsens amid COVID, but no famine yet","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — There’s little doubt that North Korea’s chronic food shortages worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and speculation about the country’s food insecurity has flared as its top leaders prepare to discuss the “very important and urgent task” of formulating a correct agricultural policy.

            Unconfirmed reports say an unspecified number of North Koreans have been dying of hunger. But experts say there is no sign of mass deaths or famine. They say the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party meeting is likely intended to shore up support for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he pushes ahead with his nuclear weapons program in defiance of intense U.S.-led pressure and sanctions. 

            “Kim Jong Un can’t advance his nuclear program stably if he fails to resolve the food problem fundamentally because public support would be shaken,” said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “The meeting is being convened to solidify internal unity while pulling together ideas to address the food shortage.”











            An enlarged plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party is slated for late February. Its specific agenda is unknown, but the party’s powerful Politburo earlier said that a “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote radical change in agricultural development.”

            The meeting will be the party’s first plenary session convened just to discuss agricultural issues, though they often are a key topic at broader conferences in North Korea. Raising grain output was one of 12 economic priorities the party adopted during a plenary meeting in December. 

            It is difficult to know the exact situation in the North, which kept its borders virtually closed during the pandemic. Food shortages and economic hardships have persisted since a famine killed an estimated hundreds of thousands of people in the mid-1990s.

            In his first public speech after taking over from his father as leader in late 2011, Kim vowed that North Koreans would “never have to tighten their belts again.”

            During the first several years of his rule, the economy achieved modest growth as Kim tolerated some market-oriented activities and increased exports of coal and other minerals to China, the North’s main ally and biggest trading partner. More recently, however, tougher international sanctions over Kim’s nuclear program, draconian pandemic-related restrictions and outright mismanagement have taken a severe economic toll.

            South Korean estimates put North Korea’s grain production last year at about 4.5 million tons, a 3.8% decrease from a year earlier. Annual grain output has plateaued at about 4.4 million tons to 4.8 million tons in the past decade. 

            North Korea needs about 5.5 million tons of grain to feed its 25 million people, so it’s usually short about 1 million tons each year. About half of the gap is typically offset by unofficial grain purchases from China. The rest is an unresolved shortfall, said Kwon Tae-jin, a senior economist at the private GS&J Institute in South Korea.

            Kwon says curbs on cross-border trade due to the pandemic have likely hindered unofficial rice purchases from China. Efforts by North Korean authorities to tighten controls and restrict market activities have also worsened the situation, he said.

            “I believe this year North Korea is facing its worst food situation since Kim Jong Un took power,” Kwon said.

            Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson at the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that an unknown number of North Koreans have died of hunger, but said the problem is not as serious as the mid-1990s famine, which stemmed from natural disasters, the loss of Soviet assistance and mismanagement.

            The current food problem is more an issue of distribution than of an absolute shortage of grain since much of the grain harvested last year has not yet been eaten, ministry officials said. Food insecurity has worsened as authorities tightened controls over private grain sales in markets, instead trying to confine the grain trade to state-run facilities. 

            Severe steps taken by the Kim government to contain the pandemic provided effective tools for imposing a tighter grip on the kinds of market activity that earlier helped foster stronger economic growth but might eventually erode the government’s authoritarian rule, analysts say.

            Kwon said current food shortages are unlikely to cause mass deaths because food is still available in markets, though at high prices. During the famine in the mid-1990s, grain was hard to come by, he said.

            North Korea monitoring groups have reported increases in the prices of rice and corn — the two most important staples — though the price of corn has stabilized recently in some regions. 

            “If North Korea indeed sees people dying of hunger and faces a chaos, it won’t publicly say things like ‘a very important and urgent task’ for an agricultural policy,” said Ahn Kyung-su, head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG, a website focusing on health issues in North Korea.

            The North’s plenary meeting is “typical propaganda” meant to show Kim is working to improve living conditions and comes at a time when the leadership needs new fodder to burnish his image, on top of the nuclear program and assertions of a victory over the pandemic, Ahn said. 

            During the plenary meeting, Kwon said that leaders will likely pressure local farm officials to raise grain output without presenting any effective solutions for the food crisis. Targets will be set and officials may be punished for failing to meet them if food shortages worsen, Ahn said.

            Yi Jisun, an analyst at the state-run Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul, said in a report in January that North Korea recently imported large amounts of rice and flour from China, though it is unlikely to accept food assistance from the United States, South Korea and Japan. 

            While declaring that food problems must be improved at any cost, the state-run media in the North have continued to tout its longstanding policy of “self-reliance,” a strategy that shuns Western help.

            “The assistance by imperialists is a trap for plundering and subjugation meant to wrest 100 things after giving one,” the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary Wednesday. “Building up the economy by receiving this ‘poisoned candy’ would be a mistake.”SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — There’s little doubt that North Korea’s chronic food shortages worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and speculation about the country’s food insecurity has flared as its top leaders prepare to discuss the “very important and urgent task” of formulating a correct agricultural policy.Unconfirmed reports say an unspecified number of North Koreans have been dying of hunger.

They say the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party meeting is likely intended to shore up support for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he pushes ahead with his nuclear weapons program in defiance of intense U.S.-led pressure and sanctions.“Kim Jong Un can’t advance his nuclear program stably if he fails to resolve the food problem fundamentally because public support would be shaken,” said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “The meeting is being convened to solidify internal unity while pulling together ideas to address the food shortage.”An enlarged plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party is slated for late February. Its specific agenda is unknown, but the party’s powerful Politburo earlier said that a “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote radical change in agricultural development.”The meeting will be the party’s first plenary session convened just to discuss agricultural issues, though they often are a key topic at broader conferences in North Korea. Raising grain output was one of 12 economic priorities the party adopted during a plenary meeting in December.It is difficult to know the exact situation in the North, which kept its borders virtually closed during the pandemic. Food shortages and economic hardships have persisted since a famine killed an estimated hundreds of thousands of people in the mid-1990s.In his first public speech after taking over from his father as leader in late 2011, Kim vowed that North Koreans would “never have to tighten their belts again.”During the first several years of his rule, the economy achieved modest growth as Kim tolerated some market-oriented activities and increased exports of coal and other minerals to China, the North’s main ally and biggest trading partner. More recently, however, tougher international sanctions over Kim’s nuclear program, draconian pandemic-related restrictions and outright mismanagement have taken a severe economic toll.South Korean estimates put North Korea’s grain production last year at about 4.5 million tons, a 3.8% decrease from a year earlier. Annual grain output has plateaued at about 4.4 million tons to 4.8 million tons in the past decade.North Korea needs about 5.5 million tons of grain to feed its 25 million people, so it’s usually short about 1 million tons each year. About half of the gap is typically offset by unofficial grain purchases from China. The rest is an unresolved shortfall, said Kwon Tae-jin, a senior economist at the private GS&J Institute in South Korea.Kwon says curbs on cross-border trade due to the pandemic have likely hindered unofficial rice purchases from China. Efforts by North Korean authorities to tighten controls and restrict market activities have also worsened the situation, he said.“I believe this year North Korea is facing its worst food situation since Kim Jong Un took power,” Kwon said.Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson at the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that an unknown number of North Koreans have died of hunger, but said the problem is not as serious as the mid-1990s famine, which stemmed from natural disasters, the loss of Soviet assistance and mismanagement.The current food problem is more an issue of distribution than of an absolute shortage of grain since much of the grain harvested last year has not yet been eaten, ministry officials said. Food insecurity has worsened as authorities tightened controls over private grain sales in markets, instead trying to confine the grain trade to state-run facilities.Severe steps taken by the Kim government to contain the pandemic provided effective tools for imposing a tighter grip on the kinds of market activity that earlier helped foster stronger economic growth but might eventually erode the government’s authoritarian rule, analysts say.Kwon said current food shortages are unlikely to cause mass deaths because food is still available in markets, though at high prices. During the famine in the mid-1990s, grain was hard to come by, he said.North Korea monitoring groups have reported increases in the prices of rice and corn — the two most important staples — though the price of corn has stabilized recently in some regions.“If North Korea indeed sees people dying of hunger and faces a chaos, it won’t publicly say things like ‘a very important and urgent task’ for an agricultural policy,” said Ahn Kyung-su, head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG, a website focusing on health issues in North Korea.The North’s plenary meeting is “typical propaganda” meant to show Kim is working to improve living conditions and comes at a time when the leadership needs new fodder to burnish his image, on top of the nuclear program and assertions of a victory over the pandemic, Ahn said.During the plenary meeting, Kwon said that leaders will likely pressure local farm officials to raise grain output without presenting any effective solutions for the food crisis. Targets will be set and officials may be punished for failing to meet them if food shortages worsen, Ahn said.Yi Jisun, an analyst at the state-run Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul, said in a report in January that North Korea recently imported large amounts of rice and flour from China, though it is unlikely to accept food assistance from the United States, South Korea and Japan.While declaring that food problems must be improved at any cost, the state-run media in the North have continued to tout its longstanding policy of “self-reliance,” a strategy that shuns Western help.“The assistance by imperialists is a trap for plundering and subjugation meant to wrest 100 things after giving one,” the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary Wednesday. “Building up the economy by receiving this ‘poisoned candy’ would be a mistake.”",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821327,"Avalanche blitz Jets early, win 5-1 for 4th straight","WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon scored 19 seconds in and the Colorado Avalanche got four goals on their first five shots Friday night in a 5-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets that extended their winning streak to four games.

            MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and J.T. Compher each had a goal and an assist. Bowen Byram and Matt Nieto also scored for the Avalanche (32-19-5), who are 5-0-1 in their past six games and 12-2-2 in their last 16.

            “We were rested and we got some good practice in this week,” said Compher, whose team last played at home Sunday in a 6-5 overtime victory against Edmonton. 











            “We were ready right from the puck drop and continued it for 60 minutes tonight.”

            Alexandar Georgiev made 26 saves for Colorado, which has also won four straight on the road.

            “Scored timely goals and played smart,” Georgiev said. “Managed to score some more in the second (period), and the third we shut them down completely.”

            Mason Appleton had the goal for the Jets (35-23-1), who are 1-4-0 in their past five games.

            Connor Hellebuyck stopped 21 of the 26 shots he faced in the opener of Winnipeg’s three-game homestand before he was replaced by David Rittich to start the third period. Rittich made 10 saves.

            Earlier in the week, Jets coach Rick Bowness said this matchup against Winnipeg's surging division rivals was the “most important game of the year.”

            “Well, we were asleep to start the game. No question,” Bowness said. “So you talk to the players and get their opinion. We were clearly asleep.”

            The Avalanche led 4-1 after the first and 5-1 following the second.

            “From the first shift, you saw, obviously, they capitalized on their chances,” Jets defenseman Brenden Dillon said. “They were quicker to pucks. They were physical. We got humbled tonight.”

            MacKinnon put Colorado ahead with his 20th goal of the season on a breakaway. It was the fastest game-opening goal by the Avalanche since MacKinnon scored 11 seconds in on Oct. 13, 2018.

            “You want to give credit to them, they’re a really good hockey team, but we didn’t help ourselves tonight,” Appleton said. “We’re a really good hockey team when we want to be. We were not that tonight.”

            Winnipeg tied it at 3:12 on the power play when Appleton tipped in Nate Schmidt's drive from the point.

            Rantanen made it 2-1 just 80 seconds later with his 37th of the season. He was followed by Compher three minutes later, and Byram bumped it to 4-1 at 10:58.

            The Jets had their second power play in the final two minutes of the period, but didn’t get a shot on net. 

            Winnipeg changed its defensive pairings to start the second, but Nieto went to the front of the net and tapped in a pass from Compher to make it 5-1 at 10:59.

            Colorado was 0 for 3 on the power play and Winnipeg went 1 for 5.

            “Some time off this week to get some practice time in and some rest time, so that benefited us early in the game,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said.

            “And then some really good discipline, structurally sound, made them earn all their chances. I thought we did a nice job on the defending side of it, moved the puck pretty efficiently tonight, so it turned out to be a pretty good performance for our group.”

            PILING UP POINTS

            MacKinnon has 14 points in a six-game point streak, including six goals. Compher has eight points in three games (two goals, six assists).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821340,Mexican states in hot competition over possible Tesla plant,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico is undergoing a fevered competition among states to win a potential Tesla facility in jostling reminiscent of what happens among U.S. cities and states vying to win investments from tech companies. 

            Mexican governors have gone to loopy extremes, like putting up billboards, creating special car lanes or creating mock-ups of Tesla ads for their states. 

            And there’s no guarantee Tesla will build a full-fledged factory. Nothing is announced, and the frenzy is based mainly on Mexican officials saying Tesla boss Elon Musk will have an upcoming phone call with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. 











            The northern industrial state of Nuevo Leon seemed to have an early edge in the race. 

            It painted the Tesla logo on a lane at the Colombia border crossing into Texas last summer, and erecting billboards in December in the state capital, Monterrey, that read “Welcome Tesla.”

            The state governor’s influencer wife, Mariana Rodriguez, was even shown in leaked photos at a get-together with Musk.

            However, López Obrador appeared to exclude the semi-desert state from consideration Monday, arguing he wouldn’t allow the typically high water use of factories to risk prompting shortages there. 

            That set off a competitive scramble among other Mexican states, like feeding time at a piranha tank. The governors’ offers ranged from crafty proposals to near-comic ones. 

            “Veracruz is the only state with an excess of gas,” quipped Gov. Cuitláhuac García of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, before quickly adding “gas … for industrial use, for industrial use!”

            A late-comer to the race, García had to try harder: He noted Veracruz was home to Mexico’s only nuclear power plant. And he claimed Veracruz had 30% of Mexico’s water, though the National Water Commission puts the state’s share at around 11%. Water, it turns out, is thicker than blood.

            The governor of the western state of Michoacan wasn’t going to be left out. Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla quickly posted a mocked-up ad for a Tesla car standing next to a huge, car-sized avocado — Michoacan’s most recognizable product — with the slogan “Michoacan — The Best Choice for Tesla.”

            “We have enough water,” Ramírez Bedolla said in a television interview he did between a round of meetings with auto industry figures and international business representatives.

            Michoacan also has an intractable problem of drug cartel violence. But similar violence in neighboring Guanajuato state hasn’t stopped seven major international automakers from setting up plants in Guanajuato.

            Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel García had to think fast to avoid being shut out entirely, and came up with a novel strategy.

            García reached out to the western state of Jalisco, whose governor, Enrique Alfaro, belongs to the same small Citizen’s Movement party. Together, the two came up with an “alliance” Thursday that would allow trucks from Jalisco preferential use of Nuevo Leon’s border crossing, the same one where a “Tesla” lane appeared last year.

            Jalisco has an already healthy foreign tech sector, but most importantly, it has more water than Nuevo Leon.

            The two appeared intent on playing nice. “We are two states that do not have to compete and cannibalize each other … cannibalization for investment is a mistake,” Alfaro said.

            López Obrador’s focus on water might be more about politics than about droughts, said Gabriela Siller, chief economist at Nuevo Leon-based Banco Base. She said the president appeared to be trying to steer Tesla investment to a state governed by his own Morena party, like Michoacan or Veracruz.

            That could be a dangerous game, Siller said. 

            “Tesla could say it’s not somebody’s toy to be moved around anywhere, and it could decide not to come to Mexico,” she said.

            Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at U.S.-based Guidehouse Insights, said playing one state off against another has been common practice in the U.S. 

            “You remember a few years back, Amazon talked about building their headquarters, like every state, city in the country was putting in bids, trying to lure Amazon there,” Abuelsamid said.

            There are doubts that whatever Musk eventually does announce will be an auto assembly plant. Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his understanding is that it won’t be a plant, but rather an “ecosystem” of suppliers.

            Musk previously has made promises that don’t come true, or happen years after he says they will. For instance, in 2019 he promised a fleet of fully autonomous robotaxis on the roads sometime in 2020. Nearly three years later, Tesla has yet to sell any autonomous vehicles. 

            While there has been little talk in Mexico so far of subsidies, many auto companies have gotten significant incentives to build plants in Mexico. That kind of race can be costly.

            “It’s questionable whether it’s actually that economically beneficial to localities or providing those subsidies,” said Abuelsamid. “They’re sometimes spending billions of dollars in tax breaks to lure a company in there.” 

            Musk at times has floated the idea of building a $25,000 electric vehicle that would cost about $20,000 less than the current Model 3, now Tesla’s least-expensive car. Many automakers build lower-cost models in Mexico to save on labor costs and protect profit margins. 

            A Tesla investment could be part of “near shoring” by U.S. companies that once manufactured in China but now are leery of logistical and political problems there. That those companies will now turn to Mexico represents the Latin American country’s biggest foreign investment hope.

            “The fight among states to attract investments from this nearshoring phenomenon is going to be tough, complicated,” Alfaro said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821353,Chicago mayor's race dominated by concerns about city crime,"CHICAGO (AP) — For years, Republicans have sought to win over voters by depicting Democratic-led cities as lawless centers of violence that need tough-on-crime policies. In Chicago, some of the Democrats running for mayor are deploying the same strategy as they debate how to make the city safer.

            One leading candidate, who touts his endorsement from the Chicago police union, says “crime is out of control” and the city needs hundreds more officers patrolling its streets. Another hopeful says that if suspects flee a crime scene, officers should be able to “hunt them down like a rabbit.” 

            Even incumbent Lori Lightfoot, the first Black woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago mayor, has used language right out of the GOP playbook, saying a top rival in her reelection bid wants to defund the police.











            The shift in rhetoric reflects the degree to which concerns about crime have dominated Tuesday's mayoral election in Chicago and threatened Lightfoot's reelection bid. Far from being an outlier, the nation’s third-largest city is just the latest Democratic stronghold where public safety has become a top election issue.

            In San Francisco, progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin was ousted in a recall election last year that was fueled by frustration over public safety. In Los Angeles, two Democrats running for mayor debated how to deal with rising crime rates and an out-of-control homelessness crisis. In New York City, voters elected Eric Adams as mayor, elevating a former city police captain who pledged to fix the department and invest more in crime prevention. And in Philadelphia, candidates running for mayor this year are debating how to curb gun violence.

            The increased attention on public safety follows a spike in crime rates in many communities that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. High-profile incidents of police misconduct drew more scrutiny of policing, and there has been disagreement even among Democrats about so-called progressive public safety policies such as ending cash bail or providing safe injection sites for drug users.

            Jaime Domínguez, a political science professor at Northwestern University, said it's the first time in 20 years that he's seen public safety be “front and center” in a Chicago mayoral election. 

            The difference, he said, is that crime is no longer largely isolated to some predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods. As more crime is occurring in other parts of the highly segregated city, including in the downtown and other areas frequented by tourists, public safety is also top of mind for white voters.

            “Historically, it was primarily a pocketed matter. It was still pernicious and candidates spoke to it, but it didn’t really affect areas where you see crime occurring now,” Dominguez said. “That has been blown up. It’s just, it’s everywhere.” 

            Chicago has a higher per-capita homicide rate than New York or Los Angeles, but it’s lower than other Midwestern cities, such as St. Louis and Detroit. Still, the number of homicides in Chicago hit a 25-year high in 2021 with 797, according to the Chicago Police Department. 

            That number decreased last year but is still higher than when Lightfoot took office in 2019. Other crimes, such as carjackings and robberies, have increased in recent years.

            Nine candidates are running in Tuesday's officially nonpartisan mayoral election. With no candidate expected to get over 50% of the vote, an April 4 runoff between the top two vote-getters is likely. 

            Randall Fearnow, a 67-year-old health care attorney who is white and who lives near Wrigley Field on the city's north side, experienced the city's crime problem firsthand when he and his wife walked in the back door of their home one day last October and discovered burglars inside. The criminals ransacked the home and stole thousands of dollars' worth of jewelry and money before running out the front door, he said. Police didn't catch the perpetrators.

            “It happened in the broad daylight,"" Fearnow said. “When you step out, it makes you feel a little uneasy. … You’re not immune anywhere from crime in the city.” 

            Fearnow cast an early ballot for Paul Vallas, who was endorsed by the Chicago police union. He also voted against Lightfoot four years ago, saying he believed her rival in the 2019 runoff was “much more level-headed.” This year, Fearnow said the two most important factors in his vote were crime and rising property taxes. 

            “The city gets more expensive to live in and less safe,” he said. “So somebody needs to do something.”

            As she fights to land a spot in the April runoff, Lightfoot has taken on opponents she sees as a threat — among them Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson. In a recent ad, Lightfoot accuses Johnson of wanting to defund police, using video of him speaking on a local radio program in 2020. During the interview, Johnson said reducing the amount of money spent on policing isn't a slogan but “an actual real political goal.”

            His statements came after the protests across the United States over the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd. Johnson also sponsored a nonbinding resolution, passed by the county board, that said money should be redirected from policing and incarceration and into social services. 

            Lightfoot said Johnson, who avoids the word “defund” when speaking on the campaign trail about policing, isn't being candid with voters. 

            “He’s asked direct questions at a variety of forums, and that guy’s got more bobs and weaves than Muhammad Ali,"" Lightfoot said.

            Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer endorsed by the Chicago Teachers Union, says he wants to invest more in areas such as mental health treatment. In a statement responding to Lightfoot, his campaign said that doesn't mean cuts to the police department. Johnson also notes that Chicago still has a violence problem even though the police budget grows every year. 

            ""Lori Lightfoot hasn’t made Chicago safer, but I will,” Johnson says in a new ad. “It’s time to get smart, not just tough.” 

            All of Lightfoot’s opponents want to fire the police superintendent she hired, saying that the former Dallas police chief has been ineffective and that hiring an outsider hurt morale. Lightfoot has defended the superintendent, David Brown, and says that while the city faced never-before-seen challenges such as the pandemic, their strategies are working and some crimes are falling. 

            Vallas, an adviser to the Fraternal Order of Police during the union's contract negotiations with Lightfoot's administration, says that if he becomes mayor, he would promote a new leadership team from within the department. Vallas says he would welcome back hundreds of officers who have retired or gone elsewhere out of frustration with Lightfoot. He also wants to return to a community policing strategy, with dedicated officers assigned to patrol each of the city's nearly 300 police beats. 

            “We’ve got to restore public safety,” said Vallas. “Everything proceeds from that.” 

            Wealthy businessman Willie Wilson, another mayoral candidate, has doubled down on his comment that suspects in violent crimes should be hunted down like rabbits. Wilson says he lost a son to gun violence, and he believes police officers are being prevented from doing their jobs.

            The other candidates are Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, Chicago City Council members Sophia King and Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja’Mal Green and state Rep. Kambium “Kam” Buckner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821354,Florida Dems pick Fried to lead party after tough midterms,"MIAMI (AP) — Florida Democrats selected former state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried as their new party chair on Saturday, hoping to move past a disastrous midterm performance in the onetime presidential battleground state where high-profile Gov. Ron DeSantis has helped cement Republican control.

            Fried, 45, outdistanced former state Sen. Annette Taddeo at a special meeting of party members in suburban Orlando, and will replace Manny Diaz. In his resignation announcement letter last month, he listed a number of problems facing the party, including a lack of resources and volunteers and poor messaging.

            Both women had lost their own races last year — Fried to Charlie Crist in the primary for governor and Taddeo to U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar in November.











            Within the past few years, Republicans have erased the voter registration advantage in Florida that Democrats held for decades. In the midterm election, longtime Democratic strongholds such as Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties flipped to the GOP, and DeSantis won a landslide reelection victory as he eyes a 2024 presidential bid.

            Democrats performed particularly poorly with Latinos in Florida compared with previous years. Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, is home to 1.5 million Latinos of voting age.

            Fried, whose term as agriculture commissioner wrapped up last month, has pledged to rebuild the party “from the ground up,” with a focus on voter registration. As the only statewide elected Democrat, Fried was a fierce critic of DeSantis, often challenging him on policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic and later on a law critics called the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

            Taddeo, 55, was a state senator from 2017 to 2022. She had said she wanted a year-round effort to register voters without outsourcing that job to other groups and to mobilize young voters. She also says the party must conduct more outreach to Black and Hispanic communities.

            Just over a decade ago, President Barack Obama won reelection to the White House after twice carrying the state of Florida. President Donald Trump won the state in the last two elections, carrying Florida by an even larger margin in 2020 than four years earlier.MIAMI (AP) — Florida Democrats selected former state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried as their new party chair on Saturday, hoping to move past a disastrous midterm performance in the onetime presidential battleground state where high-profile Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821357,Philippines marks 1986 revolt with dictator's son as leader,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Pro-democracy protesters in the Philippines marked the anniversary on Saturday of the 1986 army-backed “people power” revolt with the son of the dictator, who was ousted in that uprising, now leading the country. 

            About 1,400 demonstrators, some waving Philippine flags and holding placards that read “Never forget,” gathered at a democracy shrine along the main EDSA highway in metropolitan Manila. Left-wing activists, carrying an effigy that depicted President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as a pest, protested separately at a nearby pro-democracy monument.

            Faced with the awkward situation of issuing a statement to mark the revolt that toppled his namesake father, Marcos Jr. called for reconciliation without citing the event as a democratic milestone, as his predecessors had done.











            “I once again offer my hand of reconciliation to those with different political persuasions to come together as one in forging a better society — one that will pursue progress and peace and a better life for all Filipinos,” he said in a two-paragraph statement he posted on Facebook.

            Renato Reyes of the left-wing alliance Bayan said the president’s offer was a “good sound bite but lacks sincerity and substance” given Marcos Jr.’s refusal to acknowledge abuses under his father’s rule.

            Millions of Filipinos converged in February 1986 at the highway to shield top military and defense officials who defected from Marcos' administration. The ailing president, who imposed martial rule from 1972 to 1981, was driven with his family and cronies into U.S. exile.

            The uprising became a harbinger of change in authoritarian regimes. But in the nearly four decades since then, poverty, stark inequality between the rich and poor and a failure to address past wrongdoings have remained deeply entrenched, fanning political and social divisions. 

            The Marcoses returned to the Philippines in 1991 and gradually regained political power despite the plunder and widespread human rights atrocities four decades ago. 

            In May last year, Marcos Jr. won the presidential race in a landslide victory in one of history’s most dramatic reversal of fortunes. 

            “It’s mind-blowing in one sense, isn’t it? How did this happen? You remember those who sacrificed their lives and you feel so sad for those who were tortured, those who lost loved ones,” Judy Taguiwalo, a longtime former political detainee and torture survivor, told The Associated Press.

            Now 73 and ailing, Taguiwalo said her generation of activists who fought the dictatorship was slowly fading, but she remained defiant.

            “There’s a new generation of fighters,” she said. “Tyranny can return but there’s no forever in tyranny so long as we don’t stop resisting even if it’s an uphill battle or we get sidetracked by disinformation.”

            Marcos Jr.’s supporters called his massive victory a political vindication. Opponents said he clinched the top post through well-funded social media campaign that whitewashed the family history in a country regarded as one of the top users of Facebook and TikTok.

            The president has steadfastly rejected calls for him to apologize for the atrocities and plunder during his father’s rule and said in a TV interview last year that labeling the elder Marcos a dictator was wrong.

            The ousted leader died in exile in Hawaii three years after being overthrown without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he and his family amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.

            A Hawaii court found him liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.

            Butch Abad, a prominent activist who joined the 1986 uprising, said the army-backed revolution fortunately did not degenerate into a full-blown civil strife but peacefully restored democracy. He said it should have been used to introduce structural reforms aimed at eliminating poverty, social inequities and other volatile issues that helped ignite the revolt against the dictatorship in the first place.

            “Unfortunately, we stopped at ousting a dictator and did not pursue a deepening of democracy,” Abad said.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Pro-democracy protesters in the Philippines marked the anniversary on Saturday of the 1986 army-backed “people power” revolt with the son of the dictator, who was ousted in that uprising, now leading the country.About 1,400 demonstrators, some waving Philippine flags and holding placards that read “Never forget,” gathered at a democracy shrine along the main EDSA highway in metropolitan Manila. Left-wing activists, carrying an effigy that depicted President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as a pest, protested separately at a nearby pro-democracy monument.Faced with the awkward situation of issuing a statement to mark the revolt that toppled his namesake father, Marcos Jr. called for reconciliation without citing the event as a democratic milestone, as his predecessors had done.“I once again offer my hand of reconciliation to those with different political persuasions to come together as one in forging a better society — one that will pursue progress and peace and a better life for all Filipinos,” he said in a two-paragraph statement he posted on Facebook.Renato Reyes of the left-wing alliance Bayan said the president’s offer was a “good sound bite but lacks sincerity and substance” given Marcos Jr.’s refusal to acknowledge abuses under his father’s rule.Millions of Filipinos converged in February 1986 at the highway to shield top military and defense officials who defected from Marcos' administration. The ailing president, who imposed martial rule from 1972 to 1981, was driven with his family and cronies into U.S. exile.The uprising became a harbinger of change in authoritarian regimes. But in the nearly four decades since then, poverty, stark inequality between the rich and poor and a failure to address past wrongdoings have remained deeply entrenched, fanning political and social divisions.The Marcoses returned to the Philippines in 1991 and gradually regained political power despite the plunder and widespread human rights atrocities four decades ago.In May last year, Marcos Jr. won the presidential race in a landslide victory in one of history’s most dramatic reversal of fortunes.“It’s mind-blowing in one sense, isn’t it? How did this happen? You remember those who sacrificed their lives and you feel so sad for those who were tortured, those who lost loved ones,” Judy Taguiwalo, a longtime former political detainee and torture survivor, told The Associated Press.Now 73 and ailing, Taguiwalo said her generation of activists who fought the dictatorship was slowly fading, but she remained defiant.“There’s a new generation of fighters,” she said. “Tyranny can return but there’s no forever in tyranny so long as we don’t stop resisting even if it’s an uphill battle or we get sidetracked by disinformation.”Marcos Jr.’s supporters called his massive victory a political vindication. Opponents said he clinched the top post through well-funded social media campaign that whitewashed the family history in a country regarded as one of the top users of Facebook and TikTok.The president has steadfastly rejected calls for him to apologize for the atrocities and plunder during his father’s rule and said in a TV interview last year that labeling the elder Marcos a dictator was wrong.The ousted leader died in exile in Hawaii three years after being overthrown without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he and his family amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.A Hawaii court found him liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.Butch Abad, a prominent activist who joined the 1986 uprising, said the army-backed revolution fortunately did not degenerate into a full-blown civil strife but peacefully restored democracy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821358,"Thompson scores 42 points, Warriors beat Rockets 116-101","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Only last week ahead of the All-Star break did Klay Thompson even receive medical clearance to play on back-to-back nights, 13 months after his return from a more than 2 1/2-year absence recovering from knee and Achilles surgeries.

            He is flourishing again as he defiantly promised he would.

            Thompson scored 42 points and matched his season high with 12 3-pointers, leading the undermanned Golden State Warriors past the Houston Rockets 116-101 on Friday night.











            “I don’t like to talk about vintage me or am I my old self?"" Thompson said. ""I just think I'm being myself and I was capable of these things in the past and as long as my wrists still work, my feet work, I'll forever be able to shoot the rock.""

            It was Thompson's third career game with 12 or more 3s — NBA career 3-point leader Stephen Curry has done so twice, and Thompson let him know it.

            “It was one of those nights I had the hot hand,” he said. “It felt great, I can’t lie to you all.”

            Donte DiVincenzo added 15 points as the Warriors hung tough in the second game of a road-home back-to-back following a 124-111 loss at the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. Jordan Poole's 38-footer beat the halftime buzzer to put Golden State ahead 66-49 at the break, and he scored 15.

            KJ Martin had 22 points and eight rebounds, TyTy Washington Jr. scored 15 and Jae'Sean Tate 14 for the NBA-worst Rockets (13-46), who lost their eighth straight and fifth in a row on the road.

            Thompson shot 12 for 19 — all of his made shots coming from long range — and helped Golden State get rolling beginning the second on a 18-5 burst to build a 44-31 lead. Two off his career best for 3-pointers and four points shy of his season high, Thompson sat down for good to a roaring ovation with 1:41 remaining.

            “He was brilliant tonight and it’s just so great to see him now at the point where he can do this,” said coach Steve Kerr, who challenged Thompson to be a better rebounder. “I’m really happy for Klay, he’s put in the work. I really loved the fact he got seven rebounds.”

            The Warriors had lost two straight and four of five, but won their sixth of seven at home.

            Kevon Looney grabbed 13 rebounds for his fifth straight game with at least that many. He had been the first to do so in four consecutive games since Andrew Bogut in 2014. 

            Draymond Green had been listed as probable with a bruised right knee but didn't play, leaving the defending champions down three starters with Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins also missing. Green is likely to return Sunday.

            Curry, the reigning NBA Finals MVP, has sat out the past seven games with a left leg injury after getting hurt against Dallas on Feb. 4 in a collision while defending McKinley Wright IV as he drove to the basket. Wright’s knee hit Curry’s shin. An MRI exam showed partial tears to his superior tibiofibular ligament and interosseous membrane in his left leg. He also had a bruise.

            Rookie Patrick Baldwin Jr. added 11 points with three 3s. The Warriors' nine straight victories in the series marks their longest winning streak ever against Houston.

            Responding to Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu’s (王定宇) question about the president’s participation in the multilateral annual meeting, Wu said that Taiwan is a member of APEC and enjoys the same rights and obligations as other member countries and will continue to push for this, Liberty Times reported.

            Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) said that the matter needs to be further discussed with the host country, to see if there is such a possibility.

            Wang also asked if the closed-door security dialogue between Taiwan and U.S. officials at the American Institute in Taiwan in Virginia was unprecedented or a result of the Taiwan Travel Act. Wu said Taiwan-U.S. high-level dialogue has been going on for a long time.











            For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, being able to hold such regular communication with the U.S. and discuss issues of mutual concern is significant and it will also deepen bilateral relations, he said.

Communication between Taiwan and the U.S. is unhindered and views on issues of mutual concern are often shared, Wu said, but the content of the meeting will not be disclosed to the public.

            Tseng then asked if the president will visit the U.S. this year. Wu said the president's schedule is an important part of diplomacy, and MOFA makes travel plans according to the instructions of the Presidential Office.

            This year’s APEC meeting will be held in San Francisco from March 19-23 under the theme “Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All.” The meeting will cover issues including food security, health, anti-corruption, digitalization, women’s economic empowerment, and underrepresented communities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821383,"Appreciating Jimmy Carter, outspoken but 'never irrelevant'","WASHINGTON (AP) — Ever the outsider, Jimmy Carter served a turbulent term in the White House. His presidency was beset by soaring interest and inflation rates, gasoline pump lines and the Iran hostage crisis that eventually led to his re-election defeat.

            But he rose to even greater heights with his post-presidential career, devoting another four decades to working as an international envoy of peacemaking and democracy. James Earl Carter Jr., a peanut farmer who became the 39th president of the United States, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

            —-











            EDITOR’S NOTE — Walter Mears was an Associated Press special correspondent who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the 1976 presidential campaign. Prior to his death in 2022, Mears wrote this retrospective article in appreciation of Carter, who entered hospice care on Feb. 18.

            —-

            Trounced by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election, Carter was, at 56, a politician with only a past and ""a potentially empty life"" ahead. Then, in 1982, he organized the Carter Center in Atlanta.

            It kept him traveling, negotiating, leading election observation teams and speaking out, often to the discomfort or even resentment of the government he'd once led. Carter's Nobel citation honored ""his decades of untiring effort"" to resolve conflicts, promote democracy and foster economic development.

            The man who conceded that some considered him ""a failed president"" made himself the most active and internationally engaged of ex-presidents. ""My role as a former president is probably superior to that of other presidents,"" he said in a 2010 television interview.

            When he ran for president as a one-term former Georgia governor, Carter was so improbable a candidate that he said his mother asked him, ""President of what?""

            To answer that and his all-but-invisible name recognition rating, he started campaigning early. Carter covered some 50,000 campaign miles, his garment bag draped over his shoulder.

            He won the Democratic nomination and challenged President Gerald Ford, Nixon's appointed vice president.

            Ford had pardoned Nixon for any Watergate crimes. In the aftermath of Watergate, Carter was the anti-Richard Nixon figure. ""I will never lie to you,"" he told voters. But Carter was elected by only 2 percentage points.

            The newly elected president and wife Rosalynn shunned the limousine and walked from the Capitol to the White House after his inauguration and tried to drop some of the pomp surrounding the presidency. But his solo style and unintended snubs left him short of political allies when he'd need their help.

            For all that, Carter's term left landmarks, such as the Israel-Egypt peace accord he engineered in personal negotiations at Camp David in 1978.

            He won the beginnings of an energy conservation policy. He gained ratification of the treaties that yielded U.S. control of the Panama Canal. He opened full diplomatic relations with China. The departments of energy and education were created. But his administration struggled and Carter shook up his Cabinet amid “a crisis of confidence.”

            And then things got worse.

            On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian demonstrators invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, incited by their ayatollah to retaliate for the exiled former shah's admission into the United States for medical treatment. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage for more than a year. Carter tried to negotiate, and when that didn't work, he ordered the military rescue attempt that failed disastrously in the desert in April 1980.

            Eight Americans were killed in the attempt. It was Carter's bleakest hour.

            The hostage crisis shadowed and essentially crippled Carter's re-election campaign. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him in the Democratic primaries.

            After that, it was all uphill against Reagan. Carter carried only six states to Reagan's 44.

            Minutes after Reagan was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1981, the hostages were freed after 444 days in captivity. Carter's first major act as an ex-president was as Reagan's special envoy to welcome the freed hostages in Wiesbaden, Germany, the next day.

            Jimmy Carter, the only president inaugurated by nickname, was born in tiny Plains, Georgia, where he arranged to be buried. The father for whom he was named was in the peanut business, with a farm and warehouse. His father, brother, Billy, and two sisters all died of pancreatic cancer.

            Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, the year he married Rosalynn Smith, also of Plains. They had three sons and a daughter, Amy, the youngest child, who went with them to the White House.

            Carter spent nearly seven years in the Navy's nuclear submarine force, resigning to take over the family business after his father died in 1953. His first political stop was in the Georgia State Senate. A Democratic moderate with a New South image, Carter was elected governor of Georgia in 1970, succeeding segregationist Lester Maddox and gaining his first national note when he declared in his inauguration address ""the time for racial discrimination is over.""

            After he lost his presidential re-election bid, a shaken Carter retreated to Plains, to ""an altogether new, unwanted"" chapter in his life.

            He began the Carter Center which, he said later, offered ""superior opportunities to do good."" He and Rosalynn also worked with Habitat for Humanity, building housing for the poor in the United States and abroad.

            Carter was a tireless peacemaker who bypassed usual diplomatic channels and, as he said in 1994, went ""where others are not treading"" — places such as Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had been imprisoned after wandering across the border in 2010.

            He helped oversee democratic elections in Nicaragua and Haiti, and the first Palestinian elections. Altogether, he participated in 39 of the center’s 100 election observation trips.

            Carter said his center ""filled vacuums in the world. When the United States won't deal with troubled areas, we go there.""

            And not always quietly.

            He went to Cuba in 2002, met with Fidel Castro, then delivered a televised speech calling for an end to the U.S. trade embargo. He likened Israeli policy toward the Palestinians to apartheid. He denounced the Iraq war as ""based upon lies."" He said George W. Bush was the worst president in history in foreign affairs.

            That prompted a Bush White House spokesman to describe Carter as ""irrelevant.""

            He could be meddlesome, a freelance diplomat who irked more than one administration.

""My role as a former president is probably superior to that of other presidents,"" he said in a 2010 television interview.When he ran for president as a one-term former Georgia governor, Carter was so improbable a candidate that he said his mother asked him, ""President of what?""To answer that and his all-but-invisible name recognition rating, he started campaigning early. Carter covered some 50,000 campaign miles, his garment bag draped over his shoulder.He won the Democratic nomination and challenged President Gerald Ford, Nixon's appointed vice president.Ford had pardoned Nixon for any Watergate crimes. In the aftermath of Watergate, Carter was the anti-Richard Nixon figure. ""I will never lie to you,"" he told voters. But Carter was elected by only 2 percentage points.The newly elected president and wife Rosalynn shunned the limousine and walked from the Capitol to the White House after his inauguration and tried to drop some of the pomp surrounding the presidency. But his solo style and unintended snubs left him short of political allies when he'd need their help.For all that, Carter's term left landmarks, such as the Israel-Egypt peace accord he engineered in personal negotiations at Camp David in 1978.He won the beginnings of an energy conservation policy. He gained ratification of the treaties that yielded U.S. control of the Panama Canal. He opened full diplomatic relations with China. The departments of energy and education were created. But his administration struggled and Carter shook up his Cabinet amid “a crisis of confidence.”And then things got worse.On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian demonstrators invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, incited by their ayatollah to retaliate for the exiled former shah's admission into the United States for medical treatment. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage for more than a year. Carter tried to negotiate, and when that didn't work, he ordered the military rescue attempt that failed disastrously in the desert in April 1980.Eight Americans were killed in the attempt. It was Carter's bleakest hour.The hostage crisis shadowed and essentially crippled Carter's re-election campaign. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him in the Democratic primaries.After that, it was all uphill against Reagan. Carter carried only six states to Reagan's 44.Minutes after Reagan was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1981, the hostages were freed after 444 days in captivity. Carter's first major act as an ex-president was as Reagan's special envoy to welcome the freed hostages in Wiesbaden, Germany, the next day.Jimmy Carter, the only president inaugurated by nickname, was born in tiny Plains, Georgia, where he arranged to be buried. The father for whom he was named was in the peanut business, with a farm and warehouse. His father, brother, Billy, and two sisters all died of pancreatic cancer.Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, the year he married Rosalynn Smith, also of Plains. They had three sons and a daughter, Amy, the youngest child, who went with them to the White House.Carter spent nearly seven years in the Navy's nuclear submarine force, resigning to take over the family business after his father died in 1953. His first political stop was in the Georgia State Senate. A Democratic moderate with a New South image, Carter was elected governor of Georgia in 1970, succeeding segregationist Lester Maddox and gaining his first national note when he declared in his inauguration address ""the time for racial discrimination is over.""After he lost his presidential re-election bid, a shaken Carter retreated to Plains, to ""an altogether new, unwanted"" chapter in his life.He began the Carter Center which, he said later, offered ""superior opportunities to do good."" He and Rosalynn also worked with Habitat for Humanity, building housing for the poor in the United States and abroad.Carter was a tireless peacemaker who bypassed usual diplomatic channels and, as he said in 1994, went ""where others are not treading"" — places such as Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had been imprisoned after wandering across the border in 2010.He helped oversee democratic elections in Nicaragua and Haiti, and the first Palestinian elections. Altogether, he participated in 39 of the center’s 100 election observation trips.Carter said his center ""filled vacuums in the world. When the United States won't deal with troubled areas, we go there.""And not always quietly.He went to Cuba in 2002, met with Fidel Castro, then delivered a televised speech calling for an end to the U.S. trade embargo. He likened Israeli policy toward the Palestinians to apartheid. He denounced the Iraq war as ""based upon lies."" He said George W. Bush was the worst president in history in foreign affairs.That prompted a Bush White House spokesman to describe Carter as ""irrelevant.""He could be meddlesome, a freelance diplomat who irked more than one administration.But never irrelevant.",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821385,"Devin Booker scores 25 points, Suns beat Thunder 124-115","PHOENIX (AP) — The Phoenix Suns are still looking forward to the debut of recently acquired superstar Kevin Durant.

            While they wait, Devin Booker isn't a bad backup plan.

            Booker scored 25 points, Chris Paul added 16 and the Phoenix Suns beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 124-115 on Friday night.











            Booker's had his own injury problems this season, missing chunks of time with hamstring and groin issues. He got back on the floor a few weeks ago and looks back to his old high-scoring self.

            “I feel great,” Booker said. “I'm trying to get wind all the way back. Games like this are important for that. When you have injuries to the lower half of your body, you can't really condition.”

            Surging Phoenix has won 12 of 16.

            Terrence Ross made a 3-pointer at the third quarter buzzer to put the Suns up 94-87. Phoenix led the rest of the way and Booker’s 3-pointer with two minutes left gave the Suns an 11-point lead.

            It also gave the three-time All-Star 1,052 career 3-pointers, which broke Steve Nash's franchise record.

            Isaiah Joe led Oklahoma City with a career-high 28 points. The third-year guard shot 11 of 17, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range. Jalen Williams added 22 points.

            “Teammates were finding me, I was in the right position, knocking down shots,” Joe said. 

            The Suns are still awaiting the debut of Durant, who was dealt to the desert by the Brooklyn Nets just before the trade deadline. Durant is recovering from a sprained MCL in his right knee but is expected to return soon.

            The Thunder also were without a key piece — All-Star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed the game with right ankle soreness.

            “I thought our offense kept us in the game tonight,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We had a hard time getting a handle in them defensively. They did a really good job attacking.”

            Even without Durant, the Suns showed impressive depth. Josh Okogie scored 15 points, Deandre Ayton added 14 points and 11 rebounds and Cam Payne scored 14 points off the bench in his return from a foot injury.

            “He brought a level of juice tonight that we needed,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “The shot making, the quick attacking to the paint and then defensively, I thought he was a pest.”

            Okogie scored 15 points as the Suns took a 65-60 halftime lead. Joe had 21 points for the Thunder before the break on 8-of-11 shooting, going 5 of 8 from 3-point range.

            DURANT CLOSE

            Durant appears close to making his Suns debut.

            The 13-time All-Star played in a scrimmage on Thursday at the team's facility and Williams said the veteran's body responded well. He was also working out on the court before Friday's game.

            Durant was dealt to the Suns two weeks ago in a blockbuster deal that sent Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder and four first-round picks back to the Nets.

            WAINRIGHT SIGNS DEAL

            Forward Ish Wainright signed a multi-year contract before the game.

            The backup has emerged as a useful piece in the Suns rotation this season, averaging 4.3 points and 2.1 rebounds per game. The muscular 6-foot-5, 235-pounder played basketball and a year of football in college at Baylor.

            Wainright had 10 points against the Thunder.

            TIP-INS

            Thunder: F Dario Saric returned to Phoenix for the first time since he was traded to Oklahoma City. He was a key part of the rotation when the Suns made the Finals in 2021. The Suns honored Saric with a highlight montage during a timeout in the first quarter.

            Suns: Payne was available for just the third time since mid-December. He's been battling a foot injury. The backup point guard hit his first 3-pointer of the night, earning a big roar from the home crowd. ... G Landry Shamet (right foot soreness) was not available. ... Hosted a 57th straight sellout crowd.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821395,Germany's Scholz in India: What's at stake?,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to India is aimed at strengthening security and defense cooperation amid a host of geopolitical tensions.The visit on February 25 and 26 will include a crucial meeting between Scholz and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The pair met several times in 2022 but this trip marks the German chancellor's first time in the country since taking office.The trip also commences a day after the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The resulting war and its global impact will be a top discussion point, and the meeting is expected to emphasize the need for a robust India-Germany and India-European Union partnership to tackle the formidable challenges the world is facing.Additionally, the leaders are set to discuss green technology, economic cooperation, and the Indo-Pacific strategy.This is the first standalone visit of a German chancellor to India since the biennial Inter-Governmental Consultation (IGC) mechanism commenced in 2011.Scholz will be accompanied by a business delegation that includes CEOs of 12 major companies counting Siemens and SAP, as well as the heads of Germany's small and medium-sized business associations.During the visit, Modi and Scholz will address a business roundtable comprising top industry leaders from both sides.""Chancellor Scholz's visit will enable both sides to take stock and progress on the key outcomes of the 6th IGC, strengthen security and defense cooperation, work towards closer economic ties, enhance the opportunity for mobility of talent and give strategic guidance to ongoing collaboration in science and technology,"" a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs said.According to foreign policy experts and diplomats, Germany is India's largest trade partner in the EU and has dependably been among India's top 10 global trade partners. The total bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $24.8 billion (€23.4 billion) during 2021–22.Germany is the ninth largest investor in India, with cumulative foreign direct investment inflows of $13.8 billion from April 2000 to September 2022.Key areas of German investment in India have been transportation, electrical equipment, and metallurgical industries, the services sector (insurance), chemicals, construction activity, trading and automobiles.Trade is clearly a focus of the trip but that there's another layer to this did not escape German ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann. He explained at a press briefing ahead of the trip: ""India buying oil from Russia is none of our business. Basically, that's something that the Indian government decides... what we would like to see of course, is an Indian engagement at some stage.""Anil Wadhwa, former diplomat and strategic analyst, agreed that the trip had mixed goals. ""The agenda of the Scholz visit will have a bilateral agenda for cooperation on climate change, utilization of German technologies and the advancement of German interests in India's economy,"" Wadhwa told DW.""The chancellor will talk geopolitics with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We will see Russia and Ukraine very high on the agenda,"" Ackermann stressed at the press briefing.Experts highlighted the ways in which Germany and India may be looking for assurances on the topic.""German interests and economy are badly affected because of the ongoing war,"" said Wadhwa. ""This is placing a heavy strain on the state's exchequer, rising costs of fuel and electricity and a cutting down of expenses like holidays and the German way of life.""This sentiment was echoed by Meera Shankar, a former Indian envoy to the United States. Shankar maintained that Scholz's visit comes at a difficult time for the world, with the war in Ukraine looking set to intensify.""India is likely to urge the need for winding down the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy and dialogue,"" Shankar told DW. ""This has hit the economies of developing nations particularly hard and carries with it the danger of a larger conflict.""India's official position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine is hard to pin down, after a decades-long strategic relationship with Moscow.While New Delhi has articulated its position against the Ukraine war more robustly to counter criticism that it is soft on Russia, it has still not openly held Moscow accountable for the invasion. India has also not changed its policy on importing Russian oil and coal.German Foreign and Security Policy Advisor Jens Plötner summed up the challenge that the ongoing conflict may likely have on Scholz's trip. ""Obviously as wonderful as our bilateral relations are, they are not evolving in a kind of clean environment,"" he said during a press briefing. ""We are embedded in a very messy international situation full of challenges. The Russian war against Ukraine. This is a European war. But it is a war with global repercussions.""Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs, believes Scholz's visit will explore the rise of China and its expanding economic, political, and military engagements.There are similar concerns in India that the war in Ukraine is pushing Russia closer to China, which has troubled relations with New Delhi.""There is a rethink in the EU with the US pushing hard for the industry to diversify trade beyond China,"" Chaulia told DW. ""Because of human rights issues and the handling of the [coronavirus] pandemic, Germany is thinking of reducing the economy's dependence on Beijing for many of its critical goods.""Chaulia added an area that Germany could possibly commit to in discussions: ""Germany could provide more infrastructure and technical expertise to ramp up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific policy,"" he said.Whatever the outcome, the trip can be viewed as an important strategic development for Berlin, Gurjit Singh, former ambassador to Germany told DW.""The rapid exchange of meetings between Scholz and Modi shows a new confidence and perception. This gives the India-German relationship deeper importance and more visits and exchanges are improving the impact of the partnership.""Recently, the relationship between India and Germany has been warming. In December 2022, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also traveled to India, where she signed a mobility partnership pact to make it easier for people to study and work in each other's country.Every Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821406,German leader seeks Indian support for Russia's isolation,"NEW DELHI (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought assurances Saturday from India that it would support, or at least not block, Western efforts to isolate Russia for waging a devastating war against Ukraine.

            Following his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Scholz stressed that developing countries were being negatively impacted by energy and food shortages resulting from the war and hopes that India will help secure critical supplies to Asia, Africa and the Americas. 

            Modi maintained his cautious approach and said India wanted the conflict to be ended through dialogue and diplomacy. ""India is ready to make its contribution to any peace initiative,"" he added.











            He has refrained from any overt criticism of Russia as Moscow is a major supplier of arms, oil and India’s other economic needs.

            Scholz said that Russia's war against Ukraine ""violated the fundamental principle to what we all agree of not changing borders through the use of violence.""

            While the two leaders took no questions from the media after their meeting, Scholz later told German reporters that he and Modi had discussed the war in Ukraine “very extensively and very intensly,” but declined to elaborate, citing the confidential nature of the talks.

            Scholz, who arrived in the Indian capital on Saturday, also discussed with Modi ways to boost economic cooperation, including through a free trade agreement between the European Union and India. Scholz made clear he favors a free trade deal and said he “personally will make sure that (the talks) do not drag on.”

            The trip is Scholz's first official visit to India, though it is his fourth meeting with Modi since taking office in 2021, underlining Germany’s interest in reaching out to Delhi.

            “There is huge potential for intensified cooperation in sectors such as renewables, hydrogen, mobility, pharma and digital economy” with India, Scholz said in an interview published by The Times of India newspaper on Saturday.

            After a videoconference with fellow leaders from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday, Scholz said before leaving Berlin that “internationally, we are endeavoring to make clear that Russia stands alone in the world with its aggression against Ukraine.”

            Philipp Ackermann, the German ambassador to India, said he understands why India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia.

            ""That’s something that the Indian government decides and as you get it at a very, very low price, you know I cannot blame the Indian government for buying it,” New Delhi Television cited Ackermann as saying. 

            Germany has been pushing to diversify its economic relations as it and other European countries try to avoid being dependent on China, a German official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters.

            Modi said the business delegation accompanying Scholz was firming up agreements with India in digital technology, the telecommunication sector and diversification of supply chains.

            Scholz reiterated that Germany welcomes skilled workers from India, especially in information technology and software industries.

            ""We want to benefit from the Indian talent employed in Germany in the industrial sector,"" he said.

            Speaking to reporters later Saturday, Scholz said Germany could help India achieve its ambitious goals when it comes to expanding renewable power generation.

            India is set to receive $10.5 billion in aid by 2030 to boost the use of clean energy under agreements the two sides signed in May last year. 

            Scholz's delegation included several German business leaders, including the head of ThyssenKrupp, which is trying to sell further submarines to India.

            Asked whether such a deal with India, which has been a major buyer of arms from Russia, could be struck, Scholz said he had “the impression that the quality of German technology enjoys great recognition and appreciate here.”

            The two-day visit will also take Scholz to India’s information technology hub Bengaluru on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821407,Warner Bros. Discovery sues Paramount over 'South Park' deal,"NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. is suing Paramount Global, saying its competitor aired new episodes of the popular animated comedy series “South Park” after Warner paid for exclusive rights.

            Warner says it signed a contract in 2019 paying more than $500 million for the rights to existing and new episodes of the irreverent show, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in New York State Supreme Court. 

            HBO Max, Warner’s streaming platform, was scheduled to receive the first episodes of a new “South Park” season in 2020. But the company was informed the pandemic halted production, the lawsuit says.











            In spite of Warner's exclusive rights to the show until 2025, the company alleges South Park Digital Studios, which produces the shows and is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, offered two pandemic-themed specials to Paramount, which aired them in September 2020 and March 2021. 

            The lawsuit claims the pandemic specials should have been offered to Warner under the initial contract. The move, called “verbal trickery” in the lawsuit, drove the show's fans to the competing Paramount platform. Nearly all South Park episodes premiere on Comedy Central, one of Paramount’s cable channels, the lawsuit says.

            Show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who launched the show in 1997 and oversee the franchise, were not named in the lawsuit.

            Gaining streaming rights to “South Park” is a competitive process because of the potentially lucrative market attracting more subscribers, advertisers and a loyal fan base that Warner's lawsuit says consists mostly of young adults. 

            The 24-page court filing also cites a $900 million deal in 2021 between a Paramount subsidiary and South Park Digital Studios for exclusive content on the Paramount Plus streaming service, which launched the same year.

            Warner claims the deal was a deliberate “scheme” between Paramount, its subsidiary MTV Entertainment Studios and South Park Digital Studios to “divert as much of the new South Park content as possible to Paramount Plus in order to boost that nascent streaming platform.”

            Warner paid $1,687,500 per episode and alleges it has not yet received all episodes covered by the contract, resulting in damages of more than $200 million.

            Paramount Global did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on the lawsuit.NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. is suing Paramount Global, saying its competitor aired new episodes of the popular animated comedy series “South Park” after Warner paid for exclusive rights.Warner says it signed a contract in 2019 paying more than $500 million for the rights to existing and new episodes of the irreverent show, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in New York State Supreme Court.HBO Max, Warner’s streaming platform, was scheduled to receive the first episodes of a new “South Park” season in 2020. But the company was informed the pandemic halted production, the lawsuit says.In spite of Warner's exclusive rights to the show until 2025, the company alleges South Park Digital Studios, which produces the shows and is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, offered two pandemic-themed specials to Paramount, which aired them in September 2020 and March 2021.The lawsuit claims the pandemic specials should have been offered to Warner under the initial contract. The move, called “verbal trickery” in the lawsuit, drove the show's fans to the competing Paramount platform.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821420,Kings outlast Clippers 176-175 in double overtime,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — There were a couple moments Friday night when Sacramento coach Mike Brown wishes he could have enjoyed being a part of the second-highest scoring game in NBA history.

            Brown and his Kings though were able to savor something that is more important in the long run — a hard-fought victory.

            Malik Monk scored a career-high 45 points, De’Aaron Fox had the go-ahead basket and finished with 42 and Sacramento outlasted the Los Angeles Clippers 176-175 in double overtime.











            It is only the second time in the NBA's 76-year history that both teams have scored at least 170 points. Detroit beat Denver 186-184 in triple overtime on Dec. 13, 1983, in what remains the highest-scoring NBA game. 

            The Kings are third on the scoring list with the 176 points and the Clippers fourth. A team has scored 170 points in a regular-season game only seven times.

            “From a fan’s standpoint, I can see how this game would have been a lot of fun to watch,” Brown said. ""There was unbelievable shot making and great defense. There was high-level talent that was on display. Kudos to the players.

            Sacramento and Los Angeles also combined for 44 3-pointers, tied for the most in a game in NBA history.

            Both teams also shot at least 58% from the field and were 80% or better from the foul line.

            “I thought was a great game. A lot of momentum shifts,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.

            The Clippers had a 175-169 advantage with 1:57 remaining before the Kings scored the final seven points, including Fox's jumper with 36.5 seconds remaining. The Clippers had the final shot, but Nico Batum missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.

            The Kings also overcame a 14-points deficit late in the fourth quarter and six-point deficits in both overtime periods. 

            “We just stuck with it. We got down 12 at one point but just had our heads up. We knew they were going to let us back in,” Monk said.

            It was the first time in franchise history the Kings have had two players score at least 40 points in a game. It is the second time it has happened in an NBA game this season after Cleveland's Caris LeVert and Donovan Mitchell did it against Boston.

            Fox — who also had 12 assists and five steals — is just the 12th player since 1973-74 with 40 points, 10 assists and five steals in a game. The last to do it was James Harden in 2019.

            “We just had to grind this game out. We were on the second night of a back-to-back but it is what it is. We have a younger team than them,” Fox said.

            Kawhi Leonard scored a season-high 44 points for Los Angeles and Paul George added 34. Leonard had 21 points in the third quarter, which tied his career high for points scored in a quarter.

            “I thought he did a great job getting to a spot with the 3-point shots and attacking the basket,” Lue said about Leonard.

            Russell Westbrook started and made his Clippers debut after he cleared waivers Wednesday. He had 17 points, 14 assists and five rebounds in 39 minutes before fouling out with 1:49 remaining in the second overtime. 

            RALLY KINGS

            Los Angeles had a 145-131 advantage with 4:25 remaining before the Kings rallied back to force overtime with a 22-8 run. Monk forced the extra session with a 3-pointer from the corner with 1.1 seconds remaining.

            Sacramento’s key spurt late in regulation was 10 straight points that got it to 147-146 with 1:22 left.

            The Clippers had a 162-156 lead with 3:04 remaining in the first overtime before the Kings scored six straight to even it. Monk hit a pair of free throws with 20.4 seconds left to tie it at 164. Los Angeles had a chance to win it, but Leonard was unable to put in a tip in at the buzzer.

            LEONARD'S NIGHT

            It is the sixth 40-point game in Leonard’s 10-year career and his second since joining the Clippers in the summer of 2019. He was 16 of 22 from the field, including six 3-pointers, in 46 minutes.

            TOUGH NIGHT

            Sacramento center Domantas Sabonis played only 31 minutes after being in foul trouble most of the night. He picked up his four fouls in the first half and then drew his fifth with 6:46 remaining in the third quarter.

            Sabonis, who got his seventh triple-double in Thursday night’s win over Portland, fouled out with 3:09 remaining in the first overtime. He finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds and four assists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821427,President Tsai Ing-wen reportedly visiting US in August,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) is reportedly set to visit the U.S. in August, according to Sankei Shimbun.

            The Japanese newspaper cited several Taiwanese officials as saying that Tsai, who will finish her final presidential term in May 2024, intends to visit the U.S. to highlight her administration's diplomatic achievements and the close relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan.

            According to people familiar with the matter, there are three proposals for Tsai’s visit. The first is to give a lecture at an event hosted by her alma mater, Cornell University. The second is to participate in an event hosted by a U.S. think tank. The third plan is to attend the presidential inauguration of the next Paraguay president, which is scheduled for August, and then stop over in the U.S.

            The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a statement Saturday afternoon (Feb. 25) saying the media reports are speculation and not factual. “Arranging high-level visits abroad has always been a key task of the ministry,” MOFA said.











            If there is a specific plan for the president to visit the U.S., the Presidential Office and MOFA would announce it to the public in due course, the ministry added.

            Tsai last visited the U.S. in 2019, stopping in New York and Denver. In New York, she attended a summit of Taiwanese and American business representatives and a dinner banquet with members of the local Taiwanese-American community.

            The layover was a part of her trip to Taiwan’s Caribbean allies, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Haiti.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) is reportedly set to visit the U.S. in August, according to Sankei Shimbun.The Japanese newspaper cited several Taiwanese officials as saying that Tsai, who will finish her final presidential term in May 2024, intends to visit the U.S. to highlight her administration's diplomatic achievements and the close relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan.According to people familiar with the matter, there are three proposals for Tsai’s visit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821430,Eric Chu and KMT collusion with China's CCP,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — There are two questions worth asking about the Kuomintang (KMT) that should inform voters when they vote in the KMT primaries and in the election next November. How much is the KMT colluding with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and how pro-China is KMT Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫)?That the KMT is colluding with the CCP isn’t in question, it’s a question of how much, in what ways and to what purpose. There is no way to definitively answer these questions because we don’t know what is discussed behind closed doors, such as during KMT Deputy Chair Andrew Hsia’s (夏立言) recent trips to China.However, by collecting the pieces we do know from public sources, we can form something of a picture.As previously charted out in-depth, starting in the early 2000s, especially after the 2005 meeting between then-KMT Chair Lien Chan (連戰) and the then CCP-General-Secretary Hu Jintao (胡錦濤), the KMT openly drew close to the CCP. The high water mark of this period was the November 2015 meeting between then-President and KMT party Chair Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) and Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) in Singapore.At the time of the summit, the KMT chair and presidential candidate was Eric Chu, the same chair as now. Chu’s stance was the same as Ma at the time, saying: “President Ma's economic and political strategy for engaging China has been reasonable and very effective.""This openness by the KMT to cooperating with the CCP lasted even after Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won in a landslide election in 2016, on a pro-Taiwan and China-cautious platform. The KMT elected deep blue Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) party chair and ran similarly deep blue Daniel Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) as their presidential candidate in the 2020 election.This closeness to the CCP lasted until March 2020 when Johnny Chiang (江啟臣) was elected party chair. The light blue Chiang was openly pro-US and wanted to get rid of the deeply unpopular “1992 consensus,"" of which the KMT version runs “there is one China, each side with its own interpretation” (the CCP version is only “there is one China” with no two sides about it).Chiang was the first KMT chair in a long time to receive no congratulatory message from the CCP chair. During Chiang’s term, he said there was only “low level” communication with the CCP, and he didn’t come across as being very pleased with even that.What Chiang may have been referring to is personal communications by some deep blue members of the party, like Hung Hsiu-chu and the President of the KMT’s Sun Yat-sen School, Chang Ya-chung (張亞中). The latter, incidentally, has declared recently he will be seeking the KMT nomination to run for president.Now that Eric Chu is party chair again, where do he and the party stand on the CCP? He’s been giving different messages that keep changing over time, and is also different depending on the audience he’s addressing.I have laid out before how KMT members are on a spectrum when it comes to China and Taiwan sovereignty issues, and that there are four broad categories of KMT member. Two are important: Light blues who are more pro-US, strong on defense and want to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait indefinitely; and the deep blue pro-unificationists, who want Taiwan to be annexed into the People’s Republic of China (PRC).Like many light blues, Johnny Chiang held views that were approaching the mainstream of public opinion. Deep blues can be broadly split into two camps, those who want annexation to happen soon, and those who want it to happen slowly over the longer term.Hung Hsiu-chu and Chang Ya-chung are in the annexation soon category. Ma Ying-jeou, who laid some of the groundwork for eventual unification during his presidency, is probably in the gradual unification camp.So where does Chu fit in? In 2015-2016, during his first tenure as KMT chair and during his presidential campaign he sounded very much like a slightly toned-down Ma Ying-jeou, but in essence his stance was the same as Ma. Chu came out and told Xi Jinping he supported eventual “reunification.”Chu also flew to Beijing to meet with Xi in 2015, and said his trip, “Includes efforts that seek to promote regional economic integration such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and ‘one belt, one road.'” Both of those organizations are attempts by China to reduce the influence of the current U.S.-led rules-based system and create a parallel one that China can dominate and would have increased Taiwan’s reliance on the PRC.Then during his campaign for KMT chair in 2021 Chu took a very different stance, strongly pro-U.S., strongly in favor of preserving Republic of China (ROC) sovereignty and in favor of boosting the military to stand up to China. He sounded like he was trying to outdo Johnny Chiang.It didn’t last. Unlike Chiang, and in spite of his tough talk during the chair race, Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Chu, and Chu replied to him with a message that can only be described as toadying with lines like these:“In recent years, however, the DPP administration has changed the status quo across the Strait by adopting ‘desinification’ and ‘anti-China’ policies. That created a tough situation across the Strait and an extreme sense of insecurity among the people across the Strait”That language mimics the CCP’s own. Notice that Chu puts all the blame on the “DPP administration.” This ignores that it is a government democratically elected by the people to handle the status quo the way it has been.There is no acknowledgement that it has been China changing the status quo, and the message praises cooperation with the CCP. It also stated: “People on both sides of the strait are the descendants of Yan and Huang” (Chinese people) and praised the ""1992 consensus"" (see detail here).Then, abruptly, he changed tack again during a trip to the U.S. in June 2022. He claimed the KMT has “always” been pro-U.S., has never been pro-China, has fought communism for over 100 years, and called the ""1992 consensus"" a “non-consensus consensus,” and held those positions for a few months during that summer.Then in August, just after the live-fire war games held around Taiwan following the Nancy Pelosi visit, and just after China released their combative “reunification” white paper, Chu dispatched Andrew Hsia and a delegation to China. The timing drew considerable condemnation even from within the KMT.Clearly not pleased with Chu’s comments over the summer, it wasn’t a very welcoming trip for Hsia, but he did meet with the then-Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) head Liu Jieyi (劉結一). Though they would probably deny it, they clearly talked about Chu’s comments and CCP-KMT cooperation.The reason we know this is that late in Hsia’s trip, Eric Chu abruptly changed tack again and suddenly dumped his summer slogan of “pro-U.S., oppose CCP, keep distance from China” to “pro-U.S., friendly with Japan, peace with the mainland,"" hyped the ""1992 consensus"" and reiterated the KMT is anti-Taiwan independence. The same announcement also touted a new “2D strategy” of “defense” and “dialogue” to “maintain regional peace.""Just as the spy balloon incident was at its peak and once again making the timing problematic, Andrew Hsia led another delegation to China. This was markedly warmer and the reception from the Chinese side noticeably higher profile.Hsia not only met with the new head of the TAO Song Tao (宋濤), significantly, he also met with Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Huning (王滬寧). Hsia solicitously expressed his gratitute to Xi Jinping and asked after him, and they spoke in glowing terms of the 2005 Lien-Hu “ice-breaking meeting.”The relationship between the two parties is now once again close. And once again, they’re colluding.As a result of the trip China announced it was willing to “facilitate” allowing banned agricultural and fishing products from Taiwan back into the country. It then went a step further saying it supported “sharing development opportunities with farmers and fishers of the Taiwan region.”The KMT says, of course, that this was because they care so much about the farmers and fishermen in Taiwan, and perhaps they do. But something much bigger is going on. This is all about the KMT winning the next election.By colluding with the CCP, the KMT is undermining Taiwan’s democratically elected government’s foreign policy apparatus in order to undermine the DPP. For the KMT, the message they are sending is that they are capable of maintaining a good relationship across the Taiwan Strait, and it doesn’t hurt that farmers and fishermen previously tended to vote DPP but may reward the KMT next time.This coming election cycle the KMT plans on campaigning on a “war vs. peace” platform. According to a Storm Media report, party insiders told the publication that with all the recent talk of war, they assess that voters will choose the KMT in order to lower tensions with the PRC.That’s naive. Any reduction in tensions will in the end come at Taiwan’s expense, the CCP will only reduce its aggression if it thinks it can get concessions on Taiwan’s sovereignty.Unfortunately, it’s now quite possible the CCP and KMT will be colluding on aggressive military actions taken by the Chinese side, whether explicitly or implicitly. China won’t let up on recent increased military activities, or may even accelerate them, to keep the pressure on the DPP and support the KMT’s narrative.There is another very worrisome element to Hsia’s meeting with Wang Huning. Nikkei reported that an inside CCP source said that Xi “instructed Wang Huning to chart a new ""theoretical"" course for relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait” in order to replace “one country, two systems.” There is no way this will at its core be any friendlier to Taiwan as long as the CCP is set on annexing Taiwan.Worryingly, the KMT may be colluding with them to come up with a new formula that sounds friendlier to Taiwanese, and may be planning how to sell it to voters.",2023/02/25,3641,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821435,"Trade resumes as Pakistan, Afghanistan reopen Torkham border","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The normal trade and movement of people between Pakistan and Afghanistan fully resumed on Saturday after the two sides reopened a key border crossing that was shut nearly a week ago by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, stranding people and thousands of trucks carrying food and essential items.

            The Afghan embassy in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, announced the reopening of the Torkham border on Saturday on Twitter. Pakistani officials and Afghanistan's Taliban-appointed administrator in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province also confirmed that the border crossing is open to passengers and trade.

            The announcement sparked a wave of joy among those who had been waiting for the reopening of the international trade route since Sunday, when Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers closed the crossing. The Taliban had claimed Islamabad was not abiding by an agreement with Kabul to allow sick Afghan patients and their caretakers to cross into Pakistan without travel documents for medical care. 











            Last Monday, Afghan Taliban forces and Pakistani border guards exchanged fire, wounding a Pakistani soldier. Since then, officials from the two sides were in talks to resolve the issue amid demands from people on both sides to immediately reopen the crossing.

            On Wednesday, Pakistan’s defense minister, Khawaja Mohammad Asif, and secret service chief, Lt. Gen. Anjum Nadeem, traveled to Kabul on an unannounced but previously scheduled visit and met senior Taliban officials to discuss the closure and other issues. 

            After the visit, the crossing was briefly reopened by the Afghan Taliban to allow some of the thousands of trucks that had lined up for days at the border — many with vegetables, fruits and other perishable food items — to cross over and ease the backlog. But Pakistan shut the border on Thursday, saying it needed an explanation from the Afghan side about the abrupt closure of the border on Sunday.

            Pakistani and Taliban officials on Friday held talks and finally agreed to reopen the border.

            On Saturday, Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, a director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said “we are happy to confirm that Torkham is fully open for trade and movement of people."" He said jubilant Afghan and Pakistani truck drivers were crossing the key trade route with supplies.

            Although the Torkham border crossing is a vital commercial artery and a trade route to Central Asian countries for Pakistan, the Islamic nation has also accused the Afghan Taliban of providing sanctuary for Pakistani militants whose cross-border attacks have led to a spike in violence in Pakistan.

            Pakistan recently warned that it has the right to target Pakistani Taliban sanctuaries in Afghanistan if the Afghan Taliban administration fails to rein in the militants, increasing the prospect of more cross-border violence. The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, are a separate group but allied with the Afghan Taliban, who seized power more than a year ago as U.S. and NATO troops withdrew from the country after 20 years of war. 

            The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has emboldened the TTP, which in recent months has stepped up attacks in Pakistan, where security forces often raid their hideouts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821436,"MWC mobile tech fair to show off new phones, AI, metaverse","LONDON (AP) — The latest folding-screen smartphones, immersive metaverse experiences, AI-powered chatbot avatars and other eye-catching technology are set to wow visitors at the annual MWC wireless trade fair that kicks off Monday. 

            The four-day show, held in a vast Barcelona conference center, is the world’s biggest and most influential meeting for the mobile tech industry. The range of technology set to go on display illustrates how the show, also known as Mobile World Congress, has evolved from a forum for mobile phone standards into a showcase for new wireless tech. 

            Organizers are expecting as many as 80,000 visitors from as many as 200 countries and territories as the event resumes at full strength after several years of pandemic disruptions. 











            Here's a look at what to expect: 

            METAVERSE

            There was a lot of buzz around the metaverse at last year's MWC and at other recent tech fairs like last month's CES in Las Vegas. Expect even more at this event. 

            A slew of companies are planning to show off their metaverse experiences that will allow users to connect with each other, attend events far away or enter fantastical new online worlds. 

            Software company Amdocs will use virtual and augmented reality to give users a “metatour” of Dubai. Other tech and telecom companies promise metaverse demos to help with physical rehab, virtually try on clothes or learn how to fix aircraft landing gear. 

            The metaverse's popularity exploded after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in late 2021 exalted it as the next big thing for the internet and his company. Lately, though, doubts have started to creep in. 

            “All the business models around the metaverse are a big question mark right now,” said John Strand, a veteran telecom industry consultant. 

            ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

            AI has caught the tech world's attention thanks to the dramatic advances in new tools like ChatGPT that can hold conversations and generate readable text. Expect artificial intelligence to be deployed as an “overused buzzword” at MWC, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at CCS Insight. 

            Companies are promising to show how they're using AI to make home Wi-Fi networks more energy efficient or sniff out fakes. 

            Microsoft's press representatives have hinted that they might have a demonstration of ChatGPT but haven't provided any details. The company added AI chatbot technology to its Bing search engine but scrambled to make fixes after it responded with insults or wrong answers to some users who got early access. 

            Startups will demo their own AI-powered chat technology: D-ID will show off their eerie “digital human” avatars, while Botslovers says its service promises to “free humans from boring tasks.” 

            NOT JUST SMARTPHONES

            MWC hit its stride in the previous decade as the smartphone era boomed, with device makers competing for attention with glitzy product launches. Nowadays, smartphone innovation has hit a plateau and companies are increasingly debuting phones in other ways. 

            Attention at the show is focusing on potential uses for 5G, the next generation of ultrafast wireless technology that promises to unlock a wave of innovation beyond just smartphones, such as automated factories, driverless cars and smart cities.

            “Mobile phones will still be a hot topic at MWC, but they’ve become a mature, iterative and almost boring category,"" Wood said. ""The only excitement will come from the slew of foldable designs and prototypes, but the real size of the market for these premium products remains unclear.”

            Device launches will be dominated by a slew of lesser known Chinese brands such as OnePlus, Xiaomi, ZTE and Honor looking to take market share from the market leaders, Apple and Samsung. 

            CHINESE PRESENCE

            Chinese technology giant Huawei will have a major presence at MWC, despite being blacklisted by the Western governments as part of a broader geopolitical battle between Washington and Beijing over technology and security. 

            Organizers say Huawei will have the biggest presence at the show among some 2,000 exhibitors. That's even after the U.S. pushed allies to get their mobile phone companies to block or restrict Huawei's networking equipment over concerns Beijing could induce the company to carry out cybersnooping or sabotage critical communications infrastructure. 

            Huawei, which has repeatedly denied those allegations, also has been squeezed by Western sanctions aimed at starving it of components like microchips. 

            Analysts say one message that Huawei could be sending with its oversized display is defiance to the West.LONDON (AP) — The latest folding-screen smartphones, immersive metaverse experiences, AI-powered chatbot avatars and other eye-catching technology are set to wow visitors at the annual MWC wireless trade fair that kicks off Monday.The four-day show, held in a vast Barcelona conference center, is the world’s biggest and most influential meeting for the mobile tech industry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821437,Los Angeles area still blanketed by snow in rare heavy storm,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A powerful winter storm that swept down the West Coast with flooding and frigid temperatures shifted its focus to southern California on Saturday, swelling rivers to dangerous levels and dropping snow in even low-lying areas around Los Angeles.

            The National Weather Service said it was one of the strongest storms to ever hit southwest California and even as the volume of wind and rain dropped, it continued to have significant impact including snowfall down to elevations as low as 1,000 feet (305 meters). Hills around suburban Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles, were blanketed in white, and snow also surprised inland suburbs to the east.

            Rare blizzard warnings for the mountains and widespread flood watches were ending late in the day as the storm tapered off in the region. Forecasters said there would be a one-day respite before the next storm arrives on Monday.











            After days of fierce winds, toppled trees and downed wires, more than 120,000 California utility customers remained without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us. And Interstate 5, the West Coast’s major north-south highway, remained closed due to heavy snow and ice in Tejon Pass through the mountains north of Los Angeles.

            Multiday precipitation totals as of Saturday morning included a staggering 81 inches (205 centimeters) of snow at the Mountain High resort in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles and up to 64 inches (160 centimeters) farther east at Snow Valley in the San Bernardino Mountains.

            Rainfall totals as of late Saturday morning were equally stunning, including nearly 15 inches (38.1 centimeters) at Los Angeles County’s Cogswell Dam and nearly 10.5 inches (26.6 cm) in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles.

            “Quite a remarkable storm the last few days with historic amounts of precip and snow down to elevations that rarely see snow,” the LA-area weather office wrote.

            The Los Angeles River and other waterways that normally flow at a trickle or are dry most of the year were raging with runoff Saturday. The Los Angeles Fire Department used a helicopter to rescue four homeless people who were stranded in the river’s major flood control basin. Two were taken to a hospital with hypothermia, said spokesperson Brian Humphrey.

            In the Valencia area of north Los Angeles County, the roiling Santa Clara River carried away three motorhomes early Saturday after carving into an embankment where an RV park is located. No one was hurt, KCAL-TV reported, but one resident described the scene as devastating.

            The storm, fueled by low pressure rotating off the coast, did not depart quietly. Lightning strikes shut down LA County beaches and scattered bursts of snow, showers and thunderstorms persisted.

            Derek Maiden, 57, who lives in a tent in LA's Echo Park neighborhood, collected cans in the rain to take to a recycling center. He said this winter has been wetter than usual. “It’s miserable when you’re outside in the elements,” he said. 

            Meanwhile, people farther east were struggling to deal with the fallout from storms earlier this week.

            More than 350,000 customers were without power in Michigan as of early Saturday afternoon, according to reports from the the two main utilities in the state, DTE and Consumers Energy. Both said they hope to have the lights back on for most of their customers by Sunday night.

            Brian Wheeler, a spokesman for Consumers Energy, said half an inch (1.27 centimeters) of ice weighed down some power lines — equivalent to the weight of a baby grand piano. 

            “People are not just angry but struggling,” said Em Perry, environmental justice director for Michigan United, a group that advocates for economic and racial justice. “People are huddling under blankets for warmth.”

            She said the group will demand that utilities reimburse residents for the cost to purchase generators or replace spoiled groceries.

            In Kalamazoo, Michigan, Allison Rinker was using a borrowed generator to keep her 150-year-old house warm Saturday after two nights in the cold and dark. 

            “We were all surviving, but spirits were low on the second day,” she said. “As soon as the heat came back and we were able to have one or two lights running, it was like a complete flip in attitude.” 

            After driving to a relative’s home to store food, Rinker, 27, compared the destruction of trees to tornado damage.

            “The ice that was falling off the trees as it was melting was hitting our windshield so hard, I was afraid it was going to crack,” she said. “There’s just tree limbs everywhere, half of the trees just falling down. The destruction is insane.”

            Back in California, the Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service forecast heavy snow over the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada through the weekend.

            The low-pressure system was also expected to bring widespread rain and snow in southern Nevada by Saturday afternoon and across northwest Arizona Saturday night and Sunday morning, the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas said.

            An avalanche warning was issued for the Sierra Nevada backcountry around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the California-Nevada border. Nearly 2 feet (61 cm) of new snow had fallen by Friday and up to another 5 feet (1.5 meters) was expected when another storm moves in with the potential for gale-force winds and high-intensity flurries Sunday, the weather service said.

            In Arizona, the heaviest snow was expected late Saturday through midday Sunday, with up to a foot of new snow possible in Flagstaff, forecasters said.

            Weekend snow also was forecast for parts of the upper Midwest to the Northeast, with pockets of freezing rain over some areas of the central Appalachians. The storm was expected to reach the central high Plains by Sunday evening.

            At least three people have died in the coast-to-coast storms. A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming into contact with a downed power line, while in Rochester, Minnesota, a pedestrian died after being hit by a city-operated snowplow. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, said a person died of hypothermia.

            Much of Portland was shut down with icy roads after the city’s second-heaviest snowfall on record this week: nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters). While the city saw sunny skies and temperatures approaching 40 degrees Saturday afternoon, the reprieve — and thaw — was short-lived. More snow was expected overnight and Sunday.

In response, Taiwan sent aircraft and naval ships and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.So far this month, Beijing has sent 297 military aircraft and 103 naval ships around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821472,China extradites 2 suspected gangsters to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Two men suspected of involvement in shooting incidents in Tainan City ahead of last year’s elections were extradited from China Saturday (Feb. 25).Early on Nov. 10, a man on a scooter fired 58 bullets at the offices of a technology company in the Tainan City district of Xuejia, before heading for the campaign headquarters of a local Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politician and firing 30 more bullets into the building’s metal gate. The number of bullets and casings found earned the incident the description of the “88 shooting” in Taiwan’s media.Nobody was injured, but the timing just two weeks before nationwide local elections drew public attention and drove up fears of more violence in the run-up to the polls. In the days following the shooting, police arrested five men, but two of the main suspects were thought to have left the country.Hung Cheng-chun (洪政軍), also known by his nickname “Red Turtle,” was considered to be one of the brains behind the shootings, while Kung Hsiang-chih (孔祥志) was suspected of having fired the gun. Both were arrested in the Chinese city of Quanzhou and returned to Taiwan on a flight from Xiamen to Taoyuan International Airport Saturday afternoon, the Liberty Times reported.The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) sent agents to China to pick them up. As soon as they arrived in Taiwan, the two men put on bullet-proof vests, and were taken away by members of the Tainan District Prosecutors Office accompanied by four CIB agents. Two vans transported the suspects to Tainan for questioning.According to CIB data, China has returned 56 Taiwanese suspects over the past six years, while Taiwan extradited five suspects to China, per the Liberty Times.",2023/02/25,3699,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821483,"Fiji Drua, Blues and Hurricanes win in Super Rugby Pacific","AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — The Fiji Drua had the last say in a match which saw 11 tries to edge Moana Pasifika 36-34 Saturday on the opening weekend of the Super Rugby Pacific season.

            The Drua trailed 19-5 in the first half and didn’t lead in the match until the 77th minute when replacement winger Taniela Rakuro scored the try that gave them a narrow and thrilling win.

            Both teams were physical but also willing to play the game at pace and run the ball at every opportunity. Moana Pasifika managed a slim advantage in the forward contest but the match was eventually decided by hard-running outside backs who traded tries in the second half.











            The first try of the match came after only two minute to Abraham Pole for Moana Pasifika who wheeled around a lineout and crashed over from close range.

            When Chris Apoua scored after a strong surge by Timoci Tavatavanawai, Moana Pasifika had a 12-0 lead after only nine minutes.

            The Drua’s first try came in the 20th minute to Tevita Ikanivere who burrowed over from close range after strong preliminary work by Jone Koroiduadua, making the score 12-5.

            Ikanivere’s second try in the 45th minute brought the Drua back into the game at 26-24 and Pole also had a double when his 51st-minute try stretched the lead to 31-24.

            Later, the highly-rated Auckland-based Blues produced a statement performance to start their 2023 campaign with a record 60-20 win at the home of the Dunedin-based Highlanders.

            The powerful running of winger Mark Telea was a high point in a fast-paced match. But head coach Leon MacDonald, who recently was linked to the Scotland national team, will be concerned with the Blues’ discipline: They played the last 10 minutes of the first half and the first 10 minutes of the second half with 14 men after yellow cards and conceded too many penalties, especially near their line.

            The Blues lost last year's Super Rugby final to the Crusaders 21-7.

            “I don’t want to bring up last year but we’re probably playing with a bit of fire in the belly from the disappointment last year,” Blues captain Dalton Papali’i said.

            The Blues started strongly with tries to Telea, Beauden Barrett, Caleb Clark and Rieko Ioane to lead 31-6 after 28 minutes. The Highlanders had a small resurgence before halftime and cut the lead to 31-20 at the break.

            A try to Marcel Renata kick-started the Blues second-half scoring and with second tries to Ioane and Telea and another to Papali’i they walked away with the match.

            At Townsville, north Queensland state, the Wellington, New Zealand-based Hurricanes outclassed the Queensland Reds 47-13. The Hurricanes led 16-13 at halftime and powered away with four second-half tries while keeping the Reds scoreless.

            Tom Lynagh, son of former Wallaby flyhalf Michael Lynagh, kicked a conversion and two penalties in two attempts in his Super Rugby debut. Michael Lynagh flew out from his home in England to watch his 19-year-old son, who also plays at No. 10.

            On Friday to open the 15-round season, the ACT Brumbies beat the New South Wales Waratahs 31-25 and the Hamilton, New Zealand-based Chiefs rallied from 10-0 down after 20 minutes to defeat the defending champion Crusaders 31-10 in Christchurch.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821484,Africa's largest film festival offers hope in Burkina Faso,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — Most film festivals can be counted on to provide entertainment, laced with some introspection.

            The weeklong FESPACO that opens Saturday in violence-torn Burkina Faso's capital goes beyond that to also offer hope, and a symbol of endurance: In years of political strife and Islamic extremist attacks, which killed thousands and displaced nearly 2 million in the West African country, it's never been canceled.

            “We only have FESPACO left to prevent us from thinking about what’s going on,” said Maimouna Ndiaye, a Burkinabe actress who has four submissions in this year’s competition. “This is the event that must not be canceled no matter the situation.”











            Since the last edition of the biennial festival in Ouagadougou, the country's troubles have increased. Successive governments' failures to stop the extremist violence triggered two military coups last year, with each junta leader promising security — but delivering few results.

            At least 70 soldiers were killed in two attacks earlier this month in Burkina Faso's Sahel region. The fighting also has sowed discord among a once-peaceful population, pitting communities and ethnicities against each other.

            Nevertheless, more than 15,000 people, including cinema celebrities from Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast are expected in Ouagadougou for FESPACO, Africa's biggest film festival that was launched in 1969. 

            Some 1,300 films were submitted for consideration and 100 have been selected to compete from 35 African countries and the diaspora, including movies from Dominican Republic and Haiti. Nearly half of those in the fiction competition this year are directed by women.

            Among them is Burkinabe director and producer Apolline Traore, whose film “Sira” — considered a front-runner in this year’s competition — is emblematic of many Burkinabes' suffering. It tells the tale of a woman’s struggle for survival after being kidnapped by jihadis in the Sahel, as her fiancé tries to find her.

            Still, Traore is upbeat about her country's prospects.

            “The world has painted Burkina Faso as a red country. It's dangerous to come to my country, as they say,"" she told The Associated Press. ""We’re probably a little crumbled but we’re not down.”

            Government officials say they have ramped up security and will ensure the safety of festival attendees.

            Many hope FESPACO will help boost domestic unity and strengthen ties with other countries, at a time when anti-French sentiment is on the rise in Burkina Faso.

            Wolfram Vetter, the European Union ambassador in Burkina Faso, called the film festival “an important contribution to peace and reconciliation in Burkina Faso and beyond.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821485,"After delays, Nigerians keep watch for key vote's outcome","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Some frustrated Nigerians cast their ballots with flashlights while others stood watch at their polling stations as counting got under way late Saturday amid fears of vote tampering after a day of delays in Africa's most populous nation.

            Election officials blamed the delays on logistical issues, though other observers pointed to the upheaval created by a redesigned currency that has left many unable to obtain bank notes. The cash shortage affected transport not only for voters but also election workers and police officers providing security.

            Voting ended well beyond schedule in many places after delays but some were still voting in a few areas where the exercise stretched into the night. In the northwest Bauchi state, Lagos-based Channels TV reported that voters were still voting using their torchlights at around 9 p.m.











            And in Abuja and Delta state, voters stuck around to monitor the process and ensure the results were not tampered with.

            “Nightfall has come — anything can happen (now),” Torke Ezekiel said after casting his ballot.

            While there were fears of violence on Election Day, from Islamic militants in the north to separatists in the south voting was largely peaceful Saturday though a dramatic scene unfolded in the megacity of Lagos in the mid-afternoon.

            Associated Press journalists saw armed men pull up to the voting station in a minibus, fire shots in the air and snatch the presidential ballot box. The shots sent voters screaming and scattering for cover, and ballots strewn across the floor.

            And in the northeast state of Borno, at least five people including children, were wounded when Boko Haram extremists attacked voters in Gwoza town, local authorities said. 

            Mahmood Yakubu, head of Nigeria’s election commission, said national collation of results in the presidential election would commence at noon on Sunday. In 2019, the winner of the presidential election was announced four days after the voting day.

            “We are making very steady progress and we will continue to ensure that nothing truncates our democracy or truncates the will of the Nigerian people,” said Yakubu, the election chief.

            However, Mucahid Durmaz, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence company, said voting “has been very complicated for Nigerians.”

            There have been “widespread complaints about late-arriving officials, nonfunctioning machines, low presence of security and attacks on polling stations,"" he added.

            Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two four-year terms in Nigeria, a West African country where unemployment has soared to 33% even as one of the continent's top oil producers.

            Out of the field of 18 presidential candidates, three front-runners emerged in recent weeks: the candidate from Buhari's ruling party, the main opposition party candidate and a third-party challenger who has drawn strong support from younger voters.

            But it remained unclear how many voters were deterred because of the cash crisis, which has left Nigerians with funds in their bank accounts unable to obtain the cash they need for things like gas and taxis.

            “Voters said the new naira policy made it very difficult for people to transport themselves to their polling units and they were also hungry. So they felt rather than going out to burn energy, they should just stay back home,” said Anthony Adejuwon who monitored the election in Osun state.

            The vote is being carefully watched as Nigeria is Africa's largest economy. By 2050, the U.N. estimates that Nigeria will tie with the United States as the third most populous nation in the world after India and China.

            It is also home to one of the largest youth populations in the world with a median age of only 18. About 64 million of its 210 million people are between the ages of 18 and 35.

            Favour Ben, 29, who owns a food business in the capital, Abuja, said she was backing third-party candidate Peter Obi.

            “Obi knows what Nigerians need,” she said. “He knows what is actually disturbing us and I believe he knows how to tackle it.”

            Buhari's tenure was marked by concerns about his ailing health and frequent trips abroad for medical treatment. Two of the top candidates are in their 70s and both have been in Nigerian politics since 1999.

            By contrast, at 61, Obi of the Labour party is the youngest of the front-runners and had surged in the polls in the weeks leading up to Saturday's vote.

            Still, Bola Tinubu has the strong support of the ruling All Progressives Congress party as an important backer of the incumbent president. And Atiku Abubakar has the name recognition of being one of Nigeria's richest businessmen, having also served as a vice president and presidential hopeful in 2019 for his Peoples Democratic Party.

            For the first time this year Nigeria's election results will be transmitted electronically to headquarters in Abuja, a step officials say will reduce voter fraud. Officials also say they'll be enforcing a ban on mobile phones inside voting booths to prevent vote-buying: images of the votes are usually sent as proof if people have received money to pick a certain candidate.

            Since officials in November announced the decision to redesign Nigeria's currency, the naira, new bills have been slow to circulate. At the same time, older bank notes stopped being accepted, creating a shortage in a country where many use cash for daily transactions.

            Durmaz says the currency change should have been laid out in a longer timeline before or after the election. Lengthy waits to vote “will likely disenfranchise voters, deepen the electoral disputes and trigger violence.”

            “Delays along with reports of voter suppression in Lagos risk aggravating the disappointment among passionate voters in a highly-anticipated election and cause an explosion of violent protests in urban centers,” he warned. “Any outbreak of violence could rapidly embrace ethnic and religious undertones, given the considerable impact of ethnic and religious differences on elections in Nigeria.”

In 2019, the winner of the presidential election was announced four days after the voting day.“We are making very steady progress and we will continue to ensure that nothing truncates our democracy or truncates the will of the Nigerian people,” said Yakubu, the election chief.However, Mucahid Durmaz, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence company, said voting “has been very complicated for Nigerians.”There have been “widespread complaints about late-arriving officials, nonfunctioning machines, low presence of security and attacks on polling stations,"" he added.Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two four-year terms in Nigeria, a West African country where unemployment has soared to 33% even as one of the continent's top oil producers.Out of the field of 18 presidential candidates, three front-runners emerged in recent weeks: the candidate from Buhari's ruling party, the main opposition party candidate and a third-party challenger who has drawn strong support from younger voters.But it remained unclear how many voters were deterred because of the cash crisis, which has left Nigerians with funds in their bank accounts unable to obtain the cash they need for things like gas and taxis.“Voters said the new naira policy made it very difficult for people to transport themselves to their polling units and they were also hungry. So they felt rather than going out to burn energy, they should just stay back home,” said Anthony Adejuwon who monitored the election in Osun state.The vote is being carefully watched as Nigeria is Africa's largest economy. By 2050, the U.N. estimates that Nigeria will tie with the United States as the third most populous nation in the world after India and China.It is also home to one of the largest youth populations in the world with a median age of only 18. About 64 million of its 210 million people are between the ages of 18 and 35.Favour Ben, 29, who owns a food business in the capital, Abuja, said she was backing third-party candidate Peter Obi.“Obi knows what Nigerians need,” she said. “He knows what is actually disturbing us and I believe he knows how to tackle it.”Buhari's tenure was marked by concerns about his ailing health and frequent trips abroad for medical treatment. Two of the top candidates are in their 70s and both have been in Nigerian politics since 1999.By contrast, at 61, Obi of the Labour party is the youngest of the front-runners and had surged in the polls in the weeks leading up to Saturday's vote.Still, Bola Tinubu has the strong support of the ruling All Progressives Congress party as an important backer of the incumbent president. And Atiku Abubakar has the name recognition of being one of Nigeria's richest businessmen, having also served as a vice president and presidential hopeful in 2019 for his Peoples Democratic Party.For the first time this year Nigeria's election results will be transmitted electronically to headquarters in Abuja, a step officials say will reduce voter fraud. Officials also say they'll be enforcing a ban on mobile phones inside voting booths to prevent vote-buying: images of the votes are usually sent as proof if people have received money to pick a certain candidate.Since officials in November announced the decision to redesign Nigeria's currency, the naira, new bills have been slow to circulate. At the same time, older bank notes stopped being accepted, creating a shortage in a country where many use cash for daily transactions.Durmaz says the currency change should have been laid out in a longer timeline before or after the election. Lengthy waits to vote “will likely disenfranchise voters, deepen the electoral disputes and trigger violence.”“Delays along with reports of voter suppression in Lagos risk aggravating the disappointment among passionate voters in a highly-anticipated election and cause an explosion of violent protests in urban centers,” he warned. “Any outbreak of violence could rapidly embrace ethnic and religious undertones, given the considerable impact of ethnic and religious differences on elections in Nigeria.”___Associated Press journalists Grace Ekpu in Lagos, Nigeria; Yesica Fisch in Yola, Nigeria; Haruna Umar in Maiduguri, Nigeria; Dan Ikpoyi in Agulu, Nigeria; Hilary Uguru in Asaba, Nigeria; Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal, and Sam Mednick in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso contributed to this report.",2023/02/26,,World

The event, titled “One Year of Hope,” was organized by “Taiwan Stands With Ukraine” (TSWU).Ukrainians told reporters they hoped that after more than one year of brutal war, their country could achieve complete victory, and that Taiwan would be spared a similar invasion amid tension with China.TSWU said that in addition to organizing several events in support of Ukraine over the past year, it had also collected $1.5 million (NT$46 million) in donations, and promoted contacts between Taiwanese supporters and people in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821542,Germany's Scholz arrives in India to 'deepen' ties,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in India for a two-day visit on Saturday with the Ukraine war expected to dominate the discussions.Scholz was met by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the capital New Delhi, where he received military honors.""India and Germany have very good relations and want to deepen them. That will be the topic of our talks and, importantly, peace in the world,"" he told reported.The chancellor is expected to seek India's support for the tough stance taken by Europe and the US towards Russia over the war in Ukraine.India has an officially neutral position in the conflict. Modi has refrained from any overt criticism of Russia as Moscow is a major arms supplier.Russia also provides New Delhi with oil. Since the war began last February, India has increased its oil imports at a major discount due to European and US embargos.At the UN General Assembly on Thursday, India abstained from voting on a resolution that passed demanding Russia withdraw from Ukraine.Critics have accused India of undermining the West's sanctions on Moscow, while Indian officials have denounced what they say is the hypocrisy of Western countries, given their long history of military interventions around the world.During Saturday's news conference with Scholz, Modi said India was ""ready to contribute to any peace efforts,"" adding that New Delhi had been calling for a resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy since the war began.Scholz is also keen to expand economic and strategic cooperation with India in order to reduce Germany's dependence on China and also to free New Delhi from its close ties with Moscow.Over the past 15 years, Europe's largest economy benefited from the rise of China and cheap Russian energy, but concerns over Beijing flexing its muscle militarily and the war in Ukraine have spurred the need to decouple from both countries.Germany, alongside South Korea, is reported to be in the running to supply India with six new submarines — a deal thought to be worth $5.2 billion (€4.9 billion).Scholz is also expected to press for progress toward an India-EU free trade deal and an investment protection agreement.A German official in Berlin said the two sides remain ""quite some distance apart"" on the trade deal.But speaking in Delhi, Scholz said he and Modi were committed to making it happen, adding: ""It's an important topic and I'll get personally involved.""In May of last year, Germany and India signed a series of bilateral agreements focused on sustainable development under which India will receive $10.5 billion in aid by 2030 to boost the use of clean
energy.The trip is Scholz's first official visit to India, though it is his fourth meeting with Modi since taking office in 2021.On Sunday, Modi will take Scholz to India's information technology hub Bengaluru.Scholz is traveling with a delegation of business leaders, although no executives from major carmakers are on the trip.

She now resides in Vilnius while he remains in prison with more than 1,000 other political prisoners by the count of rights groups and the US embassy in Minsk.Recent reports had suggested that Russia is planning to absorb Belarus by 2030.Xi and Lukashenko last met in Uzbekistan in September 2022, where they announced an ""all-weather"" strategic partnership.tg/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/25,,

Unfortunately, it turned out to be the latter.Eleven days after Turkey was struck by twin earthquakes on February 6, Ceylanguden received a phone call from the public prosecutor’s office. They had identified Yilmaz’s body by his fingerprints.His body was found buried underneath the rubble of the building where he had lived in Turkey’s southeastern Hatay province.Ceylanguden had kept a vigil in front of the destroyed apartment block until the debris was totally removed. But many of the bodies pulled out during the recovery process were unrecognizable, he said. He had almost given up hope of discovering Yilmaz’s fate.""They also sent us photos of his body and a watch and a lighter,"" he told DW. ""The items belonged to my brother-in-law. We could not look at the photos of his dead body.""The earthquake victim is currently buried in a mass grave in Hatay's Narlica district along with thousands of unidentified people. ""In the next days, we will move him to our family cemetery,"" Ahmet Ceylanguden said, bursting into tears.Yilmaz’s wife Gulcan was rescued alive from the collapsed building where nearly 60 people died. In hospital, doctors later amputated both her arms and one of her legs because they were gangrenous.According to figures released by the Turkish Interior Ministry on Thursday, the current death toll stands at 43,556, with tens of thousands homeless or displaced. But a report by the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation calculated that the number of people killed in the quakes is likely to exceed 72,000.For now, many are still missing, and the exact number is uncertain. Turkish authorities told DW they were unable to provide an estimation of how many earthquake victims were unaccounted for.Turkey's Hatay province is eerily quiet. As of February 20, just over 21,000 people in the province had lost their lives with nearly 2,000 of them unidentified, the Hatay Public Prosecutor's Office told DW.More buildings collapsed in Hatay than in any of the 11 provinces hit by the earthquake, according to an assessment by Turkey's Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change ministry.Most of the destroyed buildings and resulting rubble in Hatay have now been combed through by officials. Now people here, as elsewhere in Turkey, are searching for their missing loved ones in hospitals or mass graves.After recording the victims' fingerprints and taking their DNA samples, unidentified bodies are being buried within 24 hours, according to the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).Tugba Akyuz is one of those still looking. She hopes to find her 24-year-old brother, Mustafa Batuhan Gulec, who was living alone in an apartment building in Hatay’s Iskenderun district.Akyuz managed to arrive at the scene just 20 minutes after the earthquake hit.""We saw the collapsed building,” she told DW. ""My brother lived on the fifth floor. His car was there. A phone signal was received from the apartment. Security surveillance cameras didn’t show any footage after the quake.""Akyuz said her family assumed Gulec was trapped under the rubble. But when the debris was completely removed eight days after the earthquake, he wasn’t found, dead or alive.Her father has given authorities DNA samples for identification, Akyuz said. In the meantime, the family continues to post on social media and call authorities and hospitals every day.""A pediatrician from Iskenderun State Hospital called me,"" Akyuz recounted. ""She said she saw someone looking similar to my brother who asked for water, but she wasn’t 100% sure if the guy was him or not.""She and her family still haven’t given up hope.Edited by: Kate Hairsine",2023/02/25,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821556,"More than 70 soldiers killed in Burkina Faso, extremists say","OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 70 soldiers, wounding dozens and taking five hostage, in an ambush on a military convoy in northern Burkina Faso. 

            The statement, posted Friday by Amaq, the group’s news agency, said it attacked a convoy trying to advance to areas under its control near Deou, in the Sahel's Oudalan province. It said it seized weapons and chased retreating soldiers for miles into the desert. 

            Images released by the group show 54 slain bodies in military uniform lying in the bloodstained dirt, as well as more than 50 seized assault rifles and images of the five soldiers it said were taken prisoner.











            The announcement comes one week after the attack in Deou and days after another attack in Tin-Akoff town, where locals and civil society groups say dozens more soldiers and civilians were killed when a military outpost was hit. 

            It's unclear how many people have been killed in the two incidents. Last week the government confirmed that 51 soldiers died in the Deou ambush but it has not responded to requests for updated numbers or commented on the attack in Tin-Akoff.

            Violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has wracked the country for seven years killing thousands and displacing nearly 2 million people. Frustration at the government's inability to stem the violence led to two coups last year, each one preceded by a major attack on the military.

            This is the deadliest ambush on soldiers since the new junta leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, seized power in September and analysts say it could threaten his grip on power. 

            “There’s a persistent stream of militant attacks north of the country and the public is undoubtedly taking notice of their government's inability to provide security. Any further attacks this colossal could threaten a public scene and even threaten to unseat the junta,” said Laith Alkhouri, CEO of Intelonyx Intelligence Advisory, which provides intelligence analysis. 

            One soldier involved in the ambush in Deou, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said their convoy was outnumbered as more than 300 jihadis encircled them, firing rockets and mortars. “We lost many men”, he said. 

            The large number of jihadis and the different colored headscarves they were wearing appeared like a coalition of many extremist franchises that he hadn't seen before, he said.

            The Islamic State and an al-Qaida linked group, known by its acronym JNIM, are not known to work together, but rather have been fighting each other for territory and influence in the country as well as in neighboring Mali where they operate. Analysts say it's extremely unlikely they would have joined forces.

            Some locals say the increase of jihadi violence against the military is revenge for torture and extrajudicial killings by soldiers against people presumed to be jihadis. 

            Hamadou Boureima Diallo, a local journalist in the Sahel's Dori town, told The Associated Press by phone that he spoke with locals who witnessed the latest attack in Tin-Akoff and were able to flee and that they blamed the killings on revenge. 

            “These recent bloody attacks against soldiers is because when the soldiers arrest terrorists or presumed terrorists they torture them and make photos or videos that circulate on social media,"" said Diallo, recounting what the locals said. 

            He added that they said: “We have seen some of the videos where presumed terrorists are being tortured. ... This is not good.”OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 70 soldiers, wounding dozens and taking five hostage, in an ambush on a military convoy in northern Burkina Faso.The statement, posted Friday by Amaq, the group’s news agency, said it attacked a convoy trying to advance to areas under its control near Deou, in the Sahel's Oudalan province. It said it seized weapons and chased retreating soldiers for miles into the desert.Images released by the group show 54 slain bodies in military uniform lying in the bloodstained dirt, as well as more than 50 seized assault rifles and images of the five soldiers it said were taken prisoner.The announcement comes one week after the attack in Deou and days after another attack in Tin-Akoff town, where locals and civil society groups say dozens more soldiers and civilians were killed when a military outpost was hit.It's unclear how many people have been killed in the two incidents. Last week the government confirmed that 51 soldiers died in the Deou ambush but it has not responded to requests for updated numbers or commented on the attack in Tin-Akoff.Violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has wracked the country for seven years killing thousands and displacing nearly 2 million people. Frustration at the government's inability to stem the violence led to two coups last year, each one preceded by a major attack on the military.This is the deadliest ambush on soldiers since the new junta leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, seized power in September and analysts say it could threaten his grip on power.“There’s a persistent stream of militant attacks north of the country and the public is undoubtedly taking notice of their government's inability to provide security. Any further attacks this colossal could threaten a public scene and even threaten to unseat the junta,” said Laith Alkhouri, CEO of Intelonyx Intelligence Advisory, which provides intelligence analysis.One soldier involved in the ambush in Deou, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said their convoy was outnumbered as more than 300 jihadis encircled them, firing rockets and mortars. “We lost many men”, he said.The large number of jihadis and the different colored headscarves they were wearing appeared like a coalition of many extremist franchises that he hadn't seen before, he said.The Islamic State and an al-Qaida linked group, known by its acronym JNIM, are not known to work together, but rather have been fighting each other for territory and influence in the country as well as in neighboring Mali where they operate. Analysts say it's extremely unlikely they would have joined forces.Some locals say the increase of jihadi violence against the military is revenge for torture and extrajudicial killings by soldiers against people presumed to be jihadis.Hamadou Boureima Diallo, a local journalist in the Sahel's Dori town, told The Associated Press by phone that he spoke with locals who witnessed the latest attack in Tin-Akoff and were able to flee and that they blamed the killings on revenge.“These recent bloody attacks against soldiers is because when the soldiers arrest terrorists or presumed terrorists they torture them and make photos or videos that circulate on social media,"" said Diallo, recounting what the locals said.He added that they said: “We have seen some of the videos where presumed terrorists are being tortured. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821558,Slovak movie director Juraj Jakubisko dies at 84,"PRAGUE (AP) — Slovak filmmaker Juraj Jakubisko, who was named the best movie director of the 20th century in his country, has died. He was 84.

            Jakubisko died shortly before midnight on Friday in the Czech capital, Prague, where he had lived with his family since the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia, his daughter Janette told Slovak public radio and television. His death was also announced by the Czech Culture Ministry.

            Jakubisko has dozens of feature films and shorts to his credit that won a number of awards at international film festivals.











            For his movies, full of metaphors, symbols and poetry, he was sometimes called “Fellini of the East,” or “Slovak Fellini” after famed Italian director Federico Fellini.

            Born April 30, 1938 in the village of Kojsov in what is now eastern Slovakia, Jakubisko graduated from Prague’s Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in 1966. 

            He debuted with the critically acclaimed “Crucial Years” the following year. With that, as well as “Deserters and Pilgrims” (1968) and ""Birds, Orphans and Fools"" (1969), he cemented his place as part of the Czechoslovak New Wave in cinema together with a number of other young directors of the time, including Milos Forman and Vera Chytilova.

            All those films were banned by the hard-line communist regime that was established following the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed a period of liberal reforms known as the Prague Spring.

            For the next decade, he was allowed to make only documentary films. He returned to feature movies with “Build a House, Plant a Tree” in 1979 — which was soon also banned.

            His major success was “The Millennial Bee,” in 1983, an epic family saga in the late 19th and early 20th century that won awards at film festivals in Seville, Spain, and Venice, Italy.

            In 1985, Fellini’s wife, Giulietta Masina, starred in Jakubisko's fairy tale for children “The Feather Fairy.”

            His biggest box-office success after the 1989 collapse communism was “Bathory” in 2008, a historical drama starring English actress Anna Friel as Elizabeth Bathory, a Hungarian countess who according to legend used to kill virgins in order to bathe in their blood.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821559,Thousands join Berlin rally calling for Ukraine peace talks,"BERLIN (AP) — Thousands of people protested in Berlin on Saturday to condemn Germany's supply of arms to Ukraine and call for peace talks to end the war.

            The organizers were criticized before the protest for downplaying Ukraine’s right to defend its territory from Russian aggression and failing to distance themselves from political extremists on the far right and far left, where pro-Russia views are common.

            One of the organizers, opposition lawmaker Sahra Wagenknecht of the ex-communist Left party, said during the rally that there was no place for neo-Nazis, but that anyone who wanted peace “with an honest heart” was welcome.











            While most placards at the protest reflected traditional left-wing positions, some participants bore banners with the slogan “Americans go home” and the logo of a far-right magazine. Some waved Russian flags.

            Wagenknecht accused the German government of seeking to “ruin Russia,"" and said that Moscow should be made an “offer” in order to resume peace talks.

            Another of the organizers, prominent feminist author Alice Schwarzer, said it was time to look beyond left and right. Protesters jeered whenever she and Wagenknecht mentioned the name of German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who has strongly backed the delivery of arms to Ukraine.

            Police said that about 13,000 people took part in the rally at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, while organizers claimed that 50,000 people participated.

            One of them was Konstantin Schneider, an academic from Berlin, who said he understood that countries in Eastern Europe were afraid of Russia.

            “Of course (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an idiot to attack Ukraine,"" he said. “But we still need to find new solutions (to the war) instead of sweepingly saying there's nothing to negotiate.”

            There were several small counterdemonstrations. On Friday, about 10,000 people staged a protest at the same site in support of Ukraine.

            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a recent television interview that he doesn't see a prospect for peace talks at present.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821565,"Biden unveils new Ukraine weapons package, Russia sanctions","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration declared its Ukraine solidarity with fresh action as well as strong words on Friday, piling sweeping new sanctions on Moscow and approving a new $2 billion weapons package to re-arm Kyiv a year after Russia’s invasion.Despite the U.S. and allies’ continued ambitious efforts to bolster the Ukrainians, there are no signs of an endgame in the war, which seems destined to enter an even more complicated phase in the months ahead.On the somber anniversary, Biden and fellow leaders from the Group of Seven allies that have been at the forefront of backing Ukraine stayed focused on a unified front.“Our solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law,"" the G-7 leaders said in a joint statement after a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.As Ukraine mourned its war dead and vowed it would ultimately emerge victorious, the Pentagon unveiled its latest weapons package. It includes more ammunition, electronic warfare detection equipment and other weapons to counter Russia’s unmanned systems, and several types of drones, including the upgraded Switchblade 600 Kamikaze attack drone.The latest aid package uses the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to provide funding for longer-term contracts to buy weapons and equipment. Unlike the presidential drawdown authority that the Pentagon has used repeatedly over the past year to pull weapons from its own stocks and quickly ship them to Ukraine, the USAI-funded equipment could take a year or two to get to the battlefront. As a result, it will do little to help Ukraine prepare for an expected new offensive in the spring.“Difficult times may lie ahead, but let us remain clear-eyed about what is at stake in Ukraine,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, “to ensure that a world of rules and rights is not replaced by one of tyranny and turmoil.”Biden said in an ABC News interview on Friday that he's not ready to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and allies for jets, but White House officials have pushed back that they are not the weaponry that Ukrainians need in the near term.“There is no basis on which there is a rationale, according to our military now to provide F-16s,” Biden said. “I am ruling it out for now.”Meanwhile, the White House said that new sanctions hitting over 200 people and entities will “further degrade Russia’s economy and diminish its ability to wage war against Ukraine.” The Biden administration will also further restrict exports to Russia and raise tariffs on some Russian products imported to the U.S.""Now, not only does Ukraine stand, but the global coalition in support of Ukraine is stronger than ever, with the G7 as its anchor,"" Biden said on Twitter following Friday's virtual meeting with Zelenskyy.Still, as the conflict enters a second year, there are no indications that President Vladimir Putin will retreat from the conflict. And the avalanche of international sanctions that have been steadily hoisted on Moscow over the past year have yet to deliver the sort of knockout blow to the Russian economy that the White House — and independent economists — predicted at the outset of the war.The Russian economy has weathered sanctions better than expected in 2022, in part due to “the slow introduction of commodities sanctions,"" according to a Moody’s Investors Service report on Friday.The Russian economy is expected to weaken in 2023, with GDP shrinking by 3% this year, according to the Moody's projection. The economy shrank 2.2% in 2022, far short of predictions of 15% or more that Biden administration officials had showcased at the start of the war. Export controls and financial sanctions are gradually eroding Russia’s industrial capacity, but oil and other energy exports last year enabled Putin to keep funding the war.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby acknowledged that Russia's economy was “showing some resilience” but he also said it's not clear that it “can be sustained for the long haul.”Of Putin, he said, “He has had to take some drastic measures to prop up his economy, to prop up his currency, including playing pretty aggressively with interest rates for instance.""The new sanctions introduced by U.S. Treasury on Friday hit Russian firms, banks, manufacturers and individuals, taking aim at entities that helped Russia evade earlier rounds. Russia’s metals and mining sector are among those targeted in what Treasury called one of the “most significant sanctions actions to date.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, attending meetings in India on Friday with fellow financial chiefs of the Group of 20 leading economies, called out Russian officials in attendance and insisted the world's biggest economies must do more to support Ukraine.“I urge the Russian officials here at the G-20 to understand that their continued work for the Kremlin makes them complicit in Putin’s atrocities,” Yellen said. “They bear responsibility for the lives and livelihoods being taken in Ukraine and the harm caused globally.”The U.S. State and Commerce departments as well as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative also issued plans Friday to increase pressure on Russia. These steps impose visa restrictions on 1,219 members of the Russian military, increase tariffs on Russian products such as metal, worth roughly $2.8 billion, and add nearly 90 Russian and third-country companies, including from China, to a list of identified sanctions evaders.More than 30 countries representing more than half the world’s economy have already imposed sanctions on Russia, making it the most sanctioned nation in the world.The sanctions have imposed price caps on Russian oil and diesel, frozen Russian Central Bank funds and restricted access to SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.The U.S. and allies have directly sanctioned roughly 2,500 Russian firms, government officials, oligarchs and their families. The sanctions are depriving them of access to their American bank accounts and financial markets, preventing them from doing business with Americans, traveling to the U.S. and more.By Friday afternoon, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, an international standard-setting body on illicit finance, suspended Russia from its membership. The removal occurred for the first time in the body's 34-year history.Britain also announced new sanctions Friday on firms that supply Russia’s battlefield equipment and says it will bar export to Russia of all items it has used in the war, such as aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components of weapons.“We don’t think the job is by any means done,"" Britain’s Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said.___Associated Press reporters Tara Copp and Aamer Madhani in Washington, Sibi Arasu in Bengaluru and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.___Follow the AP's coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",2023/02/25,137,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821567,Experts say bird flu threat small despite Cambodian fatality,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A top World Health Organization official, reacting to the death of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia infected by bird flu, said Friday the recent global spread of the virus and human infections are “worrying.”Dr. Sylvie Briand, the WHO’s director for epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said the U.N. agency is “in close communication with the Cambodian authorities to understand more about the outbreak.”Speaking ahead of a meeting in Geneva on influenza vaccines, Briand called the global situation concerning the virus ""worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world, and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including humans.”“WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries,” she said.Independent experts also have expressed concern over a wave of bird flu that has spread through much of the world since late 2021, posing a potential public health risk.The Cambodian girl, from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Wednesday at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu, according to Cambodia’s Health Ministry. She had fallen ill on Feb. 16, and when her condition declined she was sent to the hospital with a fever as high as 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) with coughing and throat pain.The girl's father tested positive for the virus but has not displayed any major symptoms, health authorities said Friday.Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads between sick poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals, including at a large mink farm in Spain, has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.Health Ministry spokesperson Ly Sovann told The Associated Press that the Cambodian father’s case is under investigation, and it was not yet known how he became infected. He has been put in isolation at a local district hospital for monitoring and treatment.A ministry team collected samples from 12 people from the dead girl's village known to have had direct contact with her, and laboratory tests confirmed Friday that only her father was infected.Health professionals have expressed concern about a wave of bird flu that has spread worldwide in the past year and a half, but consider the current risk to humans to be low.“There has been a massive global challenge of wild and domestic birds with the current H5N1 avian influenza virus over the last few months and years, which will have exposed many humans; despite this, what is remarkable is how few people have been infected,"" professor James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at England's University of Cambridge, said in an emailed statement.""Tragic though this case in Cambodia is, we expect there to be some cases of clinical disease with such a widespread infection. Clearly the virus needs careful monitoring and surveillance to check that it has not mutated or recombined, but the limited numbers of cases of human disease have not increased markedly and this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed,” Wood added.According to the World Health Organization, there were 56 bird flu cases in humans in Cambodia from 2003 until 2014, and 37 of them were fatal. Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries, for an overall case fatality rate of 53%. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.“Between 2005 and 2020, 246 million poultry died or were culled because of avian influenza,” says the World Organization for Animal Health.“Since October 2021, an unprecedented number of outbreaks has been reported in several regions of the world, reaching new geographical areas and causing devastating impacts on animal health and welfare,” the Paris-based agency says on its website.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees that the current H5N1 outbreak is mostly an animal health issue.“However, people should avoid direct and close contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, and wild animals,"" it warns on its website. “People should not consume uncooked or undercooked poultry or poultry products, including raw eggs. Consuming properly cooked poultry, poultry products, and eggs is safe.”___Associated Press writer Peck reported from Bangkok.",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821568,Chicago mayor's race dominated by concerns about crime,"CHICAGO (AP) — For years, Republicans have sought to win over voters by depicting Democratic-led cities as lawless centers of violence that need tough-on-crime policies. In Chicago, some of the Democrats running for mayor are deploying the same strategy as they debate how to make the city safer.One leading candidate, who touts his endorsement from the Chicago police union, says “crime is out of control” and the city needs hundreds more officers patrolling its streets. Another hopeful says that if suspects flee a crime scene, officers should be able to “hunt them down like a rabbit.”Even incumbent Lori Lightfoot, the first Black woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago mayor, has used language right out of the GOP playbook, accusing a top rival in her reelection bid of wanting to defund the police.The shift in rhetoric reflects the degree to which concerns about crime have dominated Tuesday's mayoral election in Chicago and threatened Lightfoot's reelection bid. Far from being an outlier, the nation’s third-largest city is just the latest Democratic stronghold where public safety has become a top election issue.In San Francisco, progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin was ousted in a recall election last year that was fueled by frustration over public safety. In Los Angeles, two Democrats running for mayor debated how to deal with rising crime rates and an out-of-control homelessness crisis. In New York City, voters elected Eric Adams as mayor, elevating a former city police captain who pledged to fix the department and invest more in crime prevention. And in Philadelphia, candidates running for mayor this year are debating how to curb gun violence.The increased attention on public safety follows a spike in crime rates in many communities that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. High-profile incidents of police misconduct drew more scrutiny of policing, and there has been disagreement even among Democrats about so-called progressive public safety policies such as ending cash bail or providing safe injection sites for drug users.Jaime Domínguez, a political science professor at Northwestern University, said it's the first time in 20 years that he's seen public safety be “front and center” in a Chicago mayoral election.The difference, he said, is that crime is no longer largely isolated to some predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods. As more crime is occurring in other parts of the highly segregated city, including in the downtown and other areas frequented by tourists, public safety is also top of mind for white voters.“Historically, it was primarily a pocketed matter. It was still pernicious and candidates spoke to it, but it didn’t really affect areas where you see crime occurring now,” Dominguez said. “That has been blown up. It’s just, it’s everywhere.”Chicago has a higher per-capita homicide rate than New York or Los Angeles, but it’s lower than other Midwestern cities, such as St. Louis and Detroit. Still, the number of homicides in Chicago hit a 25-year high in 2021 with 797, according to the Chicago Police Department.That number decreased last year but is still higher than when Lightfoot took office in 2019. Other crimes, such as carjackings and robberies, have increased in recent years.Nine candidates are running in Tuesday's officially nonpartisan mayoral election. With no candidate expected to get over 50% of the vote, an April 4 runoff between the top two vote-getters is likely.Randall Fearnow, a 67-year-old health care attorney who is white and who lives near Wrigley Field on the city's north side, experienced the city's crime problem firsthand when he and his wife walked in the back door of their home one day last October and discovered burglars inside. The criminals ransacked the home and stole thousands of dollars' worth of jewelry and money before running out the front door, he said. Police didn't catch the perpetrators.“It happened in the broad daylight,"" Fearnow said. “When you step out, it makes you feel a little uneasy. … You’re not immune anywhere from crime in the city.”Fearnow cast an early ballot for Paul Vallas, who was endorsed by the Chicago police union. He also voted against Lightfoot four years ago, saying he believed her rival in the 2019 runoff was “much more level-headed.” This year, Fearnow said the two most important factors in his vote were crime and rising property taxes.“The city gets more expensive to live in and less safe,” he said. “So somebody needs to do something.”As she fights to land a spot in the April runoff, Lightfoot has taken on opponents she sees as a threat — among them Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson. In a recent ad, Lightfoot accuses Johnson of wanting to defund police, using video of him speaking on a local radio program in 2020. She said Johnson, who avoids the word “defund” when speaking on the campaign trail about policing, isn't being candid with voters.“He’s asked direct questions at a variety of forums, and that guy’s got more bobs and weaves than Muhammad Ali,"" Lightfoot said.Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer endorsed by the Chicago Teachers Union, says he wants to invest more in areas such as mental health treatment. In a statement responding to Lightfoot, his campaign said that doesn't mean cuts to the police department. Johnson also notes that Chicago still has a violence problem even though the police budget grows every year.""Lori Lightfoot hasn’t made Chicago safer, but I will,” Johnson says in a new ad. “It’s time to get smart, not just tough.”All of Lightfoot’s opponents want to fire the police superintendent she hired, saying that the former Dallas police chief has been ineffective and that hiring an outsider hurt morale. Lightfoot has defended the superintendent, David Brown, and says that while the city faced never-before-seen challenges such as the pandemic, their strategies are working and some crimes are falling.Vallas, an adviser to the Fraternal Order of Police during the union's contract negotiations with Lightfoot's administration, says that if he becomes mayor, he would promote a new leadership team from within the department. Vallas says he would welcome back hundreds of officers who have retired or gone elsewhere out of frustration with Lightfoot. He also wants to return to a community policing strategy, with dedicated officers assigned to patrol each of the city's nearly 300 police beats.“We’ve got to restore public safety,” said Vallas. “Everything proceeds from that.”Wealthy businessman Willie Wilson, another mayoral candidate, has doubled down on his comment that suspects in violent crimes should be hunted down like rabbits. Wilson says he lost a son to gun violence, and he believes police officers are being prevented from doing their jobs.The other candidates are Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, Chicago City Council members Sophia King and Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja’Mal Green and state Rep. Kambium “Kam” Buckner.___Associated Press writer Claire Savage contributed to this report.",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821569,"Japan, other G-7 leaders step up Russia sanctions","TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other Group of Seven leaders adopted a set of additional sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine at an online G-7 summit Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the invasion.The leaders renewed their commitment to “intensifying our diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort,” and countering the negative impact on the rest of the world, especially the most vulnerable people, they said in a statement, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.The G-7 countries also affirmed their coordinated action to “further counter Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression"" and pledged to prevent Russia from obtaining military equipment and technology. They also called on other countries to stop providing military support to Russia.Kishida, as this year’s G-7 president, also announced Japan will impose additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing the assets of some 120 individuals and organizations and banning the export of drones and other materials that can be used for military purposes.“In order to absolutely not allow one-sided changes to the status quo, we must firmly carry out support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia to regain peace and international order based on the rule of law,"" Kishida told a news conference before hosting a teleconference with other G-7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“G-7 serves the core of the international commitment to do so,"" he said.At the summit, Kishida planned to discuss the latest developments in the Russian war on Ukraine and how to support Ukraine's recovery and affirm G-7 solidarity for the war-torn country.Kishida noted growing concern about China's potential transfer of lethal weapons to Russia, and said that Japan will cooperate with G-7 and other countries to send a “clear message” to third countries to stop supplying weapons to Russia.Kishida also expressed “strong concern” about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement Tuesday that he was suspending Moscow's participation in an arms control treaty between Russia and the United States.“Russia's nuclear threat is unacceptable, and use of nuclear weapons should never happen,” Kishida, whose electoral constituency is Hiroshima, said at the news conference. “As the world's only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, the 77-year history of non-nuclear weapons use should not be tarnished by Russia.”As the world observed the one-year anniversary of Russia's war on Ukraine, about 1,000 people protested Friday night in Tokyo's Hibiya Park, holding banners saying: “Russia, stop invading Ukraine."" Outside of the United Nations' University in Tokyo, demonstrators held a candlelight vigil. And at Zenkoji temple in Nagano in central Japan, about 30 monks prayed for the lives lost in the war.Top diplomats from Ukraine, the United States, Britain, Sweden, the EU, Lithuania and Sweden at a joint news conference in Tokyo called for solidarity for Ukraine and condemned Russia. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said Putin is wrong to accuse NATO of expanding eastward. He said the newest NATO members expanded west by their free will because the West has “a pull” of freedom, liberty and respect for individuals.Also Friday, nuclear and security experts on a panel at the non-profit Sasakawa Peace Foundation released recommendations for the Kishida government to initiate discussions at the G-7 Hiroshima summit toward establishing a framework to protect nuclear facilities in conflict areas, in response to Russia's repeated attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine.Due to its pacifist principles, Japan's support for Ukraine has been limited to non-combative military equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests and drones, and humanitarian supplies including generators.Kishida is the only G-7 leader who has not visited Ukraine. Pressure is mounting at home for Kishida to visit Kyiv before he hosts the G-7 summit in Hiroshima. Asked about a possible visit, Kishida said he is “considering” a visit, taking into consideration ways to ensure safety and secrecy, but nothing official has been decided.Japan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine. Japan was quick to react because it fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.Kishida at the online G-7 also explained Japan’s support for Ukraine. That includes a new $5.5 billion in financial aid, which Kishida unveiled Monday, bringing total Japanese support for Ukraine to more than $7 billion.Japan has also accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance and support for jobs and education — a rare move for a country that is known for its strict immigration policy.",2023/02/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821573,Mexican states in hot competition over possible Tesla plant,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico is undergoing a fevered competition among states to win a potential Tesla facility in jostling reminiscent of what happens among U.S. cities and states vying to win investments from tech companies.Mexican governors have gone to loopy extremes, like putting up billboards, creating special car lanes or creating mock-ups of Tesla ads for their states.And there’s no guarantee Tesla will build a full-fledged factory. Nothing is announced, and the frenzy is based mainly on Mexican officials saying Tesla boss Elon Musk will have an upcoming phone call with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.The northern industrial state of Nuevo Leon seemed to have an early edge in the race.It painted the Tesla logo on a lane at the little-used Columbia border crossing into Texas last summer, and erecting billboards in December in the state capital, Monterrey, that read “Welcome Tesla.”The state governor’s influencer wife, Mariana Rodriguez, was even shown in leaked photos at a get-together with Musk.However, López Obrador appeared to exclude the semi-desert state from consideration Monday, arguing he wouldn’t allow the typically high water use of factories to risk prompting shortages there.That set off a competitive scramble among other Mexican states, like feeding time at a piranha tank. The governors’ offers ranged from crafty proposals to near-comic ones.“Veracruz is the only state with an excess of gas,” quipped Gov. Cuitláhuac Garcia of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, before quickly adding “gas … for industrial use, for industrial use!”A late-comer to the race, Garcia had to try harder: He noted Veracruz was home to Mexico’s only nuclear power plant. And he claimed Veracruz had 30% of Mexico’s water, though the National Water Commission puts the state’s share at around 11%. Water, it turns out, is thicker than blood.The governor of the western state of Michoacan wasn’t going to be left out. Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla quickly posted a mocked-up ad for a Tesla car standing next to a huge, car-sized avocado — Michoacan’s most recognizable product — with the slogan “Michoacan — The Best Choice for Tesla.”“We have enough water,” Ramírez Bedolla said in a television interview he did between a round of meetings with auto industry figures and international business representatives.Michoacan also has an intractable problem of drug cartel violence. But similar violence in neighboring Guanajuato state hasn’t stopped seven major international automakers from setting up plants in Guanajuato.Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garcia had to think fast to avoid being shut out entirely, and came up with a novel strategy.Garcia reached out to the western state of Jalisco, whose governor, Enrique Alfaro, belongs to the same small Citizen’s Movement party. Together, the two came up with an “alliance” Thursday that would allow trucks from Jalisco preferential use of Nuevo Leon’s border crossing, the same one where a “Tesla” lane appeared last year.Jalisco has an already healthy foreign tech sector, but most importantly, it has more water than Nuevo Leon.The two appeared intent on playing nice. “We are two states that do not have to compete and cannibalize each other … cannibalization for investment is a mistake,” Alfaro said.López Obrador’s focus on water might be more about politics than about droughts, said Gabriela Siller, chief economist at Nuevo Leon-based Banco Base. She said the president appeared to be trying to steer Tesla investment to a state governed by his own Morena party, like Michoacan or Veracruz.That could be a dangerous game, Siller said.“Tesla could say it’s not somebody’s toy to be moved around anywhere, and it could decide not to come to Mexico,” she said.Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at U.S.-based Guidehouse Insights, said playing one state off against another has been common practice in the U.S.“You remember a few years back, Amazon talked about building their headquarters, like every state, city in the country was putting in bids, trying to lure Amazon there,” Abuelsamid said.There are doubts that whatever Musk eventually does announce will be an auto assembly plant. Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his understanding is that it won’t be a plant, but rather an “ecosystem” of suppliers.Musk previously has made promises that don’t come true, or happen years after he says they will. For instance, in 2019 he promised a fleet of fully autonomous robotaxis on the roads sometime in 2020. Nearly three years later, Tesla has yet to sell any autonomous vehicles.While there has been little talk in Mexico so far of subsidies, many auto companies have gotten significant incentives to build plants in Mexico. That kind of race can be costly.“It’s questionable whether it’s actually that economically beneficial to localities or providing those subsidies,” said Abuelsamid. “They’re sometimes spending billions of dollars in tax breaks to lure a company in there.”Musk at times has floated the idea of building a $25,000 electric vehicle that would cost about $20,000 less than the current Model 3, now Tesla’s least-expensive car. Many automakers build lower-cost models in Mexico to save on labor costs and protect profit margins.A Tesla investment could be part of “near shoring” by U.S. companies that once manufactured in China but now are leery of logistical and political problems there. That those companies will now turn to Mexico represents the Latin American country’s biggest foreign investment hope.“The fight among states to attract investments from this nearshoring phenomenon is going to be tough, complicated,” Alfaro said.As Ramírez Bedolla put it, “wherever Tesla sets up, it is going to be big news in Mexico.”",2023/02/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821574,"California faces more blizzards, floods in multistate storm","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A powerful winter storm lashing California threatened floods, blizzards and avalanches Saturday while adding frigid temperatures to the misery mix.Overnight lows could drop below freezing in some areas while downtown San Francisco could see record-breaking cold temperatures Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Projected temperatures of 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) would see the city at its coldest since 2009, the weather service said.Flash flood warnings were issued from Friday through 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. Saturday in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, a region with some 6 million people. The weather service said flash flooding was occurring late Friday in Ventura County, where up to 7 inches (18 centimeters) inches of rain had fallen and up to 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) were possible before the storm turned showery on Saturday afternoon.In Los Angeles County, forecasters said life-threatening flash flooding was possible near creeks, streams, urban areas, highways and areas that were burned by wildfires. The threat zone included downtown L.A., Hollywood, Beverly Hills and many suburbs.“Shallow landslides and mudslides are expected,” the weather service said.Despite the heavy downpour, no serious problems were immediately reported.Rain falling at up to an inch an hour raised the fear of flooding or mudslides. Evacuation warnings were issued in some burn-scarred areas and for a mile-long stretch of Oceano, which lies on the central coast near a levee that overflowed during storms last month. Residents were urged to be ready to flee at short notice.Meanwhile, people farther east were struggling to deal with the fallout from storms earlier this week.More than a half-million people in Michigan were still without power late Friday night, days after one of the worst ice storms in decades caused widespread power outages by knocking down some 3,000 ice-coated power lines.Promises of power restoration by Sunday, when low temperatures were expected to climb back above zero (minus 18 Celsius), were of little consolation.“That’s four days without power in such weather,” said Apurva Gokhale, of Walled Lake, Michigan. “It’s unthinkable.”Back in California, the Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service predicted heavy snow over the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada into the weekend.California’s wine country wasn’t spared from the rare brew of wind and snow. Mark Neal told KPIX-TV that he woke up Friday morning to see a foot (30.4 centimeters) of snow — more than he’d seen in more than 40 years — and dozens of his oak trees snapped in half.“It’s pretty much a battleground if you look at it. Some of them are over 200 years old,” he said. Luckily, the vines were safely dormant.The low-pressure system pushing the atmospheric river off the Pacific Ocean into central and Southern California on Friday was driving inland and is expected to bring widespread rain and snow into southern Nevada by Saturday afternoon and then across northwest Arizona Saturday night and Sunday morning, the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas said.An avalanche warning was issued for the Sierra Nevada backcountry around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the California-Nevada border. Nearly 2 feet (61 cm) of new snow had fallen by Friday and up to another 5 feet (1.5 meters) was expected when another storm moves in with the potential for gale-force winds and high-intensity flurries Sunday, the weather service said.In Arizona, the heaviest snow was expected late Saturday through midday Sunday, with up to a foot of new snow possible in Flagstaff, forecasters said.Weekend snow also was forecast for parts of the upper Midwest to the Northeast, with pockets of freezing rain over some areas of the central Appalachians. The storm was expected to reach the central high Plains by Sunday evening.Yet the cold weather blasting the North and West has avoided the southern states, leading to wild temperatures differences. The high temperature for the U.S. on Friday was 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34 degrees Celsius) at Falcon Lake, Texas, while the low was minus-35 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) near Huntley, Montana.The wintry blasts have led to hundreds of cancelled flights at airports around the country and shut down miles of major highways in several states.In California, some motorists were trapped overnight on snowy, icy State Route 17, a major road in the San Francisco Bay Area mountains, before it reopened Friday morning.Interstate 5, the West Coast’s major north-south highway, was closed south of the Oregon border as snow fell to the floor of the Sacramento Valley. The Grapevine, a high mountain pass north of Los Angeles, was closed for more than 12 hours. After reopening Friday evening, traffic crept through under police escort and there was a chance of more closures as forecasters predicted strong winds leading to blizzard conditions in mountain ranges and passes.Much of a long stretch of Interstate 80 remained closed most of Friday over the top of the Sierra Nevada mountain range between Sacramento, California, and Reno, Nevada.Harsh weather prompted Los Angeles County to keep its emergency shelters open into March as wind chill was expected to drop weekend temperatures below freezing in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. The county's large homeless population was at special risk.At least three people have died in the coast-to-coast storms. A Michigan firefighter died Wednesday after coming in contact with a downed power line, while in Rochester, Minnesota, a pedestrian died after being hit by a city-operated snowplow. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, said a person died of hyperthermia.Much of Portland was shut down with icy roads not expected to thaw until Saturday after the city’s second-heaviest snowfall on record this week: nearly 11 inches (28 centimeters).Tim Varner sat huddled with blankets in a Portland storefront doorway shielding him from some of the wind, ice and snow. Local officials opened six overnight shelters but the 57-year-old, who has been homeless for two decades, said it was too hard to push a shopping cart containing his belongings to reach one.“It’s impossible,” he said. “The snow gets built up on the wheels of your cart and then you find slippery spots and can’t get no traction. So you’re stuck.”___Taxin reported from Orange County, California, and White reported from Detroit.

            Ram Chandra Poudel of the opposition Nepali Congress party is supported by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, but he is not a coalition partner. 

            The move angered the biggest party in the ruling coalition, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), which retaliated by nominating its own member to contest the presidential election scheduled for March 9.











            Dahal was in danger of losing another coalition partner, after the National Democratic Party announced on Saturday it would withdraw from the government because of Dahal's support for Poudel. 

            The two parties are yet to officially announce their withdrawal of support for Dahal in Parliament. If they do, Dahal will have to seek a vote of confidence in the House of Representative, the lower house of Parliament. 

            Poudel told reporters that he will try to win support of all the parties and work for political unity.

            Parliamentary elections were held in November but no party won a majority, leading to the formation of a coalition government headed by Dahal. 

            It was his third time in power since his Maoist group abandoned a decade-long armed revolt in which more than 17,000 people were killed and joined a U.N.-assisted peace process and mainstream politics in 2006.

            The Maoists secured most parliamentary seats in 2008 elections and Dahal, also known as Prachanda, or the “fierce one,” became prime minister but quit a year later over differences with the president.KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A member of Nepal’s largest political party filed his candidacy for next month's presidential election in a decision backed by the prime minister that now threatens to bring down his fragile coalition government.Ram Chandra Poudel of the opposition Nepali Congress party is supported by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, but he is not a coalition partner.The move angered the biggest party in the ruling coalition, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), which retaliated by nominating its own member to contest the presidential election scheduled for March 9.Dahal was in danger of losing another coalition partner, after the National Democratic Party announced on Saturday it would withdraw from the government because of Dahal's support for Poudel.The two parties are yet to officially announce their withdrawal of support for Dahal in Parliament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821600,"EU slaps sanctions on top Russia officials, banks, trade","BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Saturday to impose new sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine targeting more officials and organizations accused of supporting the war, spreading propaganda or supplying drones, as well as restricting trade on products that could be used by the armed forces.

            The EU’s Swedish presidency said the sanctions ""are directed at military and political decision-makers, companies supporting or working within the Russian military industry, and commanders in the Wagner Group. Transactions with some of Russia’s largest banks are also prohibited.”

            Asset freezes were slapped on three more Russian banks and seven Iranian “entities” — companies, agencies, political parties or other organizations — that manufacture military drones, which the EU suspects have been used by Russia during the war.











            The new measures, proposed by the EU’s executive branch three weeks ago, were only adopted after much internal wrangling over their exact make-up, and made public one day after the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — the intended target date.

            The delay, which was minor but symbolically important, is yet more evidence of how difficult it has become for the 27-nation bloc to identify new targets for restrictive measures that are acceptable to all member nations.

            The sanctions are meant to undermine Russia’s economy and drain funds for its war effort, but they are also increasingly inflicting pain on European economies already hit by high inflation and energy prices and still suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Before this latest round of measures, the EU had already targeted almost 1,400 Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, government ministers, lawmakers and oligarchs believed loyal to the Kremlin, but also officers believed responsible for war crimes or targeting civilian infrastructure.

            The bloc had also frozen the assets of more than 170 organizations, ranging from political parties and paramilitary groups to banks, private companies and media outlets accused of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda.

            Russia’s energy sector was hit, too — notably oil and coal — and the bloc, through its own measures and political decisions combined with retaliation from Moscow, was rapidly weaned off its dependence on Russian natural gas.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new package in his nightly address on Saturday. 

            “Sanctions will continue to be introduced so that nothing remains of the potential of Russian aggression,” he said. 

            “There are new sanctions steps in the 10th package, powerful ones, against the defense industry and the financial sector of the terrorist state and against the propagandists who drowned Russian society in lies and are trying to spread their lies onto the whole world,” Zelenskyy said.BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Saturday to impose new sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine targeting more officials and organizations accused of supporting the war, spreading propaganda or supplying drones, as well as restricting trade on products that could be used by the armed forces.The EU’s Swedish presidency said the sanctions ""are directed at military and political decision-makers, companies supporting or working within the Russian military industry, and commanders in the Wagner Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821604,Pope doubles down on need for financial trials in Vatican,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis said Saturday that financial misconduct by Vatican personnel harms the church’s mission and scandalizes the faithful, doubling down on the need for trials in the tiny city state to find justice.

            Francis made the comments during an address to prosecutors, judges and employees of the Vatican City State’s civil and criminal tribunal at the start of the judicial year. The tribunal has seen its caseload grow significantly in recent years as the Vatican enforces new financial standards and accountability, most recently with an ongoing trial into the Holy See’s investment in a London property.

            Defense lawyers for some of the 10 defendants have flagged shortcomings in the Vatican’s unique legal system over the course of the trial, arguing that the rights of the defense haven’t been respected. Francis didn’t refer to the London case specifically, but he warned against focusing on the nitty-gritty of the Vatican's legal system given the “seriousness of the conduct at issue.”











            “Here we must be clear and avoid the risk of ‘confusing the finger with the moon,’” Francis said, using an analogy to insist that the focus must remain on the big picture of the alleged crimes.

            “The problem is not the trials, but the facts and conduct that determine them and make them painfully necessary. In fact, such behavior, on the part of members of the Church, seriously harms its effectiveness in reflecting the divine light.”

            The London trial, which opened in July 2021 and is expected to conclude before the end of the year, concerns the Vatican’s 350 million-euro investment in a luxury property as well as spinoff investigations. Prosecutors have accused 10 people of fleecing the Holy See of tens of millions of euros; the defense has denied wrongdoing.

            The Vatican’s chief prosecutor, Alessandro Diddi, acknowledged intensified public interest and scrutiny of the tribunal, but insisted his office would not be swayed by public opinion or media pressure. He pointed to the growing number of instances of judicial cooperation with other countries’ legal systems as evidence of respect for the Vatican legal system.

            “The growing attention that public opinion reserves for our activities and the judgment that many, every day, express on our work, make us aware of the great responsibility entrusted to us and the need to fulfil our duties scrupulously and accurately, but, above all, with great respect for the values underlying the guarantees of due process,” he said. 

            Francis’ own role in the London transactions has come up in the trial, as has his modification of the legal code during the course of the investigation. In recent hearings, Judge Giuseppe Pignatone has tended to cut off lawyers or witnesses who refer to the pope.ROME (AP) — Pope Francis said Saturday that financial misconduct by Vatican personnel harms the church’s mission and scandalizes the faithful, doubling down on the need for trials in the tiny city state to find justice.Francis made the comments during an address to prosecutors, judges and employees of the Vatican City State’s civil and criminal tribunal at the start of the judicial year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821605,"Red Bull's Perez leads final day of F1 testing, Hamilton 2nd","SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP) — Red Bull driver Sergio Perez moved up the leaderboard as the sun went down to lead the third and final day of Formula One testing on Saturday.

            It underlined how strong Red Bull looks heading into next weekend's season-opening race on the same Sakhir desert circuit in Bahrain. Defending world champion Max Verstappen led the first test day.

            “A very successful end to the test with another day of uninterrupted running,"" Red Bull head of race engineering Gianpiero Lambiase said. ""Checo (Perez) was able to complete a variety of test items, including a chance to get a feel for the car under conditions closer to qualifying and the race.""











            Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton was .36 seconds behind Perez in second but the twitchy W14 again experienced problems with balance and traction.

            “We’re not quite where we want to be but it’s a good platform to start from,” Hamilton said. “We don’t know where we will be next week, but we will stay positive.”

            Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas was .52 behind Perez in third ahead of Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc — who led after the morning session — and Carlos Sainz Jr. The Ferraris were around .7 seconds off Perez's pace but showed good reliability.

            “We finished the test without any issues and completed the full run plan,” Leclerc said. 

            Perez drove all day and completed 133 laps. Bottas racked 131. Only Alex Albon did more than them with 136 laps for Williams, while the seven-time F1 champion Hamilton did 65.

            As temperatures cooled under floodlights at the desert track, there was a flurry of time changes.

            Hamilton overtook the Ferraris before Perez zoomed to the top and Bottas made a late charge to push the Ferraris down.

            Leclerc is one of the most dedicated drivers in F1, and he spent the final minutes on the pit wall scrutinizing time charts and other information with headphones on.

            “We will focus on analysing the data, in order to arrive at the first GP of the year as well prepared as possible,"" said Leclerc, who has won five career races. “I’m looking forward to racing here next week.”

            AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda was in sixth spot ahead of Haas driver Kevin Magnussen. Mercedes' George Russell, who drove in the morning, was eighth.

            With Lance Stroll still sidelined because of a wrist injury in a bicycle accident, Aston Martin again used F2 champion Felipe Drugovich. He was 10th behind teammate Fernando Alonso.

            It is uncertain whether Stroll will recover in time to race next weekend, and Alonso offered no indication.

            “No news,"" the two-time F1 champion said. ""It's a private matter.”

            There was a brief red flag minutes into the morning start after some debris was cleared off the track, seemingly from Perez's RB19. 

            A second red flag came out when Bottas parked up in a run-off area. His teammate Zhou Guanyu topped day two of testing, showing Alfa Romeo's encouraging pace and reliability.

            Testing offers a rough guide to a team’s speed, with the cars often set up in very different ways or sometimes holding some speed back.

            But McLaren CEO Zak Brown said on Friday he felt his team was behind its projected targets.

            Brown will hardly have been reassured when Australian driver Oscar Piastri had a big spin on the track, although he recovered quickly. Lando Norris took over in the afternoon but placed only 11th, with Piastri in 16th.

            ""There’s definitely still a fair bit of learning to do,” said Piastri, who was cleared to drive for McLaren after a contract dispute with Alpine last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821606,Women's World Cup downhill canceled after fog delays,"CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — A downhill race in the women’s World Cup was canceled Saturday after initially being delayed for two hours because of fog over the course.

            The downhill is now set for Sunday, taking the place of a super-G which was scheduled, race organizers said.

            The cancellation was due to the “dangerous situation on the slope and for safety reasons,” the International Ski and Snowboard Federation said.











            The decision provoked whistles and jeers in the finish area from some spectators among a sold-out crowd of about 10,000.

            After several delays from the scheduled 11 a.m. start, the race was due to begin at 1 p.m. on the mostly sun-bathed Mont Lachaux course. A forerunner testing the course then crashed on his run.

            Spring-like soft snow conditions were reported by racers in the official training run Friday when World Cup downhill leader Sofia Goggia crashed into course-side safety fences.

            The south-facing slope at Crans-Montana warms quickly in the sunshine and a race with 49 expected starters Saturday could have continued close to 3 p.m.

            World Cup overall leader Mikaela Shiffrin has skipped races at the Swiss Alps resort to take a break after the world championships.

            Shiffrin has a massive 731-point lead and is on track to win a fifth giant crystal globe as the season-long champion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821618,Justice Thomas wrote of 'crushing weight' of student loans,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court won't have far to look if it wants a personal take on the “crushing weight” of student debt that underlies the Biden administration’s college loan forgiveness plan.

            
                Justice Clarence Thomas was in his mid-40s and in his third year on the nation's highest court when he paid off the last of his debt from his time at Yale Law School.

            Thomas, the court's longest-serving justice and staunchest conservative, has been skeptical of other Biden administration initiatives. And when the Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday involving President Joe Biden's debt relief plan that would wipe away up to $20,000 in outstanding student loans, Thomas is not likely to be a vote in the administration's favor.











            But the justices' own experiences can be relevant in how they approach a case, and alone among them, Thomas has written about the role student loans played in his financial struggles.

            A fellow law school student even suggested Thomas declare bankruptcy after graduating “to get out from under the crushing weight of all my student loans,"" the justice wrote in his best-selling 2007 memoir, “My Grandfather’s Son."" He rejected the idea.

            It’s not clear that any of the other justices borrowed money to attend college or law school or have done so for their children’s educations. Some justices grew up in relative wealth. Others reported they had scholarships to pay their way to some of the country's most expensive private institutions.

            Of the seven justices on the court who are parents, four have signaled through their investments that they don't want their own children to be saddled with onerous college debt, and have piled money into tax-free college savings accounts that might limit any need for loans.

            Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch have the most on hand, at least $600,000 and at least $300,000, respectively, according to annual disclosure reports the justices filed in 2022. Each has two children. 

            Justices Amy Coney Barrett, who has seven children, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has two, also have invested money in college-savings accounts, in which any earnings or growth is tax free if spent on education.

            None of the justices would comment for this story, a court spokeswoman said.

            Thomas wrote vividly about his past money woes in his up-from-poverty story, recounting how a bank once foreclosed on one of his loans because repayment and delinquency notices were sent to his grandparents’ house in Savannah, Georgia, instead of Thomas’ home at the time in Jefferson City, Missouri.

            Thomas was able to take out another loan to repay the bank only because his mentor, John Danforth, then-Missouri attorney general and later a U.S. senator, vouched for him. 

            Thomas noted that he signed up for a tuition postponement program at Yale in which a group of students jointly paid for their outstanding loans according to their financial ability, with those earning the most paying the most.

            At the time, Thomas' first wife, Kathy, was pregnant. “I didn't know what else to do, so I signed on the dotted line, and spent the next two decades paying off the money I borrowed during my last two years at Yale,” Thomas wrote.

            When he was first nominated to be a federal judge in 1989, Thomas reported $10,000 in outstanding student loans, according to a news report at the time. The Biden administration has picked the same number as the amount of debt relief most borrowers would get under its plan.

            Personal experience can shape the justices' questions in the courtroom and affect their private conversations about a case, even if it doesn't figure in the outcome.

            “It is helpful to have people with life experiences that are varied just because it enriches the conversation,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor has said. Sotomayor, like Thomas, also grew up poor. She got a full scholarship to Princeton as an undergraduate, she has said, and went on to Yale for law school, as Thomas did.

            Keeping people from avoiding the kinds of difficult choices Thomas faced is a key part of the administration's argument for loan forgiveness. The administration says that without additional help, many borrowers will fall behind on their payments once a hold in place since the start of the coronavirus pandemic three years ago is lifted, no later than this summer.

            Under a plan announced in August but so far blocked by federal courts, $10,000 in federal loans would be canceled for people making less than $125,000 or for households with less than $250,000 in income. Recipients of Pell Grants, who tend to have fewer financial resources, would get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven.

            The White House says 26 million people already have applied and 16 million have been approved for relief. The program is estimated to cost $400 billion over the next three decades. 

            The legal fight could turn on any of several elements, including whether the Republican-led states and individuals suing over the plan have legal standing to go to court and whether Biden has the authority under federal law for so extensive a loan forgiveness program.

            Nebraska and other states challenging the program argue that far from falling behind, 20 million borrowers would get a ""windfall” because their entire student debt would be erased, Nebraska Attorney General Michael Hilgers wrote in the states' main Supreme Court brief.

            Which of those arguments resonate with the court may become clear on Tuesday. 

            When she was dean of Harvard Law School, Justice Elena Kagan showed her own concern about the high cost of law school, especially for students who were considering lower-paying jobs.

            
                Kagan established a program that would allow students to attend their final year tuition-free if they agreed to a five-year commitment to work in the public sector. While that program no longer exists, Harvard offers grants to students for public service work. 

            At the time the program was created, Kagan said she wanted students to be able to go to work where they “can make the biggest difference, but that isn’t the case now.” Instead, she said: “They often go to work where they don’t want to work because of the debt burden.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821622,Schools reopen as Syrians live with quake's devastation,"IDLIB, Syria (AP) — Schools resumed classes in Syria’s rebel-held northwest Saturday after closing for nearly three weeks following an earthquake that devastated the region, local officials said, even as many schoolchildren suffer from shock.

            Many schools were turned into temporary shelters following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Turkey and neighboring parts of Syria on Feb. 6 and killed tens of thousands of people.

            The quake left homeless hundreds of thousands of people in the area, many of whom had already been displaced by Syria's 12-year-long war. Because of that conflict, the rebel-held area has also struggled to receive urgently needed humanitarian aid.











            Many students were absent from their classes Saturday as their homes were damaged by the quake and their families now reside far away from the schools, said Abdulkafi Al-Hamdou a citizen journalist in the rebel-held region.

            “Some students were worried about being inside the building and were on edge whenever they heard a sound such as a desk being moved,” Al-Hamdou said by telephone while visiting a school. “Many students are suffering from severe fear and anxiety. They are still in shock.”

            An official with the education department in the region, Ziad al-Omar, said 39 teachers and 421 students were killed by the earthquake. He added that some 250 schools suffered damage including 203 that were partially destroyed and 46 that had cracks in the walls though the structures were still standing.

            Over the past days, displaced people were asked to leave schools and many of them moved into shelters to live in tents. But prices of tents have been shooting up amid shortages and sell for about $200 or four times above the pre-earthquake price. A solid tent with metal stands can cost up to $400, in a region where more than 90% of the population live in poverty and rely on aid for food and medicine.

            Education officials in rebel-held Idlib said the last two hours on Saturday and Sunday will be used to train students on how to evacuate buildings during earthquakes.

            One of those who lost a home in the quake is Ayesha, a resident of the town of Atareb in rural Aleppo who had to evacuate her home to live in a tent. She told The Associated Press that the temporary shelter offered to her extended family of 13 people had to be evacuated because organizers said schools are about to resume and the courtyard where tents had been set up had to be vacated.

            “They gave us a tent in a school. Then they said the students have to return and they started evacuating us,” she said, giving only her first name like most women in the conservative area.

            Having a big family, Ayesha rented a small house on the edge of Atareb but four days after they moved there, a new 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck on Monday. “The house, thankfully didn’t collapse, but the walls have cracks,"" she said. ""The ceiling remained in place.”

            Since then, the family has set up a tent in the street out of fear of more aftershocks. 

            According to the opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, the earthquake killed 2,274 people and injured more about 12,400 in the rebel-held region. The quake also destroyed 550 buildings and heavily damaged at least 1,570 others, according to the White Helmets. 

            The total death toll of the earthquake is estimated to surpass 47,000 people in Turkey and Syria — with the vast majority of deaths in Turkey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821623,G-20 meeting in India ends without consensus on Ukraine war,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — A meeting of finance chiefs of the Group of 20 leading economies ended on Saturday without a consensus, with Russia and China objecting to the description of the war in Ukraine in a final document.

            The meeting hosted by India issued the G-20 Chair’s summary and an outcome document stating that there was no agreement on the wording of the war in Ukraine. The first day of the meeting took place on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            The Group of Seven major industrial nations announced new sanctions against Russia on Friday, just as the talks of the G-20 group wrapped up in confusion in the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru. 











            U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen condemned the “illegal and unjustified war against Ukraine” at a session attended by Russian officials and reiterated calls for G-20 nations to do more to support Ukraine and hinder Moscow’s war effort. 

            
                At the last major G-20 meeting, in Bali, Indonesia, in November, leaders had strongly condemned the war, warning that the conflict was intensifying fragilities in the world’s economy. The group includes Russia and also countries like China and India that have significant trade with Moscow.

            India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the communique prepared for the Bengaluru meeting carried two paragraphs from the Bali declaration, but Russia and China demanded they be deleted and said they could not be part of the final document this time.

            Their contention was they had approved the Bali declaration under the then prevailing circumstances, she said. ""Now they didn't want it,"" Sitharaman said. She didn't give any other details.

            
                The Bali declaration said that “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy – constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks.”

            The declaration also said: ""There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions. G-20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.""

            The second paragraph of the declaration, which is now unacceptable to Russia and China, said, ""It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. ... The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today’s era must not be of war.""

            Sitharaman said the meeting could not issue a communique because of the objections raised by Russia and China and decided to opt for a summary and an outcome document.

            The Lyon County Sheriff’s office said authorities began receiving calls about the crash near Stagecoach, Nevada, around 9:15 p.m. and found the wreckage two hours later. Stagecoach, a rural community home to around 2,500 residents, is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Reno.

            Care Flight, which provides ambulance service by plane and helicopter, said the dead included the pilot, a flight nurse, a flight paramedic, a patient and a patient’s family member.











            Barry Duplantis, president and CEO of the company, said Saturday afternoon that relatives of all five victims had been notified, the Reno Gazette Journal reported. “We send our deepest condolences to their families,” Duplantis said.

            The crash occurred amid a winter storm warning issued by the National Weather Service in Reno for large swaths of Nevada, including parts of Lyon County.

            The weather service said it was expecting heavy snow, wind gusts of up to 65 mph (105 kph) and periods of whiteout conditions between 4 a.m. Friday and 4 a.m. Sunday.

            “It’s a pretty mountainous region,” Lyon County Sgt. Nathan Cooper said. “Especially with the weather being the way it is right now, it’s not very good.”

            The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday morning on Twitter that it is sending a seven-member team of investigators to the crash site. The NTSB is expected release more information Sunday at a news conference.

            Care Flight identified the downed aircraft as a Pilatus PC-12 airplane. Federal Aviation Administration records show the aircraft was manufactured in 2002.

            The company said in a statement that it is halting flights to focus on helping responding agencies, team members and the families.STAGECOACH, Nev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821642,Some Democratic-led states seek to bolster voter protections,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers in several Democratic-controlled states are advocating sweeping voter protections this year, reacting to what they view as a broad undermining of voting rights by the Supreme Court and Republican-led states as well as a failed effort in Congress to bolster access to the polls.

            Legislators in Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and New Mexico have introduced voting rights measures, while Michigan’s secretary of state is preparing a plan.

            Among other things, the proposals would require state approval for local governments to change redistricting or voting procedures, ban voter suppression and intimidation, mandate that ballots are printed in more languages, increase protections for voters with disabilities, ensure the right to vote for those with previous felony convictions and instruct judges to prioritize voter access when hearing election-related challenges.











            The measures are taking a much wider approach than legislation targeting a single aspect of voting or elections law. They seek to implement on a statewide basis many of the protections under the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, a law that many Democrats and voting rights groups say is being stripped of its most important elements.

            If the legislation is enacted, the states would join California, New York, Oregon, Washington and Virginia in having comprehensive voting rights laws.

            “It’s up to states now to ensure that the right to vote is protected,” said Janai Nelson, president of the the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

            Maryland's proposal includes a requirement for local voting changes to receive preapproval, mirroring core provisions of the federal law that was struck down by the Supreme Court a decade ago.

            Maryland was not among the states, mostly in the South, that was covered under the provision known as preclearance before the court ended it. But lawmakers there saw it as important because of persistent concerns over how districts for local governing bodies have been drawn, said Morgan Drayton, policy and engagement manager at Common Cause Maryland.

            “A lot of our maps here are drawn behind closed doors, and there’s not a lot of input from the public that’s able to be given,"" she said. ""So this would do a lot to make these processes more transparent.”

            In Maryland's Baltimore County, a lawsuit claimed the county council's map packed most Black voters into a single district. The state legislation would require jurisdictions in Maryland with a history of voter discrimination to have redistricting and election changes cleared by the state attorney general.

            Democratic state Del. Stephanie Smith, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said that despite Maryland's racial diversity and history of diversity in its political leadership, ""access to the ballot and equitable representation is uneven.”

            “This bill strengthens our commitment to voting access and protections at a time of great stress on our democratic institutions,” she said.

            Proposals in Michigan and New Mexico address harassment against election workers and voters, especially those in minority communities. One of several bills in New Mexico would protect election officials, from the secretary of state to county and municipal elections clerks, from intimidation. That would be defined as inducing or attempting to induce fear, and a violation would be punishable as a fourth-degree felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison.

            Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said she will seek similar protections for voters, including prohibiting firearms within a certain distance of polling places.

            “We need an explicit ban on voter suppression and intimidation,” she said.

            Connecticut’s legislation would expand language assistance for voters who speak, read or understand languages other than English. Language assistance is covered under the federal law, but only specifies protections for Spanish-speakers and for Asian, Native American and Alaska Native language minorities.

            Ballots offered in Arabic, Haitian Creole and other languages also are needed, said Steven Lance, policy counsel at the national NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

            A language would be covered if the group speaking it is more than 2% of the citizens of voting age in a particular municipality or the group includes more than 4,000 citizens of voting age, under Connecticut's legislative proposal. 

            Residents also would have the right to ask the secretary of state to review whether a certain language should be covered, Lance said.

            In New Jersey, advocacy organizations are pushing to expand voting rights legislation to include more groups that would be specifically protected from discrimination, including the state's sizable Arab American population.

            “A reality is the federal VRA was originally crafted in 1965, and while there have been other bills in the decade since, the VRA doesn’t reflect the diversity of the population of New Jersey in 2023,” said Henal Patel, law & policy director at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.

            Some state voting rights bills also seek to create databases for information that has not always been readily available, such as polling place locations, voting rules and redistricting maps. The bills also would specify that state judges interpret voting laws in a way that ensures people maintain their right to vote.

            Democrats in Minnesota are pushing numerous voting changes, including restoring voting rights to felons as soon as they are released from prison, allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister so they are ready to vote as soon as they turn 18 and automatically registering people to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s licenses.

            Passing state voting rights legislation is only half the battle, said state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia Democrat who introduced a state voting rights act that passed in 2021 when Democrats controlled both houses of the Legislature and the governor's office.

            McClellan noted that ensuring voting rights historically was a bipartisan issue, but said Republicans are now focused on “fighting phantom voter fraud” — making this year's Virginia legislative elections all the more important.

            “The entire General Assembly is up for election this year, and I think that’s going to be a big theme in the election — that if we want to protect our progress on voting rights, we’re going to need to make sure that Democrats keep the Senate and regain the majority in the House,"" McClellan said.

            
                McClellan won a special election this past week to fill an open seat in the U.S. House, where she will make history as the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress.

That would be defined as inducing or attempting to induce fear, and a violation would be punishable as a fourth-degree felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison.Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said she will seek similar protections for voters, including prohibiting firearms within a certain distance of polling places.“We need an explicit ban on voter suppression and intimidation,” she said.Connecticut’s legislation would expand language assistance for voters who speak, read or understand languages other than English. Language assistance is covered under the federal law, but only specifies protections for Spanish-speakers and for Asian, Native American and Alaska Native language minorities.Ballots offered in Arabic, Haitian Creole and other languages also are needed, said Steven Lance, policy counsel at the national NAACP Legal Defense Fund.A language would be covered if the group speaking it is more than 2% of the citizens of voting age in a particular municipality or the group includes more than 4,000 citizens of voting age, under Connecticut's legislative proposal.Residents also would have the right to ask the secretary of state to review whether a certain language should be covered, Lance said.In New Jersey, advocacy organizations are pushing to expand voting rights legislation to include more groups that would be specifically protected from discrimination, including the state's sizable Arab American population.“A reality is the federal VRA was originally crafted in 1965, and while there have been other bills in the decade since, the VRA doesn’t reflect the diversity of the population of New Jersey in 2023,” said Henal Patel, law & policy director at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.Some state voting rights bills also seek to create databases for information that has not always been readily available, such as polling place locations, voting rules and redistricting maps. The bills also would specify that state judges interpret voting laws in a way that ensures people maintain their right to vote.Democrats in Minnesota are pushing numerous voting changes, including restoring voting rights to felons as soon as they are released from prison, allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister so they are ready to vote as soon as they turn 18 and automatically registering people to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s licenses.Passing state voting rights legislation is only half the battle, said state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia Democrat who introduced a state voting rights act that passed in 2021 when Democrats controlled both houses of the Legislature and the governor's office.McClellan noted that ensuring voting rights historically was a bipartisan issue, but said Republicans are now focused on “fighting phantom voter fraud” — making this year's Virginia legislative elections all the more important.“The entire General Assembly is up for election this year, and I think that’s going to be a big theme in the election — that if we want to protect our progress on voting rights, we’re going to need to make sure that Democrats keep the Senate and regain the majority in the House,"" McClellan said.McClellan won a special election this past week to fill an open seat in the U.S. House, where she will make history as the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress.___Associated Press coverage of race and voting receives support from the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821643,Turkey launches investigation into 612 people after quake,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Investigations have been launched against more than 600 people in relation to buildings that collapsed in Turkey’s catastrophic earthquake earlier this month, a government official said Saturday.

            Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said 184 of the 612 suspects had been jailed pending trial. Those in custody include construction contractors and building owners or managers, he said in televised comments from a coordination center in Diyarbakir in southeast Turkey.

            “The detection of evidence in the buildings continues as a basis for criminal investigation,” Bozdag added. 











            The aftermath of the 7.8-magnitude quake on Feb. 6, which led to nearly 48,000 deaths in southern Turkey and northern Syria, has seen Turks question the structural integrity of many of the 173,000 buildings that collapsed or were seriously damaged.

            Experts have said many toppled structures were built with inferior materials and methods and often did not comply with government standards. Opposition parties have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s administration of failing to enforce building regulations.

            The mayor of a town close to the epicenter of the earthquake was detained as part of an investigation into collapsed buildings, the Cumhuriyet newspaper and other outlets reported Saturday.

            Okkes Kavak, who heads the district of Nurdagi in Gaziantep province and is a member of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), is said to have failed to ensure construction inspections were carried out.

            AFAD, Turkey’s disaster management agency, said that 9,470 aftershocks had hit the region affected by the quake.

            “This will continue for a long time… we expect these aftershocks to last for at least two years,” AFAD General Manager Orhan Tatar said in a media briefing in Ankara.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821651,G20: Germany regrets China blocking Russia condemnation,"Germany has criticized China's blocking of a communique drafted during the Group of 20 meeting which condemned Russia's war on Ukraine.Saturday's condemnation was signed off by all members of the group, barring China and Russia itself.Finance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters on Saturday that the outcome was ""regrettable.""However, he added: ""For me, it was more important that all the others adhered to a clear position of international law, multilateralism, and the end of the war,"" Reuters quoted Lindner as saying.A chair's summary issued at the end of the meeting said there was no agreement on the wording of the war in Ukraine. The document simply summed up the two days of talks, without any resolutions due to the divisions.The talks started in the Indian city of Bengaluru, the center of the country's high-tech industry, on Friday, which marked the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.A major G20 summit held in Bali last November saw leaders of the member countries strongly condemn the war.India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the communique contained two contested paragraphs from the Bali declaration. Though they had been approved in November, both Russia and China said they had agreed under the then prevailing circumstances.Sitharaman did not give more details about the reasons for the duo's rejection.The clause that was rejected read: ""It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability... The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war.""Russia has been hinting recently it might resort to its nuclear arsenal, as the war with Ukraine drags on.Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Thursday to develop Moscow's nuclear forces further.Putin's remarks were issued two days after he announced that Russia would suspend its participation in a key nuclear disarmament treaty.

major quake.""The amount is three times more than Istanbul city's annual budget, but we need to be ready before it is too late,"" Imamoglu told a science council.A potential quake of over magnitude 7.5 will damage nearly 500,000 buildings, inhabited by 6.2 million people, some 40% of the city's population, according to a 2021 report by the Kandilli monitor.Istanbul sits next to the notorious Northern Anatolian fault line.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821653,Ukraine updates: Germans see arming Ukraine as involvement,"The majority of German people see their country's arms deliveries to Ukraine as participation in the war against Russia, a recent poll suggests.The poll was conducted on behalf of Germany's DPA news agency by the opinion research institute YouGov. It surveyed 2,072 Germans nationwide from February 21 until February 23, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Fifty-one percent of the respondents thought arming Ukraine meant being part of the war, an argument which Russia has been pushing. Meanwhile, 37% disagreed with the statement.Germany has approved some €2.6 billion ($2.75 billion) worth of weapons and armaments since the start of the war.Forty percent of those polled considered the amount of weapons support from Germany to be too much, 22% thought it was too little, and 23% thought it was just the right amount.Respondents were specifically polled about the controversial decision to send German heavy Leopard 2 tanks to the conflict.The German government approved the decision to send 18 modern tanks last month after a lot of hesitation over fears of provoking Russia and prolonging the conflict.Those polled were nearly equally torn, with 44% being against and 41% being in favor.Asked about the possibility of Germany sending fighter jets to the conflict, 56% of those polled disapproved, whereas 27% were in favor.Germany is considered the fourth biggest arms supplier to Ukraine since the full invasion one year ago, after the US, Britain and Poland.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Saturday, February 25:Germany was ""optimistic"" about getting orders to fulfill armed forces investments, after lull over a special €100 billion ($106 billion) defense fund announced on the heels of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year under the auspices of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ""Zeitenwende,"" or ""turniing point"" policies.Hans-Christoph Atzpodien, the chief executive of the German Security and Defence Industry Association (BDSV), told told Germany's DPA news agency on Saturday that the industry was ready to partner up with the German Bundeswehr and the Defense Ministry.""We are confident that we will now get orders across the board,"" he said. ""The companies are highly motivated, especially since some of them have already taken entrepreneurial risks.""Atzpodien added that it was important to increase the defense budget, in parallel to the special fund. He stressed investing in the Bundeswehr was an urgent matter to ""protect German democracy and Europe as a whole.""The special fund was announced on February 27 last year, days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, only a small amount of it has been disbursed.No tanks or artillery orders were made by the beginning of the year, partly due to the provisional budget only initially coming into force last year, making it difficult to grant new contracts.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko held a long conversation with his Russian ally Vladimir Putin on Friday, as the world marked the first anniversary of the war that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.A channel close to Lukashenko on the Telegram messaging app told reporters about the talk. However, no details regarding the topics discussed were given.The Belarusian president is known to be a staunch supporter of Putin.The talk comes days after a consortium of Western outlets reported that Russia was planning to annex Belarus by the year 2030, citing a document allegedly leaked from Russia's presidential administration.Russia's former president and Putin-confidante Dmitry Medvedev has denied reports that the country's ongoing war against Ukraine has dried up its missile supply.Medvedev said in an article published in Russia's monthly National Defense magazine that Russia has boosted its arms output, as well as closely examining enemy weapons which came its way.""We are not just expanding production but are also introducing the latest technologies and fine-tuning them literally ‘on the march,'"" the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted Medvedev.He added that Russian forces have also inspected enemy weapons which they seized ""as trophies,"" adding that said weapons have been taken apart into tiny parts at Russian military design bureau.""We have learnt a lot of useful things and have put the enemy's experience to our advantage,"" he said.Medvedev, who serves as the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, has often been described as Putin's protege. Many believe the Russian president is likely to choose him as a successor.A Western think-tank had suggested last week that Russia had lost around half of its most modern tanks in the war, adding that the country was struggling to replace them.The British Ministry of Defense suggested on Saturday that Russia has run out of Iranian drones it had used in the war.In its daily update on the war, the British ministry said there were no report of the use of the Iranian one-way-attack unmanned aerial vehicles (OWA-UAVs) in Ukraine since mid-February.The ministry added that Ukrainian forces had reported shooting down at least 24 of the Shahed-136 drones between late January and early February.""This lack of OWA-UAV deployments likely indicates that Russia has run down its current stock. Russia will likely seek a resupply,"" the UK Defense Ministry said.The British government will provide displaced Ukrainians with 3,000 tickets for the Eurovision Song Contest, due to be held in the English city of Liverpool later this year.The European singing contest is traditionally hosted by the country of the previous edition's winners. Though last year's Ukrainian Kalush Orchestra won the contest with the song ""Stefania,"" the contest could not be hosted by the war-torn country for security reasons.Hosting rights went instead to the country of the runner-ups; the UK.""Today's announcement means that thousands of tickets will be offered to those displaced by war, so that they can take part in a show honoring their homeland, their culture and their music,"" Britain's Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said.""As always, we stand together with the Ukrainian people and their fight for freedom.""The British government added that it would provide 10 million pounds ($12 million) worth of funding to help host the competition.Ukraine's Zelenskyy says ""2023 will be the year of our victory"" as Poland says the first Leopard tanks have already been delivered to Kyiv. Ukraine marks a year of war — as it happenedPeople staged demonstrations around the world in protest of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year after its onset. In Berlin, a disabled Russian tank was put on show near Moscow's embassy.Russian authorities have arrested several Russians who placed flowers at the statues of famed Ukrainian writers to protest against the war, according to Russian NGOs and media.Speaking on the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian president said he wanted China and India, as well as African and Latin American nations, to back peace in his country.rmt/ar (dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821654,"Ukraine: Zelenskyy seeks more sanctions, fighting grinds on","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fighting is grinding on in Ukraine after the country marked the anniversary of Russia's invasion, with Ukrainian authorities on Saturday reporting dozens of new Russian strikes and attacks on cities in the east and south.

            After a somber and defiant day of commemorations on Friday and a marathon news conference, Ukraine's seemingly indefatigable president followed up with new video posts a day later in which he declared that “Russia must lose in Ukraine"" and argued that its forces can be defeated this year.

            In a separate tweet, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also pushed for more sanctions pressure on Russia after the U.K., U.S. and the European Union all announced new measures aimed at further choking off funding and support for Moscow.











            “The pressure on Russian aggressor must increase,” Zelenskyy tweeted in English.

            He said Ukraine wants to see “decisive steps” against Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom and the Russian nuclear industry as well as “more pressure on military and banking.”

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that Rosatom and his Defense Ministry need to work on ensuring that Russia is ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if needs be. He alleged that the U.S. is working on nuclear weapons and that some in the U.S. are pondering plans to carry out nuclear tests banned under the global test ban that took effect after the end of the Cold War.

            “If the U.S. conducts tests, we will also do it,” Putin said.

            Russia has already become the most sanctioned nation in the world over the past year, targeted with sanctions by more than 30 countries representing more than half of the world’s economy. But the squeeze on its economy, trade and firms has yet to deliver a knockout blow.

            Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, called the latest U.S. sanctions “thoughtless.”

            “We have learned to live under economic and political pressure,"" Antonov said. “The experience of previous sanctions has shown that they harm the world market to a greater extent, worsen the situation of ordinary citizens in states that initiate or support reckless sanctions.”

            
                The Feb. 24 anniversary of last year's invasion brought no respite in Russian attacks. 

            Still, in one of his video posts on Saturday, Zelenskyy asked: “Is it possible for us to win?”

            “Yes,” he said. “We are capable of this in unity, resolutely and unyieldingly, to put an end to Russian aggression this year.” 

            Ukraine's military on Saturday reported 27 Russian airstrikes and 75 attacks from multiple rocket launchers in the most recent 24-hour spell. It said Russian offensive efforts continue to be concentrated in Ukraine’s industrial east and northeast. Five wounded civilians were reported in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk province, where territory is roughly split between Russian and Ukrainian control.

            Battles raged “around” and “nearby” Bakhmut, a city in the Donetsk region that has become the focus of the fighting in recent months, according to Ukraine’s Land Forces. The military said the Russian forces continued attempts to break through Ukrainian defenses, encircle and seize the city. 

            Yevgeny Prigozhin, owner of Russia's private military company Wagner, claimed on Saturday that his fighters have “completely taken over” the village of Yahidne on the north outskirts of Bakhmut. There has been no confirmation of the claim from either the Russian military or the Ukrainian army. 

            In the southern Kherson region, Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin also reported 83 Russian shelling attacks, with the regional capital, also called Kherson, hit nine times, and residential buildings, a preschool and a medical institution struck. The head of Ukraine's presidential office reported three civilian wounded in the region.

            French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that he aims to discuss peace efforts related to the Ukraine war with China when he travels there in April. China has called for a cease-fire and peace talks. Zelenskyy on Friday gave qualified support for Beijing's apparent interest in playing a role.

            Macron said in Paris that “China must now help us to put pressure on Russia.""

            “Obviously so that Russia never uses neither chemical nor nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""But also so that (Russia) stops this aggression as a condition for a negotiation.” 

            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Saturday that he welcomed parts of the peace plan for Ukraine proposed by China, but disagreed with other aspects.

            “There are things that are remarkably right, such as the renewed condemnation of the use of nuclear weapons,” Scholz told reporters during an official visit to India. “What’s missing in my view is a discernible line that says: ‘Russian troops must also withdraw.’”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821655,Refugee-averse Japan welcomes Ukrainians after Russia war,"TOKYO (AP) — Dmytro Remez quietly shows on his laptop before and after photos of buildings, clicking to once elegant offices and hotels that turned into lopsided abandoned rubble.

            One crumbling building was right in front of his home in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine. 

            Remez, 24, a fledgling medical doctor studying at Juntendo University, is among the 2,291 Ukrainians who have moved to Japan since the war with Russia began a year ago.











            “It’s ridiculous. The main purpose is to destroy everything. If you look at the cities for which they are fighting, the cities are totally destroyed,” he said, sitting in his tiny, but clean, modern dorm in Tokyo. 

            “No one will live in the cities in the future. So for what? Why? Why do you do this?” 

            His flight-to-safety story is a rare one in a nation that has a reputation for closing its doors to asylum seekers. 

            Japan accepted just 74 refugees, mostly from African nations in 2021, the latest year for which such data are available, according to the Justice Ministry. That's fewer than 1% of 2,413 applicants.

            Technically, Ukrainians aren’t even categorized as “refugees,” but called “evacuees.” The system for accepting Ukrainians works without Japan having to change its overall refugee policy. The Japanese government has repeatedly expressed its solidarity with the U.S. and other Western nations in supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. 

            A significant portion of the money helping Ukrainians in Japan has come from Nippon Foundation, a nonprofit that directs motorboat racing revenue to philanthropy. Nippon Foundation initially committed 5 billion yen ($37 million) to help Ukrainians, including travel costs, housing and living expenses, and has since raised the amount to 8.58 billion yen ($64 million) over three years.

            It's among the largest donations made in reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago, with other major gifts in cash and services coming from American technology companies like Microsoft as well as European foundations and companies with a charitable mission. Private donations tallied by the U.S. nonprofit Candid found that $1.2 billion was donated since the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the U.N. has received $3.4 billion in commitments or donations mostly from governments to fund its humanitarian response to the war. 

            Nippon Foundation, founded by politician and businessman Ryoichi Sasakawa in 1962, has now given aid to 1,921 Ukrainians in Japan. The group has been honored with various international awards. 

            The organization is now headed by Yohei Sasakawa, Ryoichi Sasakawa’s son. Its charity work includes fighting leprosy, disaster relief, help for people with disabilities and various scholarships, under its motto “to achieve a society in which all people support one another.”

            Ayako Niijima, who oversees protection and assistance at the Japan Association for Refugees, says the way Japan grants refugee status is very narrow, and the procedure difficult, compared to the global standard. 

            Her organization helps refugees in Japan in partnership with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR.

            Niijima said that dozens of people hoping to live in Japan are now homeless. Those numbers are expected to grow, since entry restrictions for the coronavirus pandemic were lifted in October. 

            “There is definitely a big difference in treatment for Ukrainians,” Niijima said, while noting she is supportive of all people who seek safety in Japan, including Ukrainians. 

            Remez doesn’t appear overly interested in the inner workings of his aid package. He is just grateful for the support he's received, especially from the university and his professors, and all that he is learning, going every day to the university hospital. 

            The other day, he learned about the CT scan. Another day, he had fun taking part in a relay running race with nurses and doctors, the only Ukrainian on the team. 

            The full-tuition opportunity, complete with plane tickets, to continue his studies was the only such option he found online. It just happened to be Japan, he recalled with a smile. 

            And he considers himself lucky. The people are friendly. If he gets lost, people go out of their way to help him. 

            His wife, Oleksandra Horbulova, a violinist whom he dated for several years and married shortly before the war began, has also gotten into Japan, but through a different program unrelated to Juntendo. 

            They live apart for now but see each other on weekends. She does charity concerts and teaches music to children. They plan to have children, once they save enough money. 

            Remez has learned to love ramen noodles and sushi, although he still loves to cook. His borscht is delicious, he boasts. He is learning Japanese. 

            Being a doctor was always his dream because he wanted to help people. It’s a challenge, like solving a crime, except what you are fighting is disease, he said. 

            He hopes to go into general practice in Japan. There are people to help here as well, and Japan is prone to natural disasters.

            “You know, we are still trying to find new ways of killing each other. We have disasters that can kill thousands of people. Why are we killing each other? It’s stupid,” said Remez. 

            His father, a lawyer and government worker, still lives in Ukraine. He missed being killed by 15 minutes, when his workplace was bombed before he arrived. His father is really brave, Remez says. He lost his mother to kidney failure, shortly before the war began. He has no siblings. 

            Remez acknowledged he was never one of those overly fascinated by samurai, ninja or other things Japan, although he has watched Studio Ghibli animation films by Hayao Miyazaki. 

            These days, he is startled by how Japan and Ukraine have so much in common. Instead of individualism, driven by a desire to get ahead, he senses a peaceful community spirit in both nations. 

            When he visited a nearby shrine over New Year’s, the celebration of life there reminded him of Easter in Ukrainian churches.

            Being a doctor, Remez also thinks about how the historical connection among doctors lies deep between the nations in studying and treating the effects of radiation. Chernobyl happened in Ukraine; Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Fukushima in Japan, Remez said thoughtfully. 

            Ukrainian doctors helped in Fukushima after the 2011 tsunami, quake and nuclear disaster. Japanese doctors performed lifesaving cancer surgery on children after the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe. 

            “We are the only two countries that suffered nuclear disaster,” he said. “Japanese people have suffered. They really want to help.”

            Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyamaTOKYO (AP) — Dmytro Remez quietly shows on his laptop before and after photos of buildings, clicking to once elegant offices and hotels that turned into lopsided abandoned rubble.One crumbling building was right in front of his home in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine.Remez, 24, a fledgling medical doctor studying at Juntendo University, is among the 2,291 Ukrainians who have moved to Japan since the war with Russia began a year ago.“It’s ridiculous. The main purpose is to destroy everything. If you look at the cities for which they are fighting, the cities are totally destroyed,” he said, sitting in his tiny, but clean, modern dorm in Tokyo.“No one will live in the cities in the future. So for what? Why? Why do you do this?”His flight-to-safety story is a rare one in a nation that has a reputation for closing its doors to asylum seekers.Japan accepted just 74 refugees, mostly from African nations in 2021, the latest year for which such data are available, according to the Justice Ministry. That's fewer than 1% of 2,413 applicants.Technically, Ukrainians aren’t even categorized as “refugees,” but called “evacuees.” The system for accepting Ukrainians works without Japan having to change its overall refugee policy. The Japanese government has repeatedly expressed its solidarity with the U.S. and other Western nations in supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia.A significant portion of the money helping Ukrainians in Japan has come from Nippon Foundation, a nonprofit that directs motorboat racing revenue to philanthropy. Nippon Foundation initially committed 5 billion yen ($37 million) to help Ukrainians, including travel costs, housing and living expenses, and has since raised the amount to 8.58 billion yen ($64 million) over three years.It's among the largest donations made in reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago, with other major gifts in cash and services coming from American technology companies like Microsoft as well as European foundations and companies with a charitable mission. Private donations tallied by the U.S. nonprofit Candid found that $1.2 billion was donated since the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the U.N. has received $3.4 billion in commitments or donations mostly from governments to fund its humanitarian response to the war.Nippon Foundation, founded by politician and businessman Ryoichi Sasakawa in 1962, has now given aid to 1,921 Ukrainians in Japan. The group has been honored with various international awards.The organization is now headed by Yohei Sasakawa, Ryoichi Sasakawa’s son. Its charity work includes fighting leprosy, disaster relief, help for people with disabilities and various scholarships, under its motto “to achieve a society in which all people support one another.”Ayako Niijima, who oversees protection and assistance at the Japan Association for Refugees, says the way Japan grants refugee status is very narrow, and the procedure difficult, compared to the global standard.Her organization helps refugees in Japan in partnership with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR.Niijima said that dozens of people hoping to live in Japan are now homeless.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821656,Maryland church celebrates heritage on ‘Caribbean Sabbath',"HYATTSVILLE, Md. (RNS) — As worshippers entered the sanctuary of Metropolitan Seventh-day Adventist Church, doorman Percy Joseph greeted them with “Happy Sabbath,” his bright red Trinidad and Tobago T-shirt showing beneath his long black coat.

            Inside, guest steel drum players began to play “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” giving the tune known as the Black national anthem a steady beat reminiscent of the homelands of many congregants.

            Then, marching and dancing flag bearers processed down the main aisle, first with the American flag, and then with banners of those lands, from Barbados to the Dominican Republic to Trinidad and Tobago.











            On the third Saturday of Black History Month, at this church near Maryland’s border with the District of Columbia, it was “ Caribbean Sabbath.”

            ___

            Pastor Trevor Kinlock kept up the enthusiastic flavor of the service as he greeted the congregation before his sermon.

            “Come on, raise your flag and represent,” Kinlock said to those fellow congregants who, like him, had Jamaican roots, before turning to a more global celebration. “We’ve come to celebrate him and we thank God for the beauty of our diversity as a people.”

            Kinlock used his time at the lectern to emphasize why Black churches need to remember the history of Black people, including Americans like “Sister Harriet Tubman and Mother Sojourner Truth,” the latter who had ties to Adventism.

            But he quickly added others beyond the North American mainland, such as Jamaican hero “Queen Nanny,” the spiritual and military leader of formerly enslaved African people called Maroons, who used guerrilla warfare against British troops, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who led the Haitian Revolution that overthrew French soldiers, making the island the first nation in the Americas to end slavery.

            “You ought to give God a praise — thank God for the example of our Haitian brothers and sisters,” he said. “Caribbean folk know how to act up.”

            Preaching on the Hebrew Bible text about the Prophet Elijah, Kinlock said, “We need the radical spirit of Elijah that resists and challenges the social evils of our day.” He cited the disproportionate numbers of people of color who are incarcerated, cases where “brown immigrant children are ripped from their parents at the border and housed in detention camps” and the killings of Black people at the hands of police officers.

            “We need to call down the fire on global corporate power that still exploits the people and resources in the Caribbean and in Africa, extracting their wealth and leaving our people in poverty,” he said to cheers in agreement. “We cannot keep silent but we’ve got to speak out.”

            Seventh-day Adventists, known for their observance of the Sabbath on Saturdays, have topped the Pew Research Center’s list of the most racially diverse religious groups in the U.S.

            “’Caribbean Sabbath’ is not an official event across the North American Division territory of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,” said Julio C. Muñoz, a spokesperson for that division of the church. But “there are churches with a rich Caribbean background that observe and celebrate their heritage at different times throughout the year, including Black History Month.”

            At Metropolitan, which has marked its members’ Caribbean culture for more than a decade, some were celebrating not just one country but the cultural diversity within their own families.

            United Kingdom-born Claudette Smith is the daughter of a Barbadian mother and Jamaican father and she married a man from Trinidad.

            “Representation matters and not too many churches in the area take time to celebrate their members, the diversity in their members,” she said. “We have people from all over the place that come here to this church. And it’s nice that we get a day where we can act foolish in Jesus’ name.”

            Asked about the Metropolitan service, Monika Gosin, associate professor of sociology at the College of William & Mary, said it exemplifies the latest juncture in the growth of U.S. Black immigrant populations, who have long been a part of the Black community and its churches. Pew reports that nearly half of the country’s foreign-born Black population — 46% — was birthed in the Caribbean.

            “The way that we even conceptualize the Black church is changing,” she said. “This particular church service really reflects that, the way that Black people in United States are grappling with and embracing this particular diversity that they have.”

            For decades, Caribbean communities in cities such as Washington, Atlanta and New York have recognized Black History Month, said Noel Erskine, an expert on Caribbean theologies at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology. Often, a community celebration would be held in a church because such a building could provide a large and free space for gathering.

            “The part that’s new is the theological piece,” he said, “to say this is a Sabbath.”

            In an interview, Kinlock said the service, which draws hundreds to the sanctuary and an overflow room, is bigger than the Easter, Christmas or revival services at his church. Many replace the usual suit and tie or dress with cultural outfits that reflect their country — with T-shirts and, in one case, a skirt resembling the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.

            “It’s a space where our members and their family and friends can feel celebrated, can feel affirmed, so that is something that brings them out and then it’s good music and you get to express yourself in your authentic cultural voice and in your own way,” he said of his church, whose other Sabbaths in February celebrated African Americans and Africans, with a plan to end the month with an international food festival. “That is refreshing because there are not many spaces that they can just be themselves.”

            Other Adventist churches have spotlighted their Caribbean members in services during Black History Month, from a church in Orlando, Florida, earlier this month to one in Mount Vernon, New York, last year.

            Philip James, dressed in bright green and yellow colors representing his native Jamaica —and a small embossed flag on his chest just like his pastor at Metropolitan SDA — said he appreciated the special day.

            “It brings back memories,” he said, carrying a hefty Bible and hymnal under one arm. “And sometimes you miss it.”

            Although many of the people waving flags, cheering and dancing were excited about foreign countries, there were a couple of American flags in view.

            “For me it’s special because it signifies unity and community,” said Nikita Thompson, who has attended the church for eight years. “I’m not from the Caribbean but I feel connected and I learn from them and their heritage.”

            Ursula Roberts-Allen, wearing a skirt with the red and white colors of the flag of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, also affirmed the service’s educational emphasis.

            “It brings me back home — it does — and helps me to teach my son what the Caribbean is about,” said the 36-year member, “and passing on our heritage to the next generation is critical.”

            Olive Sterling, who described herself as “from a little place in Jamaica called Redberry,” also enjoyed the celebration, 50 years after she had joined the Washington-area church.

            “It just highlights my heritage,” she said. “It does my spirit good.”HYATTSVILLE, Md.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821657,Seattle Opera puts story of Afghan women center stage,"As the Taliban once again assert control of Afghanistan and push women further out of public view, a female Afghan filmmaker is working thousands of miles away to help bring to life a wildly popular tale of two heroines living in her homeland, including under the group’s first reign.

            The world premiere of Seattle Opera’s “A Thousand Splendid Suns” opens Saturday evening. It is based on a novel by Kabul-born author Khaled Hosseini that explores the inner worlds of Mariam and Laila over decades of Afghan history, some with stark parallels to the present. 

            The women, born nearly two decades apart, forge an unlikely bond as they share an abusive husband and navigate struggles facing them and their country. It’s a story of hardships, injustices and loss, but also of deep love, endurance and one big decision that, ultimately, alters both their lives and leads to the survival of only one. 











            It was supposed to be a story of a bygone era -- until the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 dramatically changed that. 

            For the opera’s stage director, Roya Sadat, who lived under Taliban's first rule and made a professional name for herself after the group’s 2001 ouster, that reversal is deeply personal.

            Born in the city of Herat, she happened to be in America when she learned that her birthplace had fallen to the Taliban in 2021. Just like other historic events in Afghanistan colored Mariam’s and Laila’s lives, that takeover has once again reshaped Sadat’s country and, this time, turned her into an asylee in the United States.

            “I was actually never thinking that one day I will leave Afghanistan,” the 39-year-old said. “When I heard this news, I was in shock. And I just said: ‘no, no, no, it’s not possible.’... It was like watching a terrible movie.”

            In that moment, Sadat added, directing “A Thousand Splendid Suns” took on a new meaning.

            “Suddenly, the topic changed in my mind, that ‘Oh my God, now this story is going to repeat again. Now, maybe, a thousand Laila and Mariam are going to be in the same situation,’” she said. 

            In her director’s statement, Sadat writes about becoming “homeless” in the blink of an eye and describes how the goal of her work has evolved.

            “My task was no longer to simply portray the universal pain, struggle, and perseverance of women through the story of two Afghan women,” she said. “It became a duty to convey an unparalleled injustice to which my countrywomen are condemned.” 

            Mariam and Laila have captured the imagination of composer Sheila Silver for a long time. She felt like she knew them and wanted to tell their story. She listened to the book in 2009 and recalled tears streaming down her face as one of the women faced her death.

            “This is what heroes are made of, people who make sacrifices for others that they love and so that was what drew me in,” Silver said. “It was about the love and bonding and resilience and strength of these two women.”

            And in that sense, she found their tales universal. “It’s their humanity that we’re celebrating,” she said. “It’s a story of that time with incredible parallels to this time today.” 

            Hosseini, the book’s author who lives in California, wishes that wasn’t the case. 

            He had hoped the story of “A Thousand Splendid Suns” would become a relic of the past, maybe a ""cautionary tale.” But instead, he said, “what’s going on with women today is a cruel deja vu.”

            He lamented that the international spotlight on Afghanistan seemed to have faded. He hopes the opera’s audience will be moved by the music, but also that the production, even if in limited ways, can spark conversations about the situation there.

            “I’ve always thought of the arts as our most powerful … teachers of empathy,” he said. “I hope that this opera is an expression of the collective struggles and sacrifices of Afghans over the last four decades, particularly Afghan women.”

            Despite initial promises, the Taliban have increasingly imposed restrictions on women and girls with an expanding list of bans that included barring them from universities and schools beyond the sixth grade. That has sparked an international uproar, deepening Afghanistan’s isolation at a time of severe economic turmoil.

            The crackdown on women’s freedoms harkens back to when the Taliban ran Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 -- and to a somber part of Sadat’s own life under the group. 

            She no longer could attend school. She turned to books, sometimes borrowed from relatives or friends, to expand her world. Home doubled as a school of sorts, where her mother and an aunt would teach her different subjects. 

            Through it all, she clung to hope. 

            It was under the Taliban, that, sitting on her family’s kitchen floor, Sadat started writing a script that later turned into her first movie. At the time, she said, she didn’t have electricity; the kitchen fire provided the light she needed to write. 

            Toward the end of the Taliban’s reign, a relative helped her get a spot in a class that trained women in nursing. There, Sadat said she helped organize small cultural groups that produced theater critical of the Taliban’s treatment of women; to avoid getting caught, classmates would be on the lookout inside a stairwell to alert others if Taliban members approached.

            After the Taliban’s fall, Sadat and her sister co-founded Roya Film House, a company that has produced films and TV dramas.

            Working on the Seattle opera, she said, has been of special significance.

            “In creating the atmosphere of this work, I have tried to show the people the beauty of Afghan women’s lives — the parts of that world they do not know and the people they have not seen,” she said. “I want to evoke Kabul in the old years, full of songs, poetry, music, color, and joy. Throughout Afghanistan’s history, even on the path of pain and suffering, is the radiant face of a woman who shines.”

And I just said: ‘no, no, no, it’s not possible.’... It was like watching a terrible movie.”In that moment, Sadat added, directing “A Thousand Splendid Suns” took on a new meaning.“Suddenly, the topic changed in my mind, that ‘Oh my God, now this story is going to repeat again. Now, maybe, a thousand Laila and Mariam are going to be in the same situation,’” she said.In her director’s statement, Sadat writes about becoming “homeless” in the blink of an eye and describes how the goal of her work has evolved.“My task was no longer to simply portray the universal pain, struggle, and perseverance of women through the story of two Afghan women,” she said. “It became a duty to convey an unparalleled injustice to which my countrywomen are condemned.”Mariam and Laila have captured the imagination of composer Sheila Silver for a long time. She felt like she knew them and wanted to tell their story. She listened to the book in 2009 and recalled tears streaming down her face as one of the women faced her death.“This is what heroes are made of, people who make sacrifices for others that they love and so that was what drew me in,” Silver said. “It was about the love and bonding and resilience and strength of these two women.”And in that sense, she found their tales universal. “It’s their humanity that we’re celebrating,” she said. “It’s a story of that time with incredible parallels to this time today.”Hosseini, the book’s author who lives in California, wishes that wasn’t the case.He had hoped the story of “A Thousand Splendid Suns” would become a relic of the past, maybe a ""cautionary tale.” But instead, he said, “what’s going on with women today is a cruel deja vu.”He lamented that the international spotlight on Afghanistan seemed to have faded. He hopes the opera’s audience will be moved by the music, but also that the production, even if in limited ways, can spark conversations about the situation there.“I’ve always thought of the arts as our most powerful … teachers of empathy,” he said. “I hope that this opera is an expression of the collective struggles and sacrifices of Afghans over the last four decades, particularly Afghan women.”Despite initial promises, the Taliban have increasingly imposed restrictions on women and girls with an expanding list of bans that included barring them from universities and schools beyond the sixth grade. That has sparked an international uproar, deepening Afghanistan’s isolation at a time of severe economic turmoil.The crackdown on women’s freedoms harkens back to when the Taliban ran Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 -- and to a somber part of Sadat’s own life under the group.She no longer could attend school. She turned to books, sometimes borrowed from relatives or friends, to expand her world. Home doubled as a school of sorts, where her mother and an aunt would teach her different subjects.Through it all, she clung to hope.It was under the Taliban, that, sitting on her family’s kitchen floor, Sadat started writing a script that later turned into her first movie. At the time, she said, she didn’t have electricity; the kitchen fire provided the light she needed to write.Toward the end of the Taliban’s reign, a relative helped her get a spot in a class that trained women in nursing. There, Sadat said she helped organize small cultural groups that produced theater critical of the Taliban’s treatment of women; to avoid getting caught, classmates would be on the lookout inside a stairwell to alert others if Taliban members approached.After the Taliban’s fall, Sadat and her sister co-founded Roya Film House, a company that has produced films and TV dramas.Working on the Seattle opera, she said, has been of special significance.“In creating the atmosphere of this work, I have tried to show the people the beauty of Afghan women’s lives — the parts of that world they do not know and the people they have not seen,” she said. “I want to evoke Kabul in the old years, full of songs, poetry, music, color, and joy. Throughout Afghanistan’s history, even on the path of pain and suffering, is the radiant face of a woman who shines.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821659,Inadequate investigation? Takeaways at Murdaugh murder trial,"Investigators like to say the crime scene at a killing tells the story even if no one else does.

            In the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh, his defense lawyers want jurors to believe the crime scene can't tell them much about the deaths of his wife and son because state agents did a poor job investigating.

            Murdaugh, 54, is accused of killing his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, at kennels near their home on June 7, 2021, as the once-prominent attorney's career and finances were crumbling. Murdaugh has denied any role in the fatal shootings. He faces 30 years to life if convicted.











            Here are some key takeaways from the 61 prosecution and 11 defense witnesses called so far in the five-week trial, including Murdaugh himself.

            CRIME SCENE PROBLEMS

            The defense has called experts who said investigators didn't dust for fingerprints, collect and test blood, or photograph evidence with the angles or clarity needed to study it properly later.

            
                The first officer arrived at the rural Colleton County estate 20 minutes after Murdaugh called 911 when he returned home from visiting his ailing mother. Almost immediately, the local sheriff realized he was dealing with someone whose family dominated the legal system in neighboring Hampton County for generations and turned the investigation over to the State Law Enforcement Division.

            It took hours for agents from across the state to get deep into the South Carolina Lowcountry. During that time, more than a dozen family and friends walked around the scene, comforting Murdaugh. The bodies of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh were covered with a sheet, which can absorb fluid, instead of a tarp. Then the sheet wasn't saved, meaning possible hair or DNA from a killer could have been lost. Intermittent rain fell and the runoff from the kennel roof fell on Paul Murdaugh's covered body.

            “It’s a crime scene. You don’t want water dripping all over the place. But more importantly, I thought it was pretty disrespectful,"" Murdaugh's former law partner Mark Ball testified.

            When state agents arrived, they sent Murdaugh and his entourage to the home. Witnesses testified it hadn't been searched for weapons, bloody clothes and other evidence or even checked to see if a suspect was hiding inside.

            Prosecutors have little direct evidence of Murdaugh's guilt. The weapons used in the killings have not been found. There's no blood-spattered clothes or surveillance video.

            Prosecutor John Meadors told one of the experts that the investigators did the best they could under the circumstances.

            “You're being paid to come in here and say they did a bad job,"" Meadors said.

            STAR WITNESS

            He was the 72nd witness of the five-week trial. But everyone perked up Thursday when Alex Murdaugh headed to the witness stand.

            His defense team wasted no time. Their first questions were whether he killed his wife or son.

            “I did not kill Maggie, and I did not kill Paul. I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul — ever — under any circumstances,"" Murdaugh said.

            Murdaugh admitted he lied for the 20 months when he told police, his family and anyone else who asked that he was not at the kennels before he found the bodies of his wife and son there. A video on his son's iPhone, shot minutes before prosecutors think the killings happened, recorded Alex Murdaugh's voice. It took state agents more than a year to hack into the phone and find it.

            In cross-examination, Murdaugh admitted he stole from clients and his law firm, likely sealing his fate for many of the 100 other charges he faces ranging from theft to insurance fraud to tax evasion.

            “I took money that wasn’t mine. And I shouldn’t have done it. I hate the fact that I did it. I am embarrassed by it. I’m embarrassed for my son. I am embarrassed for my family,” Murdaugh said.

            COUSIN EDDIE

            Outside of Murdaugh and his family, no potential witness has piqued the interest of trial watchers like Curtis ""Eddie"" Smith.

            
                “Cousin Eddie,” as many have taken to calling him, was the person Murdaugh said he called when he wanted someone to kill him three months after the deaths of his wife and son.

            The fatal shot only grazed Murdaugh's head. Smith told reporters that the gun fired as they wrestled over the weapon and if he had shot intentionally at Murdaugh, he wouldn't have missed.

            Smith and Murdaugh met about a decade ago when Smith needed a lawyer for a workers’ compensation case. Investigators said they ran a drug and money laundering ring together with Smith cashing checks to help Murdaugh hide money he was stealing from clients.

            In the end, both prosecutors and defense attorneys appear to have decided Smith could hurt their cases as much as help them.

            Defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said Smith had six different explanations for shooting Murdaugh “and any other information you ask him about.”

            But earlier this month as prosecutors and Harpootlian discussed with the judge whether Smith would testify, the feisty defense attorney lamented Smith might not be called.

            “The cross-examination of Mr. Smith is something I am looking forward to,” Harpootlian said.Investigators like to say the crime scene at a killing tells the story even if no one else does.In the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh, his defense lawyers want jurors to believe the crime scene can't tell them much about the deaths of his wife and son because state agents did a poor job investigating.Murdaugh, 54, is accused of killing his wife, Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, at kennels near their home on June 7, 2021, as the once-prominent attorney's career and finances were crumbling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821662,Buffett touts benefits of buybacks in his shareholder letter,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett said critics of stock buybacks are “either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue” or both, and all investors benefit from them as long as they are made at the right prices.

            Buffett used part of his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday to tout the benefits of repurchases that fiery Wall Street critics like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats love to criticize. The federal government even added a 1% tax on buybacks this year after they ballooned to roughly $1 trillion in 2022.

            “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),” wrote Buffett, who himself is a long-time Democrat.











            Investor Cole Smead said Washington, D.C., should take note of Buffett's view on buybacks.

            “Any politician, regardless of the aisle side, should stand up and be at attention to a statement like that,” said Smead, who is with Phoenix-based Smead Capital Management.

            Buffett used his typical self-deprecating style to say Berkshire's remarkable record of doubling the returns of the S&P 500 over the last 58 years with him at the helm is the result of only “about a dozen truly good decisions – that would be about one every five years.” 

            He recounted a few of those in his letter, but kept his message — which has long been one of the best-read documents in the business world — remarkably brief this year at a little over eight pages. And he devoted an entire page to a tribute to his 99-year-old partner Charlie Munger.

            “I think investors -- whether they be investors in Berkshire or just students of Berkshire -- look to him for more and I think they may come away wanting more,” CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said.

            Buffett pointed out how much Berkshire benefits from dividends that it receives from the huge investments in its portfolio like Coca-Cola and American Express even though he refuses to pay a dividend at the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he leads because he believes he can generate a bigger return for shareholders by investing that cash. Coke paid Berkshire $704 million in dividends last year and American Express added $302 million, and those payments helped push the value of those stakes to $25 billion for Coke and $22 billion for American Express. Berkshire paid $1.3 billion for each of those investments in the 1990s.

            Buffett said the key lesson for investors is that “it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.”

            Berkshire said its' fourth-quarter profit fell sharply to $18.2 billion from $39.6 billion a year earlier as the paper value of its investments fell. 

            So those bottom line numbers were again distorted by the value of Berkshire's sizeable stock portfolio. That's why Buffett maintains that operating earnings are a better measure of Berkshire's performance because they exclude derivatives and investments. But by that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings also declined to $6.7 billion, or $4,584.46 per Class A share, from the previous year's $7.3 billion, or $4,904.23 per Class A share.

            That's well below what Wall Street predicted. The three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings per Class A share of $5,305.83 on average.

            Analysts said that overall the results were still strong, but higher claims costs continued to hurt Geico's results while railroad traffic slowed at BNSF and rising interest rates hurt several of Berkshire's businesses that are tied to the housing market, like its nationwide network of Realtors and its Clayton Homes manufacturing housing unit.

            Berkshire's performance tends to follow whatever the U.S. economy is doing because so many of its dozens of manufacturing, utility and retail businesses follow those trends. In many ways, the conglomerate is a barometer of the economy.

            Whenever Buffett sees opportunities, Berkshire continues to invest in whole companies and stocks. He was particularly aggressive last year when he made a net investment of roughly $53 billion by the calculations of Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. Much of that went into stock of oil producers Occidental Petroleum and Chevron and last fall's $11.6 billion acquisition of Alleghany Corp. insurance. 

            But even with all that spending, Berkshire's cash hoard grew to $128.6 billion at the end of the year, up from $109 billion at the end of the third quarter. Berkshire's businesses generate so much cash that it piles up quicker than Buffett can invest it.

            At the start of this year, Berkshire boosted its stake in the Pilot Flying J network of 750 truck stops to 80%, up from the 38.6% it acquired in 2017, so that will help this year's earnings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821673,Bills would let transgender people seal name-change requests,"SEATTLE (AP) — You can change your name, but in many states you can’t completely shed your old one — something that’s of particular concern to transgender people and that legislators in at least two states are trying to change.

            A bill in Washington would allow gender expression and identity as reasons to seal, or keep out of the public record, a future petition for a name change. And a California bill would require the sealing of petitions by minors to change their name and gender on identity documents.

            In states where such petitions aren’t sealed, transgender people can be susceptible to cyberbullying or even physical violence because their previous names, and by extension their lives, are an open book in the public record, advocates warn. Students, for instance, can and do easily find and share such records when they are looking for background on a new kid in town, one advocate noted.











            Maia Xiao, a University of Washington graduate student, has changed her name in that state and said the publication of a transgender friend's name-change records in an online forum led to relentless harassment, including hate mail. She wrote last summer to Democratic state Sen. Jamie Pedersen to urge reform.

            “It feels very close to me,” said Xiao, who would not disclose the name of her friend, citing privacy. “I don’t live a very online life, but it’s really scary to know that something so personal can be so easily accessed by transphobic trolls who want to cause harm.”

            Pedersen is sponsoring the Washington legislation, which passed the Senate this month with bipartisan support and is expected to also pass the House. The bill is modeled on laws in New York and Oregon and would also extend records privacy to refugees, emancipated minors and people who have been granted asylum. 

            Currently, only people subjected to domestic violence can have their name changes easily sealed in Washington. Some other states, including California, also make exceptions for victims of crimes like human trafficking, stalking and sexual assault.

            “This seemed to me like a simple action that could go a long way in making transgender people a lot safer in our state,” Pedersen said.

            Some officials and law enforcement officers worry that criminals who request a name change could escape accountability under the proposals. The Washington bill would allow courts to unseal a name change file if law enforcement had reasonable suspicions, and sex offenders and incarcerated people would still be ineligible for a sealed name change.

            “This is not the intent of the bill, and such cases would be rare, but there needs to be procedures in place to prevent it,” Jennifer Wallace, executive director of the Washington Association of County Officials, said in an email.

            The approaches in Washington and California contrast starkly with recent and mysterious moves in Florida and Texas to compile lists of trans residents using public records, and as lawmakers in at least 39 states consider a torrent of anti-trans bills.

            Republicans’ “disturbing” requests for data on transgender residents in some of those states add urgency to his proposal, Pedersen said.

            The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton last year requested data on how many people had changed the gender information on their driver’s licenses. The Texas Department of Public Safety found over 16,000 gender changes during the prior two years but didn’t turn over data because it could not determine the reason for each change. 

            In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis asked state universities last month for data on students who had sought or received treatments for gender dysphoria. Neither Paxton nor DeSantis explained why they requested the data.

            Harassment from such disclosures can especially target young trans people who struggle with mental health issues or gender dysphoria, advocates say. The same internet forum that Xiao said had targeted her friend came under fire last year for instances of doxxing trans people, or maliciously publishing their personal information online, and has been linked to suicides.

            Peers may search students’ names as they move to a new middle or high school and can easily find and share court records related to their petitions for a name and gender change, said Kathie Moehlig, executive director of the San Diego nonprofit TransFamily Support Services. She approached California Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Chris Ward with the idea for the bill after students she advises brought the trend to her attention.

            Many families with trans children aren’t even aware such records are public, Moehlig said.

            “Somebody’s gender identity is an innate piece about them — it’s intimate,” she said. “They deserve the right to the privacy around their identity.”

            The California bill, which was introduced last month and has not yet been scheduled for a hearing, would require the state to seal any petition filed by a person under 18 for a change to gender and sex or to gender, sex and name in identity documents. Also sealed would be documents from a petitioner’s court proceedings.

            San Diego lawyer Clarice Barrelet, whose 11-year-old son is transgender, said simply plugging his name into a search engine shows his legal gender change.

            He had insisted by age 6 that he should not be called a girl and would grow up to be a man, Barrelet said. He came out as transgender at age 8 and changed the name and pronouns he used in school, even before his mom petitioned the court for a legal change to his identity documents.

            Barrelet said she thinks those records should be sealed for children and adults to better protect their privacy.

            Ward, a San Diego County Democrat and vice chair of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, said he hopes his bill will reduce the risk of bullying for gender-nonconforming children. He noted that being outed can be especially traumatic for young people who are still processing their identities.

            “I want them to certainly be comfortable,” Ward said, “and free to be themselves.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821674,Paul's lead trimmed to 1 shot by Siem at Indian Open,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Yannik Paul's lead at the Hero Indian Open was trimmed from five shots to one after the third round of the European tour event on Saturday.

            Paul, who shot a 1-under 71 to move to 11 under overall, is one ahead of fellow German Marcel Siem.

            Siem birdied his last two holes for a 67 that put him in the final group on Sunday as he goes in search of his fifth European tour title — and first since 2014.











            “I get the shivers already, just thinking about it,” said Siem, who is ranked No. 337. ""Yannik is a very good player, very steady, he’s a tough guy to beat. I’m not thinking about it. Last three holes down the stretch, that’s where it matters.

            “I’m just trying to do what I do, but it would mean a lot to me, trust me. It would be a life-changer.”

            Paul's only previous title came at the Mallorca Open last year.

            “I’m in a great position and I’m looking forward to playing with Marcel tomorrow,” the No. 119-ranked Paul said. “Getting the win would be amazing. Such an iconic event here but I think that’s the hard part.

            ""You don’t want to think ahead, you want to stay in the present because 18 holes is a lot of golf left. I’ll just try to get some rest tonight and look forward to tomorrow.”

            Dutch golfer Joost Luiten, who shot a 68, was three strokes off the lead on 8 under.

            Jorge Campillo (67), Veer Ahlawat (68) and Thorbjorn Olesen (66) were tied for fourth place, six shots behind Paul.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821697,Man gets life in prison for killing Navy midshipman's mother,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A Maryland man convicted of fatally shooting the mother of a U.S. Naval Academy football player with a stray bullet was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 

            The Capital Gazette reports that Angelo Harrod's life sentence was the maximum punishment sought in the case.

            In December, a jury convicted Harrod, 31, of Annapolis, of charges including first-degree murder in the June 2021 shooting death of Michelle Cummings, the mother of Navy football player Trey Cummings.











            Cummings, 57, of Houston, came to Annapolis with her husband to celebrate their son’s Naval Academy induction. Cummings and her husband were sitting on the patio of a nearby hotel when she was shot by the stray bullet.

            Prosecutors said Harrod killed Cummings when he and a second, unnamed man fired at an occupied SUV. Authorities believe two people in the parked car appeared to be the intended victims.

            During Harrod's trial, neither prosecutors nor police named the second man linked to the shooting.

            Defense attorney Howard Cardin said Harrod did not fire the bullet that killed Cummings.

            “I wouldn’t shoot at anybody I didn’t know,” Harrod said at his sentencing hearing.

            Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Pamela Alban said she has “no doubt” that Harrod was responsible for the 2021 attack.

            “You don’t care about the rules,” Alban told him.

            Before the sentencing, the judge dismissed a defense request for a new trial.ANNAPOLIS, Md.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821698,Westbrook goes from Lakers' bench to being Clippers' starter,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Russell Westbrook not only switched locker rooms at Crypto.com Arena. He went from being on the bench to a return to the starting lineup.

            Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue didn’t waste much time seeing how well Westbrook would mesh with his new team. The eight-time All-Star signed after he cleared waivers on Wednesday and was the starting point guard Friday night in a game against the Sacramento Kings.

            Westbrook’s Clippers debut was overshadowed in what ended up being the second-highest-scoring game in NBA history. He had 17 points, 14 assists and five rebounds in 39 minutes during the Clippers’ 176-175 loss to the Kings in double overtime.











            “It was great to get back on the floor. Obviously, you want to win and that’s the most important part,” said Westbrook, who fouled out with 1:49 remaining in the second overtime.

            Lue was pleased with Westbrook’s debut despite him having only two practices with the Clippers before the game. Westbrook was waived by Utah on Monday after being traded to the Jazz by the Lakers on Feb. 9.

            “I thought he was great. Still learning the offense, still learning where guys like the basketball and where to get the ball,” Lue said. “He knew PG’s (Paul George’s) plays and Kawhi’s (Leonard) plays, that’s the most important thing, and he picked up on those right away.”

            Westbrook quickly fit in by pushing the pace and finding his new teammates. He was the first Clippers player to have at least 10 assists in his team debut since 2005.

            Of Westbrook’s 14 assists, Leonard was the biggest beneficiary. Leonard scored 13 of his season-high 44 points off passes from Westbrook, including three 3-pointers.

            Norman Powell had three catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, but Westbrook also had to work it inside, finding Mason Plumlee inside for three easy baskets.

            George, the biggest supporter of Westbrook joining the Clippers, said it was quickly apparent that Westbrook filled an immediate need.

            “We needed a point guard. What you saw tonight: somebody to get us on offense and someone to get us easy baskets,” said George, who played with Westbrook for two seasons in Oklahoma City. “I know his strengths. If you run with him, he will make the game easier for us.”

            Westbrook was 7 of 13 shooting. Most of his attempts were drives in the paint (6 of 9) instead of pullup jumpers, which defined his 1 1/2 seasons with the Lakers. He missed his first three 3-point attempts before making one in the corner in the first overtime.

            For all the positive flashes that Westbrook showed, there are things he still needs to clean up with his game. There were seven turnovers, with four attributed to bad passes. He got crossed up on defense late in regulation when Malik Monk hit a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime.

            The Clippers will need Westbrook to continue to get up to speed with only 20 games remaining in the regular season. Los Angeles is fifth in the Western Conference with a 33-29 record but only two games in front of the pack in the play-in tournament spots.

            “I think it’s going to be just learning as we go through the process,"" Lue said. ""We don’t have a lot of time to really experiment, because we’ve still got to win games. We have to make sure we take advantage of everything we can so we can get up to speed.”
